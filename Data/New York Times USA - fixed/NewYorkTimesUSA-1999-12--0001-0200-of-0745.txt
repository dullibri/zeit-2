HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
How a Town In Wisconsin Went Mad

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
It may not have a headless horseman charging murderously through a Gothic forest, but James Marsh's film "Wisconsin Death Trip" frequently suggests a semidocumentary offshoot of Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow." The movie, which opens today at Film Forum, is a visually audacious riff on Michael Lesy's macabre 1973 cult classic book of vintage photographs and news clips chronicling the human tragedies that engulfed the rural farming community of Black River Falls, Wis., in the 1890's.
Faced with economic depression, a brutal climate and a diphtheria epidemic that decimated its infant population, a good number of the town's citizens (most were recent German and Scandinavian immigrants) went berserk. The murder, suicide and arson rates skyrocketed. Religious and occult fanaticism ran rampant, and many citizens of Black River Falls found themselves incarcerated in the nearby Mendota Asylum for the Insane. 
 The heart of the book consists of formal portraits of Black River Falls' upright citizens taken by the town photographer, Charles Van Schaik. Their stony death-mask visages (precursors of Diane Arbus's most disturbing work) suggest that in the worst of times the town had deteriorated into a real-life village of the damned. The accompanying newspaper accounts of the violent acts of the townspeople are so dryly factual in their understated way that read alongside grim photographs, they convey a mood of gallows humor. The very term "death trip" has an aura of sardonic hippie nonchalance.
Mr. Marsh's film uses the pictures and reporting as springboards for re-enactments of some of the most notorious crimes described in the book. Filmed in smudgy black and white and underscored with spiritually exalted music (everything from Arvo Part to Faure's Requiem), they are staged as silent-movie tableaux vivants. The sardonic tone of the book is accentuated by the voice of Ian Holm reading the newspaper accounts of the murders and suicides in an insinuating voice that conveys an attitude of sly, supercilious amusement. Occasionally he dramatically lowers his voice to a hissing conspiratorial whisper.
Among the grisliest true vignettes is the story of a 13-year-old boy who shot an old hermit for kicks, then inhabited his property until his crime was discovered, after which he fled and engaged in a gun battle with a pursuing posse. Many of the other murders were crimes of passion carried out by rejected lovers.
In addition to recounting individual murders, the movie has several stories of notorious local loonies like Mary Sweeney (Jo Vukelich), a schoolmistress who traveled around Wisconsin snorting cocaine and breaking windows. (She claimed to have destroyed $50,000 worth of glass.) Then there is Pauline L'Allemand (Marilyn White), a once-successful European opera singer who arrived in the area nearly penniless and unsuccessfully tried to find patrons through a series of musical soirees. She was eventually carted off to the Mendota Asylum, from which she later escaped.
When the movie is concentrating on the book, it is a creepily enthralling document that illustrates the susceptibility to breakdown of what we think of as sanity and civilization. But the film stumbles in its color sequences, which examine life in Black River Falls today and imply that the toxins of the 1890's are still present. As evidence that life in Black River Falls and in thousands of similar small towns across America is potentially deadly, the movie focuses on local parades, beauty contests and other small-town rituals, and relays newspaper reports of recent crimes that recall those of a century ago.
But the comparison seems shallow and forced. Life in Black Water Falls may be bland and homogenized, but it doesn't appear uncomfortable. Only one scene, in which the camera studies the stony faces of the residents of an old-age home as they are serenaded by a male chorus singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," does the contemporary imagery mirror the book's grimmest photographs.
Framing these tales is a vintage Chamber of Commerce-style pitch that extols the joys of life in Black River Falls and states that "nowhere in this great continent of ours can be found a more desirable residence."

HEADLINE: Have Laptop, Will Upload for Dinner

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Mike Phillips wanted to go home. An animation artist, he had worked in New York for MTV and in Berlin for a film studio, but he couldn't get Barrie, a town 60 miles north of Toronto, out of his mind. "I missed being able to drive a short distance to the wilderness," said Mr. Phillips, 25.
So, despite the paucity of animation work there, home he went this year and began trolling the Internet for work. That is how he discovered eLance, a jobs bazaar (www.eLance.com) where freelancers can list their skills and search for work. And though he named a price that was more than 50 percent above what a New York employer wanted to pay, he landed an assignment. 
 Mr. Phillips is the beneficiary of an economic boom that has driven unemployment in the United States to its lowest level since astronauts were landing on the moon and has made employers desperate for skilled workers. To cater to them, an entirely new kind of job fair is springing up, run not out of a convention center but in cyberspace.
ELance and its rivals are the information-age equivalent of the medieval town square where workers-for-hire called out their skills. Today's job seekers do the same, but through their computer keyboards. And whether they are computer programmers in Atlanta or Finnish translators in San Diego, they can find work without traveling. For their part, employers gain access to a new pool of freelancers without having to give them office space or fringe benefits. Across the economy, said Berrud Sheth, the chief executive of eLance, "the supply is sitting all over the world, and demand is where it is," often unable to move.
Though small, the sites tap into three of today's hottest employment trends: the rise of outsourcing, the Internet revolution and the surge in people working at home as telecommuters or small-business owners.
The biggest jobs bazaar is Monster Talent Market, a part of Monster.com, the most popular Internet job-hunting site. After five months in business, Monster Talent Market says it has signed up 110,000 independent contractors and more than 7,500 employers.
By contrast, one of the newest players in the field, FlexMind.com, is deliberately elitist. The Massachusetts start-up wants to register only students at a dozen or so of the most selective universities in the country, assuming that employers would love to hire them for part-time assignments and that the students who otherwise might have to wait tables would jump at the chance.
"It's a nice way for a company to have a low-commitment preview of an employee," said Julius Mokrauer, chief executive of FlexMind. In FlexMind's first two months, about 500 students and 40 companies -- including American Express and barnesandnoble.com -- have registered on the site, Mr. Mokrauer said. He left his job as a trader at Lehman Brothers to start the company last year after hiring a Harvard law student for $35 an hour and realizing what a bargain that was for his employer.
FlexMind charges employers 20 percent of whatever they are paying to the freelancer. ELance, which is now free, will begin charging companies, and perhaps freelancers, next year. Monster charges employers about 10 percent but no more than $1,000. At eLance and FlexMind, it is the freelancers who do the bidding; at Monster, it is the employers. Other Web sites, like FreeAgent.com, simply list job openings for freelancers and their resumes for employers but do not allow auction-style bidding.
With so many job openings going begging these days, the freelance Web sites can be a boon to employers. Susan Patnaik, for example, was having trouble finding an artist in New York to illustrate a graphic novel -- a type of comic book for adults -- that she was producing. She had called artists she knew and asked for recommendations but was striking out.
So she listed the assignment on eLance for $350. Bids started arriving the next day, and she chose Mr. Phillips, even though he wanted $550, because she was impressed with the samples she had downloaded. Presto: talent-hungry Ms. Patnaik had her worker, and job-hungry Mr. Phillips had his 25-hour assignment, even though they live hundreds of miles apart, do not know anybody in common and may never meet.
Of course, $550 is hardly enough for Mr. Phillips to live on, and thus far he has not landed any other jobs through eLance. On average, only four or five deals are made each day on the site, the company said.
From an employer's perspective, the sites can create as many problems as they solve, since virtually anyone can post a resume. On eLance, Mr. Phillips said, "It seems like there are a lot of young, inexperienced artists applying for jobs." And HotJobs.com, a rival to Monster, does not offer an auction site, the company says, because its clients -- big companies -- have shown little interest.
But there are a few big success stories. Benita Kenn quit her job as a public-relations manager for a California technology company this year to spend more time with her folk band. She put her resume on Monster Talent Market and got two jobs. The first, with a golf merchandise site, began in August and is just ending, while the other, with a seller of personalized T-shirts and mugs, began in October. Ms. Kenn has been working an average of 20 hours a week at pay that she says is typical for a public-relations consultant. (That would be about $100 an hour, people in the industry said.)
Still, she uses her old contacts because she said she cannot rely solely on the auction site. "Ideally, there would be hordes of people bidding for me," Ms. Kenn said. "But that's not where it's at at this point."

HEADLINE: Ginseng Therapy for Farmlands

BYLINE: By JEFF WAGGONER 

DATELINE: CAIRO, N.Y.

 BODY:
It can be worth as much as gold, and it grows.
It is American ginseng, a cousin of the aromatic root that has been used by Asians for thousands of years to treat problems including headaches, diabetes and declining male potency. 
 And one man here in the shadows of the Catskills 120 miles north of Manhattan, where the root grows wild on the forest floor, believes that it could be the remedy for the financial headaches of upstate farmers and other landowners.
Robert L. Beyfuss, a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent in Greene County, is on a crusade to make fallow fields and woodlands profitable by persuading people to grow the wild version of American ginseng. The dried root can fetch $1,000 a pound on the worldwide market.
In the last two years, Mr. Beyfuss has organized the 170-member Empire State Ginseng Growers Association. He is planning an International Ginseng Conference in Greene County next September to share information on growing the plant, whose recorded history in New York State dates to the early 1700's, when a Jesuit missionary noted its use by Indians.
Ginseng's missionary is a gray-haired 49-year-old who speaks in fluid cadences that he put to good use in the early 1980's, when he was host of a farm program on a Schenectady television station. Two guests told him about the Catskills' fame among lovers of ginseng.
Since then, he has taken ginseng to reduce stress during a divorce, to lose weight and to increase his brain power for graduate work. He has hunted the root, grown it, bottled it for friends as Dr. Bob's Ginseng Elixir and written a master's thesis on it.
"I am haunted by ginseng," he said.
So, it seems, are many others. In the last decade, as interest has grown in alternative medicine, many Americans have started taking it in pills, drinking it in tea and eating the root raw for many of the same health reasons that Asians take it.
Most ginseng, known as field-cultivated ginseng, comes from China and Korea, where it is grown in raised beds under shade cloth and heavily dosed with pesticides and fertilizers. In North America, the major producers of field-cultivated ginseng are in Wisconsin, Ontario and British Columbia.
But for aficionados, Asian or American, the most prized and potent ginseng grows wild. Those rare roots grow in the Catskills, where the herb is referred to as "shang." It is eagerly sought by shang hunters, who jealously guard their favorite secret hunting grounds.
American ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, ranges from Quebec to Georgia, and from the East Coast to Iowa. It thrives in the heavy shade of deciduous trees. But the most potent wild ginseng, Mr. Beyfuss says, grows in Vermont and New York, especially in the Catskills, which have the best conditions: crisp winter weather and the right soil.
Although 90 percent or more of the $1 billion world market is for the field-cultivated plant, the wild version is worth up to 30 times as much, with cultivated ginseng selling for $10 to $15 a pound and fresh wild ginseng averaging $300 a pound. It is not unknown for dried wild ginseng to retail for $1,300 a pound.
One small wild root, if it is old enough and resembles an anatomically correct man, including sex organs, can be sold for up to $500 in Hong Kong to those who use it as an aphrodisiac. "The more ginseng resembles a human figure, the more valuable it is," Mr. Beyfuss said.
The wild root's sometimes eerie resemblance to a human perhaps explains why the Chinese word for ginseng means "man root." Field-cultivated ginseng looks more like a pale carrot than like a human.
The rising value of wild ginseng has led Mr. Beyfuss and others to explore ways to grow ginseng by simulating wild conditions; gently scratching the ground under the branches of a mature shade tree, and dropping the seeds.
"Ginseng loves sugar maples," said Scott Harris of Otsego County, who is president of the state's Ginseng Growers Association and, with his wife, Sylva, the proprietor of Sylvan Botanicals, near Cooperstown. The association's members include 30 growers of simulated wild ginseng, like the Harrises, as well as a dozen cultivators of field-grown ginseng. The rest grow it as a hobby.
But before Mr. Beyfuss could recommend that others take up the farming of wild ginseng, he had to learn its secrets, with the unlikely aid of the wary shang hunters. The wild ginseng is a protected species, and so by state law may only be picked from Sept. 1 through Nov. 30. Mr. Beyfuss and other hunters are dropped off in the woods and picked up after harvesting is done, so their parked cars do not reveal the locations of their treasure troves.
Mr. Beyfuss says he is a shang hunter, but not a very successful one. So he devised a way to extract the information he needed from the best shang hunters without requiring them to reveal where they dug.
Shang dealers, who are registered with the state, provided Mr. Beyfuss with the hunters' names. He then sent out a simple questionnaire in postage-paid envelopes, asking for soil samples from places where the hunter found good wild ginseng, and for information about the area where it grew, including nearby trees, and slope and exposure of the land.
During the mid-1990's, Mr. Beyfuss got back 100 questionnaires and soil samples in paper bags and old socks, and was able to piece together a profile of the kind of soil -- high in calcium, relatively high in acidity -- that Catskill wild ginseng prefers. Armed with this knowledge, he devised a checklist that he handed out to potential growers to determine the best places to sow seeds.
If simulated wild ginseng takes root, it could prove a valuable resource to Greene County landowners who are struggling to pay property taxes. The number of working farms in the county has fallen sharply in the last two decades. In 1977, when Mr. Beyfuss arrived in Greene County, it had 120 full-time dairy farms; today, it has 27. Many longtime residents had sold their property, and 53 percent of the land in the county is now owned by nonresidents.
Mr. Harris calculates that one acre of simulated wild ginseng could, after several years of growth, be worth up to $50,000 a year.
If Mr. Beyfuss's efforts work, he will not only make unused farmland and woodlots profitable again, but also please those who are trying to protect New York City tap water. Growing ginseng is one of the strategies the Watershed Agriculture Council in Delaware County is examining to protect the city's watershed, of which much of the Catskills are a part, from pesticides and other harmful runoff.
Forest land is economically unviable, said Alan White, executive director of the council, because property taxes can be four or five times higher than the revenue it produces. The council, through the Forest Service, has awarded Mr. Beyfuss grants to encourage the production of simulated wild ginseng, which does not require tilling, fertilizers or pesticides.
But for Mr. Beyfuss, the bigger challenge will be to sell the idea of wild ginseng to drugstores.
"There are 15 products for sale in the Rite Aid in Cairo that contain Asian ginseng," he said. "That ticks me off. If our ginseng is so good, so fine, why can't we buy American ginseng in this country? You can't."

HEADLINE: Study Shows Rise in Number Of Women Jailed for Drugs

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
A new national study shows a remarkable surge in the number of women incarcerated for drug offenses: an 888 percent jump between 1986 and 1996, in comparison with a rise of 129 percent for nondrug offenses, researchers said.
And in New York State, almost the entire increase in the number of women sentenced to prison was a result of drug offenses, according to the study, results of which were released early last month. 
 The study, a 26-page booklet titled "Gender and Justice: Women, Drugs and Sentencing Policy," was researched and written by the Sentencing Project, a national nonprofit organization that promotes sentencing reform and conducts research on criminal justice issues.
Since 1980, the number of women in prison has increased at nearly double the rate for men. Minority women, especially blacks in New York State, are disproportionately affected by drug arrests and imprisonment, the study found.
"There are more men in prison for drug offenses than women," said Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project and co-author of the report. "But of the women in prison, they are more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses than the men in prison."
Of the women in prison for drug offenses in three states singled out by the study -- New York, California and Minnesota -- researchers found substantial variation. Those states were chosen because of geographical differences, varying sentencing structures, and good data.
In New York, nearly all -- 91 percent -- of the increase in women sentenced to prison from 1986 to 1995 was in connection with drug offenses. In California, drug offenses represented 55 percent of the increase; in Minnesota, 26 percent.
Of the women sentenced to prison for drug offenses in the three states, many were members of minority groups -- 91 percent in New York, 54 percent in California and 27 percent in Minnesota -- numbers substantially greater than the minority proportion of each state's population.
The impact of the justice system on Hispanic women varied from state to state. In New York, in 1995, Hispanic women constituted 44 percent of the women imprisoned for drug offenses, but only 14 percent of the state's population. In California Hispanic women represented 25 percent of imprisoned drug offenders and 31 percent of the population.
New York State officials said they could neither confirm nor contradict the findings because they had not had time to study the report. "But what I can say," said Caroline Quartararo, spokeswoman for the governor's criminal justice director, Katherine N. Lapp, "is that of the first-time felony drug offenders -- male or female -- fewer than 10 percent received prison sentences."
Mr. Mauer said there were numerous factors that snared women in the criminal justice system: the impact of drug abuse on low-income women; declining economic opportunities for many women; limited treatment options and the harsh mandatory-sentence policies adopted in conjunction with the war on drugs.
Mr. Mauer also theorized that a greater percentage of women than men were incarcerated because men were often able to cut a deal with prosecutors. "I've heard this anecdotally," he said. "The men may not be the major drug dealer, so they can cooperate with prosecutors by giving them the name of the major dealer. The women may know only their boyfriend as a dealer."
Mr. Mauer said the solution for the high rate of women's incarceration for drug offenses was drug rehabilitation treatment. "I think there are studies that show a dollar of treatment is more effective than a dollar spent in incarceration," he said.

HEADLINE: Monthly Index Registers Burst of Hope By Consumers

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Consumer optimism rebounded in November, bolstered by rising incomes and stock prices, just as retailers geared up for the holiday shopping season, Conference Board figures showed yesterday.
The consumer confidence index climbed to 135.8 in November from 130.5 in October, the New York-based research group reported. The index is the highest since August, and the increase follows four months of declines. 
 "Everyone's employed and everyone's got money," said Richard Yamarone, senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. "This is going to be the fuel for holiday sales."
The burst of optimism showed up at the cash register. Retail sales at stores open at least a year rose 6 percent for the week ended Nov. 27 from the corresponding period a year earlier, according to the weekly sales report by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. That includes the two days after Thanksgiving, one of the busiest times for retailers.
Consumer expectations for the economy over the next six months also rose in November -- to 109.6 from 101.5 in October. The reading is the highest since June, when the overall index peaked at 139, for the best reading since October 1968.
Consumer sentiment about current economic conditions rose to 175.3 in November from a revised 173.9 in October, previously reported at 173.5.
The Conference Board surveys about 5,000 households on attitudes toward economic conditions, employment prospects and spending plans. Spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economy. Strength in consumer confidence suggests more fuel for the economic expansion, which is in its ninth year and on track to set a record in February.
Almost 28 percent of those surveyed said they expected their incomes to increase over the next six months. That is the highest this year and up from 24.1 percent in October.
Another report yesterday, from executives in the Chicago area, showed that manufacturing in the Midwest grew at a slower pace in November, a sign of some cooling off in that part of the economy with possible influence on future interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its factory index fell to 56.8 in November from 58.8 in October. At the same time, the index of prices paid rose to 70.9 from 65.4 last month.
"From the Fed's perspective, the drop in the index will likely come as a relief," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Market in New York. "But the range of the past six months remains intact, and the rise in the price index is a reminder of relentless upward pressure on commodity prices."

Merger Mania Got You Down? So, Start Thinking Small

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS 

 BODY:
WE might be forgiven for concluding that everything in corporate America is getting bigger and bigger. The global couplings in autos, oil and gas, financial services, telecommunications and now pharmaceuticals sometimes give the impression that the business world is driving toward an acquisition apocalypse. When the dust settles, we will all draw a paycheck from the same employer.
Now comes Thomas W. Malone to file a minority report. Dr. Malone is a professor of information systems at the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an alumnus of Xerox's creative Palo Alto Research Center. For five years, he has been co-director of a major-league effort to think about what shape the company and the workplace will take in the new century, now only a month away. 
 In his view, the century will bring a new golden age for small enterprise and a new springtime for individual creativity in business. Communications in the Internet era will be so powerful, so rich, so cheap that even the smallest enterprises, already nimble, will be armed with the information they need to compete with corporate giants. He expects an economy in which companies as small as 1 to 10 talented people can thrive.
Newborn Web businesses are already swirling like snowflakes. How long before they carpet the ground? Dr. Malone summarized his views last month at a valedictory gathering of M.I.T.'s initiative on Inventing the Organizations of the 21st Century, an extensive research effort he cofounded in 1994. The project (at the Web site ccs.mit.edu/21c) has drawn in two dozen scholars and numerous companies, with financing from British Telecommunications, A. T. Kearney, National Westminster Bank, Union Bank of Switzerland and a consortium of Norsk Hydro and other Norwegian business interests.
Dr. Malone's talk in Wong Auditorium on the M.I.T. campus amounted to instructing the elephants on the mouse. The assemblage was mostly a roll call of big companies trying to peer over the horizon, among them Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, Fidelity Investments, State Farm, Polaroid, Intel, Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computer, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Andersen Consulting and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center. (One mouse in the crowd, tiny Sohodojo of Raleigh, N.C., billed itself as "a nanocorp" and lamented the tax disadvantages of working out of the home.)
Dr. Malone's term is "the e-lance economy," a play on the word "freelance." He expects a business landscape in which much of the work that large corporations now do will be done instead by "temporary companies" -- ad hoc combinations of small specialist firms that come together to tackle a single project and disband upon its completion.
At the heart of that economy will be a vast electronic marketplace in business services, already taking shape. Small companies will be able to rent the design, manufacturing and marketing muscle now available only to big businesses. Small talent pools will be free to focus on what they do best.
Dr. Malone likes to talk about TopsyTail, a tiny Dallas-based producer of hair and fashion accessories founded a decade ago. Relying on a score of vendors, from demand forecasting through manufacturing and order fulfillment, TopsyTail has produced more than $100 million in sales at retail with three employees.
"I am not good with employees, I am good with vendors," TopsyTail's energetic founder, Tomima Edmark, said in an interview on Monday. Outsourcing to the limit not only fits her managerial personality, she said. It also provides instant, inexpensive expertise in a consumer business where the race is always to the swift. Her next step is a Web store, HerRoom.com, to sell women's underwear online, starting in February.
The seeds of an economy of microenterprises are everywhere. Dr. Malone sees them in the surge in outsourcing; in the popularity of telecommuting; in the proliferation of virtual companies; in the erosion of the Fortune 500 as the premier employer; in the legions of people who opt for freelance or part-time work. He sees the same trajectory inside large companies, which increasingly work through project teams, joint ventures, ad hoc alliances, internal markets and independent business units.
In some familiar industries, the e-lance economy has long been the norm. "It is the way that films get made," Dr. Malone said. "It's also the way that we make buildings." Decades ago, the major Hollywood studios had everything under one roof. Today, a coalition of artistic and technical talents is assembled piece by piece. The studio does the financing and manages marketing and distribution.
Almost everyone believes that the next century will see greater decentralization of business decision-making. There the debate begins. Will the Internet foster an economy of small enterprises, or will it make it possible to build a global empire far more extensive than anything known today?
Is the prototype Edward Jones, the investment firm, with more than 5,000 local offices united by cutting-edge communications and an engrained culture of serving the careful long-term investor? Or is it the cottage industry of thousands of independent financial advisers who rely on Charles Schwab for their transaction needs and tap the Internet for endless sources of financial analysis?
Many experts, including some at the M.I.T. conference, say that economies of scale and new efficiencies in harnessing corporate learning favor the larger-and-larger structure. They say that only the largest will be able to assemble and manage the costly information engines needed to power a global empire. And huge companies like BP Amoco are devising new systems to organize and index the vast business savvy that exists within their ranks but today is tacit and untapped.
"My bottom line is very simple -- if we look at 2010, we will find bigger organizations, bigger and bigger and bigger," John F. Rockart, the director of the Center for Information Systems Research at M.I.T., said in a video presentation at the conference. It used to be that the cost and sheer difficulty of communications increased geometrically with a company's size. But with more powerful electronics and better data management, "that's going away," Dr. Rockart said. "Size will no longer be an inhibitor."
Dr. Malone contends that it is easier to think about flattening the corporate hierarchy by chopping away at middle management and empowering underlings -- all half-measures in his view -- than it is to grasp the workings of a vast network of many, many small players under no central direction or control. (Some people call that a market.) But his model of creativity and efficiency is not merely a leaner, flatter company.
Instead, he said, consider the celebrated Linux operating system, which was developed and perfected by thousands of volunteers after Linus Torvalds posted his early efforts on the Internet and invited all and sundry to have a go at them. Or consider the Internet itself. Dr. Malone invariably draws smiles when he asks if the Internet could conceivably have been developed by AT&T, with the normal panoply of corporate procedures and clearances.
"There's literally no one in charge of the Internet," he said at the conference, "no one who can shut it down, no one who can keep you from connecting with it." Fundamentally, it is a collection of interaction protocols, a set of rules for exchanging information. "Anyone who follows those rules can basically play any role they want."
"No one controls the Internet," he wrote in the Harvard Business Review. "No one's in charge. No one's the leader. The Internet grew out of the combined efforts of all its users, with no central management. The Internet had to be self-managed."
This is the idea: No one organization can match a thriving marketplace of ambitious talents for creativity and innovation. So why shouldn't a General Motors, instead of being wedded to its in-house battalions of engineers, open its needs to innumerable design enterprises from outside? That is the open architecture that propels Silicon Valley. Why not tap it to build cars?

HEADLINE: Paid Leave for Parents

 BODY:
President Clinton's plan to give states the option of providing unemployment insurance benefits for new parents is good for working families. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act gave workers the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or sick relative without losing their jobs. But many low-income workers cannot afford to take any amount of time off without pay. The new experimental project, which would be totally voluntary, would allow states to subsidize a leave following the birth or adoption of a child if they so chose. At least four states -- Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington -- have proposed legislation to extend unemployment benefits to parental leave.
Under current federal law, states have substantial flexibility to determine eligibility for unemployment benefits and benefit levels. Although unemployment insurance is traditionally seen as helping only those who have been involuntarily laid off and are immediately available to work, many states have granted benefits to workers who are not in that narrow category. A third of the states, for example, grant unemployment benefits to workers who leave their jobs because of urgent family reasons, such as a spouse being relocated. Federal regulations have likewise allowed states to grant unemployment benefits to workers who are off the job because of training programs, illness in some situations, jury duty or temporary layoffs. Allowing states to experiment with providing benefits to new parents could help meet the needs of the changing labor force where mothers and fathers both work. The Labor Department would evaluate the impact of the benefits on insurance costs, and on worker retention and management, before the program is made permanent. 
 Business lobbies are concerned that a new benefit would drain the trust funds that pay unemployment insurance. But many states currently have significant trust fund surpluses because of low unemployment in recent years, and many have chosen to reduce unemployment insurance taxes as a result. State policy makers are in the best position to determine whether their labor force would be helped by expanded parental leave benefits. The Clinton administration would give them the ability to move forward on this issue.

BYLINE: Compiled by Barth Healey

 BODY:

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: CURB ON BEEF SALES TO END -- A two-year-old ban on sales of beef on the bone is to end Dec. 17 after assurances from medical officials that there is no longer any risk that certain cuts may be contaminated with the infective agent that causes mad-cow disease, which attacks the brain. The action was unrelated to the continuing French blockade of all British beef imports in defiance of the European Commission's decision to lift its worldwide ban last Aug. 1. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
NORTHERN IRELAND: ASSEMBLY APPROVED BY LORDS -- A bill to transfer home rule to the new Northern Ireland Assembly passed the House of Lords and is expected to clear Commons today. The process was speeded up to enable the Protestant-Catholic coalition for Ulster to start work on Thursday. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

VATICAN CITY: POPE TO VISIT FATIMA -- John Paul II plans to visit Fatima on May 13, his third pilgrimage to the site in Portugal where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to three shepherds on May 13, 1917. On May 13, 1981, the Pope was shot by a Turkish gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca, and he believes that Mary saved his life. The pope is expected to beatify two of the children. The third, Sister Lucia Dos Santos, 92, lives in a convent in Portugal. Alessandra Stanley (NYT)
 
TURKEY: PLEA TO DELAY EXECUTION -- The European Court of Human Rights asked Turkey to delay the execution of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan for several months until it rules on his plea that the death penalty breaches European law. The case is central to Turkey's hopes of becoming a candidate for the European Union. Mr. Ocalan was convicted of treason and murder in leading rebel Kurds seeking self rule. (Reuters)
 
SWITZERLAND: MORE HOLOCAUST PAYMENTS -- The Swiss fund for Holocaust survivors approved payments of $1.27 million to 1,600 Jewish and Gypsy applicants and political opponents of the Nazis. The fund has distributed more than $160 million. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
UKRAINE: LEADER PROMISES REFORM -- As he was sworn in for a second five-year term, President Leonid Kuchma promised radical reforms and better living standards. "You will see a new president before you," he said at a lavish ceremony that legislators had opposed. He called for "stern pragmatism" in pursuing economic growth and better ties with Russia and the United States. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAQ: CURB ON OIL SALES -- Still divided on how to treat Iraq, the United Nations Security Council is likely to extend for only one week the program under which Iraq exports oil to pay for food, medicine and other items. The Iraqis rejected the measure in advance. An earlier two-week extension led to a cutoff of exports. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
SIERRA LEONE: PEACEKEEPERS ARRIVE -- One hundred thirty Kenyan soldiers, the start of a 6,000-member United Nations peacekeeping force, arrived in Freetown. A July peace accord granted the rebels several high-ranking positions in a coalition government, but Amnesty International said "deliberate and arbitrary killings, rape and abductions of civilians have increased despite the peace agreement." Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
RWANDA: EX-MINISTER ARRESTED -- A former Rwandan government minister accused of genocide was arrested on Friday in Paris. Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, 46, was wanted on a warrant from the United Nations war crimes tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania. In a hearing set Monday, a Paris court must verify that the accusations fall within the tribunal's jurisdiction, the first time a French court has faced this question. If so, he will be handed over. (Agence France-Presse)
 
EAST AFRICA: COMMON MARKET REBORN -- Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania signed a treaty to resurrect their common market, but the agreement does not resolve the issue of removal of trade barriers. The three have said they will admit Rwanda to the union. Ian Fisher (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
PANAMA: CANAL CEREMONY -- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and former President Jimmy Carter are to represent the United States at the handover of the Panama Canal on Dec. 14, the State Department said. Mr. Carter signed the treaty in 1977 that returned sovereignty of the canal. (Agence France-Presse)
 
HAITI: U.N. POLICE TO STAY -- The Security Council voted to keep a police training force in Haiti until mid-March, when Haiti is to hold an election and the United Nations plans to send a broader development mission. The council voted 14-0, with Russia abstaining. China, which opposed an extension because of Haiti's ties with Taiwan, voted yes. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: 2 JOURNALISTS KILLED -- Two journalists were shot to death in a northeastern area that has experienced heavy fighting between Marxist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups. The journalists were covering a local election that had to be called off after a mayor was assassinated. No group has claimed responsibility for the three killings. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: CORRUPTION TRIALS -- One hundred special courts will be established to try people charged with corruption and loan defaults, Gen. Pervez Musharraf announced. A list of 5,000 names has been given to immigration officials to keep suspects from leaving the country. The general seized power Oct. 12. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: FILIPINO INVITED TO MEDIATE -- Indonesia has invited a former Philippine Muslim rebel leader, Nur Misuari, to help mediate with separatists in Aceh. Mr. Misuari is governor of a four-province autonomous Muslim region in Mindanao that was set up under a peace treaty that the separatist Moro National Liberation Front signed in 1996 with the Philippines government.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Time of Trial by Taunt for the World Trade Chief

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 30

 BODY:
It took nearly a year for Mike Moore, the new director general of the World Trade Organization, to get the job of running the 135-nation group. It could take just a few days, during the organization's contentious meeting in Seattle, for him to be judged a success or a failure.
If the violent demonstrations and disruptions of the meeting's opening day today are any guide, Mr. Moore, a seasoned trade negotiator who was briefly prime minister of New Zealand, is now confronting the biggest challenge of his career. 
 Mr. Moore, 50, is at the center of the trade meeting that is to bring together President Clinton and top trade officials from the member countries of the Geneva-based organization. The goal of the meeting, now scheduled to run through Friday, is to gain sufficient agreement among the members to support a new round of negotiations aimed at opening global markets further.
Most chief executives of international organizations are not forced to think about their legacies so early in their terms. But the combination of the divisive 10-month selection fight, which delayed Mr. Moore's installation until September, and the urgent matter of organizing the Seattle conference put great pressure on him.
That pressure increased even more last week after the W.T.O. failed to come up with an agenda for Seattle. Moreover, much of the attention surrounding that meeting has shifted to the demonstrators who have descended on the city to protest what they see as lack of concern by the trade group on the environmental, safety and labor aspects of trade.
Mr. Moore wields little decisive power because members can ultimately defy W.T.O. decisions. Yet he is the image maker for the trade group, a particularly sensitive role since it has become the lightning rod for criticism on matters as diverse as genetically modified soybeans, child labor, endangered sea turtles and cheaply sold steel.
It was Mr. Moore's qualities as a communicator that persuaded important trading nations, including the United States, to support him for director general. "You can see him going off to Washington, sitting down with Congressmen and convincing them with his folksy way that the W.T.O. isn't something monstrous," said a trade diplomat in Geneva.
Mr. Moore is not afraid of confrontation but prides himself on listening to other viewpoints. He acknowledged on Monday during a meeting with W.T.O. delegates in Seattle that the protesters had some legitimate issues. He also got a dose of what the combative atmosphere might be like in Seattle a few weeks ago in Geneva, when a group of students bolted from a W.T.O. meeting they had been invited to attend, shredded the literature they had been given and chained themselves to the grand staircase at the organization's headquarters. Comrades unfurled banners across the building's stately facade: "The W.T.O. Kills. Kill the W.T.O."
"It's impolite and bad manners to chain yourself up, then ask for an invitation to see me," Mr. Moore responded affably, but firmly.
The son of New Zealand farmers, Mr. Moore has drawn on his experiences as a construction worker, a meat-industry worker, a printer and later a social worker to bolster his everyman persona. Also a longtime politician and trade negotiator, Mr. Moore has said he is a true believer in trade as a force for prosperity.
"What's at stake is jobs and an opportunity to raise living standards for everybody," he frequently says.
Despite that, Mr. Moore has run into the reality that profound differences among nations on important trade issues are threatening to derail any new global negotiations -- part of the reason for the W.T.O.'s existence. He has not been able to dislodge trading blocs from entrenched positions. For example, the European Union has not budged from the stance that farm products must be treated specially because their production contributes to maintaining the rapidly vanishing countryside -- a position viewed as pure protectionism by countries like the United States.
But the director has also received some good marks for his efforts.
"He was incredibly patient," said Brazil's trade negotiator, Celso Amorim.
"He's honest and he didn't try to play games with us," added Nacer Benjelloun-Touimi, who represents Morocco at the W.T.O.
"He's built bridges, which is good," said Munir Akram, Pakistan's representative. "But he has to deliver in Seattle. I'm convinced a director general can make a difference." Both Pakistan and Morocco supported candidates other than Mr. Moore for the W.T.O.'s top job.
Whatever the outcome in Seattle, Mr. Moore will not lose his job, get a promotion or have his pay cut. In the compromise that ended the prolonged selection fight, he was appointed for a three-year period, to be followed the next three years by his Thai rival for the post, prompting irreverent W.T.O. staffers to nickname him "Demi Moore."

HEADLINE: Russians Briefly Detain U.S. Diplomat, Calling Her a Spy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Russian officials said today that they had caught an American spy as she was preparing to meet with her Russian informant and confiscated an array of sophisticated espionage equipment.
The Clinton administration acknowledged that an American diplomat had been briefly detained in Moscow in an "incident," but declined to comment on Russian charges that the diplomat was a spy. 
 "Other than confirming that there was an incident involving an American working at the U.S. Embassy, I'm not going to comment on alleged intelligence matters," the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, told reporters in Washington.
The episode came just as a United States Navy enlisted man was being charged with passing secrets about American decoding programs to Russia, officials said. Petty Officer First Class Daniel M. King, 40, who worked at a Navy decoding office at Fort Meade, Md., is being held in military custody in Quantico, Va. awaiting a hearing on espionage charges.
The renewal of cold-war-style spy skirmishes this week between Moscow and Washington have increased the strains between the two nations, already at odds over Russia's war in Chechnya, NATO's war with Yugoslavia and Washington's plan to erect a limited antimissile defense.
It also showed the renewed confidence of Russia's Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., which summoned Russian reporters to boast about its success in unmasking American agents and displayed a photograph of the alleged spy: a low-level diplomat at the United States Embassy.
The Central Intelligence Agency has long maintained an intelligence station in the American Embassy in Moscow, and its officers work under diplomatic cover, posing as State Department employees. C.I.A. officials refused to comment on the latest flap in Moscow.
But despite the end of the cold war, Russia and the United States have continued to spy on each other. Russian intelligence services have been so active, in fact, that the Clinton administration asked the Kremlin earlier this year to cut back on its spying as good-will gesture.
Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's prime minister and the leading candidate to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin, is a former senior intelligence officer, as is his main political rival, Yevgeny M. Primakov.
The Russians took this spy episode in stride. The Foreign Ministry said it planned to issue an official protest but added that it did not expect the incident to lead to serious harm to American-Russian relations.
"We hope and expect that this should not interfere with relations between the United States and Russia," Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said. "But certainly such episodes do not help improve the climate and atmosphere."
Still, the F.S.B. was eager to talk about its counterintelligence efforts for a prime-time Russian television audience.
The Russians identified the espionage suspect as Cheri Leberknight and asserted that she was a C.I.A. officer who had been working under cover as a second secretary at the American Embassy.
They charged that she had been trying to obtain secret Russian military documents when she was detained on Monday night in northern Moscow. Ms. Leberknight, who enjoys diplomatic immunity, was turned over to the American Embassy by the Russian authorities and is expected to leave Moscow shortly.
According to the Russian account, Russian counterintelligence agents tracked Ms. Leberknight as she prepared to meet a Russian contact. Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman for the F.S.B., said her goal was to obtain "state secrets about our military-strategic plans and military-strategic complex."
Russian officials did not say specifically what type of documents were being sought. Even with its economic woes, Russia retains a powerful nuclear arsenal and is building new long-range missiles.
Russian officials said that Ms. Leberknight had carried a map showing her meeting point and had been equipped with a variety of devices to determine if she was under surveillance.
C.I.A. officers have traditionally used high-tech equipment to detect whether they are under surveillance. Their equipment can determine if nearby radio communications increase when the C.I.A. officer is on the move, which would be a sign that the officer is being followed. But it is not known whether the diplomat was found to be carrying such equipment.
Mr. Zdanovich showed a photograph said to be of Ms. Leberknight.
Ms. Leberknight was taken to the F.S.B. headquarters in downtown Moscow but refused to talk, Russian officials say. She was later turned over to the counsel at the American Embassy.
There was no word tonight on whether Russian officials had also arrested a Russian who might have been in contact with the United States as part of an alleged espionage operation. But the F.S.B. said its investigation was continuing.
Russian officials insisted that there was no connection between the Moscow case and the arrest of the Navy enlisted man.
"This is not a response," Mr. Zdanovich told a Russian television interviewer.
Russia's security service has been very active in recent months. It arrested a Russian researcher, who was later charged with disclosing military secrets, and pursued investigations against Russian environmentalists who have investigated the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Day of Steep Losses Ends Strong November for Nasdaq

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, led by America Online and AT&T, after a wave of late selling erased gains in financial stocks spurred by the first increase in bond prices in two weeks.
"I think we're seeing some investors just throw in the towel and sell," said Jim Herrick, managing director in charge of listed trading at Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "AT&T, others, these stocks have been on a tear the last few days." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 70.11 points, or 0.64 percent, to 10,877.81. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks lost 18.76 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,389.07.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 85.21points, or 2.5 percent, to 3,336.16, its biggest drop since Oct. 15.
Though the Nasdaq fell yesterday, it soared 12.5 percent in November, its largest gain since January, when it climbed 14.3 percent. The S.& P. 500 rose 1.9 percent and the Dow Jones industrials climbed 1.4 percent in November.
America Online fell 6 3/4, to 73 1/4 . The online service said it would offer a new issue of about $1.25 billion in zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes for general corporate purposes. That could dilute the value of the existing shares. The notes will be due 2019.
AT&T dropped 3 15/16, to 55 15/16 The largest long-distance provider has gained almost 13 percent since Nov. 23.
Cisco Systems Inc., the maker of Internet equipment, fell 4, to 88 5/8. Still, it rose 21 percent for the month.
Veritas Software, a maker of information-management and protection software, lost 10 3/8, to 89 13/16.
Albertson's Inc., the grocer, fell 3 13/16, to 32, after it said profit next year would fall short of forecasts because of higher-than-expected costs. Albertson's bought American Stores in June and has struggled with the costs of combining operations and renovating stores since then.

Yields Fall Slightly
 By Reuters
 Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, as the wave of bargain-hunting, month-end portfolio purchases and rumored buying by the Federal Reserve ebbed, market sources said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 97 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.29 percent from 6.30 percent on Monday.
Treasuries were temporarily in the red at midmorning on two reports that showed a jump in consumer confidence and a rebound in price pressure among Midwest manufacturers.
The Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index jumped to 135.8 in November from a revised October reading of 130.5.
At the same time, a report from purchasing managersin Chicago showed that their prices-paid measure bounced back to 70.9 in November, matching its level two months ago after a drop in October. But the overall barometer of regional manufacturing activity fell two points to 56.8.
Economists said the higher prices-paid figure was largely a result of oil prices, which soared above $27 a barrel earlier this month, a nine-year high.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 43-day cash management bills follow:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: 10 Districts Are Named In Test of School Choice

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
In its first foray into school choice, the New Jersey Department of Education yesterday announced its selection of 10 school districts that will be the first to accept, tuition-free, students from any district in the state.
The 10 districts, which vary in size and wealth and location, will receive up to $8,500 from the state for each student who transfers in during the pilot program, which will begin in September. The program will expand over a five-year period, allowing up to 21 districts to accept students tuition-free, state education officials said. 
 "School choice can open up a new world of options for parents and children," Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said in a statement yesterday. "Parents who take advantage of those pilot projects will no longer be limited by the boundaries of the school district in which they happen to live."
The 10 districts that will participate in the school choice program are Hoboken, Folsom, Englewood, Washington Township of Burlington County, Cumberland, Bloomsbury, Upper Freehold, Mine Hill, Salem City and Kenilworth.
Students are already allowed to attend schools in districts other than their own by paying tuition to those districts. The districts in the pilot program will receive payments from the state for each incoming student. Those losing the students will continue to receive state aid for each one, but that figure would be reduced by 25 percent in the first year, 50 percent in the second year, and finally by 75 percent.
State officials have little expectation that parents in such communities as Princeton or Summit, with their excellent schools, will decide to transfer to one of the 10 districts in the program. The hope is that each of the 10, which will be closely monitored by the state, will work to come up with unique programs to attract students who need a new educational setting.
Some of the smaller districts among the 10 want more students so they can afford to offer more programs. Some of those in urban areas want to compete with surrounding urban districts for the best students. Other districts with declining enrollment want to bring their numbers back up.
"It's very simple," said David Anthony, the president of the Hoboken school district. "How many choices can you offer a child to go to school? It's like college. If you do well, you can go to Harvard. If you don't do as well, there are a lot of other choices."
More than anything, state officials hope the concept of choice will create a market mentality among local districts that will make all of them improve as they try to attract or hold on to students.
Jeffrey V. Osowski, deputy commissioner of education in charge of the program, said that the 10 represented a cross section of districts from the north and the south, rural, suburban and urban, and even an economic mix. Some of the districts have schools with high scores on standardized state tests; others are near the bottom.
Any district in the state could have applied to become one of the 10 choice districts in this first round. Mr. Osowski said that about 40 districts indicated interest, but that only 12 applied. The districts had only a month to apply for the program, which the New Jersey Board of Education approved in September.
"We wanted a good representative sample, and we think we got that," Mr. Osowski said. "Every one of these districts views this pilot program as a way to enrich their program offerings."
In tiny Salem City, in the southernmost part of the state near the Delaware Memorial Bridge, outsiders might be attracted to the district for its new dance program, its technology program or its agricultural-horticultural program, said Richard R. Rhau, the superintendent.
The district, with its one high school, one middle school and one elementary school, is too small to offer many extras, but it could offer more if it increases enrollment, he said. The high school has 525 students, but could accommodate 1,000.
In Hoboken, Mr. Anthony, the president, said school choice could help attract students to a district that has been shrinking in enrollment, with 2,550 students this year, down from about 10,000 15 years ago.
The school choice program will allow them to try to accept as many as 160 outside students the first year, and up to 580 by the end of the pilot program. Some of those might come from nearby Jersey City and Union City, Mr. Anthony said, whose districts in turn will work hard to try to keep their students from leaving.
"We're just trying to become a part of the movement to offer students more choices," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
JapaneseIntervene Again, but the Yen Edges Upward Anyway

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The yen approached a four-year high against the dollar yesterday as a second day of efforts by the Japanese central bank to stem the currency's rise crumbled in the face of expectations for strong demand for Japanese stocks.
"People are still interested in investing in Japan" while less money appears to be leaving the country for investment abroad, said Kathy Jones, a currency analyst at Prudential Securities. That increases the demand for yen and undermines the central bank's attempts to stem the currency's rise by flooding the market through sales of yen. 
 Also buoying the yen is Japan's consistent current-account surplus, the broadest measure of international trade, which provides demand for yen as Japanese exporters bring home overseas revenue, Mr. Jones said. Japan posted an 812 billion yen surplus, or about $8 billion, in its current account in September,
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 101.88 yen, a weakening from 102.35 on Monday. The dollar has not traded below 100 yen since November 1995.
The euro settled at $1.0087, down from $1.0095, erasing an intraday gain as traders bet that the European Central Bank would not buy the currency to prevent it from falling to $1, or parity.
The intervention yesterday was the 11th time in the last five months that the Japanese central bank entered the currency market to sell yen at the behest of the Finance Ministry. The bank sold $3 billion to $4 billion of yen for dollars yesterday, traders estimated, bringing the sales since June to more than $40 billion. Haruhiko Kuroda, vice finance minister for international affairs, confirmed the move. Japan's foreign currency reserves totaled $273 billion in October.
The Japanese are concerned that a stronger currency will erode exporters' overseas profit at a time domestic demand remains weak.
"There's a good chance we go through" 100 yen to the dollar in the weeks ahead, said Derek Halpenny, a currency economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in London. All the Japanese central bank "can hope for is to curtail the speed of the yen appreciation," he said.
The bank's efforts to curb the yen have been overwhelmed as global investors poured money into Japan's equity markets. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks is up 49 percent in dollar terms this year, though it declined 1.55 percent yesterday. Japanese exporters have also stifled the beginnings of dollar rallies as they use any declines in the yen to convert revenue at more advantageous levels.

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls Brady Law a Success and Backs More Limits

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Celebrating the sixth anniversary of the Brady law, which mandates waiting periods and background checks for gun buyers, President Clinton said today that the system had blocked more than 470,000 gun sales to "felons, fugitives, stalkers and others prohibited from purchasing firearms."
In just the last year, since the Federal Bureau of Investigation began instant computerized checks of gun buyers' criminal histories, 160,000 sales have been prevented, the president said. 
 "These numbers, of course, are not just numbers," said Mr. Clinton, who signed the Brady bill into law on Nov. 30, 1993. "They represent lives saved, injuries avoided, tragedies averted."
Even as he proclaimed the success of the law -- named for James S. Brady, former President Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was severely wounded in the attempted assassination of Mr. Reagan on March 30, 1981 -- Mr. Clinton called on Congress to put further controls on guns next year. Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on the details of a package of bills in the Congressional session just ended. Both parties have cast gun control as an issue in the 2000 elections.
"Over 32,000 Americans still lose their lives in gunfire every year, including 12 children every day," the president said. "That is why I pledge to make passage of common-sense gun legislation my top public safety priority next year. And I challenge Congress to make a New Year's resolution to do the same."
Among the measures offered by Mr. Clinton that Congress failed to approve were a one-gun-a-month limit for individuals and criminal background checks for buyers at gun shows.
The National Rifle Association, which fought the Brady bill and tried to prevent Mr. Clinton's other initiatives, said the administration ought to focus on enforcing existing laws rather than adding new ones.
"There are 20,000-odd gun laws on the books, many of them on the federal level," said an N.R.A. spokesman, Jim Baker. "Enforcing those ought to be the priority."
Since the Brady law went into effect in March 1994, an estimated 412,000 felons, fugitives and mentally ill people have been prevented from buying handguns, the Justice Department says.
Police officials, prosecutors and criminologists generally believe the Brady law has contributed to the decline in crime in the 1990's.
But some advocates of gun control contend that the law did not go far enough to close loopholes in federal gun laws. For example, the Brady law has not curbed the practice of straw purchasing, in which a person without a criminal record buys a gun on behalf of a felon.
On a West Coast swing, the president said at a fund-raiser here for Democratic Congressional candidates that electing more Democrats would help to improve the gun laws. From San Francisco, he went to Los Angeles to receive honors from the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a nonprofit organization that wants more gun restrictions.
Mr. Clinton announced another measure today intended to curb the illegal marketing of firearms to juveniles and criminals -- a computer database to help agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms trace weapons used in crimes. Under the original Brady law, the state and local authorities were responsible for conducting background checks on potential buyers. That system expired a year ago, along with a five-day waiting period for buyers. Since then, the F.B.I. has begun the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which it operates jointly with state officials.
"The system has proven to be highly effective, performing more than 8.7 million checks in its first 12 months," Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Amid Friendly Greeting, A Candidate's Grilling

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H., Nov. 30

 BODY:
This is a state that takes its responsibility for holding the nation's first presidential primary very seriously. Voters expect to meet candidates, shake their hands and ask them a barbed question or two. Plenty of folks here would probably take a candidate home for a good health care debate over coffee if they could.
Perhaps, then, it was that sense of duty that inspired Aine Whittum to subject former Senator Bill Bradley to a grilling this afternoon. 
 Mr. Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, was greeting voters along the snow-covered main drag of this western New Hampshire town when he decided to pop into Ms. Whittum's place of employment: the Vitality Shop, a purveyor of herbal and homeopathic medicines, organic foods and sundry other New Age products.
Mr. Bradley had just begun bantering with the store's owner when Ms. Whittum, 24, sweetly piped up: "Can I ask a question?"
"Sure," said Mr. Bradley, sounding affably unprepared for the interrogation he was about to get.
Ms. Whittum pulled out one of the Bradley campaign's policy papers and, holding it aloft like a summons, said, "I was wondering about your economic policy. I don't feel you are being very clear."
She continued: "Part of your agenda is to keep the economy growing and growing. But the earth is only one size and everything can't keep growing."
Possibly sensing the danger of having to face down a hostile questioner while surrounded by half a dozen reporters, Mr. Bradley quickly tried to address her concerns. In the new global economy, he said, American economic growth would be fed by software and service companies, nonpolluting industries that do not use a lot of natural resources.
But Ms. Whittum said she was not talking just about natural resources, but about unchecked population growth, global economic instability and a variety of other potential catastrophes. It was time, she suggested, for a return to the barter system.
Mr. Bradley had patiently begun an analysis of the failures of the barter system in Russia when his aides began nudging him toward the door. He bid adieu.
Ms. Whittum, despite having monopolized the candidate for more time than many reporters get in a week, was not satisfied. Who would she vote for? "I'm thinking of writing myself in," she answered.
 
Way to a Candidate's Heart
 If Mr. Bradley has that hungry look about him, it's probably because he is. Hungry, that is.
In an effort to keep weight off during the campaign -- a nearly impossible task given the pressures to load up on fatty fast foods -- Mr. Bradley usually dines on salads and fruits. But it just doesn't seem to be quite enough for his 6-foot-5 frame.
So it is that Mr. Bradley can often be spied grabbing food at odd moments while he campaigns. For instance, on Monday night after a televised town hall meeting in Manchester, he ducked into a room where reporters had been watching the event. But Mr. Bradley was not looking to offer last-minute dollops of spin to stray journalists. No, he was in search of pizza. He triumphantly emerged from the room munching a cold slice, unperturbed by the congealing glob of cheese that was hanging off it like a lead sinker.
It is also probably his growling stomach more than his desire to win votes that drives Mr. Bradley to steal french fries and onion rings from the plates of diners when he visits restaurants on campaign events.
But Mr. Bradley may have recently shifted eating tactics. Monday's dinner was steak.
 
The Sartorial Strategy
What is it about Mr. Bradley and clothes?
He is known for wearing the same suit for weeks at a time, repairing torn ties with Scotch tape and resoling shoes scores of times to avoid buying new ones. But Mr. Bradley is not just unchic: he has made a political art form of being unartfully dressed.
When a reporter once jokingly asked him where he had bought his tie, Mr. Bradley proudly volunteered that he had forgotten to pack one and had to steal the tie from an aide. And when, at his wife's urging, he bought shoes for the first time in -- he claims -- 25 years, he made a campaign event out of it, leading a pack of camera crews into a shoe store in Nashua, N.H.
So it should not have been surprising, perhaps, that the mere hint of a change in Mr. Bradley's attire could set off rumors in Washington. Was that an earth-tone suit he was wearing during a speech at Tufts University? And since when does the dowdy Mr. Bradley wear French-blue shirts? Was this an effort to mimic the clothing strategies of his Democratic rival, Vice President Al Gore?
Well, in fact the suit was neither new nor earth-toned, but stolid, conservative banker's gray. (It just looked kind of earthy from a distance.) And about that deep blue shirt, well, Mr. Bradley had an answer for that, too.
Seems that, once again, he had forgotten to pack enough shirts during a recent visit to Iowa. So he had a trusty aide buy him some new ones. He asked for blue, but he didn't specify trendy French blue. But that was what he got and that was all he had to wear in New Hampshire.
Asked if there was some trend here, Mr. Bradley, as he often does when confronted with a question he considers silly, sighed and ever so slightly rolled his eyes.
"This is not trend," he said. "This is a moment that illustrates the deeper character of the candidate."

HEADLINE: Hiring of White Guard Who Killed Black Youth Stirs Anger

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Elected officials and guards at the Passaic County Juvenile Detention Center today criticized the decision to hire as a guard a white former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black teenager in Paterson five years ago.
The shooting touched off nearly two weeks of demonstrations, vandalism and sporadic violence, though the officer, Ronald Cohen, was later exonerated of any wrongdoing. 
 Mr. Cohen started work on Monday as a detention officer at the 100-bed center in Wayne, about 10 miles from Paterson. News of his hiring, reported today in two local newspapers, drew criticism from Paterson's City Hall -- Mayor Martin Barnes called it "unwise" -- and from some of Mr. Cohen's new co-workers, who fear that his presence may cause angry and violent reactions among inmates.
"I wouldn't believe that you could hire a person like that for a place like this, with all the juveniles here," said Darrin Williams, a senior detention officer who has been at the center for eight and half years. "This guy was at the center of perhaps one of the largest reactions to a juvenile being killed in Paterson, and he wasn't indicted. I come from the streets of Paterson and I understand them, and this is a problem."
Mr. Cohen shot 16-year-old Lawrence Meyers on Feb. 21, 1995. The officer, then 25 and a rookie Housing Authority police officer on the job less than three months, had been detailed to a plainclothes antidrug operation run by the city police. The young man was seen running from a car where the officers suspected a drug sale had taken place. Officer Cohen chased him.
According to the grand jury investigation that exonerated the officer, the two struggled and the officer's gun accidentally discharged. The bullet struck Mr. Meyers in the back of the head.
Mr. Meyers, whose family acknowledged at the time that he was a drug dealer, lay in a vegetative state for two days in a local hospital before dying, while reaction to his shooting prompted violence and vandalism by rampaging high school students and later raucous, but peaceful, demonstrations led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Meyers's funeral drew hundreds.
"This was very symbolic for Paterson, and to this day there are annual vigils commemorating Meyers's death," Mayor Barnes said. "It is just not good thinking on the part of the county to hire this man for a job working with inner-city youths."
Mr. Cohen could not be reached today for comment, and Robert Garigliano, director of the detention center, did not return several calls seeking comment on the hiring for the $23,318-a-year job.
Ten months after Mr. Cohen was exonerated by the grand jury in the Meyers shooting, he was fired by the city for substandard performance. He sued, and last year accepted a $48,000 settlement from the city.
Privately, some local officials said they saw local Democratic politics at work, from the hiring of Mr. Cohen as a housing police officer to his securing a prized drug-detail assignment as a rookie, and now turning up again on the public payroll.
But Georgia Scott, a Democratic member of the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders who is on the committee that oversees the detention center, said she understood that Mr. Cohen had taken a civil service examination and qualified for the post. While she noted that he had been cleared of wrongdoing and that she believed in "second chances," Ms. Scott said the freeholders should have been consulted on the hiring in such "a sensitive situation."
Just how sensitive became clear in interviews with several detention officers at the center, many of whom live in Paterson and, like most of the inmates, are black and Hispanic.
"The men are worried about having to work with him because they know that you don't need to give the kids too much to react negatively to," said Julius Beasley, a shift supervisor and 18-year veteran of the center.
The hiring of Mr. Cohen has also aroused concern among some black clergy members in the city of 140,000. The Rev. Melynn Murphy, pastor of Mount Zion Full Gospel and president of the city's chapter of the Congress of National Black Churches, said she was convinced that Mr. Cohen's presence could "trigger something" at the youth center, and ministers in town were drafting a letter urging county officials to rethink the assignment.
"What will be the perception of these young people who we say are there to be rehabilitated?" she asked. "Here we are putting an irritant in their face."

HEADLINE: Study of Ill Gulf War Veterans Points to Chemical Damage

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Some veterans of the Persian Gulf war who have complained of chronic illnesses have signs of brain damage caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, the authors of a scientific study partly financed by the Pentagon reported today.
Magnetic scans of sick veterans found lower-than-normal levels of a certain chemical, indicating damage in the parts of the brain that control reflexes, movement, memory and emotion, the study's authors said. 
 More than 100,000 American service members sent to the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991 have since reported experiencing a raft of maladies, including fatigue, muscle pain, memory loss and sleep disorders, which have collectively come to be known as gulf war syndrome.
The researchers stopped short of identifying the exact cause of the brain damage, saying that more medical research was needed. But coupled with a survey last month sponsored by the Pentagon, the findings showed that scientists were narrowing in on chemical exposure -- from pesticides, low levels of nerve gas or an experimental drug given to troops -- as the cause of the illnesses.
The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and presented today at the annual convention of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.
A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig R. Quigley, declined to discuss the findings in detail, saying they were preliminary and had not yet been subjected to peer review in an academic journal, which the authors said they expected soon.
"There are many steps to go here," Admiral Quigley said. "We need to take a look at it."
The study's principal author, James L. Fleckenstein, a professor of radiology, said in an interview that the study was the first to show brain damage in sick veterans.
Dr. Fleckenstein and his colleagues examined 22 veterans complaining of illnesses. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which measures chemical levels in the brain, they compared the results with those from 18 healthy veterans. The experiment was repeated in a sample of six more veterans.
The brain scans found that sick veterans had 10 percent to 25 percent lower levels of a chemical called the chemical N-acetyl-aspartate, signaling a loss of neurons in the brain stem and basal ganglia. Dr. Fleckenstein said that veterans with more severe symptoms showed the lowest levels of the chemical.
Nearly three years ago, researchers from the same university reported that exposure to a combination of chemicals might have been responsible for veterans' illnesses. The university's lead investigator, Robert W. Haley, said the most recent findings validated the earlier work.
Last month, the Rand Corporation, a research organization financed by the Department of Defense, released a survey that concluded that pyridostigmine bromide, an experimental drug meant to protect against an attack with nerve gas might be responsible for the illnesses.

2 Schools, 2 Strategies, One Goal: Keeping Top Students

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Emily Armstrong's first child was a pioneering kindergartner at a new experimental public school on the Lower East Side nine years ago. Her daughter, Brighid, thrived, and so did her school, the Neighborhood School, turning its funky mix of children of ex-hippies, professionals and working-class immigrants into the top-ranked elementary school in the district, and one of the best in New York City.
But when it came time for Brighid to go to middle school, her mother jumped ship, sending her to a school in East Harlem, a long subway ride from home. And Ms. Armstrong cannot imagine, when Brighid's younger brother, Kevin, is ready for middle school in two years, staying in the district. 
 "I love my neighborhood; I'm a real die-hard East Village person," said Ms. Armstrong, who closed down her video training company to spend more time with her children -- and their schools.
But the difficulty of finding a good public school has overshadowed much of the pleasure that she and her neighbors take in a neighborhood once known for its crime and drugs, but now bursting with art galleries, restaurants, community gardens and democratic ideals.
"I never realized what an insane place it was till I sent my kids to school," she said. "The hysteria about schools is just unbelievable."
Across New York City, there is a brain drain not just of talented teachers or brilliant principals, but also of an equally scarce commodity: ambitious, well-informed and choosy students, as parents shop around for better schools. Those who stay in the neighborhood through elementary school often leave in middle school, unable to find a nearby school that can handle both the turbulence of budding adolescence and serious academics.
Frustrated by the loss of students to neighborhoods as close as TriBeCa or as far as East Harlem, officials of District 1 on the Lower East Side have begun a recruitment drive, which they hope will retain enough students to become the core of a new crop of stronger schools.
Over the last few weeks, district officials have crisscrossed the neighborhood, a sometimes uneasy mix of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans who send their children to public schools, Orthodox Jews who do not, artists, Bengalis and Eastern Europeans. From 14th Street to Chinatown, Astor Place to the East River, officials have dropped off fliers at day care centers, community organizations, local newspapers and ethnic radio stations, encouraging families to take a closer look at Lower East Side schools.
A public-school fair this fall attracted 150 people, more than any similar event in the district in 20 years, said Laksmi A. Nor, the district's director of instruction.
The district superintendent, Sonia Diaz Salcedo, hopes that the drive will call attention to district schools that work and keep enough families with high-scoring children to help lift District 1 out of the mediocre middle of achievement among the city's 32 school districts.
It is a strategy that wealthy suburbs seldom have to think about. And it is one that leads to arguments about equity. Is it possible, parents and school officials ask, to create good schools by attracting strong students without further damaging the struggling schools they leave behind?
The district began, Ms. Salcedo said, by strengthening its elementary schools, using two models, the Neighborhood School, founded by teachers, and Public School 34, a classic neighborhood school. In the last two years, P.S. 34 has been expanded to eighth grade, hoping to keep the families in the district until the children are ready to go to high school.
Many parents at the Neighborhood School say they would like their school to do the same.
At the Neighborhood School, which has grown increasingly popular over the years, the atmosphere is folksy and informal. Its philosophy is so egalitarian that the school shies away from celebrating any holidays, for fear of offending someone. It shunned textbooks for many years, though social studies and math books have begun to creep into classrooms, as parents complained that without a text, it was hard for them to help their children at home.
Parents can follow the curriculum through letters sent home by every teacher. In kindergarten, children write that they have been feeding food scraps to their worms and sketching trees in Tompkins Square Park. In sixth grade, children plan to write a screenplay based on the Salem witch trials.
 It is hard to walk down the halls without bumping into a mother or father. Last week, Ken Gilbert, a lawyer wearing a dress shirt, tie and dreadlocks, led 4- and 5-year-olds in singing "how oats, peas, beans and barley grow," and then, by request, "You Are My Sunshine," while they inspected plants in the greenhouse.
Judith Foster, the director, an Ed Koren cartoon come to life with frizzy black hair and a look of erudite intensity, proudly tells how a father arrived, demanding a tour, after hearing about the school in Katmandu, Nepal. Asked what makes the school tick, she talks about community and empathy in the same breath as academics, and tells another story, of a little boy who could not find the bathroom. But he knew, she said, where to find his reading buddy, and he turned to the older child for help.
"What's important about our school is that children's ideas are treated seriously," she said.
Where the Neighborhood School breaks tradition, P.S. 34 embraces it. A miniature American flag hangs in every classroom. Bells ring loudly to signal times to change classes. When Virginia Hutchinson, the principal, who typically looks understated in a gray pantsuit, arrived six years ago, the library was closed. She reopened it, and students can drop in to do research any time.
Violin cases piled in classrooms are testament to the school's music program. Using a combination of grant money, city money and a partnership with the Third Street Music School, every child has an instrument and takes music class two to four times a week.
Every morning, Ms. Hutchinson makes her ritual announcements over the public address system: "Stand up and be counted if you had 100 percent attendance." "Stand up and be counted if you read six books so far this year." "Stand up and be counted if you were a good citizen and helped keep your school clean today." The floors gleam.
Most of her families come from nearby low-income housing projects, and for them "a big issue is a safe environment," Ms. Hutchinson said.
The P.T.A. president of P.S. 34, Lorraine Pattiasina, lives in nearby Section 8 housing and has returned to college while her husband, an Indonesian immigrant, works as a doorman. Eight of her 11 children have attended P.S. 34, and she has watched it improve.
But with 45 percent of the students in elementary school reading at or above grade level in 1997-98, the school performs well behind the Neighborhood School, with 73 percent reading at or above grade.
Mrs. Pattiasina is convinced -- despite the denials of district officials -- that the Neighborhood School receives more public money than her school.
"There is a constant battle of who gets more, who gets less," she said.
Ms. Pattiasina plans to stay at P.S. 34 and fight for more resources, even if it means pitting her school against another. Ms. Armstrong, who sent her daughter, Brighid, to middle school in East Harlem, says she might be persuaded to stay if she could get past the neighborhood politics that sees the expansion of her school as a victory for elitism.
"The saddest thing is this bad attitude about other people, other schools," she said. "You get into this 'circle your wagons' mentality. You are driven to isolation."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Senseless in Seattle

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Is there anything more ridiculous in the news today then the protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle? I doubt it.
These anti-W.T.O. protesters -- who are a Noah's ark of flat-earth advocates, protectionist trade unions and yuppies looking for their 1960's fix -- are protesting against the wrong target with the wrong tools. Here's why: 
 What unites the anti-W.T.O. crowd is their realization that we now live in a world without walls. The cold-war system we just emerged from was built around division and walls; the globalization system that we are now in is built around integration and webs. In this new system, jobs, cultures, environmental problems and labor standards can much more easily flow back and forth.
The ridiculous thing about the protesters is that they find fault with this, and blame the W.T.O. The W.T.O. is not the cause of this world without walls, it's the effect. The more countries trade with one another, the more they need an institution to set the basic rules of trade, and that is all the W.T.O. does. "Rules are a substitute for walls -- when you don't have walls you need more rules," notes the Council on Foreign Relations expert Michael Mandelbaum.
Because some countries try to use their own rules to erect new walls against trade, the W.T.O. adjudicates such cases. For instance, there was the famous "Flipper vs. GATTzilla" dispute. (The W.T.O. used to be known as GATT.) America has rules against catching tuna in nets that might also snare dolphins; other countries don't, and those other countries took the U.S. before a GATT tribunal and charged that our insistence on Flipper-free tuna was a trade barrier. The anti-W.T.O. protesters extrapolate from such narrow cases that the W.T.O. is going to become a Big Brother and tell us how to live generally. Nonsense.
What's crazy is that the protesters want the W.T.O. to become precisely what they accuse it of already being -- a global government. They want it to set more rules -- their rules, which would impose our labor and environmental standards on everyone else. I'm for such higher standards, and over time the W.T.O. may be a vehicle to enforce them, but it's not the main vehicle to achieve them. And they are certainly not going to be achieved by putting up new trade walls.
Every country and company that has improved its labor, legal and environmental standards has done so because of more global trade, more integration, more Internet -- not less. These are the best tools we have for improving global governance.
Who is one of the top environmental advisers to DuPont today? Paul Gilding, the former head of Greenpeace! How could that be? A DuPont official told me that in the old days, if DuPont wanted to put a chemical factory in a city, it knew it just had to persuade the local neighbors. "Now we have six billion neighbors," said the DuPont official -- meaning that DuPont knows that in a world without walls if it wants to put up a chemical plant in a country, every environmentalist is watching. And if that factory makes even a tiny spill those environmentalists will put it on the World Wide Web and soil DuPont's name from one end of the earth to the other.
I recently visited a Victoria's Secret garment factory in Sri Lanka that, in terms of conditions, I would let my own daughters work in. Why does it have such a high standard? Because anti-sweatshop activists have started to mobilize enough consumers to impress Victoria's Secret that if it doesn't get its shop standards up, consumers won't buy its goods. Sri Lanka is about to pass new copyright laws, which Sri Lankan software writers have been seeking for years to protect their own innovations. Why the new law now? Because Microsoft told Sri Lanka it wouldn't sell its products in a country with such weak intellectual property laws.
Hey, I want to save Flipper too. It's a question of how. If the protesters in Seattle stopped yapping, they would realize that they have been duped by knaves like Pat Buchanan -- duped into thinking that power lies with the W.T.O. It doesn't. There's never going to be a global government to impose the rules the protesters want. But there can be better global governance -- on the environment, intellectual property and labor. You achieve that not by adopting 1960's tactics in a Web-based world -- not by blocking trade, choking globalization or getting the W.T.O. to put up more walls. That's a fool's errand.
You make a difference today by using globalization -- by mobilizing the power of trade, the power of the Internet and the power of consumers to persuade, or embarrass, global corporations and nations to upgrade their standards. You change the world when you get the big players to do the right things for the wrong reasons. But that takes hard work -- coalition-building with companies and consumers, and follow-up. It's not as much fun as a circus in Seattle.

HEADLINE: Bush to Propose Broad Tax Cut In Iowa Speech

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush will lay out the centerpiece of his economic agenda on Wednesday, calling for sweeping cuts in income tax rates, a tax break for many married couples and an increase in the child credit, his aides said today.
The proposal, valued by the Bush campaign at $483 billion over five years starting in 2002, seemed certain to ignite debate among his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, and drew fire today from Vice President Al Gore, who called it fiscally irresponsible even before its details were disclosed. 
 The tax-cutting package, which would be financed out of anticipated budget surpluses, would be larger than the tax cut passed by the Republican-led Congress last summer and vetoed by President Clinton.
The plan seeks to shore up Mr. Bush's standing as a traditional economic conservative even as it addresses his theme of helping the working poor. But like Republicans in Congress, Mr. Bush faces a complicated task in selling a big tax reduction. At a time when the economy is strong and many people are feeling prosperous, polls show that the electorate is more interested in using the nation's newfound fiscal health to address issues like education and Social Security's solvency.
Mr. Bush's proposal -- to be unveiled in a speech in Des Moines on Wednesday -- would reduce taxes across the income spectrum gradually over five years.
The wealthy would see the top income tax rates reduced to 33 percent from 36 percent and 39.6 percent. The 28 percent and 31 percent rates paid by many middle-class taxpayers would be consolidated at 25 percent. Lower-income families would benefit from the creation of a new 10 percent tax bracket that would apply to much of the income currently taxed at 15 percent.
The plan would also double the child credit to $1,000 and allow more affluent families to claim the credit than under current law. It would benefit many married couples by reviving a deduction based on the lower-earning spouse's income. And it would phase out over eight years the inheritance tax on large estates.
The plan does not contain any reduction in taxes on capital gains, long a primary goal of conservatives. But in most ways, the plan sticks closely to Republican orthodoxy, concentrating its benefits on the upper end of the income scale, the people who pay the most taxes, while also appealing to middle-income families.
One of its unstated messages is that Governor Bush -- more than his father, who as president broke a vow not to raise taxes and who once derided the supply-side tax-cutting philosophy as "voodoo economics" -- can be counted on by his party's conservative base to do the right thing.
"This is simply an effort to show that he's a serious candidate who has ticked off all the little boxes of things you're supposed to do when you run for president," said Bruce Bartlett, a former Treasury Department official in the Reagan and Bush administrations. "The important thing is that it touches all the various bases, that it's small enough not to be considered fiscally irresponsible but substantial enough that it means something to the people who he feels need to be given something in the tax area."
Mr. Bush's proposal is also his first major effort to put a detailed policy behind his theme of "compassionate conservatism."
His advisers said the combination of the new 10 percent rate and the increase in the child credit was intended to help working poor families. Under the current tax code, those families lose a substantial portion of tax breaks available to them through the earned income tax credit -- and therefore face much bigger tax bills -- as their income approaches middle-class levels.
By the Bush campaign's calculations, the changes would remove six million families from the federal income tax rolls, or 20 percent of all families with children.
"It's a plan that will reduce the upper rate," Mr. Bush told reporters in Chicago today. "It's a plan also that recognizes that our current system is not fair. If you're a single mother with children, and you live on the outskirts of poverty, and you work hard, as you move toward the middle class, you pay an enormous rate."
But some analysts said the tax cuts would overwhelmingly go to the wealthy and would do less for low-income people than Mr. Bush suggested.
"I disagree that there's much for low income," said Iris J. Lav, deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization in Washington. "Even the things that look like low income are really middle income, and as I understand the rate structure, you're really talking about a massive tax cut for high-income people."
Mr. Bush is putting out his economic plan as he prepares for his first debate with his rivals for the Republican nomination on Thursday night in New Hampshire, and is clearly eager to show that he has a detailed agenda.
But he is also risking criticism from some of his Republican opponents as being too timid on tax cuts. From the Democratic side, Mr. Bush is already under attack.
Mr. Gore criticized the Bush approach today, saying that like the tax bill passed by Republicans in Congress this year it would endanger the nation's fiscal health. Campaigning in New Hampshire, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush had endorsed "a truly reckless tax scheme that would immediately put our country back into deficits."
The Bush plan was developed by a team of economists headed by Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor and policy aide to President Bush. The team also included Michael Boskin, who was chief economist in the Bush White House, and John F. Cogan, who was a budget official in the Reagan administration.
The size of Mr. Bush's plan was determined in part by projections of the size of the budget surplus. Both parties in Washington have agreed that the part of the projected surplus generated by excess Social Security revenue -- about $2 trillion over the next decade -- should be off limits for tax cuts or new spending. But the rest of the surplus -- the part generated by general tax revenue -- is up for grabs.
Mr. Bush's economic team estimated that the non-Social Security surplus in the first five years of their tax cut would be $586 billion. That estimate is higher than current surplus estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the White House, although their estimates are likely to be increased in coming months.
But analysts said there was still considerable uncertainty about how big the surpluses will be, in part because the current projections are based on assumptions that spending increases will remain far more limited than they have been in each of the last few years.

Highlights of the tax plan to be laid out by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
 
FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATES
The plan would reduce the top two income tax rates, 39.6 and 36 percent, to 33 percent. The middle rates, 28 and 31 percent, would be reduced to 25 percent. The current 15 percent rate would remain, but some of the income now subject to it would move into a new 10 percent bracket.
 
CHILD CREDIT
The child credit would be doubled, to $1,000 a child. The income cutoff on eligibility for the credit would rise to $200,000 for a married couple filing jointly from $110,000.
 
MARRIAGE PENALTY
The plan would reinstate a deduction available to couples in the mid-1980's. It would allow couples filing jointly to deduct 10 percent of the earnings of the lower-earning spouse, up to an earnings limit of $30,000.
 
INHERITANCE TAX
The plan would phase out the tax on large estates and gifts over eight years.
 
CHARITABLE GIVING
Taxpayers who do not otherwise itemize deductions would be allowed to itemize charitable contributions.
 
CORPORATE RESEARCH
A current provision giving credit to companies that engage in research would be made permanent.

HEADLINE: A Group Without a Center;
Rockefeller Investment Arm Trying Not to Look Back

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
There's finally a nip in the air, and the energy level around Rockefeller Center is ratcheting up. The Christmas tree will be lighted tonight, the refurbished skating rink is full of figure eights and the new Banana Republic flagship store is drawing crowds. The buildings somehow seem to glitter.
All in all, the center has the kind of rich sheen that one would normally associate with the Rockefeller name, so that makes it hard to remember that the Rockefeller family has not owned it for years. 
 "We never had a strategy of holding onto anything forever because our name is on it," said Peter J. Johnson, an adviser to David Rockefeller, who is now just a minority partner in the investor group that owns Rockefeller Center.
Sometimes, it seems as though this quintessentially American landmark has been through more owners than moviedom's Red Violin. In the last 15 years, it moved from American hands to Japanese hands and back to American ones and was in and out of bankruptcy.
Now, it is safely ensconced in the hands of a deep-pocketed investor group led by the venerable Goldman Sachs, and it is again operating as though nothing ever went wrong.
All of which makes this a bittersweet time for the folks at Rockefeller Group International, which used to own the place. It, too, is "Rockefeller" in name only now, having been sold to a Japanese company several years ago. Perched in their offices in the McGraw-Hill Building across the Avenue of the Americas, the Rockefeller Group people are onlookers, not participants, when the center is center stage.
"We always expected that we'd somehow keep control of the property," said Alan L. Stein, a senior vice president of Rock Group, as it is often called. Karen A. Treadwell, its treasurer, put it more emotionally: "That first year, I couldn't even go to the tree lighting, knowing we weren't part of it anymore," she said.
Still, the Rock Group staff is spending a lot less time these days looking wistfully at its past. Instead, staff members much prefer looking west toward Seventh Avenue, where a sign of their future is starting to rise.
There, on the site of a former parking lot on 49th Street, Rock Group has broken ground on a 33-story office tower, to be owned and mainly occupied by the financial powerhouse Morgan Stanley.
"This building is a visible sign that we've made it all the way back, that we're true real estate developers again," said Lorian L. Marlantes, Rock Group's chief executive.
In the New York real estate world, a tight little community where every developer's ups and downs are the fodder of power-lunch chatter, Rock Group's fall and rise has provided the spice at countless expense-account meals. Rock Group, now a wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese company, Mitsubishi Estate, has a lot fewer employees than it did in its glory days. And while they still get a lot of the cushy benefits that the Rockefeller family's largess once guaranteed, they no longer have the cocktail-party cachet that their employer once conveyed.
Still, they finally have something that eluded them for much of this decade: a seemingly solid future.
Like most real estate companies, Rock Group is thriving in a boom market. It has several building projects going outside New York, and "developers and tenants are calling us," said Jonathan D. Green, president of its development unit.
It still manages four skyscrapers on the Avenue of the Americas, including the McGraw-Hill Building, which it partly owns. It owns a slew of industrial properties in New Jersey, a telecommunications company, even a division that runs temporary office suites. It also owns 77 percent of Cushman & Wakefield, a huge real estate services company.
And all of those units are expanding apace. "We have stopped looking in the rearview mirror," Mr. Marlantes said.
That past view is not a pretty sight. Rock Group, which until 1984 was called Rockefeller Center Inc., was set up by the Rockefeller family trusts in 1932 to funnel some of their vast fortunes into real estate. It soon also owned television and radio stations, a paper bag company, Radio City, even an oil and gas company. But starting in the 1970's, the 14 Rockefeller family trusts that owned Rock Group began divesting assets.
The beginning of the end came in 1985, when the trust funds borrowed $1.3 billion from a real estate investment trust. Then, the trusts sold close to 58 percent of Rock Group to Mitsubishi Estate in 1990.
People cringed at the thought of a Japanese company owning so American a symbol as Rockefeller Center. But Mitsubishi's ownership was short-lived. Financing had been based on the assumption that annual rents would rise as high as $65 a square foot by the early 1990's. In fact, the center was lucky to get rents half that high after the 1989 real estate recession hit.
Mitsubishi refused to pay the debt itself. Rock Group was forced to put the landmarked part of the center into bankruptcy in 1995. "You couldn't go to a party without getting asked, 'How did you ever get into that kind of position?' " Ms. Treadwell, the Rock Group treasurer, said.
When Rockefeller Center emerged from bankruptcy in 1996, the real estate investment trust sold it to a group led by Goldman Sachs and Tishman Speyer Properties. The Rockefeller family trusts sold an additional 22 percent of Rock Group to Mitsubishi in 1991 and sold their remaining 20 percent stake to the Japanese company in 1997.
"The trustees felt it was imprudent to have so much of the family's value tied to the Rockefeller Group," said Mr. Johnson, David Rockefeller's adviser.
It was left to Mr. Marlantes, who has headed Rock Group since 1995, to pick up the pieces. "We had to convince ourselves and our people that the past was the past, that they hadn't screwed up and that they had a bright future," Mr. Marlantes said.
It was no small task. About 865 employees left Rock Group when the center was sold in 1996. While most got jobs with the new owners, many did not. The remaining 346 employees felt shellshocked.
"It was so depressing to see longtime colleagues leave, and to see job security become such a big issue," Ms. Treadwell said.
A few months after the center was sold, Mr. Marlantes moved Rock Group's offices from 1230 Avenue of the Americas, one of the landmarked Rockefeller Center buildings, to the McGraw-Hill Building across the street. "Psychologically, it was better to make a clean break, and be in a building we still owned," he said.
And he mandated that the most beloved benefits, like scholarships for employees' children, be continued. "They came to me right away and said, 'We have to maintain a corporate culture of caring,' " said Maureen Sullivan-Byrne, a 31-year employee who is now director of employee services.
Now, three years later, Rock Group is back up to 370 employees. And even rivals say they are an energized lot. "They've actually become more aggressive since they emerged from the bankruptcy," said Stephen B. Siegel, chief executive of the ESG unit of Insignia, which is Cushman's largest rival.
Rock Group does have to contend with Japanese owners. Six of its nine board members are Japanese, and two have set up offices in Rock Group's space. Although Rock Group executives play down the difficulties, other American executives who work for Japanese subsidiaries say the culture shock can be monumental.
"Americans are used to looking at facts, making decisions and moving on," said Jim Ivy, chief executive of the Savin Corporation, which Japan's Ricoh bought in 1995. "Japanese companies spend twice as much time keeping everyone informed and involved."
Rock Group executives do not deny that they spend a lot more time catering to the Japanese bosses than they did to the Rockefellers. But many say that in a funny sort of way they feel more unfettered as a lesser-known Japanese subsidiary than they did when Rockefeller Center was their raison d'etre.
"Those landmarked buildings are old, everything breaks; they were awfully expensive to run," said one Rock Group higher-up, who refused to be identified lest he seem to be dining on sour grapes. "Owning them was a labor of love, not profit."
And the spirit is more aggressive. "The Rockefeller family was selling off real estate, not expanding," said Leslie E. Smith Jr., a senior vice president of Rock Group who runs development projects outside New York. "Mitsubishi said to me, 'You want to go out and fly, go ahead.' "
Until Mitsubishi took full control, Mr. Smith had concentrated solely on building Rock Group's 700-acre industrial park in Mount Olive, N.J. Lately, he has been negotiating two big deals in Florida, in partnership with an investment firm. His group has also built a research center for AT&T in Florham Park, N.J., and has bought adjacent land that it will soon develop. Rock Group is helping Mitsubishi Estate develop an office complex in London. Mitsubishi now enlists Rock Group's help in designing buildings in Japan. And it is encouraging Cushman to open an office in Tokyo.
But Rock Group has not cut the umbilical chord entirely: its management company and its office suites group still use the Rockefeller Center name in their logos.
"When I identify myself as the senior vice president of leasing at Rockefeller Center Management, people ask about the buildings around the skating rink." Mr. Stein conceded. "Having a great American name in our masthead makes a significant difference, but it also leaves a residue of confusion."
It's not that the Rock Group folks don't ever gaze wistfully across at their old homestead. But its loss has gone from a sharp pain to an all but unnoticeable dull ache.
"We're on an upswing," Ms. Sullivan-Byrne said. "We feel more security in our jobs and we do still have the Rockefeller name. It no longer seems as painful not to be lighting the Christmas tree."
Ms. Treadwell agreed. "That first year, I didn't go the Christmas tree ceremony because it was too hard, too painful," she said. "I don't go now, either, but just because I don't like the crowds."

HEADLINE: Fed Governor Says Rates Might Increase

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers may decide to raise interest rates again to keep the United States economy on a low-inflation growth path, a Fed governor, Laurence H. Meyer, said yesterday.
"The fundamental challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to a more sustainable, though still excellent, state," Mr. Meyer said in the text of remarks to be delivered at the Stern Graduate School of Business at New York University. 
 Three interest rate increases by the Fed since June may not be enough to slow the economy to the point where inflation is not likely to accelerate, he said.
On Nov. 16, the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee raised the overnight bank lending rate a quarter-point, to 5.50 percent, saying that the increase "should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward."
This year's rate increases could be seen merely as a reversal of the rate cuts in 1998, Mr. Meyer said. Still, "any policy action has to be justified on the basis of how it contributes going forward to achieving the broad macro objectives assigned to monetary policy," he said.

Conseco, Its Stock Sagging, Focuses on Balance Sheet
Conseco, an insurance holding company with a sagging stock price, announced a reversal of strategy. It cut its common stock dividend and agreed to raise $478 million by selling convertible preferred stock on extraordinarily generous terms to a private investment firm.
Conseco's shares rose $1.6875, to $20.25, on the news. And Moody's Investors Service said that when the financing by the investment firm is completed, it would raise Conseco's rating from junk bond level to investment grade. Floyd Norris: Market Place. Page C18.

HEADLINE: National Guard Is Called to Quell Trade-Talk Protests;
Seattle Is Under Curfew After Disruptions

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK and STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Downtown Seattle was placed under curfew and the National Guard was called in tonight, after the city was engulfed in demonstrations that threw the opening of global trade talks into turmoil.
The protesters surrounded the convention hall, pinned trade dignitaries in their hotels and stopped traffic at several intersections. By late afternoon, clouds of tear gas set off by the police wafted through downtown streets populated by Nordstrom, Nike and Starbucks, and Mayor Paul Schell declared a state of emergency and a curfew that he said would last until sunrise on Wednesday. 
 The protests forced the postponement of opening ceremonies for a meeting of the World Trade Organization that President Clinton, who is scheduled to arrive here early Wednesday, had hoped would showcase American leadership on free trade.
The global organization is meant to resolve trade disputes and promote free trade, and the Seattle meeting is intended to open a new round of negotiations.
But the protesters have descended on Seattle with an eclectic array of grievances, most centered around the sentiment that the trade organization is a handmaiden of corporate interests whose rulings undermine health, labor and environmental protections around the world.
In Seattle the police used tear gas, pepper spray and rubber pellets at some intersections to break up the groups of demonstrators.
A small group of men, dressed in black clothing and masks and ignoring cries of "Shame on you!" from other protesters, smashed windows and spray-painted graffiti at downtown stores like Nordstrom, Niketown, Starbucks and the Gap. Both were jarring sights in a city that prides itself on its laid-back image.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other scheduled speakers for opening ceremonies this morning were unable to get through the crowd, which in many cases blocked intersections by linking hands or lying down in the street.
With thousands of protesters already gathered downtown and about 20,000 additional marchers in a union-backed rally headed that way, the trade body's director general, Mike Moore, a former prime minister of New Zealand, announced early this afternoon that the opening ceremonies would be put off. But he vowed that the trade talks would go on. In fact, he held meetings today with a few trade ministers who managed to leave their hotels.
"Negotiating groups are in full swing," Mr. Moore said. "This conference will be a success."
Outside, protesters chanted: "Whose world? Our world! Whose streets? Our streets!"
Reaction of the trade delegates here seemed to run the gamut, from bewilderment to bemusement to, in some cases, anger. As demonstrators shouted "Go home! Go home!" a German delegate, Arnold Schwez, made his way back inside the Sheraton Hotel after he could not get through the crowd.
"These people don't understand the benefits of free trade to the developing nations," Mr. Schwez said.
Early tonight, as Christmas lights and displays came on in parts of downtown streets, demonstrators continued to hold their positions, and a few fires, most set in trash cans, burned in the street.
The governor of Washington State, Gary Locke, in announcing that he was calling in at least 200 troops from the state National Guard, said the troops were "trained in crowd control" and would be unarmed.
Mr. Moore told reporters: "This is a sad day. To those who argue that we should stop our work, I say: tell that to the poor, to the marginalized around the world who are looking to us to help them."
A spokesman for the Seattle police, Clem Benton, said tonight that he could confirm at least 19 arrests of protesters, several of whom were charged with assault, and that number appeared likely to rise.
The police continued to move through parts of downtown with armored personnel carriers. As white clouds of tear gas passed down the streets, protesters coughed, cried and asked for water. Further back, groups of demonstrators chanted, "The whole world is watching!"
In at least a few instances, uniformed officers fired rubber-coated capsules at protesters who the police believed were charging police lines. The pellets, which the police said contained chemical irritants, hit some of the protesters in the leg or the arm, causing visible welts.
"We are here peacefully; we just want our message to be heard," said Gloria Haselwander, a 21-year-old clerk in a Seattle music store who said she believes that the world trade group's rulings contributed to environmental destruction and ever-greater gaps between the world's richest people and its poorest. "We kept saying, 'No violence, no violence,' " she added, "but there was just this mass of gas. My throat hurts, my lungs still hurt."
Bill Simpich, a lawyer from San Francisco, said most protesters were intent on being nonviolent, but were also intent on continuing their demonstrations until the trade body's procedures were reformed to take account of health and environmental issues.
"We will keep marching until the process is open and until they let the people in the door when the decisions are made," said Mr. Simpich, who started his day in the rainy, pre-dawn darkness by gathering with other protesters in a park near the Pike Place Market and then marching toward the convention hall. Rain continued intermittently through the morning, but then stopped for most of the rest of the day.
For Mayor Schell and other city leaders, who had once eagerly sought the meeting to showcase Seattle's role as a major exporter in one of the most trade-dependent regions of the country, the immediate focus tonight was simply on restoring order. But they were bound to face questions in the days ahead about their preparations for protests and, perhaps, to face conflicting criticism that the police moved too harshly on the protesters or did not act aggressively enough to head off the chaos.
Most of the demonstrators were clearly opposed to the window-smashing and other destructive acts by a small knot of protesters, most of whom were young men wearing masks and declining to give their names when asked by reporters.
"Anarchy rules!" said one, carrying a trash can down the street and then using it to smash a window of a Starbucks coffee shop.
At a news conference tonight, both the mayor and the police chief said they respected the right of protesters to gather here, and they blamed a small percentage of them for the violence. "We have demonstrators who are continuing to express their point of view," Chief Stamper said. "Most are doing it nonviolently; some are doing it violently."
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, was unable to deliver his speech to delegates. In his prepared text, he said: "Unless we convince developing countries that globalization really does benefit them, the backlash against it will become irresistible. That would be a tragedy for the developing world."
This morning, close to 20,000 union members and their allies packed Memorial Stadium, next to the Space Needle, to hear speeches by opponents of the trade organization. The speakers ranged from James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters union president, to Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, and Wei Jingsheng, a Chinese dissident.
Speaker after speaker voiced anger that, in their depiction, the trade organization favored corporations and overturned national laws that protected the environment, endangered species and consumers.
Several union leaders also belittled the organization's push for free trade, saying it has encouraged American companies to move operations overseas where workers are paid far less and have few rights.
To thunderous applause, Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said, "The rules of this new global economy have been rigged against workers, and we're not going to play by them anymore."
A few union leaders took a protectionist tone, condemning the flood of imports, which they said had wiped out hundreds of thousands of well-paying American manufacturing jobs. But most union leaders focused on pressing the trade organization to protect workers' rights as a way to lift living standards around the world and to close the growing gap between rich and poor in many developing countries.
John Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, said, "Until the W.T.O. addresses these issues, we should not and must not permit our country to participate in a new round of trade negotiations."
After the rally, the union members, joined by environmentalists and other protesters, began a two-mile-long march that skirted the area of the sit-ins and the tear gas. Protesters carried signs that included, "Labor Rights Not Trade Wrongs" and "End Corporate Rule."
As the marchers snaked through downtown, most of the best-known department stores, including Nordstrom and Bon Marche, were closed. Even many Starbucks were shut, with a protester painting "We Want Fair Wages" on the door of one.
The protesters marched past the Westin Hotel, where the American delegation is staying. The hotel was ringed by city buses that were purposely parked bumper to bumper to prevent the organization's critics from approaching the hotel.
The sit-ins brought traffic in many parts of the city to a standstill and angered many motorists. A sit-in at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Seneca Street prevented cars from leaving a freeway exit during the morning rush.
Stephanie Derouin, a customer service worker for Amazon.com. who was trapped for half an hour after taking the Seneca exit, said: "I sympathize with them, but I wish they didn't put me out like this. But if I didn't have a job, I'd probably be out there protesting with them."

Chart: "Behind the Hubbub in Seattle"
 
WHO'S PROTESTING AND WHAT THEY OBJECT TO:
United Steelworkers of America, A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Teamsters.
 
STEEL: Several steel unions are out in force in Seattle protesting the dumping of imported low-cost steel that eliminates jobs in the U.S. The W.T.O. may consider doing away with U.S. anti-dumping laws.
 
The Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation and Friends of the Earth are among the many environmental groups protesting the W.T.O.
SEA TURTLES: , an endangered species, have become the leading symbol for environmental groups that accuse the W.T.O. of ignoring the environmental impact of its decision to force the United States to amend an import ban on shrimp. The rule said shrimpers must use nets that allow sea turtles to escape. The W.T.O. said the rule was unfairly applied.
 
The Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Consumer Federation of America, and Public Citizen are among the Seattle protest groups.
BEEF: The groups are protesting the W.T.O.'s support of the American desire to export hormone-treated beef.
 
Some of the diverse groups include the Corporation for Enterprise Development, the Ruckus Society, the International Forum on Globalization and Pat Buchanan, the presidential candidate.
POWER: The W.T.O.'s secretive, Geneva-based bureaucracy has become the target of think tanks and political action groups that oppose large international corporations.
 
WHAT THEY WANT:
 
STEEL: The United Steelworkers want to prevent foreign steel from being dumped in the United States at below market prices.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Teamsters have different concerns, calling for the W.T.O. to set international labor standards that would prevent poor countries from using child labor, or lax labor laws, to lure jobs away from wealthy countries.
 
SEA TURTLES: Many environmental groups have called for the trade group to weigh environmental impact more carefully when making trade decisions, but some more radical groups have pushed for the W.T.O. to be eliminated.
 
BEEF: The W.T.O. ruled that the European Union did not have a sufficient scientific basis for banning imports of American hormone-treated beef. Both American and European consumer groups have vigorously protested the decision. The groups argue that governments should put concerns about food safety on above free trade.
 
POWER: They object, in part, to the closed-door nature of the W.T.O.'s decision making, as well as what they see as its tendency to ride roughshod over the legislative process of local and national governments. Many also see the W.T.O. as having too much power to impose financial penalties on countries that violate its decisions. The International Forum on Globalization says that the W.T.O. represents the most fundamental redesign and centralization of the world's political and economic arrangements since the industrial revolution.

HEADLINE: Gore Borrows Clinton's Shadow Back to Share a Bow

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: BEDFORD, N.H., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore asserted today that the nation's prosperity was the central imperative of his campaign, and he gave credit to President Clinton -- and himself -- for the booming economy.
"In this campaign for president, economic policy should be front and center," Mr. Gore told a group of business executives here this morning as he allied himself fully with the President whose shadow he has otherwise been trying to escape. 
 "President Clinton has presided over an economic policy in the current administration that has been historic in its realism about what works and what doesn't work," Mr. Gore said, "and I'm proud to have been a part of the deliberations that have helped to set this economic policy in place."
Mr. Gore's comments were his strongest about his role in the current prosperity, and the remarks were striking in their full embrace of Mr. Clinton. Far from separating himself from the President, as he had been doing so frequently, Mr. Gore praised him often and used the word "we" to describe the administration's economic successes.
"I want you to know that I am determined to continue the prosperity and to continue the policies that have worked to build that prosperity," he said, pledging that as president he would invest in public education and job training for workers.
In his talk to the business group, he promised to reduce the deficit "every single year" of his presidency. Background papers issued by his staff said that he pledged to "make certain that America stays on the path to be debt-free by 2015," but he did not say that to this audience.
Later in the day, Mr. Gore, who suffered some embarrassment this year when he took credit for the development of the Internet, said he was the one who had first drawn attention to the toxic contamination of Love Canal. He was telling a school audience that each person can make a difference in the world and he recalled a child writing to him when he was in Congress about a hazardous-waste site in Tennessee.
He then added: "I found a little place in upstate New York called Love Canal. I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone, Tenn.," he said. "But I was the one that started it all. And it all happened because one high school student got involved."
Mr. Gore held Congressional hearings on the matter in October 1978. But two months earlier President Jimmy Carter had declared Love Canal a disaster area, and the federal government, after much howling by local residents, had offered to buy the homes.
Mr. Gore was not available to answer questions from reporters after he made this statement.
In his economic speech Mr. Gore also discussed his little-known work as a real estate developer in the early 1970's in Daleville, Ala.
"For a brief time I was a home builder, after I came back from Vietnam," he told the audience. "Tipper and I borrowed some money and bought 20 acres on the edge of the town where we lived and made it into a subdivision, 35 lots, and I had a partner who built several homes and then sold the rest of the lots. I know a good bit about how to make money that way -- that was our nest egg. To build this country is a great thing."
Peace and prosperity are traditionally overriding issues in national elections, but mostly when they are threatened. Mr. Gore's advisers said he had not focused on prosperity until now because the economy was humming and voters were more concerned about education, health care and school safety. But Mr. Gore has been preoccupied over the last several months with the mechanics of his campaign and changing his image. And today's assertion was as much a declaration that he wanted to turn the conversation to the pocketbook issues that voters focus on increasingly as an election approaches. As one adviser put it, Mr. Gore deserved some credit for the nation's prosperity and he planned to take it.
But claiming credit for the economy has its hazards. It directly links him with Mr. Clinton.
Marshall Wittman, an analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gore's taking credit for the economy illuminated both the cloud and the silver lining of being vice president. "If he is going to take credit for the good, he has to take the bad with it," Mr. Wittman said.
The question of how responsible a president is for the economy is always an open one; a vice president's share is even more open.
Robert Reischauer, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office, appointed by Democrats, and now an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that the Clinton administration had made "some very gutsy decisions" that helped vanquish the deficits and that Mr. Gore was influential in those decisions.
"Gore was known as a voice of moderation and perseverance when it came to deficit reduction," Mr. Reischauer said, "and he was on the side of the president."
But Mr. Reischauer added, "There were a lot of other factors, not the least of which was Lady Luck."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 10, 1999, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 1 about a campaign appearance by Vice President Al Gore in New Hampshire rendered a passage incorrectly in a comment he made about the contamination of Love Canal. Mr. Gore said: "I found a little place in upstate New York called Love Canal. I had the first hearing on that issue and Toone, Tenn. But that was the one that started it all." He did not say "But I was the one that started it all."

 BODY:
It is all too easy to dismiss the protesters at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle as radicals with 60's envy. A seemingly more trenchant criticism is that they are simply behind the curve, fighting against a tide of globalization that has already swamped them. Mike Moore, the director of the W.T.O., describes his opponents as nothing more than protectionists launching an assault on internationalism.
The truth, however, is that the protesters in Seattle have been bitten by the globalization bug as surely as the trade lawyers inside the Seattle hotels -- though by globalization of a different sort -- and they know it. The confusion about the protesters' political goals is understandable: this is the first movement born of the anarchic pathways of the Internet. There is no top-down hierarchy, no universally recognized leaders, and nobody knows what is going to happen next. 
 This protest movement is really anti-corporate rather than anti-globalist, and its roots are in the anti-sweatshop campaigns taking aim at Nike, the human rights campaign focusing on Royal Dutch/Shell in Nigeria and the backlash against Monsanto's genetically engineered foods in Europe.
At any time, one huge multinational company may be involved in several disputes -- on labor, human rights and environmental issues, for example. Activists learn of one another as they aim at the same corporate target. Inadvertently, individual corporations have become symbols of the global economy in miniature, ultimately providing activists with name-brand entry points to the arcane world of the W.T.O.
This is the most internationally minded, globally linked movement the world has ever seen. There are no more faceless Mexicans or Chinese workers stealing our jobs, in part because those workers' representatives are now on the same e-mail lists and at the same conferences as the Western activists. When protesters shout about the evils of globalization, most are not calling for a return to narrow nationalism, but for the borders of globalization to be expanded, for trade to be linked to democratic reform, higher wages, labor rights and environmental protections.
This is what sets the young protesters in Seattle apart from their 60's predecessors. In the age of Woodstock, refusing to play by state and school rules was regarded as a political act in itself. Now, opponents of the W.T.O. -- even those who call themselves anarchists -- are outraged about a lack of rules and authority. They are demanding that national governments be free to exercise their authority without interference from the W.T.O. and asking for stricter international rules governing labor standards, environmental protection and scientific research.
Everyone, of course, claims to be all for rules, from President Clinton to Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates. In an odd turn of events, the need for "rules-based trade" has become the mantra of the era of deregulation. But deregulation is by definition about the removal of rules. The W.T.O., charged with defining and enforcing deregulation, is only concerned with rules that regulate the removal of rules.
The W.T.O. has consistently sought to sever trade, quite unnaturally, from everything and everyone affected by it: workers, the environment, culture. This is why President Clinton's suggestion yesterday that the rift between the protesters and the delegates can be smoothed over with small compromises and consultation is so misguided.
The face-off is not between globalizers and protectionists, but between two radically different visions of globalization. One has had a monopoly for the last 10 years. Then other just had its coming-out party.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Yen Fallson Hints of Move by Central Bank

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The yen fell against the dollar yesterday on speculation that the Bank of Japan would step up efforts to curb the yen's strength, which threatens to stymie economic recovery in Japan.
The yen backed off a four-year high against the dollar after the central bank suggested that it might increase the amount of yen in the banking system, effectively lowering its value. A bank official later denied that, adding that no change in policy was planned. Some traders said the bank might have been trying to slow the yen's gains. 
 "The market is starting to understand the Bank of Japan is prepared to maintain sufficient funds for stability" of the yen, said Michael Kahn, chief currency dealer at State Street Bank and Trust Company in Boston.
The yen fell to 102.78 per dollar from 102.15 late Tuesday in New York. It fell against the euro for the first day in eight sessions, to 103.575 yen from 103.13 yen. On Friday, the yen rose to 101.25 per dollar, its highest level since Dec. 12, 1995.
That prompted the central bank, which acts for the Ministry of Finance in the currency market, to sell yen on Monday and Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Shows Steady Expansion

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded in November for a 10th consecutive month and was on track to finish 1999 with the highest rate of growth in five years, a survey of business executives showed today.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index was 56.2 last month as rising demand for exports helped fuel growth. The index has held above 50 since February, showing that more manufacturers reported improved conditions than declining ones. 
 The index of prices paid fell to 65.3 in November from 69.4 in October, showing that price increases for raw materials were abating. October's reading had been the highest since 70.5 in May 1995.
"I haven't seen better business conditions for manufacturing," said Norbert J. Ore, chairman of the association and director of corporate purchasing for the Chesapeake Corporation in Richmond, Va.
Manufacturing is on course to have its best three-month showing in five years. The index for October and November averaged 56.4. If that holds for this month, the quarterly reading would be the highest since 58.2 in the fourth quarter of 1994.
The index has signaled growth almost all year after falling last December to 45.3, the lowest since May 1991, when the economy was emerging from the last recession.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that construction spending increased three-tenths of a percent in October, the first rise in three months, as builders stepped up work on new homes and public projects.
And a report from the Conference Board, a private research group, pointed to further growth, though at a slower rate in the next six months. The group's index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in October after a drop of one-tenth of a percent in September that was the first decline in five months.
Manufacturing has been on the rebound since Asia and Latin America started to recover this year from economic troubles. There was further evidence of that in today's purchasing management report. The index of export orders rose to 54.5 in November from 52.4 during October. It was also the 10th consecutive month above 50 for that gauge.
The overall new orders index also rose, climbing to 59.9 in November from 59.5 during October, which means factories should stay busy for some time, analysts said.
Manufacturers all the same are having to cope with rising costs of raw materials, including natural gas, aluminum and steel. Counting November, the prices-paid index has showed a majority of manufacturers reporting that they have paid more for seven months.
The decline in the prices index for November will remove some pressure for companies to pass along those higher costs to their customers, Mr. Ore said. "It's difficult still to pass through price increases in this market," he said. "Many industries are being very restrained in raising prices and very cautious about raising prices."

BroadRally Led by Blue Chips Lifts the Dow 120 Points

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday with the blue chips leading the way on positive news from General Electric and the Exxon Mobil Corporation, the newly merged oil giant.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 120.58 points, or 1.11 percent, to 10,998.39. 
 The Nasdaq composite index climbed 17.55 points, or 0.53 percent, to 3,353.71.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 8.81 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,397.72.
Analysts said softer-than-anticipated November data from the National Association of Purchasing Management offered some relief from fears that the Federal Reserve bank could raise interest rates to stem inflation.
The association's manufacturing activity index for November was 56.2 versus an expected 56.3 percent. A figure above 50 indicates the nation's manufacturing sector is expanding.
"I think the N.A.P.M. numbers are part of it," said Roy Blumberg, money manager at Sheer Asset Management. "We had a pretty good pull-back here over the past five or six days. Basically, I think the major trend is up."
Declines overtook advances by about a 17 to 14 margin, on heavy volume of 907 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 31 stocks at new highs while 261 made new lows.
But a big tide of positive company news bolstered the Dow.
"That is really why the Dow is rallying today," said John Cleland, chief investment strategist at Security Benefit Group of Companies in Topeka, Kan.
General Electric gained 4 7/16, at 134 9/16, after Salomon Smith Barney raised its price target on the conglomerate to $150 from $135.
Shares of Exxon Mobil rose 3 3/16, to 82 1/2, on their first day of trading after the two oil giants combined to become the world's largest publicly traded oil company.
AlliedSignal Inc. rose 3/4, to 60 3/4, and Honeywell Inc. strengthened 2 1/4, to 114 3/16, after the European Union said it had cleared the proposed merger between the two companies.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq recovered some of its losses from its drop Tuesday but traders said the market was still prone to some profittaking.
"If you want to talk about Internet stocks and technology stocks, they have had a long hard run," said Dick Stein, vice president, chief technical analyst at Noble International Investments, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla. "Some would say they are overbought."
Yahoo Inc. jumped 16 1/8, to 229, after Standard & Poor's said it would add the Internet media network to its benchmark 500-share index. Yahoo replaces the Canadian transit services company Laidlaw Inc. Laidlaw fell 1/2, to 5 5/8.

Treasuries Unchanged
 By Bloomberg News
 Treasury bond prices were unchanged yesterday, as investors awaited the jobs report tomorrow.
Treasuries fell and then recouped early losses after a report showed manufacturing activity expanded at a slower-than-expected pace in November. Even so, comments from the Fed governor, Laurence Meyer, suggesting that the central bank was prepared to raise rates again, and expectations that the report tomorrow will show a booming labor market, kept bonds in check.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 97 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was also unchanged at 6.29 percent.

HEADLINE: Anger as Mexico Begins Foreign Car Restriction

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and SAM DILLON

DATELINE: EL PASO, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Despite threats of economic boycotts from Mexican-American groups and growing political opposition in Washington, the Mexican government today instituted a customs policy requiring deposits of as much as $800 for all cars with non-Mexican license plates entering the interior of the country from the United States.
Mexican officials say the program is in response to widespread problems of motorists leaving unregistered foreign cars in the country, the equivalent of illegal imports. Including taxes, cars cost roughly 13 percent more in Mexico than in the United States, and officials say 1.5 million vehicles have been illegally brought into the country, a statistic that infuriates Mexican car dealers. 
 The Mexican government delayed the new policy for a month after criticism from lawmakers in Washington and Mexico City, but this morning customs officials at checkpoints along the 2,000-mile border began enforcing the deposit. Critics predict the plan will harm tourism in Mexico. The deposit also represents a hardship for poorer, recent immigrants from Mexico who usually return to visit relatives for Christmas.
"Everybody knows it's not fair," said Jose Alvarez, a construction worker from California, as a border guard inspected his late model van this morning at the main Mexican checkpoint in Ciudad Juarez, across the Rio Grande from El Paso. Mr. Alvarez and his family must pay a $400 deposit to visit relatives in Guanto, Mexico.
"We had to work all year for a vacation with our family, and now we have to give some money for a deposit," Mr. Alvarez said.
The controversy is another reminder of the occasional friction between Mexico and the United States even as the two nations remove trade barriers through the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In recent weeks, the policy has prompted organized protests by Mexican-American groups in Houston, San Antonio, Chicago and Los Angeles, including threats to boycott Mexican products like Tecate beer. A bipartisan Congressional delegation has asked President Clinton to intervene, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, announced this week that she would call Senate hearings early next year.
The deposit plan creates a sliding scale under which motorists post a refundable cash or credit deposit of $400 to $800, depending on the age of the vehicle. Drivers who remain in a 16-mile zone near the border are exempt from the deposit, which also does not apply to Baja California.
On Tuesday night, hundreds of motorists lined up for hours in Texas border cities like Del Rio and Laredo to enter Mexico before the deposit was instituted.
In Laredo, which has the heaviest traffic into Mexico, Mayor Betty Flores said this week that the city would offer free parking in the expectation that many poorer, newer immigrants would leave their cars in the United States rather than pay the deposit.
By this morning, motorists like Mr. Alvarez seemed resigned to the deposit, if not happy about it. Deposits are made with Mexico's National Bank of the Army, and officials have promised that the deposits will be refunded when a motorist returns to a border checkpoint. But because Mexico is often plagued by corruption, some motorists fear that their money will not be returned.
Mr. Alvarez, for example, said he would pay with a credit card. "You give cash, and you may not see that money anymore," he said. The family left San Jose on Monday, hoping to reach the border in time to avoid the deposit but failing.
Marco Provencio, a spokesman for the Mexican Treasury Ministry, said the government guaranteed the return of the deposits and called the program necessary to "to help us attack illegal vehicle introduction." He called the problem a "complex matter" and said the government did not intend to bring hardship to poor, recent immigrants.
But many Mexican-Americans and new immigrants from Mexico consider the program a slap in the face.
"It is a total attack of our people's pockets," said Cristobal Hinojosa of Mexicans in Action, an advocacy group in Houston. "The Mexican government knows very well that this is the season when our people travel to see their families."
Last year, United States motorists spent $679 million in Mexico, and Mexican tourism officials initially expressed surprise over the deposit program.
Much of the traffic comes from United States and Canadian snowbirds, but Olivia Bravo, the co-owner of an insurance agency in Laredo, said her company did not get a single request for a Mexican car insurance policy last month compared with about 400 in November 1998.
At the border checkpoint in Ciudad Juarez, a motorist from California traveling to Mexico City said, "The Mexican government has gone wacko." The man, who would only give his first name, Luke, said he planned to spend two weeks on a vacation with his niece. As a customs guard examined the suitcases and boxes stuffed into his van, the man watched a succession of cars, many old and banged up, enter Mexico.
"Like everything, only the poor people get hurt," he said.

HEADLINE: Europe Says Its Strike Force Won't Impair Role of NATO

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Senior defense officials of France, Germany and Britain are trying to reassure the United States prior to a NATO meeting on Thursday that rapidly coalescing plans to create an independent European military intervention force would not weaken the Atlantic alliance.
France, Germany, Britain and Italy, which have the largest armed forces in Western Europe, plan to ask leaders of all 15 European Union countries to agree in Helsinki next week to lay the groundwork by no later than 2003 for a European crisis-response force of up to 60,000 troops, officials in Paris and Brussels said. 
 Finland, which will preside over the meeting on Dec. 9 and 10, has proposed a draft agreement on a force of 50,000 soldiers that could be sent within 60 days to crisis situations on Europe's periphery and stay for up to two years, according to a European Union official in Brussels. The Europeans say they need such a force for crises that the United States and Canada might not want to become involved in.
The Finnish draft also incorporates French, German, British and Italian proposals to set up a permanent European political and security committee of senior officials in Brussels, a military committee of senior defense chiefs from participating countries to advise them, and eventually a permanent military staff in Brussels to plan and coordinate military operations in the field, this official said.
While there is growing consensus on the need for Europe to restructure its defenses, many of the European allies are actually cutting military spending. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen criticized Germany today for spending only 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense.
"The decisions Germany makes in the next few months and years will have a profound and lasting impact on the capabilities, not only of this nation, but of the alliance as a whole," he said in Hamburg.
Officials in Washington and at NATO headquarters in Brussels fear that the new push for an independent European military arm will divert resources and attention from NATO.
The German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, did not address the spending issue in a speech at the French Military Academy in Paris on Tuesday, but said reorganized armies that were more easily deployable would strengthen the European contribution to NATO. "In the transatlantic alliance, we don't have too much America, we have too little Europe," he said.
His French counterpart, Alain Richard, added, "The emergence of a true European defense pillar will help make the alliance better able to adapt to the requirements of new missions -- and make it stronger, because it will be more balanced."
At their side, Britain's armed forces minister, John Spellar, said, "We have to accept that Europe has not been pulling its weight in its own backyard." He added, "We must be clear that NATO is the cornerstone of our defense and security policy."
The European Union recently appointed Javier Solana, NATO's former secretary general, as its defense and security coordinator, and French officials said he would preside over the development of the new European defense institutions that could emerge if neutral European Union members like Sweden, Austria and Ireland agree next week to let the others go ahead with closer cooperation on defense.
The push was accelerated by the European allies' realization during the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo this year that they had nothing like the ability of the United States to move hundreds of fighter-bombers to the theater of operations, use sophisticated satellite technology to guide bombs to their targets, and neutralize Serbian antiaircraft defenses -- even though the conflict was less than an hour's flying time from their own territories.
Stung by the realities of how little military muscle they could actually bring to bear in a crisis after they reached agreement on a common policy, European Union leaders decided last June on the need to set up their own defense arm.
One reason they were able to agree was that the British prime minister, Tony Blair, had concluded from the earlier European debacle in Bosnia, where fighting ended only after the United States and NATO finally weighed in in 1995, that if Europe was to deal with similar crises in the future it would have to have the ability to act even without the United States.
The Finnish proposal for the European meeting includes measures to try to reassure the United States, Canada, Turkey and other NATO countries outside the European Union.
French officials also said they were working to reassure neutral European Union members that no country would be compelled to participate in a military action.

HEADLINE: G.M. and DaimlerChrysler Report Weak Monthly Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1

 BODY:
General Motors and DaimlerChrysler announced November sales figures today that were weaker than expected as American automakers continued to lose market share to Japanese rivals, who posted big gains.
G.M. said its sales in the United States inched up just one-tenth of a percent last month compared with figures in the period a year earlier, several percentage points worse than expected, while DaimlerChrysler said its sales fell 1.3 percent last month, marginally worse than expected. But Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and particularly Nissan Motor all reported large increases, while sales for Mitsubishi Motors more than doubled. 
 Japanese automakers have been trouncing G.M. in particular in the car market lately while introducing new minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks in an assault on the American automakers' most profitable niche.
The weak results for G.M. and DaimlerChrysler put pressure on them to offer more rebates and other discounts, which will tend to erode profits. "It's still a sign of deceleration in consumer interest, and it'll take incentives to bring that back," said David M. Garrity, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
While the Ford Motor Company is not scheduled to release its sales figures until Thursday, auto analysts said today's statistics showed that the market had slowed from a torrid pace during the summer and early autumn to a merely brisk pace in November. Mr. Garrity estimated that the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales had slowed during November to roughly 16.6 million automobiles from an average of 17.2 million in the six previous months.
But G.M. and DaimlerChrysler's sales were virtually flat compared with November of last year, when the market was running at an annual pace of only 15.4 million automobiles. That suggests that foreign automakers are capturing most of the growth in the market and that when the final numbers are tallied late Thursday, both automakers will show sharp drops in market share.
Ford, which has introduced several popular car models, like the Lincoln LS and Ford Focus, is expected to post a modest increase in sales but may still lose a little of its market share. But with G.M.'s share plunging, Ford could draw even with the world's largest automaker in the months ahead, something it has not done since the 1930's except during strikes at G.M.
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director of market analysis, said the company was focused on selling more high-profit models, like sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, and on selling fewer vehicles in general to rental companies and other commercial fleets, which tend to demand huge discounts. A rising proportion of G.M.'s sales are to families and other retail buyers, he said, adding, "market share is not the only metric for us as a corporation."
But Mr. Ballew acknowledged that G.M.'s market share in November fell short of the company's target of 30 percent. Analysts said it appeared to have plunged below 28 percent. While G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler are able to keep all their factories open because the overall market is so strong, and they are making large profits from the sale of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, eroding market shares could hurt them in the next economic downturn.
Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and marketing, said he was satisfied with the November results. DaimlerChrysler's sales of minivans, a class of vehicles that the company invented in 1983 and has dominated ever since, dropped 6 percent last month. He said this was to be expected given that other automakers had introduced rival models and that DaimlerChrysler's models were in their last year before a redesign.
While an annual rate of 15 million automobiles was considered good until the last several years, automakers have recently become accustomed to better results and are likely to increase rebates and other discounts as each maker tries to keep its factories running at full capacity. The level of discounts in the auto industry has receded somewhat after a peak in September but is already starting to rise again, with G.M. beginning to offer low interest rates on some versions of its full-sized pickups, one of its most profitable markets.
Rebates have also grown for minivans, while cars of virtually all sizes have long carried heavy discounts.
Helped by the success of the Honda Odyssey minivan, Honda's sales climbed 2.2 percent. Toyota's sales were up 11.3 percent; Nissan's were up 14.7 percent, and Mitsubishi's soared 156 percent with the popularity of the new Eclipse coupe and discounts on the Montero Sport, a sport utility vehicle.
Auto executives and dealers have been keeping a wary eye on rising gasoline prices, wondering when they will start to hurt sales, particularly of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups. But so far the effect on sales seems limited, possibly because the increase has been gradual and has been accompanied by many predictions that further increases are unlikely.

HEADLINE: World Bank Economist Felt He Had to Silence His Criticism or Quit

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
For Joseph E. Stiglitz, the choice was stark: Either silence his criticism of global economic policies as practiced in Washington or resign as chief economist at the World Bank. He resigned, and in doing so focused attention on the uncertain role of academic economists in positions of power.
As Mr. Stiglitz sees it, Washington has failed to keep pace with the latest thinking on sustaining growth in developing nations. There is an "intellectual gap between what we know," he said in an interview, "and what is still practiced" at the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund. 
 Yet there is an inherent tension in Mr. Stiglitz's position. As the World Bank's chief economist, he has had a seat at the policy-making table. The World Bank, in effect, has helped to make the decisions that Mr. Stiglitz criticizes, an unusual role for an insider. Nevertheless, James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's president, openly supported Mr. Stiglitz in his views -- voicing criticism publicly only once, in October. Mr. Stiglitz's dissents generated an unusual amount of debate over the proper policies for the global economy, particularly after much of Asia, joined later by Russia, Brazil, and other developing countries, plunged into turmoil shortly after Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Stiglitz joined the World Bank.
"It has become obvious to me that it would be difficult to continue to speak out as forcefully and publicly as I have on a variety of issues and still remain as chief economist," Mr. Stiglitz said. "Rather than muzzle myself, or be muzzled, I decided to leave."
His premature departure, announced last Wednesday and effective on Jan. 1, removes from Washington the most outspoken critic of the practices that the big industrial nations favor in their relations with the developing world. Those practices emphasize open markets, unrestricted borrowing from foreign lenders, rapid privatization, balanced budgets, a minimal government role and various austerity measures when crises strike.
Mr. Stiglitz, who has been the leader in developing theories that challenge standard economic policy, also emphasizes open markets. But he argues that markets on their own frequently fall short of the promised prosperity, and a little government intervention can usually improve the outcome.
The Treasury and the I.M.F., for example, insisted that the East Asian countries in difficulty raise interest rates to restore investor confidence. Higher rates scare investors, Mr. Stiglitz replied, and produce recessions that are more damaging than if governments held rates down. Controls on short-term lending from abroad became another point of contention. Mr. Stiglitz contends that developing countries should limit such loans to avoid the huge defaults and devaluations that can occur when foreign lenders lose confidence and demand repayment, precipitating a crisis. But even after that happened in East Asia, policymakers frowned on setting limits on short-term lending, although they are more open to the practice now.
"The Stiglitz group represents one of the most important innovations in economics in the last 100 years," said Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, who has altered his own views as a result of the Stiglitz influence. Mr. Arrow's early research, emphasizing the efficiency of a laissez-faire market system, had helped him to win a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1972.
But Mr. Stiglitz's style is another matter. It raises the question, in Mr. Arrow's mind, of what an economist who takes a job in Washington should do when his expertise tells him that policy decisions are bad economics. Should he go public, or should he confine his disagreement to closed- door discussions with other officials and then, once the decision is made, remain silent?
The 56-year-old Mr. Stiglitz, who came to Washington from Stanford University, is the most prominent example in this decade of the outspoken approach. Two other top economists in government represent the opposite style, publicly endorsing official policy and indeed formulating much of it. They are Lawrence H. Summers, the Treasury secretary who came to Washington from Harvard University, and Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s first deputy managing director and formerly of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Both sent word through aides that they were not available to comment. Among economists, speculation had circulated for weeks that Mr. Summers had pressed Mr. Wolfensohn to silence Mr. Stiglitz. Amid official denials of any such behind-the-scenes moves, Mr. Stiglitz said that he had come to the conclusion that he could no longer continue to speak out bluntly and remain at the World Bank.
"In a sense, there was a question of personal and professional integrity," Mr. Stiglitz said. "Remaining silent when people were pursuing wrong ideas would have been a form of complicity."
Mr. Arrow, while intellectually leaning toward Mr. Stiglitz's views, has mixed feelings about public dissents. "You certainly want debate, and you cannot always have it behind closed doors," he said. "But you cannot do one policy and have the world on notice that you might switch to another. It is very hard to define the rules of this game."
Olivier Blanchard, an M.I.T. economist, is more definite. "Much of the content of the Stiglitz message, the role and the complexity of institutions needed to make markets work, is something that most of us feel at ease with," he said, "But the style has some of us unhappy. The issue is not lose the message, but do it in a way that is more productive politically. That is an aspect that Joe has ignored."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Stiglitz disagrees. Less visible, more diplomatic dissent is suitable, he says, when there is time for gradual change. But "it became very clear to me that working from the inside was not leading to responses at the speed at which responses were needed," he said. And when dealing with policies "as misguided as I believe these policies were, you have to either speak out or resign."
Mr. Stiglitz's departure from the World Bank came sooner than he had anticipated. His appointment as chief economist would have come up for renewal in February and he had said that he intended to remain in Washington at least until his youngest child graduates from high school next June. He plans now to join a Washington research center in January -- he has not decided which one -- and return to Stanford in the fall.
He will not sever all his ties with the World Bank. Mr. Wolfensohn has asked him to head a search committee for a new chief economist. Mr. Wolfensohn praised Mr. Stiglitz last week for moving the bank away from the market-oriented "Washington consensus." Indeed, with Mr. Wolfensohn's support, Mr. Stiglitz had gone public with criticism of official policy far more than he had while working for President Clinton as a member of his Council of Economic Advisers and then as the council's chairman.
But last fall for the first time, Mr. Wolfensohn criticized his chief economist publicly, stating that Mr. Stiglitz's views on Russian privatization were "not wholly correct."
With encouragement from the West, Mr. Stiglitz says, Russia privatized state companies too rapidly, counting on market forces to discipline their behavior. But laws and institutions were needed first to prevent powerful shareholders from channeling corporate wealth into their own pockets.
Mr. Stiglitz's solution fits his modus operandi: economically sound but politically difficult. The Russian government, he says, should re-acquire the companies, just as the American government takes control of a failed bank or seizes corporate assets for nonpayment of taxes. The privatization process could then be restarted, he said, "but gradually and in the proper sequence."

HEADLINE: 2 Drug Companies to Combine Troubled Agricultural Units

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
AstraZeneca P.L.C. and Novartis A.G., the world's two largest drug companies, plan to merge their troubled agricultural divisions and spin them off in a deal valued at more than $15 billion, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday.
The announcement, which could come as early as today, would create the world's largest agricultural company with sales of $8.3 billion. Analysts had long expected AstraZeneca and Novartis to combine their agricultural operations, given the depressed state of the industry. 
 "I really like this combination," said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners in New York. "Both companies have said that they were looking for something to do with their agricultural divisions. The two companies' agricultural products fit together well."
Analysts said yesterday that the spinoff of the two agricultural divisions would enable both companies to concentrate on their core businesses. After Zeneca acquired Astra earlier this year, the combined company, which is based in London, was left with an agricultural unit that did not fit with its enormous drug division.
Novartis had tried to become a life-sciences company, with holdings in pharmaceuticals, food and agricultural products, but found out the similarities between the three divisions was not as great as the company had first thought.
Both companies declined to comment yesterday.
Yet analysts in Europe and the United States said they expected Novartis to acquire a pharmaceutical company in the United States within the next several months, if not sooner.
In an interview last month, Dr. Daniel Vasella, the chief executive of Novartis, said that his company could benefit from a greater presence in the United States. Despite being the second-largest drug seller, Novartis was ranked ninth last year in prescription drug sales in the United States by I.M.S. Health, an industry consultant.
Analysts had thought that Novartis, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, would make a hostile bid for American Home Products because the two companies had similar strategies. But during the last several days, analysts have begun to speculate that Novartis may try to buy Eli Lilly or Schering-Plough.
"Novartis's selling off its agricultural division is only the beginning," Mr. Traversa said. "Novartis will definitely do something else."
Regardless of other deals AstraZeneca and Novartis make, their combined agricultural unit is a global powerhouse. The combined division would have $6.5 billion in worldwide crop-protection sales -- well ahead of its nearest competitor -- and $1 billion in seed sales.
AstraZeneca and Novartis could face some antitrust problems. Their combined agricultural division would have worldwide market share of about 24 percent, analysts said. Monsanto, one of the leading American agricultural companies, has market share of about 13 percent.
Mr. Traversa said late yesterday that he thought the divestitures the companies would have to make would not be that substantial because the product lines meshed well together. He noted that Novartis was not a large seller of fungicides, which is one of AstraZeneca's leading businesses.
The spinoff of the agricultural divisions is an abrupt shift in strategy for the pharmaceutical industry. Just two years ago, many pharmaceutical companies were strengthening their agricultural holdings to offset a possible downturn in their prescription drug businesses.
The worldwide agricultural market began to experience troubles in Southeast Asia and Europe, leading many analysts to project a 3 percent drop in worldwide agricultural sales this year. Executives at Novartis and AstraZeneca soon decided that they wanted to concentrate on pharmaceuticals, which have a much higher profit margin than agricultural products.
Novartis had taken drastic steps to improve the profitability of its agricultural unit. Earlier this year, the company announced that it would cut 1,100 jobs from its agricultural division, about 6 percent of its 18,000 workers.

HEADLINE: AT&T and Charter Plan Cable Swaps

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The AT&T Corporation, soon to be the largest United States cable television company, and Charter Communications Inc. said yesterday that they would swap cable systems serving about 1.3 million customers as they consolidate their regional service areas.
Charter said it would take over AT&T Broadband and Internet Services cable systems serving 704,000 customers in St. Louis and communities in three other states. AT&T will get Charter systems serving 632,000 customers in Fort Worth and five other states besides Texas, plus an undisclosed amount of cash. 
 AT&T is investing billions to buy and upgrade cable networks for use in delivering local and long-distance phone service, video programming and high-speed Internet access. The company, which is based in New York, paid $59.4 billion to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. in March, and has agreed to pay $62.5 billion for MediaOne Group.
Charter, based in St. Louis and controlled by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, wants to expand its holdings in Missouri and Illinois to gain operating efficiencies and economies of scale.
The proposed swap between Charter and AT&T is subject to regulatory approval, which is expected to take several months, the companies said.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Carrying the Flag For Free Trade;
Brazil Still Embraces Globalization

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Acquiring a telephone was a distant dream for Rene Vieira da Conceicao Muniz, a maid in a small town in southeast Brazil. The government's inefficient telecommunications monopoly made telephone lines a luxury of the upper classes, far from the reach of Ms. Muniz, a mother of three whose monthly salary is the equivalent of $57.
But the privatization last year of Brazil's phone system, part of a much wider opening of the nation's economy to foreign investment, trade and competition from abroad, has changed the situation. Two months ago, Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications company that bought the local telephone operation in Ms. Muniz's region, began an installment plan for low-income clients to buy cellular phones over several months. 
 "Before, I would have had to save for many years to get a phone," Ms. Muniz, 31, said, "and then it would have cost 2,000 reais," or about $1,036, compared with the $150 she will spend for her cell phone. Recently, the local priest called her to see if she was available to clean twice a month for about $10. "My life is hard, but it is better," she said. "My dream now is to buy a computer for my son."
Brazil, one of the biggest emerging-market members of the World Trade Organization, points to itself as an example of the positive economic change that can come from policies advocated by the 135-nation group. And despite the financial turmoil that struck this nation earlier this year, Brazil remains committed to freer trade and globalization as the best way to improve the standard of living of ordinary people.
The anti-trade protests this week at the W.T.O.'s meeting in Seattle have focused attention on what critics call the evils caused by free trade -- economic disruptions, environmental degradation, exploitation of cheap labor by rich multinational corporations. But advocates of open markets argue that most developing countries that have joined the W.T.O. are better off than before and note that the largest emerging-market country, China, is about to join the organization in a move aimed at lifting itself up the next rung of the economic ladder.
Before the opening of Brazil's economy, the availability of basic technological services to people beyond an urban elite was virtually unthinkable. The government in Brasila was unable to invest in such things as it scrambled to deal with the more pressing priority of hyperinflation. And officials were wary that the entry of foreign investment threatened national sovereignty.
Then, in a policy shift at the start of the 1990's, Brazil took the first steps toward embracing the global economy. It began by auctioning several state companies and lowering many of its steep import tariffs. Barriers to the entry of goods ranging from Compaq personal computers to artificial flowers to Harley-Davidson motorcycles were reduced. With the onset of a more competitive marketplace, the first Brazilian multinational corporations were groomed and began to prosper.
Nowhere are the changes more apparent than in the country's consumer and business cultures.
As large swathes of Brazil's population of 165 million benefited from advances like the expansion of telephone service or were provided with an opportunity to buy imported goods, Brazilian business underwent a metamorphosis. Since 1996, Brazil has received $81 billion in direct investment from abroad, as foreign concerns took notice of the potential of the world's ninth-largest economy.
WEG, a company based in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, is a product of this new environment. Founded nearly 40 years ago in an enclave of descendants of German immigrants -- Weg is German for road -- the company, a producer of electric motors, embarked on a dizzying expansion spree in the 1990's. WEG is now the fifth-largest producer of electric motors, selling in markets from New Zealand to Mexico.
"We knew early on that to survive we had to become competitive abroad," said Decio da Silva, WEG's president. "That's why we were prepared when Brazil's own form of protectionism was eased."
Another example of a new generation's flexing its muscle abroad is Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, a privatized producer of small passenger jets. Strong sales in Europe and the United States transformed Embraer from a money-hemorrhaging state enterprise into Brazil's largest exporter.
In fact, Embraer's success has led to one of the W.T.O.'s most high-profile mediations of a trade dispute this year, as Bombardier, a Canadian competitor, accused the plane maker of benefiting from overly generous government subsidies. Embraer has tried to politicize the dispute by promoting itself as a symbol of Brazil's new industrial might.
Or there is Gerdau, a steel producer that has aggressively expanded through acquisitions in Latin America and North America. Thanks to companies like Gerdau, Brazil surpassed Canada last month as the largest supplier of foreign steel to the United States.
Of course, there is a flip side to this transformation, as free-trade opponents are quick to point out. In this city, for instance, not too far from the glimmering postmodern skyscrapers housing the local headquarters of large multinationals, there are neighborhoods like Barra Funda, a sprawling district of low-slung warehouses and old, abandoned brick factories. This is where Lorenzo Bertini has his office.
Three years ago, Mr. Bertini was the owner of Seda Flor Industria e Comercio, a company producing artificial flowers made with silk. He had a factory that employed 120 people. Then the government started to lower the tariffs on imported artificial flowers -- from 73 percent to 16 percent.
"You know how a wave wipes out a castle made of sand?," Mr. Bertini said. "That's what happened to us."
In an illustration of how Brazil's opening has added to unemployment problems, especially in cities like Sao Paulo, Mr. Bertini's company has only 10 employees. He closed his factory and now runs a wholesale operation from a converted warehouse, selling flowers imported from countries like Thailand and South Korea.
Like Mr. Bertini's company, some Brazilian companies that have come under strain are struggling to reinvent themselves. And many have failed in the current economic downturn, helping to push unemployment close to a 14-year high.
Nonetheless, public support for freer trade appears to be growing. For instance, in a recent poll conducted by a Sao Paulo newspaper, most respondents were in favor of opening the airline industry to foreign competition if that would bring ticket prices down.
"Brazilians at large are very friendly to the opening efforts," said Gustavo Franco, a former president of the central bank and one of Brazil's leading economic thinkers. "A constituency supporting liberalization has been created, and it is not averse to voicing its concerns."
Still, Brazil has a long way to go before thoroughly reaping the rewards of free trade. Brazil's share of world trade is still relatively tiny, accounting for only nine-tenths of a percent of the world's exports. Mexico, with an economy about half the size of Brazil's, accounts for 2 percent of the world's exports. While exports of goods and services account for 6 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product, they represent 26 percent of G.D.P. in nearby Chile.
To increase exports, Brazil, with the backing of the United States, is pressing Europe and Japan to ease restrictions on the entry of agricultural goods. That would help Brazil, as the world's largest coffee producer and the second-largest producer of soybeans, to expand its share of the foreign market for such basics. Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, Brazil's agriculture minister, said this was the least the rich industrialized countries can do after Brazil opened its economy to so much foreign investment.
For the time being, though, it seems Brazilians are content to continue linking with a global consumer culture. This year, for instance, McDonald's became Brazil's largest private-sector employer. Or there is the Brazilian experience of Harley-Davidson, another icon of globalization.
Four years ago, Brazil unilaterally increased tariffs on imported motorcycles above 70 percent. After United States trade representatives pressed their Brazilian counterparts, the government agreed to reduce the tariff to less than 20 percent. Subsequently strong sales led Harley to build its first assembly plant outside of the United States, in the Amazonian city of Manaus.

HEADLINE: TALKS AND TURMOIL: THE HOSTS;
Seattle Is Stung, Angry and Chagrined as Opportunity Turns to Chaos

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Police officers and unarmed National Guard troops imposed a tense version of order to downtown Seattle today. About 40 blocks were sealed off from any demonstrations, more than 400 protesters were under arrest, and the windows of some of the city's most fashionable stores and coffee shops were smashed or boarded up. Parts of the city's center remained under a nighttime curfew.
This evening, as tear gas wafted in the streets near the city's venerable Pike Place Market, a simple question was on the lips of many people, especially angry merchants: why, exactly, did we decide to be the host of these global trade talks? 
 Seattle's political and business leaders exulted when the city was chosen early this year as the venue for the meeting of the World Trade Organization. They cast it as a fantastic opportunity for one of the country's most trade-dependent regions, home to huge exporters like Boeing and Microsoft, to show itself off as a friend to global trade.
And even when environmental and labor groups started announcing that they would descend on Seattle en masse to demonstrate their opposition to the trade organization, city leaders presented that as an opportunity. Mayor Paul Schell, noting that the city had a strong union history and a tolerance for diverse views, said Seattle would offer itself as "a model for creative debate" over trade issues.
But the mayor -- a genial lawyer, former director of community development and dean of the University of Washington's school of architecture and urban planning -- today seemed as shell-shocked as anyone.
"This administration has people who marched in the 1960's. The last thing I wanted was to be mayor of a city that called in the National Guard," he said as reporters demanded to know why the city wasn't better prepared to head off the violence that hit downtown.
The destruction was carried out Tuesday with near-impunity by a relatively small gang of self-proclaimed anarchists while the police were using tear gas nearby to contain what had been a largely peaceful protest near the convention hall where the world trade group delegates were to meet.
Many Seattle residents were simply befuddled by it all. "I mean, here we are, in what is supposed to be the happiest, mellowest city on the planet, and look what's happening," said Charles Rowin, a 40-year-old technical support worker for a computer company, who came to watch protests Tuesday and wound up with welts on his leg, elbow and buttocks from rubber pellets the police used to disperse the crowd. "I'm a lifelong native of this city, and I simply can't believe what I'm seeing."
The Seattle police declined to quantify just how much tear gas had been used, or to say how extensively officers had used rubber pellets, which a police spokesman, David Ellithorpe, said officers were authorized to use "in order to encourage people to disperse."
Several protesters were hit by the pellets, and have bruises on their hands or legs to show for it. Mr. Ellithorpe said the round, marble-sized pellets "leave a welt or a stinging sensation" but he insisted that they cause less extensive damage than rubber-coated bullets used elsewhere in the world.
Merchants, just beginning the most important period of their year, were clearly enraged.
"It seems like the police were everywhere except where the real looting was going on, and I just don't understand that," said Phil Pickens, the manager of a Planet Hollywood store on 6th Avenue. "They were containing the peaceful people while the anarchists were going crazy."
Mr. Pickens said he thought it was "ridiculous" that Seattle had so eagerly sought the trade meeting, and many other merchants in the downtown area seemed to agree.
The city's deputy police chief, Ed Joiner, said today that the city had made intensive preparations to handle the expected thousands of protesters, but had not anticipated that vandals would get out of hand.
"We had a plan in place to accommodate a large protest and to help trade delegates get to their meetings," he said at a news conference. "Obviously," he added, "it didn't work."
Mayor Schell, who on Tuesday had described Seattle as a "gentle city, open to ideas," was somewhat more defensive of the city's overall approach to handling the protesters, whom he numbered at 35,000 and of whom, he said, the "vast majority" were peaceful.
"We had a difficult choice," he said in an interview. "We considered creating perimeter areas that would have kept all demonstrators out and created martial law" -- a phrase that led one of his aides to quickly interrupt him and suggest there was a better term. "And it would have required thousands of troops and made the demonstrators even angrier," the mayor continued. "Instead, it's a triumph of free speech. The issues are on the agenda, and today the talks are going on. Sometimes democracy is a little messy."
Many of the protesters turned out today with brooms and rags to try to clean up the damage, which they condemned.
"It was a tiny group that did this, but I think we all have to take responsibility for it and try to clean up the city," said Ethan Hughes, a 29-year-old biology teacher from Gloucester, Mass. He was dressed in a large gray squirrel suit, the same costume he chose for the mass protest on Tuesday, and today he was down on his hands and knees near the Bon Marche department store, picking up tiny shards of glass and scrubbing away graffiti. "I'm telling you, for each person doing any looting, there were a bunch of superheroes trying to stop it," said Mr. Hughes. "This is a movement for the common man, and no one who really cares about that would ever want it to get out of hand the way it did."
Still, others remained angry that the police did not find a way to separate the criminals from the lawful protesters. "I really thought I had a right to free speech," said Cindy Long, a high-school Spanish teacher from Federal Way, Wash. "Instead I feel like I'm being treated like a criminal down here."
Publicly, Clinton administration officials and those in the American trade delegation declined to criticize the Seattle police. "We're in no position to try to second-guess what was done," said Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman. But privately, officials said they were angry that assurances from Seattle that the city could handle protests proved futile.
Despite predictions from city officials that the conference would be a shot in the arm for Seattle's economy, many merchants said they just wanted it to end. And many said they were trying to figure out ways to lure customers back downtown.
"We did have a few customers in our store at the zenith of the chaos," said Vada O. Manager, a spokesman for Niketown, a block from the convention center, where the windows were boarded up and the facade spray-painted with anti-W.T.O. slogans. "They were pretty nervous. Because we believe in people first, we gave them gift certificates for the inconvenience."

HEADLINE: Anxious French Mutter as U.S. Envoy Tries to Sell Globalism

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Felix G. Rohatyn, the American ambassador to France, knew what he would get when the mayor of a tiny village that makes its living off Roquefort cheese called on him the day before Thanksgiving: an earful.
Mayor Philippe Folliot of St.-Pierre-de-Trivisy demanded to know why the United States had retaliated against Europe's ban on imports of American beef treated with hormones by slapping such high customs duties on Roquefort, among other European luxury products, that farmers in his village might soon see prices for their ewes' milk fall by 15 percent. 
 "He gave me a sensible, reasoned, firm protest about what this huge country was doing to his little village and his local product, for reasons which had nothing to do with the people who lived there," recalled Mr. Rohatyn, a former investment banker who now finds himself trying to explain the rules of the road of free trade to a nation that views globalization as the ultimate American takeover threat.
"I told him we were both victims," he said. "The United States was a victim of a European beef boycott that had gone on despite six years of talks, so that the World Trade Organization had said we were entitled to impose sanctions. And his village was also one of the victims of the beef boycott. But it was no pleasure for me to say that to him."
Understanding how Europeans feel about America has become a tricky business, with France leading the muttering chorus of anxiety about the absence of any real counterweight to American economic, technological and military power.
When he came here as ambassador two years ago, Mr. Rohatyn thought a lifetime of business contacts in France and the United States had equipped him to allay those fears in Europe and explain them to his fellow Americans. But as his last year as President Clinton's envoy begins, Mr. Rohatyn believes that the gap between Americans and Europeans is widening. "Now I sense a feeling that the very existence of the United States, and our enormous weight in the world, are causing a threat to their identity, making it absolutely necessary from their point of view to counter what they see as a menace to their culture and their society," he said.
"France has always been a very strong ally of the United States, and so it was during the NATO bombing of Kosovo, a war which we fought with Europe and for European values," he went on. "When that war ended, it should have strengthened ties between us. Instead, the French have a feeling of enormous anxiety."
Kosovo made President Jacques Chirac and many other European leaders, including Mr. Clinton's friend Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, acutely aware of Europe's military shortcomings and determined to rectify them.
At the same time, Mr. Chirac and many other Europeans are increasingly concerned by what they see as a new temptation in America not to withdraw from the rest of the world, but rather to impose American values and policies globally because the United States has power that no other country can match.
The danger of this new American "hyper-power," as the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, calls it, was symbolized by the United States Senate's rejection of the global Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons in October. French anxiety has also grown because of the Clinton administration's wish to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so that the United States can build a system to shoot down incoming missiles from "rogue states" like Iraq or North Korea.
"We must avoid any weakening of the ABM treaty that could lead to a rupture of strategic equilibrium and start a new nuclear arms race," Mr. Chirac told an international audience in Paris in early November.
Ambassador Rohatyn protested: "We can't be both hegemonic and isolationist. What the French are really concerned about is what they define as unilateralism, which also explains why they react the way they do to trade sanctions."
Another reason is continuing French and European economic insecurity in the face of an American economy with full employment, while Europe is still suffering from double-digit jobless rates that are often blamed on high welfare-state taxes and restrictive labor laws.
Whether because of or despite those obstacles, French industry has shed its image of bloated ineffiency during the last few years and become among the most competitive in the world, Mr. Rohatyn said. And Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led government, continuing the policies of its conservative predecessors, has gone ahead with partial privatization of banks, telecommunications and even defense industries that were nationalized in the 1980's.
But there is still a defensive tone to French public discussion of things like the opening of talks on a new round of world trade negotiations this week in Seattle.
Mr. Rohatyn said Seattle represents to the French "globalization with an American face, when what we all need, as President Clinton put it recently, is to put a human face on globalization."
So the ambassador keeps trying to convince the French that they have nothing to fear from globalization. European companies have about $1 trillion invested in factories and installations in the United States and about 3 million people working for them, roughly the same investment and employment as American companies have in Europe, he says. But French mistrust of the stock market runs high, and so the ownership of 30 to 40 percent of the French stock market by Anglo-American financial institutions like pension funds is seen as yet another threat instead of a welcome infusion of capital.
"In the regions, people think differently," he said. "Toulouse is an aerospace city, a combination of Silicon Valley and Southern California, where business activity is paramount and where I think there is much more admiration for the American model and less of a distancing from it."
So during Mr. Rohatyn's tenure, the United States Embassy here has tried to get closer to Europeans who live in villages like Mayor Folliot's by opening small "American presence posts" in the more important regional cities.
These "low-cost, high-tech mini-consulates," as he described them, now exist in Lyon and Rennes, and he will open a new one in Toulouse this week, with hopes for others in Lille and Bordeaux next year.
But one question remains. "How do you handle extraordinarily dominant power and influence, in a world where inevitably you need allies, you need friends, and you really can't and don't want to run it alone, and yet protect your vital interests and not seem like a bully?" Mr. Rohatyn asked. "I don't know the answer."
Mayor Folliot had a modest suggestion. "I told the ambassador, 'Drop the extra duty on Roquefort and we'll drop the surtax we put on Coca-Cola in St.-Pierre-de-Trivisy,' " he said. "I invited him to come down for a visit the day it happened, and he said he'd accept."

HEADLINE: Justices Skeptical of U.S. Effort For Jurisdiction Over Cigarettes

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
The Clinton administration faced a notably skeptical Supreme Court today as it tried to persuade the justices that the Food and Drug Administration has jurisdiction over tobacco and the authority to regulate cigarettes as "drug delivery devices."
The crowded courtroom became, for an intense hour, the current battleground in the tobacco wars that have swept through Congress and presidential politics. But the familiar policy arguments took second place to a prolonged dissection of food and drug law. 
 Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman labored to demonstrate that the regulations the F.D.A. issued in 1996, which were struck down last year by a federal appeals court, fit comfortably within the agency's core public health mission. The regulations placed restrictions on cigarette sales and advertising aimed at those under the age of 18.
Richard M. Cooper, a former general counsel of the Food and Drug Administration, now representing the five cigarette makers that challenged the regulations, said the agency's action was "lawless" in the absence of an explicit Congressional grant of authority.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who observed several times that regulating smoking "just doesn't fit" within the agency's statutory authority, asked Mr. Waxman whether under his theory the agency could regulate horror movies "because so many people go to them to get scared and get their adrenaline pumping."
When the solicitor general replied that "no one is suggesting" that the Food and Drug Administration regulate movies, guns and the like, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist interrupted to observe that "30 years ago, no one suggested" that the agency had authority over cigarettes.
A significant hurdle for the administration was the fact that for nearly its entire history, from its establishment under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 until the mid-1990's, the agency said it had no authority to regulate smoking.
Mr. Waxman's position is that the agency changed its mind in the face of new and "overwhelming evidence" that nicotine is addictive and that cigarette manufacturers "knew this and were engineering their products to deliver the precise dose of nicotine that consumers need to obtain its effects."
The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines a drug as a substance, other than food, "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body." So evidence not only of nicotine's properties but of the manufacturers' intent to exploit those effects was crucial to the agency's late-day re-evaluation, Mr. Waxman said.
But his point, although he made it repeatedly, appeared lost on the justices. "Wasn't it clear in 1938, even much earlier," that smoking was harmful, Justice Antonin Scalia wanted to know. Even in the early 1900's, there was a movement among the states to ban smoking, he said. "Why wasn't the surgeon general's report fully enough?" Justice Scalia added, referring to the 1964 study that documented the health effects of smoking.
Another major hurdle for the administration appeared to be the F.D.A.'s choice to regulate smoking rather than ban it. For a drug or medical device to be marketed with the agency's approval, it must be proven "safe" and "effective," with the health benefits for those who use it outweighing any risks.
The industry has argued that in light of that regulatory structure and of the agency's determination that cigarettes are not safe, it must ban them if it has jurisdiction over them at all, a step with such drastic economic and social policy implications that the agency must be able to point to explicit Congressional authorization to exercise such power.
This was essentially the conclusion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, which ruled against the agency's jurisdiction in a 2-to-1 decision in August 1998.
Mr. Waxman said today that while the agency might eventually decide to ban cigarettes, it had decided that a better approach for now was to try to keep those under the age of 18 from starting to smoke while not interfering with older smokers, "a majority of whom are addicted." The agency had concluded that letting people in that group keep smoking was safer for them than a total ban, he said.
Justice O'Connor was unpersuaded. "It strains credibility to say that these products can be safe," she said, adding, "I just don't understand how someone can stand here and say that." If the agency had jurisdiction, it would have no choice but to impose a ban, she said, "but we've certainly operated for a long time with the understanding that this wasn't covered."
Perhaps the most devastating response to the solicitor general's presentation came from Justice David H. Souter, who offered Mr. Waxman a long summary of the arguments. Justice Souter said the solicitor general had "in large part answered" many of the technical legal issues in the case but that "the global problem" still remained of whether Congress had given the agency the power it now claimed.
"It does not seem to me reasonable at this point for the government to assert jurisdiction," Justice Souter said.
By the time Mr. Cooper, representing the industry, began his half-hour at the podium, his work appeared largely accomplished. But not in all respects. He apparently failed to convince Justice Stephen G. Breyer with his assertion that the agency could only establish a manufacturer's "intent" by pointing to specific health claims made for a product. Since no such claims are made for cigarettes, there is no basis for F.D.A. regulation, Mr. Cooper said.
"The unusual thing here is that we have a product that everyone knows what it is," Justice Breyer said. "Why do you need a claim? Is the statute supposed to stop the F.D.A. from looking at the real world?" At another point, Justice Breyer said, "Smokers are no longer able to kid themselves about this -- that nicotine satisfies a craving caused by chemical addiction." That was the effect on the body that fit the definition of a drug, Justice Breyer suggested.
A colloquy with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg served as a platform for Mr. Cooper's arguments about the limits of the agency's jurisdiction. Justice Ginsburg asked whether heroin, if it were lawful, could be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
"If it doesn't purport to have a health benefit, it couldn't be regulated by the F.D.A.," Mr. Cooper said.
Justice Ginsburg asked, "Even if the product was harmful to health?"
Mr. Cooper, offering as an example household cleaning products that are dangerous when swallowed, said, "There are thousands of products that are harmful to health" that fall outside the agency's jurisdiction.
Justice Ginsburg rejected that example, asking for one in which "the core use is putting it into the body."
The agency has no jurisdiction over "street drugs," Mr. Cooper replied.
What about marijuana for which health benefits are claimed, Justice John Paul Stevens asked.
"Oh yes," Mr. Cooper said, with such claims, the agency could assert jurisdiction.
In rebuttal, Mr. Waxman said that limiting the agency's jurisdiction to products with explicit health claims would "revolutionize" food and drug law and create a huge regulatory loophole.
The regulations at issue in the case, Food and Drug Administration v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation, No. 98-1152, are based on the agency's conclusion that people who reach the age of 18 without smoking are unlikely to start. The regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to those under 18 and require retailers to check the identification of those under the age of 27.
The regulations at issue also included restrictions on advertising, which Judge William L. Osteen Sr. of Federal District Court in Greensboro, N.C., found in an earlier phase of the case to fall outside the agency's statutory authority. The Fourth Circuit consequently did not rule on the advertising restrictions, but if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the agency's jurisdiction, the tobacco industry has indicated it will challenge those restrictions on the grounds of free speech.
In addition to Brown and Williamson, the other plaintiffs in the case are Philip Morris Inc., the Lorillard Tobacco Company, the United States Tobacco Company and the National Association of Convenience Stores.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
For Bush's Rivals, a Big Chance Comes Tonight

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Mike Murphy, a strategist for Senator John McCain, cautions that there may not be fireworks on Thursday night when Gov. George W. Bush faces his rivals in debate for the first time.
"What you guys in the media want is a circus where Alan Keyes sets Orrin Hatch on fire, Gary Bauer starts screaming that Bush is a Chinese agent, and Steve Forbes tries to do a hat trick that fails, and Bush throws a pitcher of water at McCain," Mr. Murphy said. "It ain't going to happen." 
 But Bill Dal Col, the campaign manager for Mr. Forbes, is not so sure. He suggests that rambunctious Republicans, including his own candidate, are itching to gang up on Mr. Bush.
"Whoever doesn't engage Bush will be left on the sidelines," Mr. Dal Col said. "Bush is clearly the front-runner, and our primary process demands that whoever the front-runner is gets put through the test. What you've got to do is make sure you look like you're engaging on the issues" rather than on personalities.
While each of the Republican presidential campaigns has its own ambitions, expectations and strategies for Thursday night's nationally televised encounter, in Manchester, N.H., one point is beyond dispute: the event is serious business for the entire Republican field, because it brings Mr. Bush's first appearance on a national stage with his rivals.
The goal of the governor, striving to preserve his lead, will be not to do anything that will cause voters to believe he is not sufficiently learned or otherwise prepared to be president. His five competitors -- Messrs. McCain, Forbes, Hatch, Bauer and Keyes -- will do what they can to bring about a stumble.
"It's Bush's maiden appearance, and this is very much a test of his comfort level, his credibility, his nimbleness, his ability to think on his feet," said Brit Hume, the Fox News journalist who for 90 minutes will quiz the contenders with Karen Brown of WMUR-TV in Manchester.
Next to the attention on Mr. Bush, most of it will be focused on Mr. McCain, who has emerged in polls as the governor's chief rival in New Hampshire. Although Mr. Bush faces the most pressure, Mr. McCain, like the rest of the field, will have to grapple with the complicated task of trying to undermine him without making it look as if that is the purpose.
"Their challenge is to draw distinctions without being obnoxious," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta unaffiliated with any campaign. "I suspect it will be very high-minded and issues-based, because any ripping personal attack on Bush would backfire immediately."
Advisers to Mr. McCain said they saw no reason for a harsh frontal attack on Mr. Bush. But some said there was a chance that the senator would deal with campaign finance reform, which he has long championed, and use the issue to criticize the governor, who has raised more money than any other candidate in the history of presidential politics.
Mr. Forbes's advisers said he was likely to be blunt, after already lambasting Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plan today as too timid. Strategists from other campaigns said they expected Mr. Bauer, who is battling Mr. Forbes for the conservative mantle, to go after both Mr. Forbes and Mr. Bush on trade and China policy.
The format of the debate will allow little room for any debate at all. The candidates will be allotted 60 seconds to respond to questions from Mr. Hume and Ms. Brown, and 45 seconds to answer follow-up questions. (The campaigns drew lots tonight, and Mr. Bush will be the last to take a question when the program begins.) They will have no opportunity to question one another, unless, of course, they break the rules. The event will be broadcast live on the Fox News Channel.
Mr. Forbes told reporters he was disappointed that there would not be room for give-and-take, and blamed Mr. Bush. "The format is a very rigid one," he said here this afternoon. "All I know is that George W. Bush wanted that kind of format."
Members of the Bush team, clearly pleased with the structure, put rivals on notice to be nice.
"Because the opportunity for direct confrontation is limited," said Ralph Reed, an adviser to Mr. Bush, "those candidates who want to use the opportunity to lay a direct blow are in danger of looking like they're bruising for a fight."
The Bush camp's outward confidence contrasts with assorted moves the governor's advisers have taken to lower the stakes of the event. In part to respond to questions about his grip on foreign affairs and the economy, but also to deflect attention from the debate's approach, Mr. Bush's advisers scheduled several other high-profile appearances in the run-up to it.
Among other things, Mr. Bush appeared last week on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and also delivered a major foreign policy address. Today he announced his economic plan, which his team made a two-day story by offering details to the news media on Tuesday.
Mr. Hume, thinking up questions to ask on Thursday night, said he wanted to elicit responses that would make news. But he conceded that "the history of these debates is it's almost a complete crapshoot -- the most unexpected questions sometimes elicit the best moments."
Mr. Hume vowed not to go out of his way to trip up the candidates.
"You've got to be challenging, yet you've got to avoid cheap shots," he said. "I don't think I'm going to ask Bush who the top man in Turkmenistan is."
With a trace of mischief in his voice, he quickly added, "Kazakhstan, maybe."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Peace, love and Madison Avenue: TV marketers are embracing the sweeter side of the 60's.

BYLINE: By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
THE 1960's are back, compliments of Madison Avenue.
But the era evoked by several new TV commercials, some designed just for the holidays, is not the time of drug experimentation, of civil rights protests, antiwar marches and general unrest. 
 Instead -- understandably, at least from a marketing perspective -- the 60's getting all the attention is the clean-cut, early to middle part of the decade.
The most obvious takeoff is Amazon.com's holiday effort introduced on Nov. 15. It features a campy all-male chorus singing carols in matched cardigans on a set strongly reminiscent of the TV show "Sing Along With Mitch."
Dayton Hudson's Target stores has been running a campaign that uses its bull's-eye logo as a sort of optical illusion in commercials set to the song, "A Sign of The Times" sung by Petula Clark.
And, the Old Navy unit of Gap Inc. has a longtime kitschy campaign with a bit of a 60's production feel, featuring its spokeswoman Carrie Donovan, known in TV spots for her big round eyeglasses and 60's-style fashion exclamations.
And there are other less obvious examples: Gap's Banana Republic unit features a "togetherness" campaign with a bit of a 60's feel and some 60's-style film footage. Volkswagen's New Beetle campaign is also reminiscent of happy 60's advertising -- not to mention the popular car of the decade.
"My sense is we live in this brave, new ever-accelerating frenetic world, dominated by more and more products, massive choices and all these dot-coms screaming at you, and it's all bewildering to people," said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant based in Greenwich, Conn. "It's overtaxing people's minds, and there's this great wish to go back to a time when it was simpler."
It is also a fashion trend. Advertising is simply picking up what is already circulating in the culture, and that includes things like 1960's fashions and hairstyles, retro 60's furnishings and the popularity of the film character Austin Powers.
Like the fashion trend itself, the advertising that capitalizes on the 60's does so in a light-hearted way.
Bill Oberlander, executive creative director of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, an agency in New York, sees some parallels between 1999 and the 1960's, with both having great faith in progress and a strong economy.
"I consider the 90's to be much like the Camelot years; there's this feeling of stability, of good times, of America at its best," he said. "People are very optimistic right now, once we get past this Y2K blip."
The Amazon campaign is intended to convey that Amazon is the place to shop online for everything from toys to gifts. Created by the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, the spot is aimed at a broad audience, including many new online users, while still winking at the trendy young techies who embraced the site from the beginning.
Amazon felt that while some eras, like the bebop 1950's or disco 1970's, had been overused, the 1960's had barely been tapped.
"Older viewers connect with it instantly. They say it reminds them of watching the old variety shows like Lawrence Welk or Andy Williams, while younger adults just see it as fun and catchy and different," said Paul Capelli, a spokesman for Amazon.
Amazon also liked the low-tech feel of the spots juxtaposed against what is viewed as a high-tech product, he said. The commercials even carry the lyrics in a ribbon at the bottom of the screen.
Peterson Milla Hooks, a creative boutique in Minneapolis, came up with Target's "A Sign of The Times" campaign, said John Pellegrene, Target's executive vice president for marketing. Mr. Pellegrene had used Ms. Clark and her hit song in the 1960's when he worked for B. F. Goodrich.
"Back then we used it because it was the hit of the day and she was a big star," Mr. Pellegrene said. "This time, it's a fashion trend."
He noted that while the spot borrows from the 60's, it is updated with contemporary colors and styles that distinguish it from what you would see in 1964. Even the song was rearranged for the commercials.
A pitfall in latching onto advertising trends is that a campaign may not have a purpose beyond being fashionable, Mr. Trout said. Target's campaign, he said, works because it drives home the company's core message that its stores offer "mass with class." But he said it was not clear that Amazon's campaign clearly put across the message that it sells more than books.
"It's a visual distraction," he said, "and the problem with a visual distraction is that you stop listening. You don't hear the message, you just hear them singing this dumb song, and you're not telling me why you are better than the other cat."
In any case, the campaigns are likely to be as fleeting as any other style. Mr. Capelli said Amazon's campaign would run just through the holidays. Target will update its campaign for spring, but Mr. Pellegrene wasn't ready to say exactly how it would change.

HEADLINE: Bronx Father, 19, Is Charged In Beating Death of His Infant

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
A 19-year-old Bronx man who called the police after his infant son stopped breathing on Oct. 30 has been charged with beating the child to death, the authorities said yesterday.
Christian Rivera, the boy's father, was arrested Tuesday night after the New York City medical examiner determined that David Rivera, who was 2 months old, died of injuries he received on Oct. 30. 
 Mr. Rivera, of 1151 Elder Avenue in the Soundview section of the Bronx, was charged with second-degree murder, said Detective Robert Samuels, a Police Department spokesman.
Two other children who were living with Mr. Rivera and his wife were not harmed and have been placed with another family member, child welfare officials said.
According to detectives, Mr. Rivera called 911 at 9:45 p.m. on Oct. 30, saying his son was unconscious. Emergency medical workers took the child to Jacobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, the police said.
The results of the autopsy, which were released on Tuesday, determined that David died from a series of injuries to his head, chest and limbs, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner. In addition to bruises on his head and chest, David suffered from whiplash, apparently a result of being shaken, Ms. Borakove said.
Detectives said that Mr. Rivera, who is unemployed, does not live with the child's mother.
They did not say whether the mother was with Mr. Rivera at the time of the incident or whether he had custody of David.
Lenore Wiener, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services, said the agency had received no previous complaints about Mr. Rivera. The two other children, girls 2 and 5, who lived in the Elder Avenue apartment, have been placed with one of the girl's fathers while their mother receives counseling, Ms. Wiener said.
Neighbors in the six-story walkup where David died said that they rarely saw Mr. Rivera with his son and that soon after the child's death, Mr. Rivera moved out of the apartment. Last night, the superintendent was making repairs to the apartment, preparing it for a new tenant.

HEADLINE: Messages for the W.T.O.

 BODY:
Tuesday's street scene in Seattle -- the chanting demonstrators, the tear gas, the National Guard -- seemed a flashback to the 1960's. That the protests were aimed not at a divisive war but a peaceable meeting of the World Trade Organization made the whole thing even more surreal. The chaos conveyed a warning to both sides.
The violence and property destruction diverted attention from the basic point the demonstrators sought to make -- the need to reform the W.T.O.'s procedures and values. Protest leaders were right to condemn the lawlessness quickly. But the W.T.O.'s 135 members will make a huge mistake if they fail to grasp the core belief fueling these unruly protests -- that the W.T.O. is far too insular, that it has displayed too little sensitivity for issues like workers' rights and the environment, and that its secretive procedures undermine public trust. It is possible to agree with the W.T.O.'s goal of free trade, as this page does, and also to agree with President Clinton that the protesters' causes merit sympathy. 
 The W.T.O. can authorize retaliation against countries that impose unfair tariffs or engage in other discriminatory practices. But ever since its founding five years ago, the W.T.O. has operated in ways that encourage others to believe that it is some sort of cabal in thrall to finance ministers and large corporations. When one country challenges another's trade practices, for example, the cases are decided by panels of three trade experts whose deliberations are cloaked in secrecy. This is clearly a process that needs to be opened up to public view.
On the labor front, protesters want the W.T.O. to permit countries to impose trade sanctions on trade partners that use child labor or pay indecently low wages. Developing countries oppose such sanctions as protectionism aimed at products that provide jobs to their people. There is no easy resolution of this issue, because member nations do not agree on what labor-rights provisions should be set. As a sensible first step, Mr. Clinton has proposed that the W.T.O. set up a working group on labor issues to start the search for consensus.
On environmental issues, the mistrust is particularly strong. Environmentalists fear that world trade agreements threaten domestic sovereignty to impose tough environmental restrictions on imports, and they disagree sharply with several rulings by the W.T.O., notably involving trade restrictions designed to protect sea turtles and clean air.
Whatever the merits of any specific issue, it is important to note that the international trade laws that went into effect in 1995 cite environmental protection as a legitimate objective of a nation's trade laws, and judicial rulings confirm the need to balance environment and trade in W.T.O. decisions.
The lesson from the demonstrators this week is that future trade panels must not just talk about protecting the environment but actually do so. They have ample room for maneuver. Even in the controversial sea turtle and clean-air cases, the final judicial rulings were not against the principle of stringent environmental safeguards. The W.T.O. is now on notice that future panels should bend over backward to side with the environmental advocates when the cause is just and not a disguised form of protectionism.
If future panels do not protect environmental values, it may be necessary to set up separate tribunals to establish global environmental standards. Another step might be to reform the W.T.O. by strengthening its toothless environmental review group. In any case, all W.T.O. deliberations should be open. One way or another, vital issues affecting the health and prosperity of the planet deserve a visibly fair hearing.

HEADLINE: Bush Tax Cuts Are Assailed As Too Little or Too Much

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI with RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Dec. 1

 BODY:
As George W. Bush promoted tax cuts here with sweeping, populist language, his new plan came under sharp criticism today and prompted one of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes, to make some of his most pointed remarks about Mr. Bush to date.
Mr. Forbes, the wealthy publisher who has proposed a flat tax of 17 percent, characterized Mr. Bush's suggested tax cuts of $483 billion over five years as a timid capitulation to "politics as usual" that did not go nearly far enough. But Democrats and some tax analysts complained that Mr. Bush's plan went too far, and that it would benefit the wealthiest Americans the most. 
 Mr. Bush, in a speech here today, framed his proposal as an effort to grease the wheels of social mobility and provide relief to low-income families and single mothers groping for the next highest rung on the economic ladder.
"My plan sets out to make life better for average men and women and children," Mr. Bush said, adding that it would exempt one in every five American families with children from paying taxes. "We will take down the tollgate on the road to the middle class."
Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, also argued that tax cuts were necessary to sustain economic growth and ward off a recession. In a clear attempt to deny Democrats and the Clinton administration any credit for the booming economy, Mr. Bush traced the country's current prosperity to the tax cuts of the 1980's, when his father was vice president under President Ronald Reagan for eight years. Mr. Bush did not mention that after his father became president, he signed a tax increase.
"Putting more wealth in the hands of the earners and creators of wealth -- now, before the trouble comes -- would give our current expansion a timely second wind," Mr. Bush said.
His package of tax cuts would be larger than the tax cut passed by the Republican-led Congress last summer and vetoed by President Clinton, who called it irresponsible. Mr. Bush's plan would reduce tax rates across the income spectrum, lowering the highest rate to 33 percent from 39.6 percent and the lowest rate to 10 percent from 15 percent. It would double the child tax credit to $1,000 and phase out, over eight years, the inheritance tax on large estates.
In describing the plan today, Mr. Bush was seeking to further define what he means when he calls himself a compassionate conservative. But he immediately found himself under fire, from the right and left, for not being either conservative or compassionate enough.
Just three hours before Mr. Bush's midday speech, Mr. Forbes, who was also campaigning here, held a news conference and denounced Mr. Bush's tax proposals, the details of which had already been made public.
"He tinkers with the tax code," Mr. Forbes said. "It's a signal that it's politics as usual. It's a signal to Washington that they don't have to worry, their gravy train is going to remain on track."
Responding to a question about the violence surrounding demonstrations at a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle, Mr. Forbes even seemed to implicate Mr. Bush, saying, "If candidates play politics as usual -- trying to say as little as possible, be as vague as possible, just trim around the edges -- people get frustrated."
With those comments and other swipes, Mr. Forbes seemed to be intensifying his criticisms of Mr. Bush, who has a commanding lead over his Republican rivals in the polls, on the eve of a Republican debate in Manchester, N.H.
Oddly, Mr. Forbes's comments about Mr. Bush here today came a half hour after the two men had exchanged pleasantries at an Iowa Farm Bureau pancake breakfast.
Told about Mr. Forbes's dismissal of his tax plan, Mr. Bush said, "I think he likes to campaign by tearing down other people's ideas."
Mr. Forbes was not the only one dissecting Mr. Bush's plan.
Citizens for Tax Justice, which is often critical of Republican tax-cutting efforts, did an analysis that it said showed that when all of Mr. Bush's proposed cuts were fully phased in, 36.9 percent of total tax reductions in dollar terms would go to people with the top 1 percent of annual income, $301,000 or more.
People in the top 10 percent of the spectrum -- those with incomes of $89,000 or more -- would get 61.6 percent of the cut, the analysis reported. The bottom 60 percent of taxpayers by income -- $38,200 or less -- would get 11 percent.
Iris J. Lav, the deputy director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research organization in Washington, said Mr. Bush's plan would do nothing for most households below or just above the poverty line -- those making roughly $12,000 to $25,000 a year.
For many middle- and upper-income families, the tax cuts proposed by Mr. Bush could be substantial. Estimates prepared by Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, show that a married couple with two children earning $40,000 a year would have a federal income tax bill of $2,270 under current law and $670 under Mr. Bush's plan.
A married couple with no children and total income of $80,000 a year, including capital gains of $2,400, would see their tax bill decline to $6,738 from $10,592, Deloitte & Touche said. A married couple with two children earning $150,000, including capital gains of $4,200, would see their tax bill fall to $20,051 from $23,244, it said
But some Democrats said Mr. Bush's entire plan was built on a shaky premise: that the projected federal budget surpluses that he would use to pay for it will actually materialize.
"If you thought the Republican Congress's plan was a dangerous step in the wrong direction, hold on to your hats," said Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

HEADLINE: TALKS AND TURMOIL: THE REACTION;
Internationally, Embarrassment for U.S.

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
If Seattle had wanted to use the World Trade Organization meeting as a postcard demonstrating its idiosyncratic charms to the rest of the world, it would surely have hoped for some better pictures.
International responses to the images of rioting and chaos in Seattle varied as widely as countries' own views of the trade group and of American domination of world markets. Broadly speaking, though, Tuesday's events were seen as an embarrassment to the United States and to Seattle, as well as a sometimes welcome opportunity to train attention on trade issues dear to various regions. 
 In Britain, criticism tended to focus on the jarring spectacle of black-clad, heavily insulated officers repelling nonviolent demonstrators with what seemed like an arsenal of inessential weaponry. Glenys Kinnock, a member of the European Parliament who is in Seattle for the talks, said on a British television program that the Seattle authorities had grievously overreacted.
"They dress in very strange sort of Star Wars outfits, had tear gas, and I think it was quite a draconian response to the demonstration," Mrs. Kinnock said.
In some countries, commentators could barely contain their glee at what they saw as a humiliating blow to American domination of the world trade agenda. Vittorio Zucconi, a columnist for an Italian daily, La Repubblica, commented approvingly on what he described as "the strange, but formidable alliance between environmentalist agitators and European ambassadors, between blue jeans and double-breasted suits, of mothers against 'Frankenfood,' genetically altered food, and the agricultural interests of Europe."
Switzerland was not surprised by the unrest, having had its own experience with violent protests at a top-level meeting of the trade group in Geneva last year. Less than two weeks ago, 60 students chained themselves to the group's main staircase, barricaded the headquarters and unfurled an unflattering banner from the top of the building.
In Brazil, which has the largest economy in Latin America and has been expected to act as a spokesman of sorts for developing nations, the protests were described in headlines as the worst in the United States since Vietnam. In some respects, Brazil and other Latin American countries view the demonstrators as supporters of their own position -- that the international economic order is unfair to developing nations.
At the same time, though, countries like Brazil feel that the demonstrators' emphasis on environmental and labor issues tends to distract from the main question of economic inequality between rich and the poor.
For its part, France seemed to welcome the protests with an anarchic spirit of its own. French skepticism over the talks is not surprising, given the centrality of France in many of the most hotly debated issues in Seattle, including liberalization of farm trade.
The French news media devoted much of their coverage to chronicling the exploits of Jose Bove, the sometime French farmer and anti-McDonald's protester who is being called the "American hero" by some newspapers. To the delight of his countrymen, Mr. Bove illegally brought several hundred pounds of Roquefort cheese -- on which Washington has levied heavy import duties -- to the United States before joining the protesters in Seattle.
The official Chinese media gave scant coverage to the conflict in Seattle, and ignored it at first. The issues that were being raised are sensitive for the Chinese leaders, who normally take pleasure in highlighting "contraditions" in Western societies. But they have staked their reputations on gaining China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and they fear just these kinds of angry demonstrations at home from displaced workers.
In Jordan, which was scheduled to become the first and perhaps only nation admitted to the trade group during the conference, there was bitterness at the disruptions. Jordan sees the organization as essential to the foreign investment and economic growth it desperately needs. From Seattle, Muhammad Asfour, Jordan's minister of trade, was quoted as saying he was shocked and disappointed by the events.
"People like us, who came from thousands of miles away, to find no organization -- it's very sad," he said.

Clinton's Plea: 'Open the Meetings'

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech today to representatives at the World Trade Organization meeting here, as transcribed by the Federal News Service, a private company.
No one in this room can seriously argue that the world would have been a better place today if our forbears over the last 50 years had not done their work to bring us closer together. Whatever the problems that exist in whatever countries represented here, whatever the legitimacy of any of the criticism against us, this is a stronger, more prosperous world because we have worked to expand the frontiers of cooperation and reduce the barriers to trade among people. And we need to reiterate our conviction that that is true. If we were all out here going on our own, we would not be as well off in the world as we are. . . . 
 When people are working together for common prosperity in a rule-based system, they have big incentives to lay the differences down and join hands to work together. So if we just make those two points to our critics, I think it's very important.
No. 1, the world is a better place than it would have been had we not had the last 50 years of increasing economic cooperation for trade and investment. And No. 2, the world of the future will be a safer place if we continue to work together in a rule-based system that offers enormous incentives for people to find ways to cooperate and to give up their old hatreds and their impulses to violence and war.
Now, having said that, we now have to say, "What next?" I think we have to acknowledge a responsibility, particularly those of us in the wealthier countries, to make sure that we are working harder to see that the benefits of the global economy are more widely shared among and within countries, that it truly works for ordinary people who are doing the work for the rest of us.
I think we also have to make sure that the rules make sense and that we're continuing to make progress, notwithstanding the domestic political difficulties that every country will face. We all benefit when the rules are clear and fair. I think that means we have to cut tariffs further on manufactured goods and set equally ambitious goals for services. I think we should extend our moratorium on e-commerce. I think we should treat agriculture as we treat other sectors of the economy. . . .
I think it is imperative that the W.T.O. become more open and accessible. While other international organizations have sought and not shied from public participation, when that has happened public support has grown. If the W.T.O. expects to have public support grow for our endeavors, the public must see, and hear, and in a very real sense actually join in the deliberations. That's the only way they can know the process is fair and know their concerns were at least considered. We've made progress since I issued this challenge in Geneva last year. But I believe there's more work to be done, from opening the hearing-room doors to inviting in a more formal fashion public comment on trade disputes. . . .
The sooner the W.T.O. opens up the process and lets people representing those who are outside in, the sooner will see fewer demonstrations, more constructive debate and a broader level of support in every country for the direction that every single person in this room knows that we ought to be taking into the 21st century. So we can do it a little bit now and a little bit later. We can drag our feet or we can run through an open door.
But my preference is to open the meetings, open the records and let people file their opinion. No one, no sensible person expects to win every argument, and no one ever does. But in a free society, people want to be heard. And human dignity and political reality demand it today.
Third, as I have said repeatedly, I believe the W.T.O. must make sure that open trade does indeed lift living standards, respects core labor standards that are essential not only to worker rights, but to human rights. That's why this year the United States has proposed that the W.T.O. create a working group on trade and labor. To deny the importance of these issues in a global economy is to deny the dignity of work, the belief that honest labor fairly compensated gives meaning and structure to our lives. I hope we can affirm these values at this meeting.

HEADLINE: THE SPEECH -- Gore's Open Meetings;
Gore Is Using New Medium To Convey Message: Himself

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H., Nov. 30

 BODY:
Al Gore used to be a stick-to-the-script kind of guy. Lots of mind-numbing facts about the gross domestic product. But since he revamped his campaign two months ago after a slide in the polls, Mr. Gore has also revamped himself and thrown out the script of his standard stump speech.
Now, the vice president is trying to appeal to real people by portraying himself as a real person, too. He does not make full-blown speeches; he chats. He wanders into living rooms to talk with 30 people or into school gymnasiums to talk with 300 and conducts Oprah-style discussions, which he calls open meetings. He sometimes relies on stock answers to convey his positions on the issues: He wants to resubmit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that the Senate recently rejected. He wants to bring "revolutionary change" to public schools. He wants to give health insurance to all children. Excerpts, Page A28. 
 But more often than not, the message is about him. He talks about being a grandfather, about having lived in a trailer park, about how much he likes the pop singer Ricky Martin. And the medium of open meetings is an important part of the message -- that Mr. Gore is open, not the android of his reputation but a confident, freewheeling guy, able to handle any topic thrown at him, able to relate to all kinds of people.
The result is a scene like one on Tuesday at a high school here, where he was asked about violence. on television. Mr. Gore said he liked to watch "The Simpsons," prompting a round of applause from the teenage audience. Then he talked about watching the Simpsons watch "The Itchy and Scratchy Show," the cartoon within the cartoon, with its parody of violence. "They'll take out a chain saw and slice the arms off, horrible, blood spurting out, and Bart and Lisa and the little baby, Maggie, they'll laugh and giggle at this mayhem," he says, laughing himself.
"I'm sitting there watching this, saying, 'Oh my God, this is awful,' " he laughs, but he says he also enjoys it. "I'm really kind of conflicted, and that's what they're going for," he says, making the point that people become desensitized to violence when they see it all the time.
Earlier that day, he told business executives that he lived in a trailer park after he joined the Army. And out popped the little-known fact that he once was a housing developer.
Later at an American Legion post in Manchester, he was hailed by veterans for enlisting in the Army, but he insisted that he was not as brave as that implies. He became an enlisted man, as opposed to trying to become an officer, he said, because it meant only two years in the service, not three. Still, he conveyed an empathy with his fellow veterans and quoted a poem from a Vietnam buddy: "Each face may lose its name and time will not defer, but there will always be the bond between who we are and where we were."
Mr. Gore said recently that campaigns are "transformational," and in the past two months, as he has sought to regain an edge on his challenger, former Senator Bill Bradley, Mr. Gore has undergone a very public transformation as he searches for who he is and who he wants to be.
As he and his aides see it, Mr. Gore's challenge is not to show his smarts; he knows the issues inside out. His challenge is to show that a lifetime in politics has not stifled his growth, that he is not all tactics and caution, that he can think on his feet and engage the nation on his own terms, not as a spear-carrier in the Clinton administration.
The open format lends Mr. Gore an air of effortlessness, of someone open to the vicissitudes of real people, someone willing, as Michael Whouley, a strategist for Mr. Gore, says, to "put himself out there."
Mr. Gore will say, "Have at it," taking questions for an hour or so. He stays until the last person drifts away, fulfilled, his campaign hopes, by having had the chance to mull their concerns -- from global warming to the human genome project -- one on one with the vice president.
Questions from his audiences often go over the same ground, and Mr. Gore relies on them to make his policy points. For example, his answers to questions about health care now usually involve a deconstruction of the health care proposal offered by Mr. Bradley, his only rival for the Democratic nomination.
"My plan says let's insure all children," he says. "We'll get to 88 percent of the American people and we'll put provisions in place that will help others get access to health insurance." He says Mr. Bradley "gets just about the same amount -- 89 percent instead of 88 percent -- but he spends three times as much money and uses the entire surplus."
Sometimes he is asked about subjects that he never brings up on his own. Recently in Claremont, N.H., he was asked for his position on the death penalty. "I've always supported it," he replied, "because I think society has a right to make careful judgments about when that ultimate penalty ought to be applied."
He inevitably gets a question about leadership, which he often uses to distance himself from President Clinton. In Concord, he was asked to identify his "one weakness." He said that for a long time, he held his own views in check because his role was to support President Clinton. "I think it's a weakness as a presidential candidate and certainly would be as president, if I didn't shed myself of that, which I have," he said. "What you want to know is, what is my own spontaneous reaction to what comes up? What is my judgment?"
But his advisers keep telling him that the most important thing he can do is tell people "who he is." And so in his standard introduction, he talks about his family, mainly his mother and father and their triumphs over hardscrabble beginnings in the Tennessee hollows.
His mother was among the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt Law School. His father was at the forefront of the civil rights movement. Mr. Gore artfully presents his parents' backgrounds to explain his fundamental goals.
"In honor of my mother, I pledge that the progress we've made in women's rights in this century is only the beginning of what we will do in the next century," he declares. "In honor of my father, I pledge that the progress we've made in civil rights in this century will be only the beginning of the progress we make in the next century."
But this could be treacherous ground for Mr. Gore. The sheer drama of his parents' lives highlights the lack of overt struggle in his own, as the son of a Senator growing up in a hotel in Washington. He almost never mentions his elite education at St. Albans and Harvard. Instead he recalls the chaotic touchstones of his generation -- the assassinations, Vietnam, Watergate.
But he is rarely expansive about about what these events meant to him. "I went to Vietnam," he said at a recent living room appearance in Keene. "And I came back and I felt the pressures that were tearing our country apart. I saw Watergate unfold. I just wanted nothing to do with politics," which he says left him "disillusioned," especially after his father lost his Senate seat in 1970.
For all of his personal references, his discussions often give only the illusion of intimacy. This was most striking here at the high school when a young woman asked him if he would ban cigarettes and marijuana.
He said he would ban marijuana but that it would not be "practical" to ban cigarettes because so many people were addicted to them. He denounced tobacco companies, but never mentioned that his older sister, Nancy, a smoker since age 13, died of lung cancer in 1984.
In his acceptance speech at the 1996 Democratic National Convention, Mr. Gore had talked extensively about his sister's death, describing their last moments together. His speech was widely panned for seeming to exploit his sister's death. Now he never mentions her at all.

HEADLINE: TALKS AND TURMOIL: THE OVERVIEW;
PRESIDENT CHIDES WORLD TRADE BODY IN STORMY SEATTLE

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 1

 BODY:
With Seattle's streets locked down by the police and National Guard, President Clinton delivered two impassioned pleas today for nations of the world to use trade agreements to protect the rights of laborers and the environment, and delivered a pointed attack on the World Trade Organization for the secrecy of its operations.
In several appearances here that took him past the shattered windows and closed shops of a normally vibrant downtown, Mr. Clinton sided with the cause of many of the peaceful demonstrators who jammed Seattle's streets on Tuesday, even as he denounced those who engaged in violence. Excerpts, Page A17. 
 "What they are telling us in the streets is that this is an issue we've been silent on," Mr. Clinton told the ministers from 135 members of the World Trade Organization, which sets the rule for trade among their nations. "And we won't be silent anymore."
He said that "the sooner the W.T.O. opens up the process" of rule-making to outside groups, "we'll see less demonstrations and more constructive debate."
Even as Mr. Clinton spoke at Seattle's busy port and then to the group itself, the protests continued, though on a far smaller and less destructive scale, and they prompted the city's mayor to extend a curfew to a second night.
Thousands of policemen, backed by 200 National Guard troops carrying clubs and by hundreds more waiting just outside the city, arrested more than 400 people who sat at intersections or who tried to block the delegates from getting to their meetings today.
Tonight, tear gas floated through the streets again around Mr. Clinton's downtown hotel, and the police struggled to break up demonstrations near Seattle's famous waterfront market.
Apparently under the strong suggestion of the federal authorities, the city radically changed its tactics for dealing with the demonstrators today, closing down virtually all streets where protesters had been allowed to roam freely on Tuesday and leaving broad boulevards eerily empty at midday. Even on the fringes of downtown, the officers confiscated cell phones and gas masks from the demonstrators, denying them the two tools that allowed the protesters to run circles around the police the day before.
The results were immediate: Virtually all the trade group's delegates were able to move through the city easily. These included trade ministers and foreign ministers, bureaucrats and hundreds of Clinton administration officials. On the top floors of the giant convention center here, with Secret Service agents controlling access, diplomats began hashing out the framework for a trade negotiation that will take three years or more to complete.
But questions about how city officials and the police handled the protests continued, and one American official said Britain's top representative here had told his hosts that "this was the most incompetent police operation I have ever seen."
While refusing to criticize Seattle officials in public, in private several American cabinet members fumed about how the city had handled the protests, saying in interviews that they had spent months warning the Seattle police about the possibilities of violence. "We even sent them a tape of a violent demonstration at the W.T.O.'s headquarters in Geneva," said one. "And when we got here, we looked out the windows and were astounded to discover they hadn't even put up barricades."
In an interview, Seattle's mayor, Paul Schell, defended his decision to allow protesters to gather. "If I had closed the city and denied the protesters' a chance to make their voices heard," he said, "we would have been severely criticized for denying free speech and perhaps for provoking more serious violence."
In another bid to show that he was listening to the protesters who gathered for the meeting, which ends Friday. Mr. Clinton announced two initiatives to help the poorest nations, mostly in Africa, which have complained that the global trading system victimizes their populations. The most important was relaxation of American trade rules that the president said would make it less expensive for African nations to purchase and distribute drugs that fight AIDS, including AZT.
Until recently the United States had backed major drug companies, which have insisted on strict control of the distribution of their drugs, often at high prices. Today the administration said it would allow nations to buy those drugs through "parallel distributors" in other developing countries, where the same drugs are often available more cheaply. But it is unclear how much of a difference the change will make for people with AIDS in Africa, most of whom are desperately poor.
Mr. Clinton, who is staying in Seattle overnight to attend some events on Thursday, said the United States would support an initiative to end tariffs on all goods exported by the poorest nations. But the details were sketchy, and it appeared, for instance, that the administration would bow to pressure in Congress and maintain high tariffs on textiles from Africa, one of the region's main exports.
This evening, trying to demonstrate that the effort to put an agenda together for the trade talks was back on track, the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said, "Differences are definitely being narrowed." She and the chief of the trade organization, Mike Moore, canceled a dinner and reception for the ministers tonight, saying it was more important to negotiate than to socialize.
But in an interview this morning, Ms. Barshefsky conceded that most developing countries still oppose the top item on the American agenda: creating a "working group" in the trade organization that would examine issues of child labor, working conditions and the right to unionize. India, Brazil and other developing nations believe that even beginning talks on the topic is a step toward empowering the trade group to impose sanctions against countries that do not enforce a minimum set of labor standards. Indian officials charged again today that the United States and other nations would use such rules for protectionist purposes.
"It will be very, very tough," Ms. Barshefsky said of getting the trade group to look at labor issues, as her staff watched workers board up windows in the streets. "But perhaps these protests left an impression."
In fact, the American negotiators appear to be backing off a bit from their labor initiative. In private, several officials hinted they would probably accept any plan that allowed several international organizations, including the trade group, to examine the relationship between workers' rights and trade. The text of the American proposal calls for the International Labor Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations to join in examining that relationship.
"What's important is the substance, not where the group is located," an American official said.
Mr. Clinton's strongest comments focused on one of the greatest complaints of environmental and labor groups: that the World Trade Organization is far too secretive, banning spectators and reporters from its court, and conducting almost all of its business behind closed doors.
"I think it's imperative that the W.T.O. become more open and accessible," Mr. Clinton told the ministers at a lunch today. "If the W.T.O. expects to have public support grow for our endeavors, the public must see and hear and, in a very real sense, actually join in the deliberations. That's the only way they can know the process is fair, and know their concerns were at least considered."
"I know there's a lot of controversy about this," he said, alluding to European and Asian nations that have argued that openness would make the trade group more political, and risk embarrassment for some governments as documents about their most politically sensitive industries became public.
Mr. Clinton also argued that developing nations should not be concerned that the United States would use the imposition of labor standards on other countries for economic advantage. He said, "I freely acknowledge that, if we had a certain kind of rule, then protectionists in wealthy countries could use things like wage differentials to keep poorer countries down," by arguing that "you're not paying your people enough."
The answer, he said, "is to write the rules in such a way that people in our position, the wealthier countries, can't do that, can't use this as an instrument of protectionism," adding, "We can find a way to do this."

HEADLINE: Joining Up, With College in Mind;
National Guard Rebuilds Using Offer of Free Tuition

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS 

 BODY:
On a cool evening this fall, Sgt. First Class Albert Alfalla, thick-necked and eager in his National Guard uniform, faced an unusual scene for a military recruiter working in these flush times, when jobs abound and foreign threats lack the cold war's hold on the public imagination.
Gathered around him at his booth in the School of Art and Design in Manhattan were packs of high school students and their parents, reading his pamphlets, waiting for his spiel. "That's right," he told them. "I said, 'Free tuition. Go to college tuition-free.' " 
 Less than two hours later, Sergeant Alfalla had collected the names and telephone numbers of more than 50 juniors and seniors who were potential recruits, a feat that demonstrated a curious phenomenon in the world of military recruiting: young people lining up to join the National Guard.
"I could go for this, I might like it," said Alkay R. Waller, an 18-year-old senior from Mott Haven, the Bronx, as he thumbed through a Guard pamphlet. "I need it, really."
These have been challenging years for the armed forces, which have struggled to attract recruits. When the fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, only the Marine Corps had managed to enlist the number and quality of recruits it had sought. The Army fell short of its numbers for the second consecutive year, the Navy missed a similar fate by lowering its enlistment standards, and the Air Force did not meet its recruiting projections for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989.
But the state's part-time militia has had the opposite experience. After a decade of sharp decline in its ranks, the New York Army National Guard has not only stopped the contraction, it has begun to grow. Recruitment has been solid, and fewer veterans are quitting. Some units are even turning qualified people away.
The primary reason for the turnaround, the Guard's leadership says, is simple: For three years, New York has been paying the tuition bills for any Guard member who is admitted to a New York state or city college. While all the active-duty services offer educational assistance, none offer four years' worth of tuition immediately upon every enlistment, or anything close to it. Potential recruits, like Mr. Waller, have taken notice.
"In many respects this is a buyer's market -- the young man or woman can choose what he or she thinks is the best opportunity," said Brig. Gen. William C. Martin, the Guard's deputy commander. "We want the best, and we are going to get the best by making this the best offer in town."
By outbidding the competition, General Martin said, New York's Guard has stopped its slide down "the slippery slope to extinction."
Enthusiasm for the program was clear at Sergeant Alfalla's recruiting booth. After chatting with college admissions officers nearby, parents and students alike found themselves drifting to the Guard's booth to hear about the tuition offer.
"I want to see it in writing," said Dorothy Negron, of Park Slope, Brooklyn, whose 17-year-old son, Matthew, a high school senior, is considering enlisting. "But if this is true, I don't see why every young person doesn't take advantage of it."
Another parent nearby agreed: "I'm telling my boy to go in the Guard," said Andrea Keller, of Mott Haven. "This is better than financial aid."
New York's National Guard is a part-time military organization that serves both federal and state roles, as diverse as peacekeeping in Kosovo and winter storm relief in Buffalo. Along with units from 53 other states and territories, it forms a strategic reserve for the Pentagon in the case of major conflict. Its members sign up for three- to six-year enlistments, and generally serve one weekend a month, for which they are paid.
For much of the 1980's and 90's, New York's Army Guard was a struggling organization, drained of strength and morale by erosions in personnel. During the 10 years ending in 1995, the number of members plummeted, to 11,356 from 21,903. Its own projections warned that its strength would dip as low as 6,100 in this fiscal year.
In 1995, aware that the decline endangered its future as even a part-time fighting outfit, the Guard began looking for a solution. And after reviewing research that indicated that two-thirds of all high school students wanted to attend college, it asked the Legislature to enact a program that would underwrite tuition at state colleges for anyone who served.
"If you are competing against a strong economy, and 67 percent of your kids are going off to school, then why is it that they should join your team?" General Martin said. "The answer was benefits."
Guard planners, working with the veterans affairs committees in the Senate and Assembly, drafted a bill that would provide for full tuition at any college or university in the State University of New York or City University of New York systems, or pay as much as $3,400 each year toward tuition at a private school in New York.
The resulting benefit, known as the tuition incentive program, passed the Legislature unanimously and was signed into law by Gov. George E. Pataki in the summer of 1996. To date, the program has cost $6.4 million in state tax dollars, money that is, in its simplest sense, transferred from the state general fund to state colleges. The campuses "directly benefit from the additional tuition revenue," said Jon Sorenson, a spokesman for the SUNY chancellor.
Though it does not cover fees, books, room or board, the incentive program appears to have had a clear effect. Average annual attrition from the Guard, which hovered at 27 percent in the early 1990's, is now 18 percent. Guard-financed college enrollments have been climbing steadily: to 1,790 this fall, from 379 in 1997, when the incentive program was first offered. And as of Oct. 31, the Guard had nearly 12,000 members, almost double its dismal projections from 1995.
Moreover, the program has achieved one of its goals: attracting students who had not considered military service before. Evita C. Ramos, 18, met Sergeant Alfalla at a college fair at Long Island City High School last winter. Joining the military "would have been last on my list," she said, until she heard about the free tuition.
"I never thought I would be coming into the military," she said. "But free tuition? It's a load off my back."
Ms. Ramos began basic training in Fort Jackson, S.C., on Nov. 15. And better still, in the eyes of the Guard, she recruited her boyfriend, Lenny Murillo, 21, who also signed up for the tuition benefit and left for basic training on the same day. Because Guard service is part time after a few months of initial training, Ms. Ramos and Mr. Murillo will be eligible to enroll at SUNY campuses next fall, and are considering attending John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
The program has been similarly effective in upstate New York, especially in regions that have SUNY colleges. Sgt. First Class Kenneth W. Stoddard, who recruits from 21 high schools in and near Plattsburgh, said he had been so successful underwriting tuition for applicants to SUNY-Plattsburgh that his local units had no room left. "Right now, I'm loaded," Sergeant Stoddard said. "I have no more vacancies."
With personnel strength climbing, long-depleted units are replenishing their numbers. In 1996, the First Battalion/69th Mechanized Infantry, a unit with headquarters at the Lexington Avenue Armory in Manhattan, had 462 members. Today it has 649. "The growth in this battalion because of the educational program has been as high as 20 percent a year," said Lt. Col. Benson W. Lum, the battalion commander.
The Guard's turnaround is particularly striking because New York has proved to be difficult recruiting terrain for the regular military. Last year, for example, the Army instructed its recruiters in New York State to enlist 6,186 active-duty soldiers and 2,952 reservists. They managed only 3,751 and 2,097, respectively.
"I'm very lucky because of this program," Sergeant Alfalla said. "This tuition benefit has made things so much easier."
Easier recruiting does not mean, however, that the Guard is for everyone, and Sergeant Alfalla and his peers still suffer disappointments. Some promising applicants do not pass the physical. Others fail the entrance exam. And even though his job is easier than it once was, the sergeant is not above using a recruiter's time-tested tricks, like blocking an aisle with a sandwich sign, which forces strolling students to veer his way, toward his extended hand and aggressive introduction.
Further, many students still mistake Guard recruiters for their counterparts in the active services or have no interest in military life. As Sergeant Alfalla worked the crowd at the School for Art and Design, two young women drifted by, studiously avoiding eye contact.
"Join the Army?" one said. "No way."

HEADLINE: The Fight in Seattle Over Trade

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I agree with Thomas L. Friedman's Dec. 1 column, "Senseless in Seattle." The majority of American people support free trade, and why not? It has contributed to our collective prosperity and relatively low unemployment. 
 If people want to save sea turtles, they should protest the shrimp-exporting countries that brought the case against United States import restrictions, not the World Trade Organization. The W.T.O. is not evil or dangerous. It is a mechanism for countries to argue and resolve differences. And thanks to years of hard work, we have global trading rules and institutions to help us mitigate conflicts in an increasingly interconnected world.

HEADLINE: Agency Says Budget Taps Social Security

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
This year's spending bills draw $17 billion out of the Social Security surplus, according to a new analysis released today by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The budget office also predicted that if Congress did not cut spending in its next budget, for the 2001 fiscal year, which starts on Oct. 1, it would wind up spending $19 billion in Social Security surpluses. 
 These figures could change if tax revenues grow as a result of a strong economy, but spending is certain to be an issue in the presidential campaign. For example, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, this week proposed a five-year, $483 billion tax cut that would be underwritten by projected surpluses in general government revenues. Those surpluses, which have not yet materialized, depend on Congress's cutting spending sharply in coming years.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, traveling in Australia, issued a statement saying that the report "reinforces what Republicans have been saying all along," that the budget would protect Social Security surpluses, allowing for "certain scorekeeping adjustments."
But Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said, "If the economy keeps steaming ahead, it could bail us out, and clearly that's what the Republicans are betting on, but you can't base budgets on bets."

HEADLINE: Angst at Japan Inc.;
A Nation Frets Over a String of Technological Accidents

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Amid the economic recession, record unemployment, volatile markets, and shattered dreams that defined the past decade in Japan, the one thing that the Japanese people could always take pride in was their country's reputation as a world leader in technology.
But a recent string of costly and embarrassing accidents in Japan's renowned nuclear, aerospace and railway sectors has caused many Japanese to question whether their country is losing its technological prowess and attention to detail. 
 "The public should be very concerned about these accidents, which were completely preventable," said Hiroaki Yanagida, an engineering professor at Tokyo University. "In Japan there is a lack of responsibility and an arrogance on the part of engineers and industry. They've been telling us for 30 years that these technologies were completely safe, and we've just blindly accepted what they told us."
The accidents began in June, when Japan's bullet train -- long a symbol of the country's advanced technology, its efficiency and safety -- lost much of its luster, after a 400-pound concrete block fell from a tunnel wall hitting the roof of a train moving at 130 miles an hour.
Although no one was hurt, at least four other train accidents involving falling concrete and debris in tunnels have occurred this year, including one on Sunday that derailed a cargo train. The transport agency said that despite regular maintenance checks, inspectors had failed to detect the loose concrete.
In September, Japan suffered its worst nuclear accident when an employee mistake at a uranium fuel processing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, left 2 workers in critical condition and exposed at least 69 people to radiation. Government officials had once boasted that an accident of this type was impossible.
And just two weeks ago, a Japanese space agency rocket carrying a government satellite, together costing $340 million, crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff because of engine trouble. The crash was the second failure in two years for the H-2 rocket and dealt a serious setback to Japan's effort to enter the satellite launching market.
A week after the Japanese rocket failure, China successfully launched its first spacecraft designed to carry humans into orbit and guided it back to earth, in a breakthrough effort to join the United States and Russia in the elite club of manned space flight.
For many Japanese, these incidents were not merely coincidental but reflected a troubling decline in the country's industrial and technology capability, which was the cornerstone of Japan's postwar economic success.
To be sure, Japan's overall research and development efforts remain as strong as ever, and its scientists and engineers continue to churn out innovations and apply for patents at a steady clip. There is little if any evidence that Japan's technological competitiveness has been seriously compromised.
"I think it would be a huge mistake to write the Japanese off as competitors," said William Keller, director of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Japan Program. "What I think is going on here is that the Japanese psyche has been so wounded by years of recession that when there are accidents of this nature, the Japanese tend to look inwardly and begin to question their own ability."
But some technology experts say that the recent accidents have revealed flaws in Japan's industrial and technological base, mainly a decline in the education and on-the-job training of engineers, technicians and maintenance workers. In recent years, much of Japan's manufacturing of less advanced products has migrated to other Asian countries with lower wages, and fewer and fewer Japanese are willing to take jobs in labor-intensive fields.
"The best and the brightest people are not going to work for the uranium factories or in the maintenance of train tunnels," said Kiyoshi Sakurai, a technology critic. "Young Japanese dislike this type of work because it makes their hands dirty."
Indeed, perhaps most worrisome, many Japanese say, is the government's inability to guard against accidents, which jeopardize public safety and hurt Japan's image abroad. The incidents have caused a number of industries and government regulatory agencies to strengthen their maintenance and safety procedures.
Recent headlines in Japan's major newspapers underscored the public's growing concern over the accidents. "Japan's Big Technologies Start to Come Apart at the Seams," said the Nikkei, a leading financial paper. "Japan's Technology-Based State Becomes Shaky," said the daily Yomiuri.
"At no time in the postwar era has the state of the nation's science and technology and the competence of its engineers been questioned as it has been today," the Yomiuri said in an editorial.
The top bureaucrat at the Ministry of Science and Technology, Toshio Okazaki, resigned his post as vice minister because of the nuclear accident and the failed rocket launching. His successor, Yasuhiro Kato, said at a news conference last week that he would work hard to rebuild public trust in the agency. Mr. Kato directed agency personnel to be more sensitive to social and technological changes.
"With these accidents we suffered a severe blow to our image, and we will have a tough time rebuilding public confidence," said Nobuhiro Muroya, deputy director for the Ministry of Science and Technology's planning and evaluation division. "But we are determined that we will regain the public support, especially after we successfully launch another rocket and ensure that the nuclear industry is safe."
Some experts say that the problems revealed by the accidents cannot be overcome so easily. Akito Arima, who has held cabinet positions as science and technology minister and education minister, said that Japanese society had to change the way it viewed labor-intensive jobs and to improve the education and training of technical workers or it was likely to suffer more industrial troubles.
"There are so many young people in Japan who want to go to university that trade and vocational schools have started to decline, and as a nation, our legs and shoulders and hands have become weaker," Mr. Arima said. "It's fine for some youngsters to go to vocational schools and to do these important hands-on jobs. We need them."
The most unnerving of the recent episodes was the nuclear accident at Tokaimura, in which technicians poured nearly seven times the normal amount of uranium into a purification tank, setting off an explosion.
While the incident is still under investigation, there have been reports in the local news media that the plant operated by the JCO Company had failed to warn its staff of the dire consequences of having an excessive concentration of uranium in the manufacturing process.
Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the Japanese Federation of Employer's Associations, said in a recent letter to industry and management associations that Japanese society had been shaken by the accidents and he called on the trade groups to take steps to re-establish Japan as "a country of manufacturing" and a "technology nation."

HEADLINE: U.S. and NATO Allies Divided Over Defense Needs

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Ten years after the end of the cold war, the United States, unchallenged as a superpower, faces a different challenge in NATO: its allies' insistence on seeing the world from their own perspective and setting their own defense priorities instead of following Washington's.
So it was at the alliance's headquarters here today that Defense Secretary William S. Cohen tried to convince skeptical Europeans that not only the United States but Europe, too, would face a real threat to its security if North Korea, Iran or other nations continued developing or acquiring intercontinental nuclear missiles. 
 "I think it's important for allied countries to understand that the threat is real, and that in all likelihood it will increase in coming years," Mr. Cohen said later.
The United States would need the support of its allies even if it decided to build an effective missile-defense system to defend just itself, he said. But he concluded: "There is by no means a consensus within the alliance. It's something they will look at and we will discuss over the coming year."
The divide over defense needs also was evident today in allies' assurances to Mr. Cohen that their ambition to create an autonomous, all-European military force with the ability to send 50,000 troops to the far reaches of the Continent the next time trouble broke out would not diminish their military commitments to the American-led alliance.
NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, who favors the European force, observed, "There are around two million people in European armies in uniform today, and yet the European allies had to struggle hard to get 40,000 to go and serve in Kosovo."
But reorganizing and cooperating more closely with one another, the Europeans said, could give both the European Union and NATO the stronger European defense pillar the United States has been urging for decades. As long as the new European Union military structure did not duplicate NATO's unnecessarily, Mr. Cohen agreed with his fellow ministers today, "a stronger Europe means a stronger alliance."
To some extent, the problems the alliance is having arise because the member nations are finally getting things they have wanted for years.
The United States has been calling for a stronger European military contribution to NATO since John F. Kennedy was president. But now that the Europeans say they want to make one, the United States wants them to concentrate on building that stronger European security and defense identity within NATO.
The European allies thought that they won the lasting peace they yearned for when the cold war ended, and some of them cut military spending by up to half. But two wars in the Balkans, and the Europeans' obvious military shortcomings in this year's war in Kosovo, convinced them that they still depended far too much on the United States to handle trouble in their own backyard.
Britain, with France, bore most of the burden and frustration of the unsuccessful United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia until NATO took over and ended the fighting there in 1995.
And now, France and Britain, even with President Clinton's closest soul mate in Europe, Tony Blair, as prime minister, are at the core of the European defense structure that is expected to be decided next week at a European Union summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland.
The nations that would provide the bulk of a European force agree that it would act on its own only if NATO as a whole -- in effect the United States -- decided not to get involved.
Though American officials have trouble imagining a European crisis the United States could stay out of, Europeans no longer do. "American politicians, not only in the Senate but in public discussion generally, have to make big efforts to explain to the public why they should be engaged in Kosovo with billions of dollars and thousands of soldiers even though their vital interests are not in the least involved," the German defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said today.
But how the Europeans can build the force structure they plan by 2003, let alone meet their commitments to strengthen NATO, with military spending as low as it is now, was another question debated today.
"You cannot buy security on the cheap," Lord Robertson said.
The United States spent 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on the military this year, according to alliance figures. But Germany, with one of the largest armies in Europe, spent only 1.5 percent.
Even France and Britain, with 2.8 and 2.6 percent respectively, will not soon catch up to the United States at those rates in precision-guided weapons technology, battlefield intelligence and command-and-control systems, heavy-lift air transport and the other assets the Europeans found they lacked in Kosovo.
The North Korean missile threat got mostly shrugs here, European diplomats said, after watching a series of slides shown by Pentagon officials depicting wider and wider circles radiating from North Korea, representing the ranges of the three classes of missiles already tested or being developed there. The circles threw their shadows over parts of both Europe and the United States.
A three-stage missile, the Taepo Dong-2, which North Korea is still developing but has agreed not to test in exchange for American economic aid, could devastate targets in all of the United States and most of Europe with a nuclear payload, the Pentagon officials said.
But the allies appeared unprepared to take this missile threat seriously, European officials said.
Part of the point of the American briefing on missiles was to try to show the allies why the United States might decide to build a limited anti-missile defense system to counter the new threat, a system that would be barred by the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty unless Russia agrees to changes American negotiators have so far failed to get Moscow to accept.
"There is no reason why you cannot have a system like the one the United States is thinking about and full strategic stability at the same time," a senior American official said, explaining that if Mr. Clinton decides to go ahead with a national missile defense, it would initially have only 100 interceptor missiles based in Alaska. That would not be enough to pose a threat to Russia's huge nuclear arsenal, but if it worked, it might be able to take care of a few warheads lobbed in from Iraq or North Korea.
But coming on top of the United States Senate's recent rejection of the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the Clinton administration's desire to tinker with the antiballistic missile treaty has piqued the concern among some allies, particularly the French, that the world's only superpower is crashing around the world like a bull in a china shop.
"We must avoid any questioning of the ABM treaty that could lead to disruption of strategic equilibria and a new nuclear arms race," President Jacques Chirac of France said a few weeks ago, as Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was trying in vain to convince the allies that amending the treaty to meet a new missile threat from rogue states would not set off a new arms race.
French officials worry that China, for one, might decide to deploy hundreds of intercontinental missiles rather than the score or so it has now.
They also worry that, with the Senate having rejected the test ban treaty, countries like India and Pakistan will resist pleas from Washington to stick with their decision to stop testing the nuclear weapons they both first exploded last year.
Several allies, Mr. Cohen said today, raised concerns that Europe might actually be more exposed to possible rogue missile attacks if the United States proceeded alone with a missile defense.

Ben& Jerry's ponders the meaning of selling its ice cream business.

BYLINE: By Constance L. Hays 

 BODY:
IS Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., a company for whom the term "value driven" has moral implications and not necessarily financial ones, getting ready to make the ultimate sacrifice to market forces?
Yesterday, the long-languishing stock of the maker of Wavy Gravy, Rain Forest Crunch and Cherry Garcia ice cream jumped more than 17 percent on a report, issued from Ben & Jerry's headquarters in Burlington, Vt., that the company had received "indications of interest" to buy it for more than the $21 close on Wednesday. The stock finished up $3.6875, to $24.6875. 
 "These indications of interest are subject to conditions and are being considered by the board," the company said in its statement. It would not identify the prospective buyer or buyers. A spokeswoman, Chrystie Heimert, would not elaborate on the conditions, although she did say, "We have a widely recognized mission, the three-legged stool, that is product quality, economic reward and commitment to the community as it applies to social-mission initiatives."
Is it a sellout? Or just the natural consequences of being a publicly traded company, where shareholders have not been delighted with performance? Jeffrey Kanter, a food analyst for Prudential Securities, said Ben & Jerry's should come up with a new flavor -- Capitulation Crunch -- if the sale goes through.
"Despite having one of the best brand names in the country, it was losing share recently to Dreyer's, and this is almost a capitulation by the founders, saying we are in a jam here," Mr. Kanter said. "You had a company that was trading at a sharp discount to beef slaughterers."
The most likely buyers include Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc., the industry giant, based in Oakland, Calif., that distributed Ben & Jerry's nationwide until recently, and Ice Cream Partners, a joint venture that was formed this summer by the Pillsbury unit of Diageo P.L.C., which makes Haagen-Dazs ice cream, and Nestle S.A.'s American frozen confection business.
Neither probable suitor is revered in Burlington. Haagen-Dazs has long competed against Ben & Jerry's in the superpremium ice-cream category. And Dreyer's mounted an all-out offensive against Ben & Jerry's this summer with its Edy's Dreamery line. The ice cream featured flavors not unlike those of Ben & Jerry's, and they even had the kind of eccentric names -- Black Raspberry Avalanche, for example -- that are a critical part of the Ben & Jerry's brand identity.
The founders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, control a majority of the voting shares and would have to be assured that their company's core values -- which include commitments to making their product in Vermont and investing in social causes -- would not change under the new ownership. Because of that, another analyst thinks a deal may be difficult to complete.
"A hostile takeover is impossible," said the analyst, Kim Galle of Advest Inc. in Boston, who covered Ben & Jerry's until a few months ago. "And in my opinion, it is highly unlikely that they would accept an offer without an amazing amount of conditions attached to it, including manufacturing the ice cream in Vermont."
Mr. Galle said the idea of being bought by Haagen-Dazs would send Ben & Jerry's senior management into a tie-dyed tailspin. "They would sooner die than have that happen," he said, citing the fierce competition between the two brands.
Dreyer's, which continues to distribute Ben & Jerry's in some areas, as does Haagen-Dazs, had made earlier runs at buying Ben & Jerry's, a Dreyer's spokeswoman said. "We've had a long arrangement with them and over the years our executives have spoken directly with Ben and Jerry with regard to our interest in the company," said the spokeswoman, Diane McIntyre. "They have always maintained that they like their independence and their focus on their corporate mission. At that time, they chose to remain that way."
Neither she nor spokeswomen for Pillsbury and Nestle would comment when asked whether they were bidding for Ben & Jerry's right now. The Ice Cream Partners alliance was formed to speed up growth of the two companies' United States ice-cream divisions, but it is not clear whether acquisitions are a central part of the business plan.
Mr. Kanter said the next move belonged to Mr. Greenfield, who is a co-chairman of the Ben & Jerry's board, and Mr. Cohen, who is also a director. "The big thing is, are they going to follow through?" he said. "They have to follow through. If they don't, the stock price goes back down to 17 bucks, and if I'm a shareholder, I would be livid."
The company has already made some meaningful shifts away from the original format set up in 1978. In 1995, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield elected to leave the company's daily management to a chief executive. The current one, Perry D. Odak, has redesigned the package, moving the founders' photographs from the top to the back; ordered up more advertising, and made other moves.
The latest data from Information Resources Inc., which tracks sales in supermarkets, show that Ben & Jerry's sales measured by dollars rose 15.8 percent in the 52 weeks ended Oct. 10. The ice-cream category rose 8.2 percent over all. Ms. Heimert said about 60 percent of Ben & Jerry's sales were in supermarkets.
Any sale of Ben & Jerry's itself, however, is likely to take some time. "With all the hurdles and hoops and whistles attached to Ben & Jerry's, my sense is it doesn't happen too quickly," Mr. Kanter said.

Big Advance for Technology Shares Lifts Nasdaq to a Record

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Technology stocks roared higher yesterday, sending the Nasdaq composite index into record territory again and pushing the Dow Jones industrial average firmly above 11,000.
The Nasdaq composite shot up 99.07 points, or 2.95 percent, to 3,452.78, topping its Nov. 26 record of 3,447.81. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.67 points, to 11,039.06. The advance left the Dow more than 1,000 points above its mid-October low of 10,019.71 and poised to attack the record of 11,326.04 set on Aug. 25.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks jumped 11.32 points, to 1,409.04.
The Hewlett-Packard Company buoyed the Dow. The company held an analysts' meeting this week to detail plans to cut costs and expand sales of computer servers, and several investment firms expressed optimism about the company's prospects under Carleton S. Fiorina, its new chief executive.
The Nasdaq rose on gains from a wide range of technology stocks. The Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems and eBay all increased sharply. The technology-dominated index slumped early this week as investors locked in profits from a stellar November, when the Nasdaq set 15 new closing highs.
But with most technology companies posting strong sales and rapid growth, investors are finding few reasons to stay away from the sector.
"Despite the quickie reversal earlier this week, the techs didn't really go away," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company. "Portfolio managers are still going to want to score off these companies as we head toward the end of the year."
Yesterday's sharp advance perplexed some analysts, as stocks rose despite decidedly mixed news about the state of the economy. The Commerce Department said new-home sales hit a record in October, rising 16.3 percent from September despite rising mortgage rates. The report hurt bonds and sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury rising to 6.32 percent.
The strong housing report also diluted the impact of a survey that showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week.
The strength of the job market has kept inflation jitters alive on Wall Street, which is concerned that companies competing for workers will be forced to raise prices to offer attractive salaries. The rise in jobless claims was viewed as a sign the job market was not getting tighter.
Analysts said investors might have skimmed over yesterday's reports in light of today's more crucial employment report, which will reflect hiring and wages for the month of October. That report is expected to offer some indication of whether the economy is growing fast enough to persuade the Federal Reserve Board to continue raising interest rates.

Treasury Prices Decline
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as surprising vigor in the housing market intensified worries that more rate increases were on the horizon, traders and analysts said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 3/32, to 97 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.32 percent from 6.29 percent on Wednesday.
People are concerned that the Federal Reserve Board is not done raising interest rates, said Raye Kanzenbach, chief investment officer at Inside Investment Management, a unit of Dain Rauscher Inc., in Minneapolis.

HEADLINE: Setting a Price on Nazi Slavery

 BODY:
More than 50 years ago, millions of citizens of Central and Eastern Europe were compelled to work under monstrous conditions for German companies and the Nazi state. Concentration camp inmates, mostly Jews, were used by the companies as slaves in manufacturing facilities inside the camps. Others, mostly non-Jews, were deported to Germany and made to do forced labor in factories and on farms to sustain the Nazi war effort. Hundreds of thousands of people who survived these ordeals are still alive. But all are elderly and thousands die each month. If they are ever to be compensated for their nightmarish suffering, it must be soon.
Belated compensation talks this year, capably helped along by Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, have put a reasonable settlement within reach. Survivor groups have reduced their claims in the interests of an early payout. The German government, though financially strapped, has offered to contribute substantially to a settlement. But the chance for an early deal may now be lost because of the unjustified intransigence of German private industry. German companies have failed to be as generous or as flexible as they should be. 
The German government long ago made payments to concentration camp survivors, and a few private companies have given roughly $70 million to forced laborers who worked for them, which would be credited in any settlement. But hundreds of thousands of people who were forced to work either for the many large companies that have not made such payments or for Nazi-era companies and organizations that no longer exist have never been compensated. The big German companies that profited hugely from these and other Nazi economic crimes should contribute generously to these victims.
Last February, under threat of legal action from survivors' organizations, 16 leading German companies agreed to discuss a voluntary compensation agreement. They had a considerable incentive for coming to terms. Not only would all current legal actions be dismissed, but Washington has given assurances that it would oppose all further legal claims brought in American courts for Nazi-era economic offenses. Many of the German companies involved do substantial business in the United States or own American affiliates.
Since February many more companies have joined the talks, and the total amount offered by private industry has been increased to about $2.8 billion. Adding in the German government's proposed contribution of about $1.7 billion, the total German offer comes to about $4.5 billion. The survivors are seeking something in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion. It is widely believed that the real gap between the two sides is less than $2 billion.
But German industry now insists that its $2.8 billion offer is final. If the survivors' groups do not accept by Dec. 10, the companies threaten to pull out of the talks. Considering that the victims have waited more than 50 years for compensation, setting such an abrupt and artificial deadline is particularly offensive.
The German companies involved in these talks could easily afford the $2 billion needed to close the gap. Their combined profits last year amounted to tens of billions of dollars. Many other businesses that profited from forced labor have not yet agreed to contribute, and their participation could swell the fund considerably. Soon most of the surviving victims of Nazi-era forced labor will be dead. German industry must act now to erase this terrible stain on its reputation and its conscience.

HEADLINE: Teams of Researchers Dissect Disastrous Flood

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Just a few days after the waters of the Raritan River engulfed central and northern New Jersey in September, there was another sort of flood: teams of researchers and students armed with clipboards and pens joined volunteers, insurance adjusters and others who swarmed over the inundated communities as they struggled to recover from New Jersey's costliest disaster.
Some of the researchers came from Rutgers University-New Brunswick to study the flood's effects on residents, businesses and property, and to shed some historical perspective on the disaster, which was brought on by Tropical Storm Floyd. 
 Less than three months after the storm, which state officials estimate caused $1 billion in damage, the Rutgers researchers are to gather today at Rutgers's Livingston College campus in Piscataway to present preliminary findings of what they call The Great Raritan Flood Project.
"We want to know how human uses of the Raritan Valley have changed in recent decades, when governments have been experimenting with different approaches to flooding," said James K. Mitchell, a professor of geography who coordinated the project. "That will put us in a good position to make suggestions about the kinds of public policies that offer better prospects for reducing future flood losses."
The researchers -- half a dozen professors from several departments, as well as graduate students and undergraduates -- looked at several aspects of the flood to help policy makers understand how it happened, where the losses were greatest and how September's flooding differed from previous floods. They also examined the climatic conditions in that flood and others, and the demographics -- including ethnicity and income levels -- of the people most affected by the floods.
The September deluge was particularly severe -- two people died in the small borough of Bound Brook -- but flooding is common in the communities along the Raritan River and Green Brook in the plains below the Watchung Mountains.
At today's gathering, Peter O. Wacker, a professor of geography, plans to explain how flooding has occurred in this area at least since Colonial times.
"It's been known as a flood-prone area, and people keep building in these areas known for flooding and there's very little one can do to prevent flooding," he said.
In the past, most talk of solutions has centered on finding artificial ways to hold back the waters, even as municipalities have allowed more and more development in flood plains. But since September, state and federal officials have been talking about buying out property owners in flood-prone areas to keep the damage from recurring with each new flood.
"It's a well-known dichotomy: Either keep the water away from the people or keep the people away from the water," Dr. Mitchell said. His group of researchers did not try to propose an answer to that problem, but only to provide information so others can make better decisions.
Another team of researchers, Elvin Wyly and Robin Leichenko, who are also affiliated with Rutgers's Center for Urban Policy Research, looked at the storm's impact on small businesses in 10 communities hardest hit by the storm.
Together, the communities had about $140 million in business losses. Bound Brook had the most, with 148 businesses flooded out, affecting 408 jobs, or about one-tenth of the borough's employment. A month after the storm, Dr. Wyly said, only about half of the businesses were back to some level of operation.
Dr. Wyly said that many of those businesses had also been hit hard in a 1996 flood, after which many of the owners or managers applied for loans from the United States Small Business Administration.
"Many of those people were still paying off 1996 loans when the 1999 floods came along," Dr. Wyly said. He said that explained why business owners in Bound Brook mobilized and held so many protest rallies and traveled to Trenton to persuade politicians to give them direct aid, instead of more loans.
"The memories of 1996 were very fresh," he said. "There was not a generational turnover from one flood to the next."

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rose in October

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes unexpectedly soared to a record in October, government figures showed today, as warm weather encouraged buying after three consecutive months of declines.
New-home sales rose 16.3 percent in October, to an annual rate of 986,000, after falling 8.1 percent in September, according to the Commerce Department. October's gain was led by record sales in the Midwest, where temperatures were unseasonably warm, and in the South, which was recovering from a slump caused by Hurricane Floyd. 
 Through October, new-home sales were on pace to reach 928,000 this year, which would eclipse last year's record of 886,000.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said today that the number of workers filing for state unemployment benefits rose last week after falling to the lowest level in two months. First-time jobless claims increased 15,000, to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 in the week ended Nov. 27 after falling 11,000, to 276,000, the week before.
New-home sales in October rose 40.4 percent in the Midwest, to a record annual rate of 240,000, and rose 18 percent in the South. Sales also increased in the West but fell in the Northeast.
The new-home sales report comes after data released earlier this week signaled a slowdown in sales of existing homes.
"This report suggests the housing sector may not be as weak as we thought," said Scott Brown, an economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.

HEADLINE: Globalization and the Wage Gap

BYLINE: By Andrew Kohut; Andrew Kohut is the director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's difficult to decide how seriously to take the protests in Seattle against the World Trade Organization. We learned in the 1960's that unruly people taking to the streets can foreshadow broader changes in public opinion. Yet these protests are mostly about economics, and we also know that Americans are more financially satisfied than they have been in years and that consumer confidence is near record levels.
Clearly the worst of what we have seen in Seattle is thuggery for its own sake, but the support for the broader peaceful protest and the backing from unions and well-established special-interest groups show that there are pockets of deep disquiet amid the general contentment. Americans do not speak with one voice about globalization, and while most people are enjoying the boom years, it is a very top-heavy celebration. 
 In a Pew Research Center nationwide survey in April, 43 percent of respondents said that in the future a global economy would help average Americans, while 52 percent said it would hurt them. But these overall results mask a yawning gap.
Among Americans in families earning $75,000 or more, 63 percent see globalization as positive. That falls to 48 percent for those with household income of $50,000 to $74,999. And among the half of American adults in families earning less than $50,000, the positive view of globalism is held by just 37 percent.
Surveys in 1998 by Pew and Gallup found small pluralities favoring globalization overall, but both polls also showed the same strong socioeconomic skew.
Pew surveys of long-term trends, updated each year, have have found that on average, Americans rate their financial situation better now than they did from 1994 through 1996. But financial satisfaction is significantly higher only among people with family incomes of $50,000 and higher. Those in lower-earning families rated their situation no better this year than they did in 1994. The improvement they have reported is a decrease in financial pressure: fewer said this year that they "often did not have enough money to make ends meet" than did so in 1994.
Wages continue to be a source of concern. Just 39 percent of Americans say they earn enough money to lead the life they want. There has been a significant decline in satisfaction with wages among those earning less than $50,000: only 27 percent now say they earn enough, down from 33 percent in 1994. According to a nationwide survey in October by The Washington Post, 67 percent of Americans worry that good jobs will move overseas and that workers will be left with jobs that don't pay enough.
Until this week, Americans had not heard much about the W.T.O. The public continues to be of two minds about free trade, however, generally supporting the concept but expressing criticism of specific policies and agreements. The North American Free Trade Agreement gets, at best, a mixed review, and there is still little support for giving the president increased authority to negotiate trade agreements.
Americans' concern about trade agreements does not appear to be rooted in a general worry about the loss of American sovereignty: surveys show their concerns are more specific. We found strong public backing for internationally mandated environmental standards, for example, which weaken nations' sovereign powers, in the same surveys in which Nafta, which also weakens sovereignty, received significant opposition. Broad opposition to the W.T.O. could develop around specific concerns about wages and environmental and human rights issues.
For now, the dissatisfaction showing in Seattle is less important than a more widespread public optimism about future economic gains. But there is also a simmering concern about the most fundamental of economic issues: wages. And if the overall economic climate becomes less favorable, that disquiet could grow into something far more serious.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
The Euro Slips Briefly Below Dollar's Value

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Europe's single currency hit a symbolic and political low point today when it briefly dropped below the value of the United States dollar for the first time since its introduction nearly a year ago.
After months of decline, interrupted by listless recoveries, the value of the currency, the euro, slipped to 99.96 cents and then edged back just above parity, settling in New York foreign-exchange trading at $1.0018, down from $1.0083 late Wednesday. 
 In economic terms, the euro's decline to today's levels may have little effect. But it is a measure of fair psychological importance because it implies shaky confidence in either the currency itself or in Europe's ability to achieve sustained growth.
Introduced in January by 11 European nations as the currency of finance, if not yet of daily use, the euro was celebrated as a crowning achievement of European economic integration.
It was supposed to be the first real rival to the United States dollar -- what the German economist Norbert Walter described as the foreign-exchange equivalent of Airbus Industrie's challenge to Boeing in the global aircraft market.
But the euro has declined about 15 percent against the dollar and more than 30 percent against the Japanese yen.
Its decline has persisted despite frequent pep talks by European leaders, evidence of accelerating growth in European economies and even a recent increase in the benchmark interest rate.
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, reiterated his longstanding reluctance today to prop up the euro and again insisted that the euro had the "strong potential to appreciate."
At least for the time being, the central bank can afford to leave things as they are. Though a weak currency means that imports become more expensive, inflation in euro zone countries remains benign.
But the currency's decline could pose further problems. By slipping below parity against the dollar, a 1-to-1 ratio, the euro passed a psychological barrier that investors had viewed with measurable unease.
If the euro declines much further, the weakness could indeed start to stoke inflation concerns. That would presumably force the European Central Bank to protect price stability by raising interest rates -- a move that could jeopardize the pallid economic recovery under way in countries like Germany and Italy.
Skittish bond investors have already started demanding higher yields on euro-denominated debt. That in turn could lead to higher costs for home mortgages and car loans, as well as loans for business.
Politically, the currency's weakness is likely to harden the resistance of countries that have thus far refused to adopt the euro, including Britain, Denmark and Sweden. British executives had been fairly strong supporters of adopting the euro in the next few years, but they have become increasingly cool. Many now see little real advantage in giving up the pound sterling.
Economists say the main reason for the euro's decline has been the remarkable strength of the American economy. It grew in the third quarter at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, compared with growth of about 2 percent among euro zone nations. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, predicts that the region's economies will grow by 3 percent over each of the next two years, outpacing the United States for the first time in years. But American growth remains so powerful and so visible that it continues to attract vast amounts of foreign capital.
Other events may have put additional pressure on the euro. Some analysts think that investors were shaken when the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, denounced the hostile takeover bid by Vodafone AirTouch of Britain against Mannesmann, the German engineering and telecommunications company.
That, combined with Mr. Schroder's decision to help bail out the bankrupt construction company Philipp Holzmann, generated worries that Germany, which accounts for one-third of the euro-zone's economy, might be tilting against free-market policies.
Mario Monti, the European Commission's chief of competition policy, suggested in Brussels today that Mr. Schroder's actions "may have been perceived" as protectionist by the financial markets.
In Frankfurt, Mr. Duisenberg made clear that he was not happy about recent German behavior, saying, "It does not enhance the image that we want to have of being an increasingly market-driven economy across the euro area."
But he insisted he remained confident that Europe could look forward to low inflation and stronger growth. Given that inflation remains well below the annual limit of 2 percent, Mr. Duisenberg said the bank did not need to raise interest rates or intervene on behalf of the euro in foreign-exchange markets. "I would become concerned," he said, "if -- what our strong belief is, the upward appreciation possibility of the euro, the future strength of the euro -- if that were not over time to materialize. But these things always take time."

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks an Opening to Iran, But Efforts Have Been Rebuffed

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
With a series of quiet approaches and inducements, the White House has tried to achieve a politically risky opening to Iran before President Clinton leaves office, administration officials say. But all of its efforts have been rebuffed.
The most dramatic of these initiatives, they said, was a secret message sent in August seeking the cooperation of Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, in solving the 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers, in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 American servicemen and wounded hundreds. 
 Last month the administration also sought talks on reopening consular offices in Tehran for the first time since relations were cut after the 1979 Islamic revolution. And it appears ready to waive sanctions against foreign oil companies that have signed multimillion-dollar contracts to do business in Iran.
While none of those efforts have borne fruit, Mr. Khatami's seemingly more open attitude toward the West has convinced the White House that Mr. Clinton has a political opening, if a narrow one, to turn the tide on 20 years of acrimony and failed relations with Iran.
Less clear, however, is whether Iran's reformers, who appear increasingly on the defensive, have that same room for maneuver.
Although it would like to re-establish some relations with Iran, the administration faces strong anti-Iranian sentiment in Congress and remains highly concerned about Iranian support of terrorism and the possibility that Tehran may seek to undermine Middle East peace talks as they near a critical, final phase.
The concern over terrorism is in part why the Khobar Towers bombing has provided the most immediate obstacle to resuming ties. And the attempt to gain Iranian cooperation in the case was the White House's most significant effort yet to try and tease out the moderates in Tehran and test their willingness and ability to engage the United States.
An agreement on Iranian cooperation would also leave the White House less vulnerable to criticism from Congress, where members have complained that the administration downplayed evidence that Iran was behind the Khobar attack so as to avoid having to retaliate.
Early this year or late last, American intelligence officials say, they obtained the most convincing information yet that Iranian officials may have been behind the attack.
These officials refused to describe that information, except to say it was not the kind that would stand up in court. But it was used, administration officials say, to try and exploit a deepening power struggle within Iran's government and see if Mr. Khatami was ready, or able, to split from the hard-liners and disavow his country's long support of terrorism.
A message from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Khatami was secretly drafted, requesting his cooperation in the Khobar case and asking him to try and stop other terrorist-related activities. That message sat unsent in the White House for months, until August, when it was finally delivered by Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk and a National Security Council aide, Bruce Reidel, at a meeting in Paris with officials from Oman, who passed it on.
While the message had been addressed personally to Mr. Khatami, the response came back from the government of Iran: it was not interested. Though the attempt failed, it was just one signal that Washington was eager to settle old disputes and deal with Tehran.
The administration has also gradually moved to soften economic and trade sanctions against Iran, which have in any case proven porous as American allies in Europe trade with Iran and have begun to normalize their relations with Tehran.
In April, the White House announced an exemption of commercial sales of food, medicine and medical equipment, enabling bulk sales of American grain to Iranian buyers. Last month, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group announced that it had reached an agreement with Iran to spend $800 million to develop two Iranian offshore oil fields.
American law prohibits investments of more than $40 million a year in Iran. Shell, with headquarters in Amsterdam and London, has large operating units in the United States, but a company official said it expected Washington to waive the sanctions, as it has with other oil companies that have signed contracts with Iran.
As the economic barriers start to slip, the administration continues to pursue what it calls its people-to-people initiatives, including visits of Iranian wrestling teams, scholars and artists to the United States.
At times in recent months, Mr. Clinton has seemed passionate about Iran. He has even talked in terms of reconciliation with an Islamic country that had suffered at the hands of the West.
At a black tie White House dinner in April, Mr. Clinton went out of his way to say he was trying to understand Iran. He said it was important to recognize that Iran "has been the subject of quite a lot of abuse from various Western nations."
"I think sometimes it's quite important to tell people, look, you have a right to be angry at something my country or my culture or others that are generally allied with us today did to you 50 or 60 or 100 or 150 years ago," the president said.
Saudi Arabia, one of America's most important allies in the Middle East, has already reached a kind of detente with the Iranians and an understanding that Tehran will end its support for terrorism in Saudi Arabia, American officials say. Iran has also agreed to Saudi demands to cut oil production to keep it in line with OPEC quotas, a move that has been a major factor behind the recent sharp rise in oil prices.
But while the Iranians are in the process of normalizing relations with many European and Arab nations, the United States still represents a deeply emotional issue for the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other conservative clerics who hold decisive power in the country.
In searching for an opening to Iran, the administration must try to deal with Ayatollah Khamenei, who has final authority over the intelligence services, the army, the police and the judiciary.
The less conservative Mr. Khatami, elected overwhelmingly two years ago, does not have control over the vital institutions of law and order. Though widely popular, he and his reform movement have struggled to assert themselves against the conservative clerical hierarchy. And they received a devastating blow last month when one of Iran's most outspoken reformers was sentenced to five years in prison.
Despite that setback, the Clinton administration has been encouraged by the fact that quiet pressure from the West prompted Mr. Khatami to intervene in the cases of 13 Iranian Jews arrested for spying.
American officials say they believe that Mr. Khatami was able to put the cases against the Iranian Jews on hold after Western allies made it clear to him that Iran could forget about relations with the West if their trials went forward. Mr. Khatami's intervention has led American officials to believe that his influence over Iran's security apparatus may be slowly growing.
Still, the White House knows that it has to wait for the outcome of parliamentary elections in Iran scheduled for February, in which the administration hopes that Mr. Khatami's candidates will come out on top.
"We are going to have elections in February in Iran, which we think will be very important and will, I think, give a signal as to the direction in which Iran wants to move," Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said last month.
Even if there is a positive outcome in February, the United States has demanded that Tehran disavow terrorism and give up efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction. Most urgently, administration officials believe that Iran represents a major threat to Middle East peace.
Indeed, in a major speech to the Asia Society in October, Mr. Indyk, the assistant secretary of state, said Iran stood out as a stronghold of terrorist groups while other countries were moderating their behavior. American officials say there are new and troubling signs of activity by Iranian-backed groups that could lead to terrorist attacks aimed at disrupting the ongoing Middle East peace negotiations.
Tehran's refusal to cooperate on Khobar Towers has led the administration to discuss Iranian involvement in the attack publicly for the first time. Officials said the United States had information concerning the involvement of "Iranian government officials and others."
Previously, the administration had been "very careful in skirting the issue that the Iranians were responsible for Khobar Towers," an official said. But recently, officials said that "we have not reached a conclusion regarding whether the attack was directed by the government of Iran," as one put it.
Such statements seem designed to separate Mr. Khatami from the Iranian religious hard-liners and intelligence officials who may have been behind the attack. American officials suggested that by making it clear that the United States does not hold Mr. Khatami and his supporters responsible, the administration might be able to come up with a solution to Khobar similar to that found in the case of the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 that killed 270 people.
There, the United States, Britain and the United Nations negotiated Libya's handover of two intelligence officers for trial in a specially arranged court in the Netherlands. But the government of Libya was not held responsible for the bombing.
The White House has already faced strong criticism from Congress that it has for years ignored or played down reports of Iranian involvement in the Khobar bombing in order to avoid having to take action against Tehran.
Early after the blast, the United States was told by Saudi and Jordanian intelligence officials that they believed that Iran was behind the attack, American intelligence officials said. The Jordanians also said Syria had provided logistical support.
American intelligence and law enforcement officials were at first skeptical of the reports, but have gradually began to reach a consensus that the Saudis were right.
In fact, the Saudis provided much circumstantial evidence of Iran's role early in the investigation, including the names of the Saudi Hezbollah suspects in Tehran. The administration also knew several months after the attack, according to officials, of the role played by a senior Iranian intelligence official based in Bahrain.
Now, three years later and with the new information on the Khobar case that prompted the message to Mr. Khatami, the attack remains a roadblock to relations with Iran, one that many in Congress would like to see cleared before the White House proceeds further.
At the recent Senate confirmation hearing for Mr. Indyk, nominated as ambassador to Israel, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, said of the Khobar Tower case, "My big fear is we won't pursue it because of some rapprochement with Iran."

HEADLINE: Medical Insurers Revise Cost-Control Efforts

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Some of the nation's biggest insurance companies say they are changing their tactics as they face a surging backlash against managed care.
Hoping to blunt the attack in Congress and the states, which has upset investors and depressed stocks of managed care companies, some insurers have eliminated or cut back on unpopular rules. They no longer require prior approvals for diagnostic tests or admission to a hospital, or referrals by a gatekeeper doctor for consultations with specialists. 
 Employers and economists worry that relaxing these mainstays of cost restraint may unleash a new round of inflation; cost increases are already climbing into double-digits.
But the insurance companies still have powerful cost-control weapons, both old and new, including some that are resented by doctors, hospitals and patients. Among the most important is more pressure than ever on hospitals to send patients home as soon as possible. Insurers like Humana and Kaiser Permanente are paying doctors to take over patients' cases in hospitals with an eye toward speeding up care and blocking unnecessary tests. Empire Blue Cross and many other companies are also monitoring patients with serious illnesses more closely to avert the need for hospitalization or emergency room care.
The insurers are also trying to persuade doctors to practice the way the most effective doctors do. Companies like Aetna U.S. Healthcare and UnitedHealthcare provide computerized records that show doctors how they compare with peers around the country on everything from timely cancer screenings to flu shots.
Insurers like Aetna and Empire are also prodding doctors by sending them lists of patients due for a reminder that it is time for a test.
The insurers have not forgotten, of course, how to negotiate lower fees for doctors and hospitals, argue over and delay payments, or refuse to pay for certain treatments. And they continue to shift more costs to patients. For instance, most health plans have sharply raised the patient's share of drug costs to as much as 30 percent or 40 percent for some expensive drugs, from as little as no charge at all or $5 to $15 per prescription.
The companies have not jettisoned all their "mechanisms" for pressuring doctors and hospitals, said Woody Grossman, a health care expert in Dallas with the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting firm. For example, he said, they may make public doctors' and medical groups' track records.
But insurers are emphasizing most that they are softening or eliminating several unpopular practices ushered in by managed care. The UnitedHealthcare Corporation, the second-largest health insurance company after Aetna Inc., announced last month that it was virtually ending the prior reviews of medical decisions, which physicians denounced as second-guessing. United said it had been approving 99 percent of the decisions anyway.
Health insurers around the country rushed out "me, too" statements. Most companies said they were already offering employers a choice of less restrictive plans while retaining the restrictions in other plans.
United said it was retraining 1,200 nurses who used to hold sway over approvals for most requests by physicians. To save on hospital costs and improve care, the nurses will track seriously ill patients, pressing hospitals to treat and discharge them promptly, and arranging follow-up care at home.
Many of the 49 state and regional Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are making other changes that are intended to appeal to customers. "We will have all new products next year," said Bob Greczyn, president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, the state's largest health insurance company.
To reduce the expense and annoyance of cumbersome paperwork, it is consolidating and shortening forms. One new program offers Blue Cross members 25 percent discounts on services like personal trainers, massage therapists and acupuncturists, with no insurance paperwork at all.
The North Carolina plan, like a number of big insurance companies, will routinely steer members with serious or chronic diseases into programs that remind them to take their medicines, eat and exercise appropriately and have checkups, again in an effort to keep them out of emergency rooms.
A number of big national managed care companies, including United, Aetna and Humana Inc., and Blue Cross plans in New York and California, are using advanced electronic software to track doctors and patients, based on information from claims for reimbursement.
Aetna and United, for example, give doctors periodic reports comparing them with similar doctors in their region. A United report in October on members treated by the Eagle Physicians group in Greensboro, N.C., showed 87 percent received a recommended blood pressure drug after congestive heart failure, up from 76 percent in January. That compared with 70 percent, on average, for similar primary care patients in North Carolina.
"It's a step in the right direction," said Dr. Jim Osborne, an internist who is treasurer of the Eagle group, which includes 50 doctors. Eagle posted the United results on its Internet site.
At Aetna, Richard Huber, the chief executive, said quarterly reports would be sent next year to 44,000 primary care groups, describing in detail how they compare with peers in dealing with heart, asthma and diabetes problems.
For heart patients, Aetna reports on 21 items like flu and pneumonia vaccinations, taking drugs that reduce cholesterol and blood pressure levels, visits to doctors and emergency rooms and feedback on whether patients were satisfied with the care.
"Giving physicians data showing the best practices is clearly superior to giving them a couple of extra dollars" in bonus money if they meet certain standards, said Dr. Dennis Tafflin, a family physician in Doylestown, Pa., whose four-doctor group has 3,300 Aetna patients.
For pressing problems like asthma, when an Aetna member buys an oral steroid, indicating a flareup, a nurse telephones the next morning to check on the person's condition. There may be a home visit and suggestions for care to make sure that the member does not end up in the hospital, said Dr. Carol Diamond, president of USQA, an Aetna unit.
Besides making greater use of data bases and information technology, the companies can still draw on older methods to get their way. "I don't believe you are going to lose cost control," said Joe Thompson, a vice president of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, which has 36,000 United States employees.
The insurance companies can still brandish their bargaining power, based on millions of members, to keep down payments to doctors and hospitals. And they still retain, although rarely use, the threat of rejecting doctors or institutions that object. Although some states restrict financial rewards for skimping on care, some companies still offer bonuses as rewards for desired behavior. In New York and a number of other states, some insurers reject hospital charges for days when patients had no treatments.
"We still have some companies that are fairly intrusive," who make it difficult to get a test done, said Dr. Hal Stoneking, an internist with Eagle Physicians in Greensboro. "Others have been user-friendly from the get-go."
Most companies still require prior approvals for expensive procedures like M.R.I. scans. Aetna requires approvals for about 20 procedures. Even United still requires approval for treatment of mental health conditions and alcohol and drug abuse.
Even when they drop prior approval, health plans still must be notified before expensive treatments. The plans hope that notification will have "a sentinel effect," reminding doctors of company guidelines. And, of course, they still review each case after the fact and refuse payment for procedures like cosmetic surgery that they do not cover.
Using another tactic, some insurers contract with doctors called hospitalists, who take over from a patient's primary physician while the patient is hospitalized. Managed care hospitalists work closely with company nurses to shorten hospital stays.
The hospitalist typically is in full charge of the patient, and some primary care doctors contend that the practice could jeopardize patients' long-term relationships with their doctors. But Humana says its hospitalists keep the primary doctors informed. Experts who have monitored the process say that any doubts about a hospitalist's medical decisions can be taken to the hospital's own reviewers by other doctors and nurses on the case.
Analysts said that by distancing themselves from medical decision making, the insurers may insulate themselves against medical malpractice lawsuits. But the backlash intensified last month as lawyers for health plan members filed the latest of at least 12 class-action lawsuits since early October. The suits essentially seek to force seven companies -- Aetna, the Cigna Corporation, Foundation Health Systems, United, Humana, Pacificare Health Systems and the Prudential unit of Aetna -- to eliminate financial incentives for restricting care.
Congress is also working on measures to rein in managed care companies, like a bill passed by the House this year that would allow patients to sue such companies. The issue will stay alive in the pre-election session next year. Without waiting, California and Georgia recently authorized lawsuits against the companies, following the example of Texas.
"The backlash against managed care is hard to reverse," said Katherine Swartz, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. She argued that the companies had lost the trust of consumers because they failed to keep "basic promises" to "deliver better quality medical care at lower prices."
Under the heading "The Death of Managed Care as We Know It," in a special issue of The Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, Professor Swartz said it might be that managed care organizations "inherently contain structural problems that make it impossible for consumers to trust physicians in managed care."

HEADLINE: Membership In Key Group Within U.N. Eludes Israel

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 2

 BODY:
A move to admit Israel to a group of European and other nations so it can take part more fully in United Nations activities seems to have stalled because the Europeans cannot muster a consensus, diplomats say.
Frozen out of its own regional group by Arab animosity, Israel is the only member barred from joining any other such group. The groups' purpose is to nominate countries and delegates to important positions within the organization, including the Security Council. Israel and the United States, backed by a media campaign and lobbying by the American Jewish Committee, had hoped to change that by the end of this General Assembly session. 
 "It's not a secret that there is not a consensus in the European Union now," said Marjatta Rasi, Finland's United Nations representative, who has led the European Union's contingent here for the last six months.
Last Friday, when European Union political officials met to try to reach consensus, Spain balked. In earlier discussions Ireland and Italy had reservations, diplomats say. Under European Union rules, all members must agree. Other members are Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland and Turkey.
Some members are concerned about another country's name on lists already too long to ensure that every country gets a chance to serve in coveted positions. Diplomats said that Israel could be asked to forgo claims on some nominations -- the Security Council first of all.
Kenneth Bandler, spokesman for the American Jewish Committee, said today that his organization opposed such compromises. Israel, he said, should have equal right to vie for seats on the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council and the World Court, among other bodies.
"Our principal concern today is that the European Union reach consensus on giving Israel, on a temporary basis, full membership in Weog," Mr. Bandler said in an interview, using the acronym for the Western European and Others Group. By that, he said, the panel means the right to compete across the board "just like any other member of a regional group, any other member of the United Nations."
Israel has never been accepted by the Asian regional group, which includes the Middle East. Israeli estrangement from the United Nations was at its most complete in 1975, when the General Assembly voted to list Zionism as a form of racism.
But since the end of the cold war Israel's position has improved. In 1991, during the Bush administration, the United States was able to muster the General Assembly votes to strike down the resolution on Zionism. The revival of peace talks under the government of Ehud Barak has added good will.
Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States representative to the United Nations, raised the issue when he took over here in late summer.
Until last week Israel's supporters thought the tide had turned. But the Europeans' inability to reach a consensus last Friday in Brussels has set back those hopes.

HEADLINE: Relocation Begins for Crash Site Residents

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Dec. 2

 BODY:
City and county officials today began relocating residents who did not want to return to their Kent Street neighborhood, where a small plane crashed last Friday morning, killing all 3 passengers and injuring 25 people on the ground.
At the same time, officials of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, began analyzing the single-engine Beech Bonanza's three gyroscopes, which were retrieved from the scattered debris. Transcripts of radio transmissions between the pilot, Itzhak Jacoby, and air traffic controllers show that he speculated that water got into his gyroscope just five minutes into the flight from Linden Airport to Dulles International Airport outside Washington. 
 Thirty Kent Street families have asked to be relocated, although officials estimate that only 11 of their homes are no longer habitable. At least two families had met city and county welfare requirements that would allow them into other apartments immediately. They have been living in temporary quarters at hotels or with relatives. Essex County welfare officials said that they had authorized a furniture allocation for one family and expected delivery within two days.
Newark's mayor, Sharpe James, said that the city had apartments available at five locations and that city workers had been taking victims of the crash to look at them.
Today, he showed off newly painted apartments in a city-owned building that had been scheduled to be auctioned. He said that he had removed the building from the auction and directed city workers to get it ready as an emergency housing resource.
The mayor said that the city's welfare office was ready to help some people immediately with rent and relocation assistance, but that office handles only the cases of single, unemployed people. Those who qualify for that program or who receive disability payments would qualify immediately for housing.
Others who qualify immediately for relocation aid are families in welfare programs administered by the county and state governments and financed in part by the federal government, said James J. Williams, director of the county division of welfare. Under that program, families can receive security deposits and up to $300 a month in rent assistance for a year.
All others, including working families without money for new furniture, rent and security payments and single people not receiving welfare, face a longer wait, perhaps three weeks, while they apply for the programs.
Mayor James said that many of those seeking relocation were not displaced by damage to their homes and apartments, but felt traumatized and did not want to remain or were seeking to upgrade their living conditions.
"We expect some opportunism," he said, "but we are addressing everyone up there as a victim and we are not debating the merits of their claims." He said priority would be given to those whose former homes were no longer habitable.
Across town as he showed off apartments at 374 Hillside Avenue, Mayor James renewed his criticism of the state for failing to declare the neighborhood where the plane crashed a disaster area, which would have freed money for cash payments for everyone.
For Rosella Reese, 84, today marked her return to the 27 Kent Street house where she has lived for 45 years and which she said was the only place she wanted to be. Standing in her cluttered living room, which looks out onto the site of the spot where the small plane hit before careering down Kent Street, setting cars ablaze, she pointed to the new windows that city workers had put in to replace those shattered and blown out by the radiating impact of the crash. She was also provided with two portable heaters with the help of city officials.
"I didn't want to get relocated because I had a hard enough time getting here," Mrs. Reese said, recalling the struggle that she and her late husband and six sons had scraping together the money to buy the two-story yellow frame house in 1954. "I'm not traumatized and I'm not worried about the neighborhood. I'll be the same."

HEADLINE: TALKS AND TURMOIL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
After Clinton's Push, Questions About Motive

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The rebellion that is getting all the attention here is the one that is happening on the streets, as protest groups who argue vociferously with each other about what's wrong with the global economy march together to insist that the system must change.
But an equally fascinating struggle is happening six floors up, in the convention center where President Clinton made a last appeal today to the representatives of the 135 nations gathered here. It is a struggle over how much influence the United States should have in rewriting the rules of the global economy. In those negotiations, the protests are fueled by suspicions that what's going on is an effort to tailor the global trading system to America's competitive strengths and Vice President Al Gore's campaign needs. 
 Mr. Clinton used his appearances to contend that developing countries can have it both ways. They can pay workers more and allow them to unionize, he said, or keep from spewing more pollutants into the air and water, without sacrificing economic growth. "I don't know if I've persuaded many of you," he said.
By all appearances, he has not persuaded many. The pervasive sense in the hallways here is that Mr. Clinton is making a shrewd calculation about how to protect two vital constituencies for Mr. Gore -- labor unions and environmental groups -- that have felt angry and alienated since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
Talk to the Indians or the French or the Japanese, and all say the same thing: behind the high-minded statements, the United States is hoping to seize an astounding moment of American power to satisfy powerful domestic constituencies. Why else, some have asked, would the United States insist that all e-commerce remain tariff-free? "Because you are the Microsoft economy," said one Japanese negotiator, referring to Seattle's hometown team.
And why else would the United States refuse to discuss its powerful antidumping laws as part of the negotiations, while insisting that labor and the environment be on the agenda? Because American labor unions demand that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore preserve the most potent weapon in its trade arsenal, diplomats from China and Eastern Europe say.
The United States seems intent on preserving its unilateral power to slap huge tariffs on imports that underprice similar goods made by American steelmakers or auto companies, they say.
And if you ask the smaller countries how the game is being played in Seattle, they contend that Mr. Clinton is trying to tilt the very playing field that he insists he is trying to level.
"They have continued with the old GATT way of doing business," said Victor Manuel, the trade representative of El Salvador, referring to the group that preceded the World Trade Organization and was dominated by the United States. "They think they can meet in small gatherings and then announce that the two or three most important countries have already come to a consensus. It is very hard for small countries to have any influence on the process."
Charges of American bullying are as old as international trade negotiations. They are also tactically useful. Countries that are as divided as the protesters outside can unify behind distaste for American power.
But the Seattle negotiations reveal that the suspicion about American motives has hardened, and the sound of presidential primaries in the background only fuels the skeptics.
Take Mr. Clinton's position on making labor rights a central part of the World Trade Organization's mission. Officially, the United States says it wants a "study group" within the W.T.O. that will examine questions like child labor, poor working conditions and perhaps even how much workers get paid for similar work in different countries.
India, Brazil, South Africa and other developing nations abhor the idea. A study group, they say, puts them on the slippery slope toward the day when the trade organization might impose trade sanctions against countries that it judges to be coming up short. And the system, they say, would be abused by the United States and other countries to do away with one big competitive advantage that the developing nations enjoy: the ability to pay workers less.
American officials have spent weeks trying to convince Asians, Africans and others that they have no such intent: the study group is there to study. Then Mr. Clinton stepped on their lines. In an interview with The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, published on the first day of the talks, he said the working group "should develop these core labor standards, and then they ought to be a part of every trade agreement, and ultimately I would favor a system in which sanctions would come for violating any provision of a trade agreement."
That confirmed the worst suspicions of many countries. A few reportedly threatened to walk out of the labor talks. Mr. Clinton's aides have spent the past day here backtracking, beginning sentences with phrases like, "What the President meant to convey was." The question is: Did Mr. Clinton's position harden perhaps to satisfy union leaders who are still fuming about letting China into the W.T.O. and are threatening to do little to help Mr. Gore, or was he just speaking carelessly?
Richard Feinberg, a former National Security Council official attending the meeting, said the president's comments on sanctions "undercut the position of his own negotiators."
"Clinton is spending an inordinate amount of his remaining political capital pushing this will-o'-the-wisp that his negotiating team told him is not obtainable," he added. "In balancing domestic and international concerns, he is clearly tilting very far in the domestic direction."
Even some of Mr. Clinton's toughest critics, though, say he is in an impossible situation: he needs to press a political agenda at home -- a pro-labor, pro-environment agenda -- that he cannot sell abroad.
"Personally, I thought he made a very good speech," said Francois Huwart, the French minister of trade, reflecting in an interview this afternoon on Mr. Clinton's contention that over time, countries with high labor and environmental standards will attract new investment and boost their productivity.
"But it is a speech," he said. "And you have to look closely at the negotiations. There may be a decalage between the way Mr. Clinton's speech sounds and the negotiations."

Flash-Frozen G.O.P.

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H.

 BODY:
The Republican presidential debate last night was awesome. George W. Bush chained himself to the podium to protest a rule banning use of consultants on stage, while Steve Forbes, who was dressed up as a giant turtle, attacked Captain Nemo's Fast Food Fish Fry restaurant in downtown Manchester . . .
Stopstopstopstop. Sorry, we've gotten the debate mixed up with the far more eventful World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. All that excitement over something that used to be called GATT has given the presidential campaigns new hope. If people are taking a genuine interest in the W.T.O. today, perhaps tomorrow they'll become enthralled with John McCain's position on the Internet tax and Mr. Bush's plan for the Department of Education. 
 Mr. Bush seemed pretty confident as he faced off against Senator McCain, Mr. Forbes et al., considering this was only the third political debate of his entire life. Granted, the format was actually closer to a spelling bee. And granted, he might be well advised to quit bragging about the foreign-policy experience he got as governor of Texas. But Mr. Bush bore up bravely, even when Senator Orrin Hatch had the temerity to attack his Web page as "not user-friendly."
(Many of you have called to ask for tips on how to distinguish Mr. Forbes from Mr. Hatch, each of whom resembles an assistant principal in one of those high school high-jinks movies. The answer is that Mr. Forbes is the one who doesn't blink, while Mr. Hatch is the one who looks as if he just smelled something awful.)
Although Senator Hatch called the debate "kind of boring," it had its moments, the most hilarious of which was Mr. Hatch's own proposal that he and the other candidates all get on a bus together and spend two weeks traveling through Iowa and New Hampshire "like Lincoln and Douglas." Mr. Bush repeatedly demonstrated his incredible ability to respond to virtually any query by pointing out that he had been elected governor twice. It worked last night, even when the original question was what he reads. Unfortunately, Mr. Bush is the one candidate whom we need these debates in order to get to know better.
Senator McCain, like Al Gore, has become almost compulsively available -- he's done more than 50 town hall forums in New Hampshire alone. We will not even go into the other candidates. Express a little interest, and they'll not only answer questions, they'll come to your house and paint your kitchen.
In another primary milestone this week, the weather in New Hampshire has gotten extremely cold. That enables us to determine how many of the contenders plan to follow the old tradition, pioneered by John Kennedy, and demonstrate their toughness by dressing as if it's springtime in Los Angeles, even when the temperature is hovering around zero. "The report was that Kennedy had long underwear on, but he denied it," says Michael York, the state librarian.
Bill Bradley, ever the sartorial iconoclast, has already been spotted wearing a long dark-blue overcoat, although he has not gone so far as to put on a hat or gloves. A spokesman for Mr. McCain said the Arizona senator had a coat on hand, but had yet to actually wear it. Mr. Bush seems to be plowing yet another moderate path -- coat on, but unbuttoned.
This time of year, you always start worrying about the William Henry Harrison effect. Harrison, the Whig candidate for president in 1840, was troubled by talk that he was too old for the job -- or, as one newspaper put it, "a living mass of ruined matter." (Those were the days, people, when snippy columnists really knew how to snip.) In response, Harrison started demonstrating his youthful endurance by giving extremely long speeches -- although, of course, he was always careful never to say anything specific in them. He gave the longest speech of all at his inauguration, in the cold rain, thus proving his virility so conclusively he died a month later of pneumonia.
Nothing quite that bad -- or interesting -- has ever happened in New Hampshire, but this particular race is full of people from places like Texas and Arizona, so you always worry. Just as you wonder whether voter turnout would improve if the candidates started being tailed by hundreds of protesters dressed as endangered species.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Sales Begin at New Phase Of Hudson River Complex

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Sales are under way at the 134 condominium apartments and town houses that make up the first new phase of housing in a decade at Port Liberte, the luxury community on a slice of the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City.
The project now moving forward is a less elaborate version of the original, which was conceived during the mid-80's construction boom as a 125-acre village on Venetian-style canals. That plan was derailed by a subsequent recession and became a symbol of the real estate market's slide in the early 1990's. Only 363 of the 1,690 units proposed were built -- 189 of them completed and sold and 174 unsold and unfinished -- when construction halted in 1990. 
 The new units, with 800 to 2,700 square feet each, will be slightly smaller than the earlier ones, but will have the same brick and stucco exteriors, gabled roof and views of the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline. Plans to complete what had been planned as 2 1/2 miles of canals have been scrapped -- half a mile was completed in the earlier phase -- but an 18-hole golf course, a first for Jersey City, is to be added.
In the month since sales began, contracts have been signed for 40 of the one- to three-bedroom units, said David B. Barry, a senior vice president at the Applied Companies of Hoboken, N.J., the developer that took over the project in 1994, three years after the original developer went bankrupt.
Mr. Barry said prices for the units, most with garages and some of the larger ones with dens, are $180,000 to $650,000, or an average of $225 a square foot, compared with the $200 a square foot buyers paid for the original units. Over the years, Mr. Barry said, the value of the original units dropped by as much as half before rebounding.
Bernard Hartnett, president of the Port Liberte Homeowners Association, said of the project's seesawing fortunes, "From where we were, in the pit, we've come back pretty well."
He said he had paid $360,000 for his two-bedroom, 1,700 square foot duplex with harbor views in 1988 and would have been lucky to sell it for $200,000 when the market, and the project, collapsed. Today, based on sales of the original units at the complex in the last six months, he estimates he would be able to sell his unit for about $450,000.
Most residents, he added, knew there would be changes, particularly to the canals, which he said were "extraordinarily expensive and probably the sinkhole" of the first phase, when construction resumed.
Applied paid $9 million in 1994 to take over the unfinished portion of the project from its lenders after the original developer, Port Liberte Partners, went bankrupt.
The partners, including Tex McCrary, the onetime TV personality, and Francois Spoerry, a French architect, unsuccessfully tried to adapt Mr. Spoerry's concept at Port Grimaud, a waterfront project in St.-Tropez, France.
By 1996, Applied had completed and sold the 174 unfinished units in the first phase of the project. The next year, it acquired the rest of the project for $7 million, reduced it by 37 units to a total of 1,290, and substituted the planned golf course for the canals.
The course will straddle part of the existing Port Liberte site and 80 adjacent acres, once an oil-tank farm, and will be developed by Applied and the partnership that owns the former oil facility, Lasmo Petroleum Inc., the United States arm of the London-based Lasmo P.L.C., and the Pittston Company of Richmond, Va.
With the golf course, "the project gets more open space and an amenity that will be used more by residents and will add more value to the community," he said. But, he added, "we never wavered from proceeding with the project as a luxury condominium, because we think there is a market for such units."
The project's new phase reflects the second wave of development along the Hudson's west bank since the 1991-92 recession. Most of the projects in this cycle, which resumed in mid-1995, are luxury rentals, for which financing is more readily available than for condominiums, said Robert Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City.
With the economy strong and rental rates rising, "there is a market for waterside condominiums, and demand exceeds the supply," he said.
In addition to the revived Port Liberte, a few new condominium developments are being built by K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., which has sold all but six of the 274 such units it is developing in West New York at an average price of $450,000. The firm is now building 18 more expensive units, as well as 154 additional units in adjacent Guttenberg. In Hoboken, Applied is constructing a 170-unit condominium as part of its Shipyard project, which eventually will contain 1,160 mostly rental as well as condominium units.
More condominium projects are planned along the waterfront. One is a three-building, 330-unit complex in West New York that Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., will build in phases, with the first 100-unit building to start this spring.

HEADLINE: TALKS AND TURMOIL: WORKERS' RIGHTS;
U.S. EFFORT TO ADD LABOR STANDARDS TO AGENDA FAILS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The Clinton administration failed today to rally broad support among nations to add labor standards to the World Trade Organization agenda, threatening its most important goal at a meeting here that has been plagued by sometimes violent protests.
Caught between clashing demands of poor nations and the American labor movement, the administration struggled to work out a compromise that would have the trade organization set up a study group on labor standards. Such a move is widely seen as a first step toward having the body consider issues like child labor and workers' rights when setting trade rules. 
 But the negotiations, never easy, stumbled badly after President Clinton stunned the delegates, and even his own negotiators, when he told The Seattle Post-Intelligencer this week that the trade group should at some point use sanctions to enforce core labor rights around the world.
His suggestion went well beyond the official administration line that it was pushing members of the trade organization merely to set up a study group on labor issues -- not to punish countries that do not live up to the Western ideas of labor rights.
The president ended his day-and-a-half visit here and left Seattle today. The meeting is scheduled to end on Friday afternoon.
The Egyptian trade minister, Youssef Boutros-Ghali, said the proposal on sanctions derailed any hope of a compromise agreement on the issue. "If you start using trade as a lever to implement nontrade related issues," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said, "that will be the end of the multilateral trading system, maybe not this year, but in 10 to 15 years."
A trade minister from Pakistan, discussing labor issues at a negotiating session today, used blunt language on the matter, according to one Western official who was briefed on the meeting. "We will block consensus on every issue if the United States proposal goes ahead," the official quoted the Pakistani minister as saying. "We will explode the meeting."
Administration officials spent much of the day seeking to calm the storm that Mr. Clinton's comments had produced. Officials said they were looking to assure other countries that his use of the word sanctions did not amount to a mandate for the trade group to dictate labor standards or to punish countries that failed to live up to them.
"There's no question that our effort to have a working group of trade and labor is a tough fight, and one that has required us to do significant amounts of outreach to try to explain what the intent and purpose of this is," said Gene Sperling, the president's economic adviser. "By no means would we ever want something dealing with core labor standards to ever be used as a facade or guise to do anything that would be harmful to developing countries."
The American labor movement's campaign to link trade rules with workers' rights has emerged as a pivotal issue at the ministerial meeting of the trade organization here, where 135 nations are wrangling over a multitude of issues like biotechnology and subsidies for farm exports.
The meeting has been the target of thousands of protesters, who have demanded that the trade group do more to protect the environment and the interests of workers. The protests, which were marred by an outbreak of violence on Tuesday, dwindled today. But opponents of the group marched on the King County Jail this afternoon to demand the release of 500 people who were arrested as the police sought to restore order to downtown.
Mr. Clinton signed a treaty today that bars the most abusive forms of child labor, including the use of children as indentured laborers or in prostitution, mines and armies. Mr. Clinton said the treaty should be a model for enforcing other labor rights.
The European Union trade minister, Pascal Lamy, voiced concern that there was so much friction at the talks that they could fall apart without fulfilling the goal of setting up an agenda for a fresh round of talks, tentatively dubbed the Millennium Round, that would last for three years and aim at further reducing trade barriers.
The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, was far more upbeat, saying the talks were moving steadily forward. She said that progress had been made on a range of issues and that she remained optimistic that members would agree to a negotiating framework for the future talks.
Angering many developing countries, the American labor movement has pressed the Clinton administration to make the World Trade Organization allow members to impose trade sanctions on other nations that violate basic workers' rights like prohibitions on child labor and the right to form trade unions.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O., already upset at Mr. Clinton over his trade deal with China, pressed him fiercely this week to gain an agreement that could ultimately lead to letting trade sanctions be used against countries that violate basic workers' rights.
The thousands of protesters who paralyzed Seattle this week have also pressed the administration to use the talks to make W.T.O. rules what they consider friendlier to labor, human rights and the environment.
But India, Brazil and Egypt, taking the lead for the developing world, sought to block the creation of a panel that could lead to trade sanctions over labor rights. Many ministers from developing countries said such sanctions could be disguised protectionist measures that would be used to ban imports from developing countries.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali attacked Mr. Clinton's call to link trade with labor rights. "It is nonsensical," he said. "The question is why all of a sudden, when third world labor has proved to be competitive, why do industrial countries start feeling concerned about our workers? When all of a sudden there is a concern about the welfare of our workers, it is suspicious."
Administration officials suggested gingerly that they might move toward a compromise European Union proposal that would set up a group outside the World Trade Organization to study the link between trade and labor rights.
Opposing such a compromise, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., John Sweeney, insisted at a private meeting with Mr. Clinton that any working group should make its recommendations directly to the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Sweeney's approach, union officials say, would accelerate the timetable for the trade group to adopt enforceable labor rights. "I reiterated to the president how important it was to get these things in our trade agreements," Mr. Sweeney said in an interview. "The president says he's all for it. But he said he's having a tough time with the developing countries."
White House officials fear that if they disappoint American labor, that could badly hurt Vice President Al Gore, who is counting on unions' support in his campaign for the presidency. Mr. Sweeney indicated that if disappointed, the unions would redouble their efforts to press Congress to defeat the president's trade pact with China.
Several trade officials said Mr. Clinton clearly intended to soften developing countries' opposition to an accord on labor rights by granting them two large concessions on Wednesday. He announced that the United States would cut tariffs on developing world exports and would ease patent rules to enable developing countries to buy pharmaceuticals more cheaply.
But the administration was still having trouble having the developing countries agree to a panel that makes recommendations to the Word Trade Organization.
The trade minister of Kenya, Nicholas Biwott, said, "The best forum to deal with such matters is the International Labor Organization." That organization is an international body under the United Nations that researches labor issues and promotes workers' rights, but has minimal enforcement powers.
For years, labor leaders around the world have complained that the I.L.O. is a toothless, underfinanced agency unable to stop child labor and to protect other rights.
The European Union has proposed setting up a forum in which the World Trade Organization, the International Labor Organization, the International Monetary Fund and multilateral groups examine how globalized trade affects workers around the world.
America's organized labor, which is critical to Mr. Gore's political future, wants any such group to be a part of the World Trade Organization. "We don't care what it's called," Mr. Sweeney said. "You can call it anything you want, so long as it is done the way we want and is part of the W.T.O."

HEADLINE: Indictments Describe Reach of New Jersey Crime Family

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
New Jersey's most powerful organized crime family has broadened its reach into New York City, working with four local Mafia families to carry out murder, truck hijackings and other crimes over the last 10 years, the authorities said yesterday.
The accusations came as federal prosecutors in Manhattan unsealed indictments charging 39 people, 15 of whom were said to be members or associates of the New Jersey organization, the DeCavalcante crime family. 
 Ten other defendants were described by officials as linked to the Gambino, Bonanno, Colombo and Luchese families in New York.
The charges were the first major prosecution of the New York faction of the DeCavalcantes, said Mary Jo White, the United States attorney in Manhattan. Ms. White said the impact of the case should be to "significantly disrupt and weaken the hierarchy of the DeCavalcante family itself, and to effectively decimate" its presence in New York City.
The crime family, which until now has been "virtually untouched" in New York, as Police Commissioner Howard Safir put it yesterday, is based in Elizabeth, N.J., but has had a historic alliance with the Gambino family in New York.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation official said yesterday that the DeCavalcantes have about 75 so-called soldiers integrated into 5 crews, at least 2 of which are operating in New York City.
The family derives about 60 percent of its income from illegal activity in New York, and its members are "made," or formally accepted as members, by the Gambino family and report to it, the F.B.I. official said.
In announcing the charges yesterday, the officials made clear that despite the government's relentless pressure on the Mafia in recent years in New York, the predictions of its demise have been premature.
"This investigation confirms that those who declare the death of the mob do so at their own peril," said Lewis D. Schiliro, the assistant director of the F.B.I. in charge of its New York office.
Indeed, he and Ms. White said, the crime families have thrived over the decades, particularly in alliances and joint venture arrangements in their attempts to infiltrate and control both legal and illegal businesses.
"There is almost as long a history of interfamily negotiations and profit sharing as there is of conflict and bloodshed," Mr. Schiliro said.
Among those charged yesterday was Vincent Palermo, 54, whom officials described as an acting boss of the DeCavalcante family in charge of its operations in New York. The indictment said Mr. Palermo was also on a "ruling panel comprised of three high-ranking members," which had supervisory authority over the crime family's activities.
The charges against Mr. Palermo included racketeering, murder, extortion, loan-sharking and gambling, and Ms. White's office said that he was one of three defendants in the case who could face the death penalty, if prosecutors decided to seek it.
Mr. Schiliro said that the indictments were the culmination of a two-year investigation. Officials said 35 of the defendants were arrested yesterday in four states, including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Nevada.
A federal magistrate judge, James C. Francis IV, ordered Mr. Palermo held without bond after a request by prosecutors last night, pending a bail hearing scheduled for Dec. 13.
Mr. Palermo's lawyer did not return a call left on his office answering machine last night.
The indictments, which totaled 76 pages, described a pattern of racketeering and other criminal activity by various defendants that dated back to 1989, and included one murder and two attempted murders, extortion and collection of loan-sharking debts from businesses, the attempted sale of counterfeit Tommy Hilfiger and Jordache goods, and a fraudulent stock scheme.
The stolen property ring's actions included the hijacking of a truck of refrigerated Kraft food, the indictment said, as well as the stealing of other truckloads of goods, including 2,250 cases of wine, 29,000 packages of Centrum vitamins, and 56 Minolta digital copiers and pallets of toner.
Prosecutors are seeking forfeiture to the United States government of $2.5 million in proceeds of the illegal activity, the indictment said.
Ms. White also announced that two other men had been indicted yesterday in a related case, the armed robbery of two Brink's security guards in January 1998 as they were delivering money to an office in the World Trade Center.
Officials would not elaborate on how the Brink's robbery was related to the organized crime indictments, except to say there was a connection. Three other men previously had been arrested in the robbery, in which about $1 million was taken.
One expert on the mob, James B. Jacobs, a law professor at New York University, said that the charges suggest that despite recent, widely publicized incursions into Wall Street and other legitimate businesses, most of the efforts of organized crime will continue to be centered in the black markets.
"The purging of the mob from the legitimate economy in many ways is easier to do," he said, "because these are all regulated industries."
"You can't really regulate people out of illegal activity," added Professor Jacobs, author of "Gotham Unbound: How New York City Was Liberated From the Grip of Organized Crime."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From New Hampshire Debate Involving G.O.P. Presidential Candidates

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from comments in the candidates forum last night in Manchester, N.H., involving Gary L. Bauer, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Steve Forbes, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Alan Keyes and Senator John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by The New York Times: 

Mr. McCain
 
Q. Senator McCain, in your home state of Arizona and in Washington, D.C., fellow Republicans make an issue of your temper. It is one thing to feel passionate about the issues, but why is it that those who know you best seem to like you the least? . . .
 
A. You know, a comment like that really makes me mad. The fact is I have very close and dear friends in Arizona and in the Senate and in the House and very dear friends all over America, I'm happy to say. Do I feel passionately about issues? Absolutely. When I see the Congress of the United States spend $6 billion on unnecessary, wasteful, pork-barrel spending and we have 12,000 enlisted families, brave men and women, on food stamps, yeah, I get angry.
And you know a lot of those young people have come up and said to me "Thanks for fighting for me." If everybody who wants the status quo in Washington wants that to remain so, then I'm not their guy. But I can assure you, Karen, that I'm going to change the status quo in Washington. We're going to rid the government of the special interests . . .
 
Mr. Forbes
 
Q. You've got an ad on the air now, quickly put together with a telephone call, in which you accuse Governor Bush of a betrayal on Social Security because he has considered raising the age. Is it fair to criticize someone simply for considering an option which is on nearly everybody's list of what to do about that program -- to call it a betrayal? . . .
 
A. It's typical of a political culture today to make promises and then break the promises. And Governor Bush, the other day on "Meet the Press," said he would consider raising the retirement age. It's already been raised from 65 to 67. That's a betrayal. Now what are they going to raise Governor -- 70, 75? That's not fair to the people. . . .
You know in politics, especially on Social Security -- where they've raised the retirement age, tax benefits, when they weren't supposed to -- you know that's code for we're going to do it. Guaranteed it's going to happen. And that's why the place to attack it and fight it is now. . . .
 
Mr. Bush
 
Q. I'm going to give you a chance to respond to that. Is this code for "We're going to do it"?
 
A. I was asked a question about my plans to make sure Social Security was safe and secure. I said we need to take all the payroll taxes aiming for Social Security and dedicate it to only Social Security. I said we need personal savings account for younger workers. But what I said on that show was that we're going to keep our solemn commitment to people who've retired and near retired as far as their benefits go. And they asked me about younger workers. I said, I hope we're able to keep the benefits the same for younger workers, as well. But the key thing is to have somebody who knows how to lead, to bring people together to solve the Social Security system. We need leadership in Washington, D.C., to make sure there is a sound Social Security system. . . .
 
Q. Governor you have said that you would always have people around you as president who would be able to fill in any gaps in your knowledge of the world and the players on the world stage. But let me ask you, do think that President Bush could've done the job he did in assembling and holding together the Gulf War coalition composed of many very varied nations, had he not had the knowledge of the world that he had from years of experience in diplomacy, in politics at the U.N.
 
A. In order to be a good president when it comes to foreign policy it requires someone with vision, judgment and leadership.
I've been the governor of the second biggest state in the United States. If it were a nation it would be the eleventh largest economy in the world. I was overwhelmingly re-elected because the people in my state realized I know how to lead and I've shown good judgment. . . .
There's only one person on this stage, only one person, who's been in a chief executive officer position in terms of government. That's me, governor of the second biggest state. I've had foreign policy as governor of Texas and that is with Mexico. And I've handled it well, I've got good relations with President Zedillo. I've built a -- I've built bridges of trust so that when we deal with problems, common problems, we can do so in the spirit of cooperation not a spirit of animosity.
 
Mr. Bauer
 
Q. If you could only do one thing as president, what would it be?
 
A. My goodness. What a great question. I'm tempted in a lot of different areas to answer that. Obviously, my strong position about the sanctity of life is something that I don't think we're going to get anything else right in America if we don't get this right. We've only made a mistake like this once before, Brit, and that was way back in the 1850's in the Dred Scott case when the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, said that black men and women had no rights that the rest of us were bound to respect. And we look back on that and we're astonished that the court would say such a thing. The poison of that decision still keeps Americans apart today. . . .
 
Mr. Forbes
 
Q. Mr. Forbes, set aside your flat tax for the moment, if you would. What would you advocate, as President, to keep us away from inflation and out of economic recession?
 
A. Well, that's very easy, and that is to have a Federal Reserve that keeps the dollar sound. And unfortunately today, Karen, we have a Federal Reserve that is starting to tighten up, raise interest rates because of a bogus economic theory that says that prosperity causes inflation. So, unlike George Bush, I'm not sure I'm going to reappoint Alan Greenspan, if he's addicted to that theory. It's a destructive one. It has already done immense harm to agriculture in America. And if he continues in that course of action, it's going to do real harm to the economy. . . .
 
Mr. McCain
 
Q. Senator McCain, where do you come out on this question of this stock market as high as it is and on the issues that have just been asked of Mr. Forbes, relating to Mr. Greenspan, who seems at times alarmed by the level of the stock market. . . .
 
A. I share Mr. Greenspan's concern. And by the way, I would not only reappoint Mr. Greenspan; if Mr. Greenspan should happen to die, God forbid, I would do like they did in the movie "Weekend at Bernie's", I would prop him up and put a pair of dark glasses on him and keep him as long as we could. The fact is that Mr. Greenspan deserves great credit, great credit for this economic recovery. He's been a steady hand. He's unintelligible, but he's had a very steady hand on the tiller and I am a great admirer and an advocate of his policies and programs.
 
Mr. Hatch
 
Q. Senator Hatch, you have two minutes now for your closing statement. . . .
 
A. It seems to me that the way -- what we ought to really do is we ought to leave the entourage behind. We ought to get out there and understand that the American people, they want us as presidents for the good or the bad. They want us to be a good president during the good times, they want us to be able to help them during bad times. . . .
I just have a suggestion to all of us. Why don't we just take two weeks in the month of January and spend a week here in New Hampshire, a week in Iowa; get on a bus, all of us, leave the entourage behind, and just go throughout this state and meet with the people and let them set the standards, let them set the terms.
Do it in town meetings, and let them ask any questions they want and let's just respond to them. Let's kind of be like Lincoln and Douglas and really have a debate here rather than, you know, the stilted thing that we're doing.

HEADLINE: Senate Republicans in Albany Propose Gradually Reducing State Utility Tax

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 2

 BODY:
Setting the stage for what is likely to be a lively fight over enacting a new state budget next year, State Senate Republican leaders today proposed eliminating a tax on utility companies that adds several dollars a month to the average New Yorker's gas and electric bills.
The gross receipts tax, as it is known, has long been among the most unpopular taxes collected by the state. It is passed along by utility companies to consumers, increasing rates for residential customers as well as business owners, particularly those in industries that use a lot of electricity. 
 But the tax brings the state about $800 million a year, making many lawmakers reluctant to repeal it altogether because they worry that they will be forced to reduce important state services to make up for the lost tax revenues.
The Senate plan would gradually reduce the tax during the next three years, cutting state revenues by $710 million by 2003. Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, said the plan would allow electric companies to reduce their rates and thereby make New York a more attractive place to live and do business.
"The gross receipts tax is a hidden tax on consumers and business, but its effects are quite clear: higher utility costs that make it more expensive to live and create jobs in New York State," Mr. Bruno said in a statement. He said the plan would bring New York's utility rates, among the highest in the nation, in line with those of other states.
The plan is the centerpiece of a wide-ranging package of tax cuts that Senate Republicans say they intend to push during the 2000 legislative session, which begins next month. Mr. Bruno's aides said he intended to release details of the Republicans' package over the next few weeks.
The Senate plan represents the opening bid in what is expected to be a lively debate over how to use a budget surplus that some estimate would total at least $2.5 billion when the state ends its fiscal year on March 31.
In the Legislature, the plan drew a tepid response from Democratic leaders, who said they intended to focus on financing for education, job creation programs and health care. Even the Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who has championed tax cuts, declined to endorse the Senate plan. The state has cut taxes for the last five years, raising concern among independent fiscal monitors that the new multiyear tax reductions could hamper the state's ability to deliver services, particularly if there is an economic downturn.
In fact, Moody's Investors Service, one of Wall Street's major bond rating companies, released a report today showing that the state would face a $1.1 billion budget shortfall for the 2000-01 fiscal year. That figure, the report said, is expected to grow to $5.8 billion by the 2001-02 fiscal year, because state spending on multiyear tax cuts and other programs enacted in previous budgets is expected to outpace the state's revenues.
Even with that, there has been strong support across the state, particularly among business leaders, for eventually eliminating the gross receipts tax because power companies pass it directly to their customers, increasing the state's already high utility costs for the poor and the wealthy alike. The proposal has had substantial support on Long Island, where residents pay among the highest electric rates in the United States.
In recent years, lawmakers have reduced the surcharge on the gross receipts tax to 3.25 percent, from 4.25 percent. The Senate plan would eliminate the surcharge altogether, potentially passing on savings to consumers. For example, a person in New York City with a $1,377-a-year gas and electric bill would save about $55 once the tax was eliminated, according to Senate analysts.
Business leaders, who have long complained about the tax, praised the Senate's plan, saying it would encourage many companies to expand in New York. "Eliminating the gross receipts tax on electricity and gas would put a very positive jolt in New York's economic recovery," said Daniel B. Walsh, the president of the Business Council of New York State, a statewide chamber of commerce.
"Today's proposal," he added, "not only assails one of our most anticompetitive taxes, it also reminds us that we have started but not finished the job of tax reductions. The gross receipts tax is the major culprit in keeping New York's energy costs well above average."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"A China Dissident's Ordeal: Back to the Mental Hospital" (news article, Nov. 30) reminds one of the worst of the Soviet Union. Yet we also read of the understandable desire to increase economic ties with China, in large part for financial gain and in some part on the premise that economic exchanges may help alleviate, over time, that country's repressive political climate. At what point should moral revulsion have priority over economic activity and hoped for, but not assured, political improvement?

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
More and More Malaysians Question Economic Policies

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 3

 BODY:
With all due respect to Frank Sinatra, investors here have had just about enough of "My Way."
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad adopted Sinatra's swan song as the anthem for his election campaign last month to remind voters how he had steered Malaysia through Asia's financial crisis while spurning foreign succor and remonstration. The public responded on Monday by giving his ruling National Front a majority and a five-year reprise to his 18-year tenure as prime minister. 
 But behind the election results and the stock market's slump the day after, analysts and investors say, is a growing impatience with Malaysia's failure to take the kind of financial and corporate medicine that the International Monetary Fund has prescribed for Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. Mr. Mahathir appears to have won little gratitude for having spared Malaysia whatever humiliation might have come from inviting foreign assistance.
"There are a lot of people not entirely happy with him," said Fiona Leong, head of research at the J. M. Sassoon brokerage firm.
Instead, Mr. Mahathir's policies and antiforeign talk appear to have alienated the foreign investment-fund managers whom Malaysia needs to finance its shift from a high-technology manufacturing base to a service economy, as companies relocate production to countries with cheaper labor like China.
Such dissatisfaction may seem out-of-place considering Malaysia's current economic vigor. After slipping into recession in 1998 and imposing controls on currency flows in and out of the country that fixed its exchange rate, Malaysia has returned to growth that economists estimate could exceed 5 percent this year. The sidewalks of downtown Kuala Lumpur have become a battle zone of jackhammers and fake French cafes.
Economists say this Malaysian renaissance has less to do with Mr. Mahathir's policies than with a cyclical rebound generated by demand for Asian exports from the United States and Europe.
"It's just a cyclical upswing," said William Belchere, head of Merrill Lynch's fixed-income research in Singapore.
The electoral returns themselves provide some insight into the disillusionment with Mr. Mahathir. The ruling coalition's share of the votes dropped to roughly 56 percent from more than 65 percent when elections were last held in 1995. Thanks to a redrawing of constituencies in 1996, that was enough to secure more than three-quarters of the seats up for grabs. But Mr. Mahathir's own party, the United Malays National Organization, saw more than one-fifth of its seats taken away.
Much of this popularity was lost in more conservative Muslim northern states, with a second state falling into the hands of the Islamic Party of Malaysia. Though less developed, the area is rich in natural resources, and investors worry that this new opposition state will copy its predecessor and impose Islamic law, curbing its appetite for such lucrative pastimes as gambling and drinking alcohol. Analysts also worry that the opposition gains could presage broader dissension once Mr. Mahathir, who is 73, leaves office.
Another potent source of discontent comes from the middle-class communities and industrial enclaves in the state surrounding the capital. There, the National Front's share of votes fell from roughly 75 percent to 55 percent.
Foreign investors are also leery, with many still smarting from what they regard as Mr. Mahathir's caprice and his unfounded accusations that a Jewish-led conspiracy has sought to undermine Malaysia's economy.
As part of an effort to repair its economy, Malaysia also outlawed trade in Malaysian shares overseas, a move that overnight shut down a lively market in Singapore and left 172,000 investors with roughly $4 billion in Malaysian shares they could not sell. Fund managers say the still-unresolved issue is yet another example of discrimination against foreign shareholders.
"If they're serious about reform, and they want to be fair, why do they lock these guys up?" asked J. Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund.
Mr. Mobius, who says he has pulled $2 billion out of Malaysia since it imposed capital controls, is spearheading a campaign by fund managers to persuade Morgan Stanley Capital International to reconsider its August decision to reinclude Malaysia in its influential model portfolios. Because so many funds use Morgan Stanley's portfolios as a benchmark to measure their own performance, he says, Malaysia's reinclusion would obligate many fund managers to invest there regardless of what Mr. Mobius says are considerable political risks.
In late October, Morgan Stanley announced that it would delay the return of Malaysia to its key indexes from Feb. 29 until May 31 to avoid any potential problems caused to computers by the leap year.
"Thank God they listened to our advice," Mr. Mobius said.

HEADLINE: Trump's Judgment

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd's Nov. 28 column, "Trump Shrugged," captured Donald Trump's hollowness as a candidate and as a person. His main claim to fame is success in accumulating money and buildings, so it is not surprising that he puts these accomplishments forward as his chief qualification for the highest office in the land. 
 But when Mr. Trump brags that he is also successful in getting dates, I wonder about his judgment. Does he think women will vote for a candidate who rates women on their looks on a numerical scale? Can he empathize with women who need day care, health care, education and training to support their families? Or will he attribute their low economic status to their "beauty" score and prescribe makeup, diets and designer clothing?

HEADLINE: Optimism Blooms on an Anti-Leukemia Pill

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
An experimental pill has shown remarkable promise against a form of leukemia in early tests, researchers say, helping every patient in whom the standard treatment earlier failed.
The drug, STI-571, is intended to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, which accounts for about 4,300 of the 30,000 new cases of leukemia in the United States each year. 
All 31 patients taking at least 300 milligrams a day have had normal counts of white and red blood cells for as long as eight months, said the lead researcher, Dr. Brian J. Druker of the Oregon Health Sciences University, who will present his findings here on Sunday at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Thirty of those patients had normal blood counts within a month of beginning treatment. And cancer-causing cells were apparently eliminated in three patients, and reduced in six others.
The current standard treatment for this kind of leukemia is interferon, a natural protein that raises the body's immune defenses. Introduced in 1986, it cures up to one-third of those with the disease. But remission often requires two years of daily shots, and interferon has many side effects, including pain and inflammation of the joints. The new drug's side effects are few and mild, and it is available in pill form.
Nobody knows yet whether the drug will continue to be effective or whether instead the cancer will develop resistance to it. But the researchers say the study is important no matter what the long-term effects, because the drug is aimed at the particular biological defect -- an enzyme called tyrosine kinase -- that causes the cancer.
"This is perhaps the best example of how understanding the cause can lead to an effective treatment for cancer," said Dr. David A. Scheinberg, chief of leukemia at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "It will serve as a model for development of other types of cancer, where we are beginning to learn more about what causes them."

HEADLINE: Police Tactics in Question;
Handling Protest in Seattle

 BODY:
Seattle is a city with a tradition of liberal politics and civility in public discourse. So it was a shock to see the host city of the World Trade Organization meeting face down protesters with tear gas, rubber pellets and the National Guard this week. The root problem seems to be a failure by Seattle's mayor and police chief to prepare for the size of the demonstrations and possible violence.
The mayor's instincts were commendable -- to give demonstrators who had come from around the country the opportunity to protest peacefully in the center of the city. He has argued that a big show of police force would have unfairly squelched free speech and possibly incited the crowd. At first his approach seemed to be working. An orderly, festive parade of more than 30,000 labor and environmentalist demonstrators did march through the heart of the city to the sound of brass bands. 
 But after that demonstration ended on Tuesday, a few dozen self-proclaimed anarchists began smashing store windows and destroying property, with virtual impunity. Meanwhile the police were blocks away using tear gas to roust nonviolent demonstrators who were blocking the streets. The city should have been prepared to deploy more officers to deal with violent individuals.
After the Tuesday fiasco, city hall imposed a civil emergency order that lasted until last night, making about 20 blocks surrounding the site of the W.T.O. meeting off-limits to all protesters and the general public. That stringent reaction, as well as harsher police tactics on Wednesday, raised civil liberties concerns and will probably be challenged in court. Better planning and intelligence work by the Seattle police might have averted the mayhem, which fortunately did not result in serious injuries to protesters or police. The commendable effort to accommodate public debate unfortunately turned into a restraint on free assembly. But before the anarchist element was able to overtake the event, peaceful demonstrators made an important contribution to the global debate.

HEADLINE: North Korea, Apparently Seeking to End Its Isolation, Agrees to Resume Talks With Japan

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, Dec. 3

 BODY:
North Korea, one of the most isolated and bellicose countries in Asia, has made some unexpected diplomatic overtures in recent months, suggesting that its Communist government is itching to come out of its shell, or at least see what the rest of the world has to offer.
At a meeting today in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, leaders from North Korea and Japan announced a breakthrough agreement to resume talks on establishing diplomatic relations. The talks have been stalled since 1992. 
 The talks, which may lead to the reinstatement of Japan's food aid to North Korea, are expected to begin before the end of the year in Tokyo, Beijing or Pyongyang, a joint statement said.
The agreement is part of a recent effort by North Korea to improve its relations in order to gain more economic aid, which it desperately needs to rebuild its shattered economy and feed its starving people, who have suffered greatly during years of food shortages.
Political analysts said that while North Korea's new diplomatic tack is likely to reduce tensions in East Asia, the country remains as unpredictable as ever and has demonstrated no intention to reform its repressive policies.
"North Korea is definitely trying to normalize its relations with the outside world because it needs external support to overcome its economic crisis," said Kim Yeon Chul, a researcher for the Samsung Economic Research Institute.
"But this does not mean that North Korea has a strong appetite for major reforms," Mr. Kim said. "They are simply trying to solve short-term problems, and from a long-term perspective, they are not going to significantly change their fundamental hard-line principles."
Only a few months ago, North Korea was widely considered the bane of Asia after it threatened to test-launch a long-range ballistic missile.
But anxiety eased considerably when North Korea agreed to suspend the tests if the United States relaxed trade restrictions imposed at the end of the Korean War.
United States and North Korean representatives have been meeting in Berlin on and off for several months to address bilateral concerns and improve relations. North Korea has also held talks with British officials in London and European Union officials in Brussels.
Driving North Korea's push to improve its diplomatic ties is President Kim Jung Il, who analysts say has successfully consolidated his control over the military, the bureaucracy and Parliament in the past year, after a period of uncertainty following the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, in 1994.
With the worst of the food shortages and natural disasters like flooding easing, the analysts said, Mr. Kim is seeking to place his country on sound economic footing through better diplomatic ties.
Beyond diplomacy, North Korea appears to be opening up in other ways that few people ever considered. The country has permitted an unprecedented number of cultural and athletic exchanges with South Korea in the past year that are intended to promote unity between the two nations, which are technically still at war.
On Sunday a group of South Korean and American entertainers, including President Clinton's half brother, Roger, are to participate in a "Year 2000 Peace and Friendship Concert" in Pyongyang.
In what could be another breakthrough agreement, a leading South Korean manufacturer of jeans, the Nix Company, said that after months of negotiations, it has convinced North Korea to accept a donation of 10,000 pairs of jeans and 5,000 sweaters to be distributed to young people. In the past, North Korea has banned blue jeans, which it considers the ultimate symbol of "capitalism" and "Western decadence," said Park Sung Eun, Nix's public relations manager.
Indeed, organizers of excursions to the Korean demilitarized zone do not permit visitors to wear jeans or T-shirts because North Korean soldiers have taken photos of visitors wearing faded jeans to be used later as proof of hard times in the West.
Ms. Park said North Korean officials approved the donation only after they were assured the jeans would be black and loose fitting.
"I guess they didn't want jeans that showed off certain features, mainly because they want to use them as work clothes," Ms. Park said.
The deal to resume diplomatic talks with Japan followed a meeting of 16 Japanese lawmakers led by a former prime minister, Tomiichi Urayama, and a North Korean team led by Kim Yong Sum, secretary for international affairs of the Workers Party of Korea.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Euro Drops Against Dollar, Hitting New Low, but Rallies

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The euro regained strength today after dipping to a new low against the dollar, defying warnings that it might fall sharply a day after it broke through a symbolically important barrier.
Europe's single currency fluctuated within a narrow band as analysts tried to make sense of its plunge below parity with the dollar on Thursday. 
 The euro has declined 16 percent in dollar terms since 11 countries introduced it on Jan. 1. Its slide has embarrassed supporters who viewed it as a symbol of regional pride and a crucial step in efforts to integrate the economies of Europe.
The euro reached a new low today of 99.90 cents in trading in Japan and again in London. It first reached parity with the dollar on Thursday and then slipped to 99.96 cents later that day.
Many currency traders and economists, however, shrugged off as meaningless its decline to a few hundredths of a cent less than $1.
"It's more important as a symbol than a reality," said David Kern, an economist with National Westminster Bank Group.
Some traders had speculated that a mass of computerized sales orders would kick in once the euro breached the $1 mark. Instead, the currency rebounded each time it slid below parity. It closed at $1.0017 today in trading in New York.
The relative calm in European currency markets baffled many analysts.
"We haven't seen very many fireworks yet," said Mark Cliffe, chief economist at the bank ING Barings. "It's been sort of a slow process of attrition. It's almost as if the market's wondering what to do next."
The euro sagged on Thursday after the European Central Bank refused to intervene in the market by buying euros, concerned that an effort to bolster the currency's price might also undermine the bank's conservative monetary policy.
Officials at the European Commission, which is the administrative arm of the European Union, played down the euro's fall, saying today that Europe's economic recovery would inevitably cause the euro to strengthen.
"We believe this is a short-term movement," said Ricardo Levi, the commission's chief spokesman. "Currencies go up and down. We believe the bases of the European economy are fine and improving."
Government officials in Germany, the largest economy in the 11-country zone that uses the euro, also expressed confidence in the currency's future.

HEADLINE: Pokemon Mania Takes On Criminal Proportions

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Dec. 3

 BODY:
Sometimes a Pokemon is just a Pokemon.
And sometimes the children's phenomenon of the moment becomes so ubiquitous it is hard not to see it as an inescapable, if elusive, window onto the moment. 
 Consider this week. Police here say they have broken up a $1 million Pokemon card counterfeiting ring, pushing the total value of bogus Pokemon products seized in North America since May to $20 million. In Bridgeport, Conn., a 9-year-old boy hid in a downtown store until it closed, tried to steal 44 packs of Pokemon cards and $600, and, trapped in the locked store, called 911 for help. And, in a clash of Asian and Western culture and religion, Nintendo of America, which controls Pokemon licensing in North America and Europe, persuaded its parent company in Japan to stop printing a Japanese symbol of hope on Japanese-language Pokemon cards because it resembles a swastika and offended customers in the United States.
What lifted Pokemon from a card game to a zillion-dollar phenomenon may be a process too mysterious to comprehend.
"Kids value Pokemon in an hysterical, passionate way," said Todd Gitlin, a professor of culture, journalism and sociology at New York University. "If anyone tells you why, don't believe them. No one knows. Why was it hula hoops? Why was it Monopoly? Why was it Babe Ruth? Why was it yo-yos? It just is."
But, however it evolved, it is clear the Pokemon phenomenon reflects the way modern communications and marketing are able to lift a few products into the economic stratosphere.
"There are literally thousands of things trying to become the craze of the moment," said Robert Frank, an economics professor at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management. "Naturally, all can't succeed. There are lots of things just as good as Pokemon that don't make it. It has to have something intrinsically engaging."
Both professors agreed that once an interest in Pokemon took root, it evolved from a children's craze into a financial one. "This is all pure economics now," Professor Gitlin said. "Once there's demand, there's money, and once there's money there's counterfeiting."
Since Pokemon was introduced to America in September 1998 simply as a video game, Nintendo of America has licensed 90 Pokemon-related products, from playing cards and their 150 Pokemon characters, to toys, hats, T-shirts, plastic figurines, sheets and paper goods, said Beth Llewelyn, a Nintendo spokeswoman.
Bogus goods started popping up in May, and Nintendo began an aggressive counterattack against counterfeiters, hiring private detectives and teaching United States Customs officers how to detect black-market packaging and shipping documents, Ms. Llewelyn said. Of the estimated $20 million in counterfeit goods seized in the last seven months, $10 million worth was confiscated last summer in a wholesale warehouse in Los Angeles, she said. The other $10 million, including plush dolls and toys, figurines, hats and T-shirts, cards and stickers, was seized in recent months in stores in Lower Manhattan, on the shipping docks of Elizabeth, N.J., and at stores in Honolulu, San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia.
The estimated $1 million in bogus cards seized in Hackensack on Tuesday was the largest amount found in a single raid, she said.
Thousands of sheets of cards, each with 54 cards, were found in three vans detectives stopped at a warehouse here and in two warehouses in neighboring Little Ferry. Hackensack's police chief, Charles K. Zisa, said the three warehouses contained "pallets and pallets" of additional sheets of cards ready for shipping. The cards were printed by sophisticated computer and imaging machines and cut in the warehouses, Chief Zisa said. He said detectives are now trying to learn where the cards were to be packaged and distributed.
Of the 150 Pokemon characters depicted on the playing cards, a few are rare, or premium, characters, like one named Charizard. Dr. Frank said the scarcity helps fuel the demand for them and explains why children pressure parents to buy them the cards, which come in packs of 10 or 11 and sell for $5 to $8.
"Coveting the prize possession is an age-old story in human nature," he said. "The company decides how hard it is to find the rare card. If you could get any Pokemon card you wanted, there'd be no market."
That might help explain, he said, the 9-year-old boy hiding in the Bridgeport store and then trying to steal the 44 packs. After the boy, who is about 4 feet tall, called 911 from inside the locked store, officers found him sitting on a shelf, dangling his legs over the side.
The boy was charged with juvenile delinquency and then released to his great-grandmother.
The squabble over the swastikalike symbol on the Japanese language cards seems to stem, too, from excessive demand. The symbol that drew objections is a manji, a sign of hope in Japan and a fixture on many Buddhist temples long before the Nazis adopted the swastika.
Cards with a manji were supposed to be distributed only in Japan but reached the United States through a "gray market" for Pokemon products, Ms. Llewelyn said.
Different from bogus or black-market goods, the "gray market" products are licensed for sale only in one country, in this case Japan, but are purchased there by legitimate companies and distributors and then resold in the United States, she said. To prevent any further cultural "misunderstandings", the symbol will no longer be printed on Japanese-language cards, she said.
It's a lot to make of a bunch of cards. But Neal Gabler, cultural historian and author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality," said in a culture obsessed by celebrity, Pokemon has been turned into a "kind of fire, a conflagration," and children have been caught up in it.
"The kids get caught up in the fire themselves -- you have to have the cards, you have to have the toys," Mr. Gabler said. "It even becomes a bizarre form of material-based community, a community based on cards and toys. Not to become part of it is to be marginalized. No one wants to be marginalized, or out of the loop."

HEADLINE: Safra's Death Not Expected to Delay Big Bank Sale

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
The death of Edmond J. Safra is not expected to delay the $9.9 billion sale of his banking businesses to HSBC Holdings, Britain's largest bank.
Banking experts said today that the acquisition of Republic New York Corporation and Safra Republic Holdings was still likely to be completed by the end of the year. The Federal Reserve, which represents the last regulatory hurdle, is to review the merger next week. 
 "In isolation, there should be no delay at all," said Mark Thomas, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais in London. "His death should be immaterial."
Mr. Safra had not been expected to have a major role in the banks' operations under the new ownership. But he had been expected to help HSBC hold onto Safra Republic's 30,000 very wealthy clients. Safra Republic, an affiliate of Republic New York, has 44 offices, holding client funds that total $56.5 billion.
It was the private-banking operations, aimed at people with $1 million or more to invest, that primarily attracted HSBC, which has also been successful in managing money for the wealthy.
"Clearly, Safra was expected to take an active role, if not a symbolic role at the new bank," said Richard Coleman, of Merrill Lynch & Company in London. "There has to be a risk that friends and associates whose money and trust had been connected to Safra may not be loyal to a new owner now that he died. It raises a question that I can't begin to quantify."
To a large degree private banking depends on the personal touch and the caution, secrecy and service it offers. Mr. Safra had a reputation for being always available for his most wealthy clients, and that loyalty was reciprocated.
Mr. Safra's 1983 sale of a private banking operation, the Trade Development Bank, to American Express drew criticism that American Express did not know how to cater to wealthy clients, which led to the departure of Mr. Safra less than two years later. American Express sold its Geneva-based private banking subsidiary in 1989, but not without some unpleasantness. An executive vice president of American Express acknowledged responsiblity for unfounded suggestions that Mr. Safra was linked to organized crime.
Karen Ng, a spokeswoman for HSBC here, declined to comment on the implications of Mr. Safra's death on the completion of the transaction. "HSBC will uphold the banking tradition and integrity which were the hallmarks of Edmond's life," she said.
Shares of Republic New York slipped 1.5 percent today, or $1.0625, to $70.375, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. In London, HSBC shares rose 3.5 percent, or 28.50 pence, to 849 pence, or $13.58.
Mr. Safra played a central role last month in reviving the long-delayed deal for Republic. The acquisition had been stalled by HSBC pending the outcome of an investigation by Japanese regulators into the Republic securities unit that was begun in the beginning of September.
United States and Japanese officials have said William H. Rogers, who was president of the futures unit of Republic New York Securities, aided his client, Martin A. Armstrong, founder and chairman of Princeton Economics International Ltd. and its Hong Kong brokerage subsidiary Cresvale International Ltd., in defrauding investors of more than $500 million.
HSBC agreed to proceed with its purchase after Mr. Safra agreed to accept $450 million less for his stakes in Republic and Safra.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Buoyed by JobData, Nasdaq and S.& P. Rise to Record Levels

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Forget the Federal Reserve and the threat of higher interest rates. That seemed to be the message from investors yesterday as they snapped up stocks, sending two of the market's benchmark measures to new highs and leaving the Dow Jones industrial average just 40 points short of a record.
The other message was buy technology stocks, as the Nasdaq composite index jumped 1.97 percent, putting it up an extraordinary 60.56 percent to date this year. 
 The Nasdaq rose 67.85 points yesterday to a new high of 3,520.63, crossing the 3,500 level only 21 trading days after first closing above 3,000. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 24.26 points yesterday, or 1.72 percent, to a new high of 1,433.30. And the Dow Jones industrials rose 247.12 points, or 2.24 percent, to 11,286.18.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks -- something of a lagging area -- had a strong day, as well, increasing 4.14 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 464.58. It is now up 10.1 percent for the year.
Among the big names leading the rally were Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., J. P. Morgan, General Electric and Microsoft.
"I am very comfortable with the fundamentals," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. But, he added, the stock market has moved awfully far awfully fast. "I would think that having a correction before too long is likely and would be helpful," he said.
Yesterday's rally came after the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate was unchanged in November at 4.1 percent while the economy created 234,000 new nonfarm jobs. The report also showed that average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent last month, down from 0.3 percent in October.
The report was a relief for bond traders because the increase in jobs was in line with forecasts and the wage data showed a slight month-to-month slowdown, easing inflationary fears.
That news spurred a rally in bonds, which sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond down to 6.25 percent from 6.32 percent on Thursday. The price of the bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its yield, rose 26/32, to 98 9/32.
Stocks rallied from the opening bell yesterday. By 11:06 a.m., the Dow was up more than 300 points and 15 points above its record closing high of 11,326.04, set on Aug. 25. The Nasdaq and the S.& P. 500 indexes were in hot pursuit.
By the close of trading, all three main indexes had given up some of their gains, but stocks were still markedly higher for the day. Advances on the Big Board led declines, 1,832 issues to 1,269, on volume of more than one billion shares. Breadth among Nasdaq stocks was slightly positive.
In currency markets, the value of the euro touched below $1 for the second day, in part because European investors are continuing to jump into American stocks, especially in technology. But by late afternoon, the euro had rebounded a little to settle at $1.0017, barely above parity.
"This is amazing," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, of yesterday's stock rally. He added, "I can scratch the surface in explaining it, but I cannot understand it."
Mr. Cliggott said the rally in technology stocks could in part be accounted for by a change in the preferences of individual investors. In past years, he said, the flows of cash into mutual funds concentrating on value stocks and those concentrating on growth stocks were about even. But he said that this year, based on the most recent figures from AMG Data Services, $7 billion had been taken out of value funds while $97 billion was put into growth funds.
Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, outlining the mood of the stock market, added: "You've got the earnings growth. You've got inflation looking tame. And the Fed does not have to be aggressive. What more could you ask for in terms of equities?"
And that has been the mood for much of the last month and a half, despite the Fed's interest rate increase in November. Corporate earnings for the third quarter were up 22.7 percent, compared with a year earlier. The forecast for this quarter is for an increase of 17.5 percent, according to First Call/ Thomson Financial, while 17.9 percent is predicted for the first quarter of 2000 followed by 16.5 percent in the second quarter. In addition, there is no sign yet of a significant slowdown in the economy.
Speaking of the employment report, Mr. Berner said, "These data are consistent with the 5 percent growth forecast I have for the fourth quarter, so where is the slowdown?"
But that also represents a problem for the stock market. The more it rallies, the more it will spur consumer spending, which has been the backbone of the economic expansion, one that by the end of January will be the longest on record in the United States. If the economy does not slow on its own, the Fed can be expected to continue raising its interest rate target, which would put pressure on stocks. Laurence H. Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve, made that clear in a speech this week.
"I continue to believe," he said at the Stern Graduate School of Business at New York University, "that the fundamental challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional, but unsustainable state to a more sustainable, though still excellent state. The transition might well occur while we remain spectators of an economy that slows spontaneously, and as a result of recent policy actions. Or it could involve our more active participation," he said, suggesting the possibility of more interest rate increases. "It depends."
The jobs data, Mr. Berner said, had not changed his view that the Fed would have to raise its short-term interest rate target, which is now 5.50 percent, next year.

HEADLINE: 234,000 NEW JOBS IN NOVEMBER KEPT ECONOMY HUMMING

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The tireless national economy kept spinning out new jobs in November, assuring robust economic growth in the final months of the American Century.
Not only that, but people also worked longer hours, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The combination of more people employed -- a hefty 234,000 more -- and more time on the job for everyone gave rise to forecasts that in the fourth quarter the economy would keep up its spectacular growth. 
 "We were expecting the economy to slow more quickly, with the help of a stock market decline," said Chris Varvares, a partner in Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis, which is forecasting an annual growth rate of nearly 5 percent, or almost as much as the 5.5 percent in the third quarter. "But we are getting a revving up, not a slowing, and we are certainly not going through a stock market decline."
Stock prices shot up yesterday, in reaction to two numbers in the report: the job growth and the average hourly wage for ordinary workers. That wage rose only 2 cents, to $13.41. The combination of healthy economic growth and modest wage gains suggests the likelihood of little inflationary pressure.
That is an outlook that stock investors favor. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 247.12 points, or 2.24 percent, to 11,286.18 -- not far from the record close of 11,326.03 on Aug. 25.
"If the wage growth had been a bit higher, the stock market would not have performed nearly as well," said Joshua N. Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management.
Not everyone was as sanguine as stock investors about inflation. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent, matching the 30-year low hit in October, suggesting that labor shortages must eventually become inflationary, although there is no sign of that yet.
Wage pressures are, however, showing up among higher-level people, whose incomes are more likely to be fattened by bonuses, profit sharing and cashing in stock options. These labor costs are captured in a broader but less publicized measure of pay called compensation per hour. It has risen at an annual rate of 4.8 percent since the second quarter.
And unit labor costs -- the amount paid to workers to make a car, say, or dry-clean a suit -- have edged up.
"We think there is a fair amount of pressure already developing on profits," Mr. Varvares said.
Still, there seemed to be a widespread consensus among Wall Street economists that the Federal Reserve, which recently raised interest rates slightly, would refrain from any further increase this year, not seeing in the latest job numbers enough inflationary pressure. Indeed, the Labor Department report suggested that job growth, for all its current strength, was gradually declining, to 200,000 a month over the last three months from 230,000 a month over the last six months.
The Clinton administration hailed the job report as a milestone. With the 234,000 new jobs in November, job creation during the president's nearly seven years in office passed the 20 million mark, reaching 20,043,000, an achievement that mainly reflects the strong economy but also the administration's economic policies, officials said.
Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman called the achievement historic -- and indeed there has been no other seven-year period in which so many jobs have been created.
But in percentage terms, the 20 million new jobs created since January 1993, bringing the total number of nonfarm jobs to 129.5 million last month, represented growth of 18 percent. In the long economic expansions of the 1960's and the 1980's, the work force expanded by greater percentage rates over seven years: 25 percent in the 60's and 22 percent in the 80's.
"There were comparable periods of job growth that you can find in other recoveries," Henry Holzer, the Labor Department's chief economist, acknowledged, "but we have reached lower levels of unemployment than in the 1980's."
The administration also released a study that found that a great majority of the new jobs were in occupations that paid more than the national median wage of $13 an hour. But several labor economists noted that newly created jobs were almost always at the higher end of the pay scale, even during recessions, a point that Mr. Holzer also acknowledged.
"It may not be any different than in the past," he said, "but the perception is different; the perception is that the economy is not creating good jobs, and we are."
The real issue is the distribution of pay over the work force, and here there has been an improvement since President Clinton took office in 1993, said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. The percentage of American workers earning less than $8 an hour, adjusted for inflation, has fallen from 30 percent to about 25. "All of the improvement has come since 1996," Mr. Bernstein noted.
Much of the November job growth came in the service sector, particularly in helping companies convert their computer systems for Year 2000 operation. But construction jobs also swelled, by 55,000, perhaps because of the mild November weather in much of the country. And workers everywhere put in longer hours; an index of hours worked rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.4 percent in October.
Manufacturing employment, while still shrinking, is doing so much more slowly than in the first half, when the loss averaged 36,000 jobs a month. Since July this has fallen 9,000 a month, including only 2,000 in November. The gains reflect the strong demand for merchandise in a booming economy, as well as reviving demand abroad for American goods, analysts said.
But there were also signs of weakness. Retail employment grew by only 1,000 jobs beyond what the Labor Department expected in the adjustment it makes to allow for the holiday demand for store clerks.
"That might simply reflect the difficulty retailers are having in finding enough workers in this tight labor market," said Thomas Nardone, chief of the Division of Labor Force Statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HEADLINE: President Halts Target Practice By Navy on Puerto Rican Island

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton today ordered a halt to live-fire military training on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques and an end to all exercises there within five years unless local residents agree to an extension.
Even though Mr. Clinton rejected alternative recommendations by the Navy and a special presidential panel to resume live firing, his decision failed to satisfy demands by Puerto Rican leaders for an unambiguous declaration that bombing will never resume on Vieques and for a specific date that the Navy will close down the firing range and leave the island. 
 "I am extremely disappointed with the plan proposed by the president," Gov. Pedro J. Rossello said at a news conference in San Juan. "It is not acceptable."
Mr. Clinton accepted the recommendation of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, who has been trying to end the seven-month deadlock between Puerto Rico and the Navy over the island that the Navy considers the indispensable "crown jewel" of its East Coast training operations. The area is the largest naval site in which it can conduct simultaneous live-fire exercises involving ships, planes and marines engaged in amphibious assaults.
The compromise plan announced today postpones several major decisions while the Navy and the governor of Puerto Rico negotiate whether the military will resume exercises in March with inert, or dummy, ordnance that contains no explosives. The Navy also offered the island a $40 million economic revival project to demonstrate that the service understands it must "repair relations" with the people of Vieques.
As a result of today's agreement, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its battle group, including a Marine detachment, will go on its next assignment to the Mediterranean in February and then on to the Persian Gulf without training on Vieques.
Instead, the Navy and Marines have put together a "patchwork" of training at bases in Florida and North Carolina for pilots to drop bombs and marines to storm the beach, as well as temporary naval artillery training on Cape Wrath in Scotland.
"These arrangements will not provide training as good as that obtainable in Vieques," said Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig. "But we believe that not pressing the issue at this moment in Puerto Rico is the most productive route for resuming training in Vieques over the longer term."
All military exercises were suspended in April when a civilian Puerto Rican guard, David Sanes Rodriguez, was killed after Marine jets dropped bombs that unintentionally hit an observation tower.
Since then protesters occupied large sections of the 900-acre range that has been used since 1941 for what the Navy considers essential training for combat readiness. For decades there have been complaints about Navy activity on the island, and in 1983 the Navy signed a memorandum with Puerto Rico promising to change its behavior.
The encampment of protesters, who vowed to remain on the range, which is strewn with unspent explosives, played into today's decision.
Attorney General Janet Reno strongly argued against any immediate resumption of exercises that would require federal marshals to forcibly remove the demonstrators, according to senior administration officials.
"Secretary Cohen called the president earlier this week and said his judgment was based on the strong view of the attorney general that it would not be a manageable situation, given the emotions that exist right now," a senior administration official said.
Vieques has become one of the few issues that have united the citizens of Puerto Rico, who have actively campaigned to place it on the political agenda in the presidential campaign and in New York State politics.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New York, became an early supporter of Puerto Rico's side in the debate. Mrs. Clinton declared in October that there should be "an immediate and permanent end to the bombing," which she said "put the people of Vieques at risk, degraded the environment and hampered economic development."
Her expected opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, said he had no comment on the issue, which has become a rallying point for New York's large Puerto Rican population.
Vice President Al Gore said through a spokesman today that he wanted the Vieques range closed.
"The vice president still favors shutting down the firing range and believes the Pentagon and Puerto Rican leaders should focus on a transition plan to bring that about," a spokesman for Mr. Gore said.
In testimony in October, Mr. Rossello told Congress that the live firing training on the island had created an unacceptably high unemployment rate for its residents, who have also had health problems, including a higher cancer rate. He also said that "bombs away, day after day" had threatened the coral reef and wildlife of the island.
This fall, a presidential panel agreed that the Navy had been an imperfect neighbor, and in a news conference today, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, said the Navy was "committed to rolling up our sleeves and working with the good people of Vieques to ensure that we can continue to use that range."
"Vieques is important to the United States Navy and the United States
Marine Corps," the admiral said. "It's the crown jewel training experience for us. We don't want to lose it, and we're willing to work to keep it."
The training area in and around Vieques is the major training area for the Navy on the East Coast. The equivalent on the West Coast is the San Clemente Training Area north of San Diego, where naval battle groups can also conduct live fire training for artillery, aircraft and amphibious landings but on a much smaller scale.
Mr. Cohen emphasized that his first responsibility was "to ensure that American military forces are well trained and ready for the dangerous missions we routinely ask them to perform."
But Admiral Johnson admitted that when the Eisenhower battle group left Norfolk this February, it would not be combat ready until it received further training in the field.
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who is on the Armed Services Committee, criticized this plan as "a risky approach that will deploy two U.S. battle groups before their training is complete" and they have been battle-proven. "The Pentagon's proposal jeopardizes American forces, as it is clearly not in our national interest to deploy troops that are not fully trained," she said.
But Puerto Rican politicians said today there was little chance that the Navy would be asked to stay at Vieques. They contended that since the Navy had been able to find alternative temporary sites in Scotland, and earlier in Sardinia, for their live-fire exercises, there was no need to reconsider Vieques. "If the Eisenhower is not here, it is because they have other places to do that type of training, and it proves our point," said Alfonso Aguilar, press spokesman for Governor Rossello. "It is very difficult for the Navy to continue saying that Vieques is indispensable."
Ruben Berrios-Martinez, a member of the Puerto Rican Independence Party and a friend of Mr. Clinton, said in Vieques that today's decision was only a skirmish in a larger battle. "It is a long war, and it will not be won until there is an agreement on not one more bomb at anytime, forever, and a schedule to leave," he said.
To achieve that end the demonstrators are expected to remain on the Vieques firing range.
Their presence could upset future negotiations that Mr. Clinton hopes to begin in Washington between Governor Rossello, the Navy and senior Pentagon officials.
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crisis unit, the Hostage Rescue Team, quietly visited Vieques to begin preparations in case the president decided to accept the Navy's recommendation and begin immediate live-fire exercises on the island. Under that plan, Ms. Reno would have been required to dispatch federal agents to the island quickly to clear protesters from the range.
But Ms. Reno and the director of the F.B.I., Louis J. Freeh, strongly objected to the idea, law-enforcement officials said. They advised the White House and Pentagon officials that any plan that required federal agents to clear protesters from the range would present a serious risk to agents and demonstrators.

Jobless Rate Stays at 4.1% And Inflation Appears Tame
The nation's jobless rate remained at 4.1 percent in November, matching the 30-year low hit in October. The Labor Department also said that 234,000 new jobs were created, and the average hourly wage for ordinary workers increased by only 2 cents an hour, to $13.41. 
 The combination of healthy economic growth and modest wage gains led economists to suggest that there is little inflationary pressure. That news spurred a strong rally on Wall Street, sending both the Nasdaq composite index and Standard & Poor's 500-stock indexes to new records. Page A1.
 
Safra's Death Will Not Delay Merger
The death of Edmond J. Safra is not expected to delay the $9.9 billion sale of his banking businesses, Republic New York and Safra Republic Holdings, to HSBC Holdings, Britain's largest bank. The Federal Reserve, which represents the last regulatory hurdle, is expected to review the merger next week. A8.
 
S.E.C. Issues Accounting Guidelines
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidelines for corporations when they report financial results in an attempt to prevent companies from using bookkeeping gimmicks to inflate revenue figures. The staff bulletin was intended to clarify and interpret existing rules, not to make new ones. But in some cases it may force accounting changes by companies that had relied on interpretations that the S.E.C. rejects. C4.
 
U.S. Meets Resistance in Seattle
The United States found itself isolated on many of the key issues that President Clinton has put at the top of his agenda for negotiations at the World Trade Organization meeting, raising the prospect the next several years of talks will yield little to meet the demands of American industry and labor unions. While the United States got Europe and Japan to agree on talks that could eventually eliminate subsidies on farm goods, it appeared headed toward a sacrifice on its positions on the dumping of below-cost products and pushing for access for genetically modified foods. A6.
 
Investors Cautious About Malaysia
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad insisted on doing things his way during the Asian economic crisis last year, and now his country is recovering nicely. But his policies and antiforeign talk appear to have alienated the foreign investment-fund managers whom Malaysia needs to finance its shift from a high-technology manufacturing base to a service economy, as companies relocate production to countries with cheaper labor like China. C2.
 
Euro Stays Above Parity With Dollar
The euro regained strength and closed at $1.0017 after dipping to a new low, defying warnings that it might fall sharply a day after it broke through the symbolically important barrier of $1. The euro has declined 16 percent in dollar terms since 11 countries introduced it in January. Its slide has embarrassed supporters who viewed it as a symbol of regional pride and a crucial step in efforts to integrate the economies of Europe. C3.

HEADLINE: Republican Family Squabbles

 BODY:
The first Republican presidential debate with everyone participating probably left Gov. George W. Bush and Senator John McCain in their recent positions as the front-runners in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush seemed confident, if tightly programmed, while committing no major gaffes. Mr. McCain dealt genially with questions about his temperament. Steve Forbes gave a combative performance and may have sealed his role as the main conservative alternative after picking up the endorsement of The Manchester Union Leader.
There will be plenty of time to sort out the horse race among the contenders. What was most interesting on Thursday night, however, was the candidates' ambivalence, indeed confusion, about the role of government. All those in the debate said they wanted less of it, along with lower taxes. But there were also calls for government to do more on schools, retirement benefits, health care, the environment, the Internet and other things. 
 This fundamental contradiction needs to be addressed by the candidates in future debates. For now it was useful to see the distinctions drawn by Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain on taxes. With its pie-in-the-sky quality, the Texas governor's approach was more reminiscent of Ronald Reagan than of his own father. Mr. Bush promoted a five-year, $483 billion tax cut without any recognition that it would use up a budget surplus that may not even exist -- and without explaining how he would also pay for the additional spending on the military and on programs for the poor that he has called for.
Asked about the concern that his tax cut would use up the budget surplus, Mr. Bush had a quip instead of an answer. "If we elect a Democrat, the surplus will go away, because they'll spend it all," he said. Mr. McCain's endorsement of a more modest tax cut, and his comment that "I wouldn't count on these surpluses," was more sensible.
It was not surprising that Mr. Forbes and Alan Keyes want to abolish the tax system. More dismaying was the comment from Senator Orrin Hatch about replacing the tax code with a national sales tax, a step that effectively makes economic war on the poor and the middle class. Mr. Forbes was the most contradictory about the government's role. He wants it to tone down antitrust regulation but enforce a passengers' bill of rights on airplanes.
Mr. McCain, by assailing special interests and the campaign finance system, portrayed himself as pro- and anti-government at the same time. He wants to cut the federal budget but also spend more for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. He also spoke knowledgeably on foreign policy and military issues, but one notable feature of the forum was something he did not do. The Arizona senator so carefully avoided criticizing Mr. Bush that he was forced yesterday to say he was not applying as a running mate.
The uncertainty about government among the candidates may reflect a general uncertainty among the voters. The polls show that past antipathy toward government programs has lessened in recent years. The candidates' oratory in the debate paid tribute to that old attitude of government-is-the-problem, but their specific words suggested that the election will turn on how to make government effective, not how to cut it back drastically.

HEADLINE: Where's the Beef? On the Plate;
Steaks, Roasts and Hamburgers Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
Not so long ago, most people wandering through food shows would stop by the Harris Ranch display, only to turn away even before trying a taste of the company's microwave-ready Swiss steak and pot roast in gravy.
"Particularly in a town like Seattle they'd say, 'I don't eat beef,' " said Brad L. Caudill, director of marketing with Harris Ranch, a leading California cattle feeder and processor. 
 In late October, however, in displaying his wares in Seattle, Mr. Caudill found the reception was completely different.
"Everyone that stopped by our booth ate beef and seemed to be on some high- protein diet," he said. "It was amazing."
After 20 years in which consumers steadily defected to chicken, beef is showing signs of making a comeback. Over the last few years, demand and price have stabilized. Now, analysts are predicting consumption will increase further this year even as beef prices are going up.
At a time of record levels of production, consumer spending for beef is expected to reach $48.6 billion, $2 billion more than 1998.
The strong economy gets a lot of the credit for the upswing. When Americans have money in their pocket, they like to eat steak. Rib and loin cuts have been bringing record prices, which is helping to fuel a predicted $5-a-person spending increase, the largest since 1990, according to Cattle-Fax, a cattle industry market information management service.
But also playing a role, experts say, are new attitudes about fat, in part because of the encouragement of books like "Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution," recommending high protein, higher fat diets. At the same time, an increasing number of table-ready, heat-and-serve products are helping the industry regain its footing by allowing it to generate greater profits from each head of cattle.
One sign of the times: traffic at steakhouses has increased 73 percent in the last five years and places like Peter Luger in Brooklyn are filling up even in the off-hours.
"We're pretty much jammed all the time," said Jody Storch, a vice president and meat buyer at Peter Luger, which also has a branch in Great Neck. "There's almost a frenzy about it, people calling in with these cockamamie stories like if they don't get a reservation their husband is going to divorce them."
But the movement seems to be going beyond fine dining and expensive cuts. "Even hamburger has had a tremendous year," said Mike Miller, director of cost and performance analysis with Cattle-Fax.
Chuck Schroeder, chief executive of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, calls the improvement "the most exciting news in this industry probably in 20 years."
But, he added, "we're not so giddy we think, 'Oh my, happy days are here again.' "
Indeed, prices for cattle are still low when compared to those of a couple of decades ago. And many cattle ranchers are still suffering, leading to sharp cutbacks that could haunt the industry over the next few years. Still, cattle prices are up roughly 3 cents a pound and, while times are tight for some ranchers, many producers say they will have their first decent year in a while.
Between 1980 and 1999 the beef industry portion of consumer spending on meat and poultry dropped to 42 percent from 55 percent. The share of poultry increased to 29 percent from 17 percent while pork's share of consumer spending has remained steady at about 29 percent.
"Chicken has been eating the beef industry's lunch for 20 years," said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with Prudential Securities. "The story here is that beef is finally fighting back."
But it will be a tough battle. A $30 million marketing campaign to highlight the nutritional value of beef and changes that make it quicker and more convenient to use is on the way as the supply of beef is dropping.
Keith Collins, chief economist for the Agriculture Department, noted that cattle ranchers have been reducing their herds to counter low prices and adverse weather conditions. There will be fewer calves born in the United States this year than in the last five decades. The lower supply is expected to drive up prices further, but that could cost the industry sales if consumers switch to cheaper poultry and pork.
To maintain their recent gains, industry officials want to present beef to consumers in a different way, reorganizing the supermarket meat case so that beef is no longer displayed by cut. Instead, they want it laid out by cooking type -- grilled, roasted, braised, etc. -- with labels on how it should be prepared.
Meanwhile, to enhance beef's appeal and the industry's bottom line, cattle are being bred leaner and more cost efficiently. Brand-name products are being developed in a bid to assure quality and consistency as well as to build consumer loyalty. And in a bid to take some of the wild swings out of a notoriously cyclical business, the industry is aiming to better use lesser cuts of beef, like chuck and rump roast, which make up more than 60 percent of the carcass.
"Most people, at least those 40 and under, honestly don't know how to cook some of these cuts," said Don Burnett, president of Burnett & Son, a beef processor east of Los Angeles. And even if they did, he said, "they don't want to take the time to cook them."
Burnett & Son and Harris Ranch were among the first companies to develop beef products that are precooked and ready to be reheated. More recently, a number of other companies have jumped into the market, including IBP, the nation's largest meat packer.
Harris Ranch started in 1992, with a cooked roast that was vacuum packed and ready for the oven. In 1995, the company developed a pot roast that was named best new product of the year by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in 1998; it now has five fully cooked entrees.
"There were some very lean years, excuse the pun, for beef," Mr. Caudill said. "The prices we were receiving were what we were receiving 20 and 30 years before. The demand was just not there to drive the price."
What Harris Ranch has found is that the same brisket that might sell for around $1 a pound wholesale can go for $3.39 a pound when turned into a fully cooked pot roast with gravy.
"We can still add value to the brisket, chuck and round," Mr. Caudill said. "That's why we cook it."
While such products make up a small percentage of the company's sales -- probably 2 to 4 percent of volume on an annual basis -- about 75 percent of the company's net profits will be derived this year from the fully prepared product line, he said.
Still, "It's slow to take off because for the most part the retailer is not willing to put them in the counter and promote them," Mr. Burnett complained.
Cattle-Fax, based on Agriculture Department figures, estimates 1999 per-capita consumption of beef at 69.2 pounds. Chicken is put at 78.9 pounds.
However, food industry analysts noted that beef fares better in household surveys of consumer purchases. NPD Group, a marketing research firm, said that the average American family was expected to purchase 90 pounds of beef this year, compared with 60 pounds of chicken.
But the beef industry remains fragmented with cattle ranchers, processors and retailers fighting bitterly with each other for profits.
"The real challenge facing the farmer is getting a fair share of the dollar at market," said Rob Hosford, a spokesman for the 14,000-member Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association.
Industry officials say they are trying to address such concerns through greater coordination, but other serious hurdles will confront them as they try to build on the success of the last year.
While there has been record high production this year, analysts are predicting that it will drop significantly over the next three years.
Beyond that, owners of high-end steakhouses said that the leaner cattle being bred make it more difficult to find the cuts they want at a time when many more consumers are clamoring for them.
"It's much harder for us in the selection process," said Ms. Storch at Peter Luger, which was so hard hit by a beef shortage last summer that it reduced seating and halted take-out orders.

HEADLINE: Trade Ministers Sidestep A Sticky Issue: Secrecy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Trade ministers today ducked significant action on a problem that helped make the World Trade Organization a punching bag for protesters: the veil of secrecy surrounding its proceedings.
Even though street protesters and the Clinton administration have repeatedly pressed the 135-nation trade group to end its secretive ways, the trade ministers merely recommended that its director-general, Mike Moore, issue a report next July on how to make the group more open. 
 The trade organization's secrecy -- combined with several unpopular decisions reached by its judicial panels, which hold hearings and deliberations behind closed doors -- was one of the complaints among protesters on Seattle's streets this week.
Many demonstrators said it was bad enough that the organization seemed to favor big business, but it was even worse than much of its own business was conducted in secret.
"It's a disaster that they did so little on this," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, which coordinated many of the more peaceful protests here. "The most basic improvements could have been easily agreed on, such as allowing the public to attend its judicial hearings."
The trade organization's officials defend their privacy, saying it is a government-to-government group that deals in highly controversial and arcane matters. These officials fear that if they deliberated in the open, many issues would be heavily lobbied by and become far harder to settle.
The ministers sidestepped the issue just two days after President Clinton strongly urged them to put an end the group's secrecy as a means to help restore its battered legitimacy.
"I think it's imperative that the W.T.O. become more open and accessible," the president said on a speech here this week. "If the W.T.O. expects to have public support grow for our endeavors, the public must see and hear and, in a very real sense, actually join in the deliberations. That's the only way they can know the process is fair, and know their concerns were at least considered."
Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said Washington wanted to make more of the organization's documents public and to open up the trade panel hearings the same way the World Court in the Hague opens its hearings.
In an era when many governments preach openness, the group's panels -- which often decide whether one government's environmental or health rules are improper trade barriers -- hold their hearings in private.
Nor is the public generally allowed to see legal briefs, supporting evidence or transcripts from cases like the one in which a trade panel ruled that the United States had illegally required that imported shrimp had to be caught with nets that allow sea turtles to escape. Under the group's rules, countries can make their legal papers public in a trade dispute, but other than the United States, few countries do so.
"In England, it was called the Star Chamber," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the groups protesting here. "We saw the use of secret trials more recently in the Stalinist purges. When judges meet in secret chambers, it's tyranny."
The secrecy is one reason that many protesters chanted that trade organization was undemocratic. To make this point, one demonstrator's sign read, "Where Have You Gone, Joe Democracy?"
Keith Rockwell, the trade group's spokesman, denied that it was undemocratic.
"The W.T.O. is an intergovernmental organization, and the agreements of the W.T.O. are made by governments," he said. "It's true we hear a rap that about being undemocratic. But does that mean the governments of the U.S., France, India, Canada are anti-democratic institutions?"
The group's critics also attack it for keeping its ministerial meeting closed to public view.
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, also faults the trade organization's affiliates for holding meetings behind closed doors in which government ministers work closely with business executives to determine how to harmonize international standards on issues like labeling whether goods are produced in a way that does not hurt the environment.
"The first thing a dictator wants is for no one to know what he's doing." Mr. Nader said.
"The whole W.T.O. process is a marvelous collage of privileged exclusion to make decisions while groups of the citizenry don't know what's going on and aren't free to participate in these power plays."

HEADLINE: E. J. Safra, 67, Banker and Philanthropist

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Edmond J. Safra, the banker and philanthropist who died in an apparent arson at his Monaco penthouse today, built a vast banking group with Wall Street hustle and old world conservatism.
His death came only a few weeks after he reached a turning point in his tumultuous career, when he agreed after months of negotiations to sell his banking businesses, including Republic National Bank of New York, to HSBC Holdings, the biggest British banking company, for $9.9 billion. 
 Under the agreement, Mr. Safra, 67, who suffered from Parkinson's disease and planned to retire, was to get a payout of $2.3 billion.
The deal to sell Mr. Safra's Republic New York Corporation and Safra Republic Holdings marked the end of independence for a banking business founded more than three decades ago by Mr. Safra, an enduring figure in the banking world.
Mr. Safra started Republic in 1966 in a townhouse just south of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. But he suffered recently from Parkinson's disease, a neurological disorder, and there was growing speculation that he would sell.
In the early years, Mr. Safra built his business largely on wealthy international banking clients, many of whom were Middle Eastern Jews who fled Arab countries after the creation of the state of Israel. With a warm and compelling wit, he made confidentiality and cautious dealing hallmarks of his business.
His opponents, and they were many, accused him of dealing in dirty money, the proceeds of arms trading and drug trafficking.
But in 1989 the American Express Company was forced to offer a public apology and donate $8 million to charities designated by Mr. Safra, in an admission that company executives had organized a campaign to malign him.
To his admirers, and they were numerous in the United States and elsewhere, he was an excellent banker with a compelling intelligence who was dedicated to Jewish causes and poured the proceeds of his banking into numerous charities dear to him and his family.
In a statement today, Sir John R. H. Bond, group chairman of HSBC, said the bank "will uphold the banking tradition and integrity which were the hallmarks of Edmond's life."
In the past, Mr. Safra has been praised by influential figures, including Henry A. Kissinger and Elie Wiesel. He was in demand as a counselor and sat on the international advisory board of Harvard University.
The son of a banker of Syrian origin, Edmond Jacob Safra was born in Beirut on Aug. 6, 1932. At the age of 16, he joined the family banking business, which stretched back a century and was involved in financing the Ottoman Empire's caravan trade. He was involved in the precious metals and foreign exchange activities that benefited from the post-World War II revival of international commerce.
In 1952 his father, Jacob E. Safra, moved the family to Brazil, where three years later the family founded a bank in Sao Paulo that later became Banco Safra S.A., which is still managed by Mr. Safra's brothers, Moishe and Joseph.
Moving to expand the family business abroad, Mr. Safra migrated in 1956 to Geneva. Much of his activity in the following years was based on the extraordinary growth of the Trade Development Bank, which he founded with roughly $1 million of his own money, to tap the Swiss private banking market. In 1983, when Trade Development had deposits of almost $5 billion, he sold it to American Express for $550 million.
When American Express executives became convinced that Mr. Safra had violated a pledge not to start a competing bank business for three years, they hired detectives to track down rumors that he was involved in the Iran-contra scandal and that his banks were laundering drug money.
None of the rumors proved true, but the allegations began surfacing in newspaper articles in various countries. In July 1989, American Express agreed as part of a legal settlement to issue a public apology to Mr. Safra and to donate $8 million to charities of his choice.
By the late 1980's, Mr. Safra was again active in private banking, erecting a banking empire around the Republic New York Corporation and an affiliated company, Safra Republic Holdings, the parents of banks serving clients around the world.
Republic came to dominate some of the more exotic fringes of banking. While its heritage was in the world of international private banking, sheltering the fortunes of multimillionaires, it was equally a leader in precious metals and securities trading.
For Mr. Safra personal banking was a way of life. A banker who once visited his home in Monaco said it was "like a doctor's waiting room," with clients lined up.
Though described by friends and associates as witty and warm, Mr. Safra avoided publicity, agreeing for the first time to reverse his policy in 1988, when he sought to raise new equity for Safra Republic Holdings.
"I try to remain unknown as much as possible," he told one of four reporters he received individually, accompanied by a senior bank associate and a public relations consultant.
Expanding on his austere philosophy of banking, Mr. Safra listed the ingredients of his success: "security, seriousness, hard work, careful lending, controlling expenses."
"You can take a chance in life, but not with a bank," he said. "A bank is not a playground. Banking is conservatism. And it has been the same for a few thousand years."
Mr. Safra kept homes in Geneva, Monaco, New York and Paris.
A passionate family man, Mr. Safra was a contributor to scholarly institutions and charitable causes.
When it was decided to build a Holocaust museum in New York, which opened in 1997, Mr. Safra pledged $1 million. He financed chairs for Sephardic studies at Yeshiva University in New York and at Harvard, in Latin American studies at Harvard and in banking studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
In 1998 Mr. Safra's banking empire was shaken by severe economic downturns in several parts of the world, including Russia, where Republic New York Corporation lost $190 million in trading losses in one quarter because of errant bets on Russian securities.
It was also in 1998 that Republic made a report to the F.B.I. that began an investigation into the possibility of a vast Russian money laundering that came to focus on the Bank of New York.
This March, Republic New York announced that it planned to eliminate hundreds of jobs, about 7 percent of the total, and reorganize to refocus on profitable businesses. About two months later, the sale to HSBC was announced.
Mr. Safra is survived by his wife, Lily, and her two children from a previous marriage, Adriana and Eduardo, and by his brothers, Moise and Joseph, of Brazil, and sisters, Arlette Friedler of Belgium and Gaby Safra and Huguette Michaan of Brazil.

HEADLINE: Gifts for Body and Soul on New York-Havana Flight

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
More than anything, the objects packed carefully into luggage for the first direct flight from New York to Havana in nearly four decades told the story.
There were gifts, a reminder of families separated by distance and years. There was medicine, a necessity engendered by the economic embargo against Cuba. And there was Pokemon -- a harbinger, perhaps, of a Cuban future increasingly shaped by the capitalist world. 
 One hundred thirty-six passengers lined up early last evening for the 8:35 flight from Kennedy International Airport. (Security precautions delayed departure until just after 10 p.m.) Some were en route to the Havana Film Festival; others, to family reunions and a reconnoitering in old neighborhoods.
"He's been waiting for this day to happen for 30 years," said William Morales, 28, a New Jersey police officer, of his grandfather, Guillermo, 85, who is Cuban by birth.
The senior Mr. Morales was philosophical."I don't really know what to expect down there," he said in Spanish, shrugging his shoulders. "Whatever happens, happens."
The flight, which was handled by Marazul Charters, a company based in New Jersey, reflects the Clinton administration's more relaxed policy toward Cuba. It also reflects the determination of the company -- which is run by a father and son, Francisco and Daniel Aruca, who oppose the trade embargo -- to use air travel to influence policy toward Cuba.
Until now, travel to Cuba has required a stop in Miami, the Bahamas or Mexico. The flight will make it easier for the thousands of Cuban-Americans who live in the New York metropolitan region to legally visit relatives on the island. American citizens, while technically free to travel to Cuba, are prohibited from spending money there unless they are journalists, scholars or Cuban-Americans visiting relatives.
"It's my first trip like it was 50 years ago," Pablo Armando Fernandez, 70, a poet and novelist who lives in Cuba, said of not having to stop in Mexico or the Bahamas.
The company has scheduled weekly flights on Friday evenings, at a round-trip fare of $629. The flights are run by Grupo Taca, a Central American airlines alliance.
Karen McMullen, a film editor, and a friend, Julie Schecter, a real estate agent, were going to the film festival. They were able to get on the first flight after two other passengers canceled.
"We're making history," Ms. McMullen said, laughing. But in her next comment was an implicit acknowledgment that the direct flights, which are likely to increase American traffic to the island, could also shape history.
"I wanted to go before it turns into another Disneyland," she said.
Lest passengers needed reminding that the flight was hardly routine, they were handed a packet that included instructions from the Treasury Department about the embargo against Cuba, and a "Cuban Cigar Update" -- a reminder, necessitated by "the revival of interest in cigars and cigar smoking," of the prohibitions on bringing Cuban cigars into the United States.

STRONG JOB GAINS IN CANADA

BYLINE: By Timothy Pritchard 

 BODY:
The economy in Canada added another 60,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dropped by three-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.9 percent, the lowest level in 18 years, Statistics Canada reported. So far this year, the number of employed Canadians has risen by 313,000, a 2.1 percent gain. The tightened job market has increased the risk of higher inflation, and economists expect the Bank of Canada to match any increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board in the United States over the next few months.

HEADLINE: Trade Obstacles Unmoved, Seattle Talks End in Failure

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Global trade talks ended late tonight in complete failure, with the United States abandoning any effort to put together a new round of global trade talks.
The collapse of the talks marks one of the largest defeats for Mr. Clinton's trade policy in his seven years in office, and it was a serious blow to his administration, which had hoped to use the Seattle meeting to advance a bold agenda for trade talks that would stretch into the next millennium. 
 But disagreements on a wide array of issues, including several that were high priorities for President Clinton, as well of the disruption of violent protests, made it impossible to conclude negotiations successfully by late night, according to World Trade Organization officials.
The officials said negotiations would resume at the trade organization's headquarters in Geneva early next year. But the failure here means that the Geneva talks will cover a far narrower group of subjects, including agriculture and trade in service, and will fall far short of the goal set by the trade organization and the Clinton administration: the beginning of broad new round of global trade talks.
"There were a range of serious sticking points, and we found it difficult to knit together any kind of final agreement," Keith Rockwell, the trade organization's spokesman, said late last night. "We realized there was just no way it could be done in Seattle."
Mr. Rockwell said that the trade organization and its members still intended to push for talks on many of the sensitive issues that were addressed here, but had set no date for resuming formal discussions on a framework for a new round of trade talks.
Mr. Clinton had seen the talks here as a chance to secure his reputation as a free trader with a social conscience. Those hopes were thwarted by the combination of occasionally violent street protests and tepid support for many administration goals among both rich and poor nations.
Equally disappointed were those who favor an aggressive agenda for talks in coming years, as well as those who want to make the trade group more sensitive to labor and environmental concerns.
Protests continued throughout the day outside the Seattle convention center. But with a heavy police presence, there were no disruptions.
Negotiators, who were locked in discussions well past their deadline tonight, had seemed close to a final agreement. But draft texts and conversations with people involved in the talks made it clear that it would have outlined only a minimal, narrow basis for future talks.
As the talks bogged down, Peter S. Watson, former head of the International Trade Commission and a leading trade lawyer in Washington, said: "What you're seeing is the effect of the demonstrations, as well as some real disagreements among the W.T.O. members. They have a commitment to trade talks' going forward. But they are delaying all the hard decisions for future negotiations."
The United States had persuaded Europe and Japan to agree on talks that could eliminate subsidies on farm goods, but only at the cost of two firmly held American positions.
One opposes reviewing rules to prevent countries from selling below-cost goods in a foreign market, a practice called "dumping." Washington also seemed to step back from its goal of widening markets for genetically modified foods.
And the Clinton administration stumbled in its efforts to make labor rights a core part of trade negotiations in the future. The United States had already backed away from its original goal of setting up a working group on labor in the World Trade Organization. But it kept struggling to obtain a consensus on a forum that would operate outside the trade group but ultimately report to it.
One significant stumbling block was the push to open the trade group to increased public scrutiny. Ending the secretive ways was a common demand among many protesters here and became a top priority for the Clinton administration. Draft documents suggest that members of the trade group took only baby steps on the issue.
Negotiators did reach a preliminary accord that would have allowed more trade documents to be declassified and circulated to the public, people close to the talks said. But even so, trials held by the judges in the trade group would have remained off limits to observers, and the judges would not have accepted "friend of the court" briefs from people who wanted to voice opinions on sensitive issues, the people close to the talks added.
Advocates of a more open trade group had considered those steps modest but necessary to gain the trust of smaller governments, as well as nongovernment environmental and labor groups.
Even while negotiations continued, Mr. Clinton telephoned world leaders to try to resolve several of the most contentious issues. He had long discussions with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan; Romano Prodi, president of the European Union, and Ernesto Zedillo, the Mexican president, administration officials said. Mr. Obuchi and Mr. Prodi had declined to attend the Seattle meeting. The administration had seemed to make some progress, including a reference to eliminating various subsidies in a draft framework for talks on farm goods.
Europe and Japan, among the leading users of subsidies to protect their inefficient farmers from competition, had strongly opposed ending subsidies, while Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States, as well as several other major agricultural exporters had insisted on working toward ending all subsidies on farm goods.
But the wording on the draft framework for farm talks fell well short of the original American goal, and negotiators were unable to agree on a time frame for eliminating subsidies.
The European Union and Japan also made some progress before the talks failed, managing to obtain concessions that would have allowed nations to treat agriculture and family farms as areas needing special protection -- in effect classifying farms as an environmental resource and a way of life, not a commodity for trade.
The United States, in its struggle for an agreement, backed down on a crucial Japanese demand, that the trade organization consider ways to police the use of antidumping rules. Japan, along with many developing nations, has criticized how Washington uses laws against dumping to protect industries, especially the steel industry.
Administration officials had hoped a final agreement would contain some provision for studying and possibly amending rules governing the use of anti-dumping laws. They said that concession was meant to persuade Japan to back the United States on several other issues.
The most important area on which the United States sought Japan's support was labor rights. The administration, under heavy pressure from American unions, spent its political capital at the talks in seeking support for banning child labor and setting standards for treatment of workers.
Advancing demands from the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the administration had pushed to establish a permanent internal group to recommend how to use trade rules to enforce labor rights guaranteed in international treaties like the right to unionize.
But developing countries, led by Egypt and India, battled the American proposal, insisting that workers' rights should in no way be linked to trade. Those nations believe that even studying such ties could lead to developed countries' imposing sanctions on poor ones found to violate workers' rights.
Some countries feared that the issue would have given an unwanted entry to Western countries eager to impose their ideals of human rights on less-developed countries.
American labor leaders had said it was imperative to link workers' rights to trade, arguing that global corporations often set up factories in countries like China, where independent unions are suppressed, helping to hold down wages.
Thousands of union members traveled here and conducted the largest of a series of protests against the trade group.
Mr. Clinton at one point suggested that the organization should one day sanction countries that violate internationally accepted labor norms. But Mr. Clinton's use of the word sanctions hardened opposition, despite a frenzied administration effort to play down the president's remarks.
By this morning, American negotiators conceded that they had lost the campaign to form a new working group on labor in the W.T.O., essentially sacrificing their highest-profile goal for this round of talks.
"It became clear from the president language that the initiative put forward by the administration was something far more pervasive," said Mr. Watson, the trade expert. "That made the U.S. very isolated on that proposal and forced them to depart from their original objectives."

HEADLINE: A Few of Our Favorite Things

BYLINE: By James Bennet; James Bennet is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Civilizations typically do not choose their own relics. A footprint in the mud, a shard of pottery, a terrified figure huddled beneath a downpour of volcanic ash -- such are the random hints and feints that departed cultures indifferently bequeath archaeologists.
The immediate hurdle facing any attempt at deliberate relic assembling is: Who gets to play the volcano? If the intent is to bottle in the Times Capsule a sense of life in America circa 2000, the surest way would be to canvass a wide range of Americans living in a demographically representative community, a latter-day Peoria. 
 Which is how I happened to find myself in Fountain, Colo., one brilliant August afternoon, eating chicken salad out of a hollowed-out tomato in Gold Tooth Annie's restaurant and furtively wondering what the waitress, Melinda Cox, would put in a time capsule. Like most of the people I encountered, Cox turned out to be friendly and endlessly patient but rather flummoxed when I asked her for capsule suggestions. She finally offered one of her journal entries. "I journal every night," she said, as a way to sort through hectic days of double shifts and errands.
During the next few days, dozens of Fountain's residents -- from the Chancellor Mobile Home Park to Dominic Venetucci's farm to the SCI Computer factory to a rehearsal of the Fountain Valley Harmonizers -- proposed artifacts for the Times Capsule, what archaeologists call realia: a piece of barbed wire, a microprocessor, a penny squashed by one of the coal trains that interrupt traffic and conversation, a pack of cigarettes, a high-school code of conduct, an issue of Girls' Life, a hood ornament from a '57 Chevy, a Beanie Baby, a brick, a Nintendo 64, a hearing aid, a pumpkin seed, a packet of wildflower seeds, an audiotape of a high-speed police chase, Prozac, Valium, a television remote control, a menu from Ralph's Fine Dining and a Purple Heart, which Ralph Nothstine, the proprietor of Ralph's, handed me to take away. He was puzzled when I gave the medal back. After all, he had five of them, awarded for his service in Vietnam.
As important as the objects themselves were the reasons they were chosen. On its own, a medal or a length of barbed wire would convey little or nothing to an archaeologist 1,000 years hence. "They don't speak for themselves," warned the anthropologist Clifford Geertz, as he sat beneath the mask of a toothy Javanese demon in his office at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. "The reason these things are important, obviously, is they're important to the people in the role they play in their lives, and that's not readable -- in most cases, anyway -- off the object." Only people steeped in the place and time, he said, could supply depth of meaning for the items they chose.
I wound up in fountain because of a computer in Queens. Seeking a compact cross-section of the country, Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist, had crunched the most recent estimates by the Census Bureau, from 1997, of the makeup of the population. He sorted through the thousands of "places" and "minor civil divisions" to find those that mirror the country in terms of age, income and race. Back came a list of 26 cities, towns and suburbs, ranging in size and seeming improbability from Las Vegas down to Wild Peach Village, Tex.
Next, Dr. Beveridge sifted the communities through a finer statistical screen, looking at the age distribution of each area, the proportion of college graduates, the size of families and such. No prospect made a perfect match with the United States as a whole. Some lacked a local government or were dominated by a university or had undergone a recent wrenching change, like the closing of a military base.
The Fountain area came closest, even though the residents are a little poorer and not quite as educated as most Americans. The community's appeal went beyond statistics. It is a suburb, where most Americans live now, in the West, where they are still moving. The local economy is booming, with development advancing daily. Except for the view to the west, where Pikes Peak presides over the front range of the Rocky Mountains, everything is in flux.
People are proud of the diversity and relative tranquillity of Fountain, a satellite of Colorado Springs, seven miles away. They are delighted with the new businesses, the new schools, the low taxes. Not surprisingly, though, the pace of change has unsettled the town's residents. Over and over, they suggested items to symbolize what they saw as troubling national currents that were eddying into their valley.
At Aragon Elementary School on Main Street, several fourth graders were strongly of the opinion that the movie "Titanic" should be preserved for all time, along with a toothbrush, a Broncos shirt and a rabbit's foot. "It would show that we're superstitious," explained Shayne Hulce. And why are we? "Because bad things happen to people."
Among a flock of fifth graders gathered in an empty classroom, music was a popular choice -- Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, the Backstreet Boys. Kevin Miranda favored putting in pills, to show that medicine could combat disease. One of his classmates -- the only person all week to raise the possibility of a military threat, which she thought would come from Kuwait -- suggested a picture of nearby Cheyenne Mountain, which bristles with antennae and houses the country's nuclear early-warning system.
"There's too much technology now," said Virginia Aguirre, a fifth grader. "They're making such a big deal about the Y2K bug."
Her classmate Cassandra Cory agreed. "Everyone's obsessed with computers, 'cause they do your homework for you and you can get on the Internet and it's easier to transport letters -- and they just irritate me so much." Why? " 'Cause of the Internet, my grandma went insane and said she was going to buy a cave in Montana and save up all the silver. She thought we were going to lose all our electricity."
When Noel Gugliotta suggested that a laptop computer should go in the capsule, Cassandra said it should have "a circle around it and a line through it."
At this point, Virginia turned to me and declared with great earnestness: "I'd like you to make it possible that I could meet Stone Cold Steve Austin." Then one of the boys spoke up. "Put a bomb in there so that when they open it, it blows up in their faces." He laughed, then thought better of his idea. "But then they might get in a time machine and start killing us."
There was a quiet pause before Virginia explained: "He's an alien. I swear it."
"I've lived here all my life," Noel said, gently shifting the subject. "I think Fountain is a very quiet town. It has its people that make mistakes. It has its good side and its bad side."
The children turned to a concern I often heard from the grown-ups: development, specifically the fast-rising communities, with antique names like Heritage and Comanche Village, that are spreading to the east, consuming the range land. One student suggested a picture of the land 10 years ago, then of the same spot today. "They're nice houses but they've barely got a yard," Virginia said. "You hardly have room for a swing set."
But, Noel added, "they take care of the lawns really, really well."
When I met with a group of teachers in the spanking-new brick-and-steel high school about a half mile from Aragon Elementary, Mitch Johnson, the high school's dean of students, suggested that the time capsule contain a composite picture of a graduating class, to capture a dying practice. He said kids just don't want to pay the $15 anymore to contribute a head shot to the compilations, which march backward in time down the school walls. "It's part of a culture that is not as bonded as it used to be," he said, as his colleagues nodded. Marilyn Bribach, an English teacher, suggested a telephone receiver, to represent the way parents call to complain if their child is disciplined.
"I think it stems from parental guilt," said Delores Sauls, a science teacher at the middle school. "Parents are in the work force, so they feel they're not there for them. They need to back them up regardless."
Down the road, at the super Wal-Mart on Highway 85, more than two dozen workers in their blue vests and name badges gathered one afternoon in a windowless training room. At 209,000 square feet, the store is the largest of its kind in Colorado; in sporting goods, Rick Williams sells more earthworms than any other Wal-Mart employee in the nation -- up to 350 cartons a week.
As shyness dissipated, suggestions for the time capsule multiplied: a bar code; a baseball; a Wal-Mart name badge; a pair of bell-bottoms; and a Furby, the chattering doll that touched off a consumer frenzy last year like no one had seen before. The store got in 72 of them the day after Thanksgiving and fights broke out in the aisles.
Dale Norbeck, the manager in electronics, suggested a "servo tag" or "gator tag," the plastic gizmos that provoke anti-shoplifting alarms.
"We have to servo-tag everything in the store now," Norbeck said. "The fact is, before, we never needed to."
Even at a meeting of the town council, the suggestions started sweet but turned sour. A deer antler or cow horn, said Billy Oneyear, to symbolize the valley's rural roots.
Mary Jo Durbin, seated with the other council members around a raised, curved desk, suggested a key, which sounded straightforward enough until she explained why. Particularly in light of the shooting at Columbine High School last year, she said, each local school locks every outside door save one during the day, as a security measure.
Greg Nyhoff, Fountain's city manager, volunteered the idea of a wedding ring, since he suspected that marriage would be extinct in 1,000 years, given the rising divorce rate.
"I have a couple I could spare," cracked Terrie Burke, one of the council members.
"That's an idea," Ken Barela, a mental-health administrator and the town's unpaid mayor, said with a laugh. "Multiple wedding rings from one person."
Tim Holt, the coordinator of Fountain's new community center, was wearing a dark suit and an equally serious expression, so his proposal was surprising: a Hacky Sack, one of the leather beanbags that young people -- often with long hair and bare feet -- labor to keep in the air without using their hands. A former high-school football and basketball coach, Holt explained that uptight parents, minivans and dreams of athletic scholarships were draining children's sports of the spontaneity of the pickup games he always loved.
"I think the Hacky Sack represents that," he explained. "It's something they can go and kick by themselves and there's no one putting pressure on them to get a touchdown or hit a home run. No parent is forming a Hacky Sack league and setting up games."
Young people had ideas of their own for how to memorialize -- and express their ambivalence about -- life in 1999. Most evenings, as the sun drops behind Pikes Peak, many of Fountain's youth can be found in Metcalf Park, grinding over rails or flying skyward off ramps on their skateboards and Rollerblades. As they glided back and forth one evening, some called out suggestions for the capsule: a picture of a grizzly bear and a bald eagle, because they will surely be extinct by the year 3000; an M240 Bravo machine gun, capable of spewing 100 rounds in less than five seconds, to reflect interest in guns and hunting; a copy of the apocalyptic comic book "Spawn." Jason Freyer, a 20-year-old in Rollerblades and a black T-shirt from the band Bush, suggested a No Skateboarding sign. "It shows what we were told not to do -- but we did it anyway," he said, as his friends hooted their agreement.
Even after initial, puzzled silence about the Times Capsule eased into long talks about life in Fountain, some subjects went almost completely unmentioned. The teachers I met were astonished by how freely their students talk about sex these days. But no one -- adolescent or adult -- suggested an object to recall that great human preoccupation besides Viagra, which was mentioned more as a relic of stress. Almost no one brought up national politics, though local concerns like preserving the valley's environment prompted suggestions like a core sample from a cottonwood tree. Even religion, in a region that is a bastion of Christian conservatism, rated only a few items, including a crucifix and a passage from Exodus to show that, despite life's trials, people continue to struggle toward a promised land.
And yet, time and again, people proposed symbols of the trials themselves: a pamphlet on adult literacy to show that, at the end of the 20th century, some adult Americans cannot read; a bag of garbage to illustrate how wasteful Americans are; a vial of water from Fountain Creek to show how polluted it has become; a butterfly hair clip to highlight how fashion-conscious kids are; instructions on resisting child abduction; a kit on protecting computers against the millennium software bug to show how much fretting the glitch caused.
"There's a kind of sourness to a lot of these," Geertz, the anthropologist, mused later, as he surveyed the list in his Princeton office. "Multiple wedding rings for one person." He detected what he called a "proleptic nostalgia," a sort of anticipatory wistfulness. "There's something they're looking forward to looking back to," he said with a smile. Despite Fountain's -- and America's -- good fortune at the turn of the millennium, many of the suggestions bordered on the elegiac. There is much that the natives miss about life as it once was in Fountain, like the way the bright lights used to draw everyone to a high-school football game at night. They have learned that traditions can decay, that streams can become polluted, that presidents can lie through their teeth. And so they fear that the good things that are left -- like the migratory songbirds that seasonally nest down by the creek -- will sooner or later go the way of the good things that have already gone.
Given all this anxiety, the self-diminishing sense of a world eluding one's control, it should come as no surprise, perhaps, that people kept talking about their lawns.
For their lawns are beautiful, green as emerald chips, and their lawns are within their control. No, green grass does not naturally grow on Colorado's high, brown plains; the sod is often Kentucky bluegrass sliced from a farm. When it first goes down like a living carpet, you have to water it three times a day, then two times a day after it takes. If it turns brown, the neighbors can turn nasty. But you can always buy new sod.
For Norman LaMar Broderick, that sod is an emblem, like his garage-door opener, of the satisfaction he has found in owning his own home in the Heritage development, after growing up in the projects of Charleston, S. C. Here, your neighbors not only accept you, they will even move your sprinkler for you if you go out. When he drives home at night from nearby Fort Carson, he can punch his garage-door opener two blocks away and know exactly what will be waiting for him: his daughters will greet him and then go outside to play and all he and his wife will have to think about is what to cook for dinner.
"I'd put in a strip of sod," he said, as some of his neighbors chuckled. "That's Fountain. Everybody's got sod."
Over at Fort Carson, where artillery practice regularly rattles windows throughout Fountain, soldiers who live off the base also kept bringing up lawns -- though they also suggested a cell phone, primer for a cannon and a Meal Ready to Eat. (There was some dispute over which one, the Thai chicken or the pork chop in "Jamaican-style sauce.") "Everyone's watering their grass all the time," said Sgt. John Gazzola, who suggested that the capsule contain a sprinkler head.
"I am bound contractually to keep my lawn green," declared Grant Goins, a wry sergeant first class.
Still, as headaches go, keeping the grass green is a mild one. "You get people in some neighborhoods worried about gang violence and tumors from the power lines," said Staff Sgt. Wayne Murray. "The only thing we're worried about is the grass."

FICTION & POETRY
AHAB'S WIFE: Or, The Star-Gazer. By Sena Jeter Naslund. (Morrow, $28.) The great whaling novel reworked from a female, liberal, Protestant point of view, with compassion replacing obsession and good deeds determining a happy ending; Ahab's wife gets along without him very well.
AMSTERDAM. By Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.) In this tartly comic novel, winner of the 1998 Booker Prize, the author dispatches his self-important heroes, a composer and an editor, on the very short road from hubris to nemesis.
AMY AND ISABELLE. By Elizabeth Strout. (Random House, $22.95.) This evocative first novel examines with ruthless intimacy the relationship between a girl of 16 and her mother, who have only recently begun to hate each other.

ANOTHER WORLD. By Pat Barker. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Old hatreds, wounds and guilt, simmering from World War I and beyond, haunt a family in a novel set in modern Newcastle.
THE ARTIST'S WIDOW. By Shena Mackay. (Moyer Bell, $21.95.) The Scottish writer deliciously skewers fin de siecle solipsism in a novel where characters proffer cloying floral tributes and canned platitudes, and where the only genuine sensibility is the title character's grief.

THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY. Edited by John Updike and Katrina Kenison. (Houghton Mifflin, $28.) A collection that celebrates short fiction in the United States and a series called Best American Short Stories, in whose annual volumes each of the stories in this anthology once appeared.
BONE BY BONE. By Peter Matthiessen. (Random House, $26.95.) The last of three novels inhabited and propelled by Edgar J. Watson, a cane planter, developer and murderer whose conquest of Florida's Gulf Coast marches with the imperialist impulses of the young United States.
THE BOOK BORROWER. By Alice Mattison. (Morrow, $24.) A wrenching novel that embraces two stories: the 20-year friendship of two women in contemporary New York, and the career of an anarchist agitator of the 1920's, a woman who shows up in old age to make a lot of trouble.
THE BOOK OF HAPPINESS. By Nina Berberova. (New Directions, $23.95.) Set in the years surrounding the Russian Revolution, this novel of passionate candor allows its characters to love without irony and to speak ingenuously about what they really want (including happiness).
THE BREAKAGE. By Glyn Maxwell. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) With a host of dexterous and nimbly honed lines and images, this young poet blends the brutally honest introspection of American poets like Frost and Lowell with accessible, lighthearted language reminiscent of mid-20th-century British masters like Auden and Betjeman.

Breath and Shadows. By Ella Leffland. (Morrow, $24.) Suffused with a moonlit melancholy, this novel braids together three generations of a Danish family to pose a haunting question: what do we leave behind to prove we have ever existed?
Brief interviews with hideous men. By David Foster Wallace. (Little, Brown, $24.) In their depictions of characters whose deviant behavior puts them an angstrom away from undiluted sociopathy, these stories employ an incisive moral sensibility to dissect WASP-y male self-absorption.
CAN YOU WAVE BYE BYE, BABY? Stories. By Elyse Gasco. (Picador USA, $17.) A vivid first story collection, revolving around contentious issues of adoption and parenthood; mothers are uncertain on points of biology and feeling, while fathers may be absent but never suffer doubts.
CHOCOLAT. By Joanne Harris. (Viking, $22.95.) An accomplished and tempting novel in which a French village priest is inspired to sabotage when he perceives (correctly) a chocolate festival that coincides with Easter as an assault on the faith.

THE CONVERSION. By Aharon Appelfeld. (Schocken, $22.) An apostate seems to learn that Jews should remain Jews in this quasi-historical novel that analyzes the significance of religious identity in the disintegrating Hapsburg Empire.
THE COUNTRY LIFE. By Rachel Cusk. (Picador USA, $24.) A controlled and subversive comic novel in the British tradition of wet and weedy country life, inhabited by unscrupulous rural tyrants, told by a governess from London who is off her own hinges.

DAMASCUS. By Richard Beard. (Arcade, $23.95.) Time goes nowhere in this deft, charming novel whose lead characters, two otherwise unremarkable Britons, are born, fall in love, suffer immersion in a triangle and do whatever else they do on the identical date in November.
A Dangerous Friend. By Ward Just. (Peter Davison/Houghton Mifflin, $23.) As its well-meaning civilian hero attempts to find an American officer captured in Vietnam, this novel emerges as an allegory for this country's place in the increasingly deranged world of the mid-1960's.
DEVIL'S VALLEY. By Andre Brink. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) A mythographic novel that resurrects and reburies the Afrikaner past by creating a town, isolated for 150 years, where all is so white a portrait painter forbids himself brown pigments.
DREAMLAND. By Kevin Baker. (HarperCollins, $26.) A jampacked historical fantasy that flings real and imaginary characters into the whirlwind of dangerous, irresistible energy that was New York City in the first decade of this century.
THE DREAM MISTRESS. By Jenny Diski. (Ecco, $23.95.) A novel that weaves narrative, dream and memory into a web of resonant interconnections between a woman who suffers from trances and a bag lady who has neither name nor face.
DUANE'S DEPRESSED. By Larry McMurtry. (Simon & Schuster, $26.) In fact, Duane's not so depressed; he's just taking time out at 62 to rework and unclutter his life in the final volume of the expansive half-century Texas trilogy that began with "The Last Picture Show."
EAST INTO UPPER EAST: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi. By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. (Counterpoint, $25.) Stories by a spellbinding urban fabulist, concerning divided souls -- people whose protective coloration belies their inner longings -- in two great cities.
Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice. By A. S. Byatt. (Random House, $21.95.) In stories that home in on the place where aesthetics and moralism meet, priggish northerners fettered by incuriosity (the greatest crime in the universe of Byatt's creation) are forced to rub shoulders with a warmer-blooded breed -- artists, mostly -- who share an unremitting interest in the world around them.
EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON. By Oscar Hijuelos. (HarperFlamingo, $25.) A tender novel, by the author of "The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love," in which a beautiful Cuban emigre who works as a cleaning lady is the victim of a struggle between her instinct for self-invention and her inability to devise a suitable self.
ENGLAND, ENGLAND. By Julian Barnes. (Knopf, $23.) This satirical novel suggests that while there may always be an England, its immediate future looks more like a theme park than an empire.
THE EXPERIMENT. By John Darnton. (Dutton, $24.95.) A scientific thriller, by the culture editor of The New York Times, in which things go hair-raisingly wrong when the commanders of new technologies succumb to the lust for immortality.
EXPOSE. By Laura Van Wormer. (Mira, $21.95.) In this romantic suspense novel, a reporter returns home to Connecticut and solves the murder of her father two decades earlier.
FOR THE RELIEF OF UNBEARABLE URGES. By Nathan Englander. (Knopf, $22.) Ambitious short stories by a 29-year-old former yeshiva student from New York, now living in secular Israel; his characters are able to flourish in a borderland between the author's old world and that new one.
FREDY NEPTUNE. By Les Murray. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.50.) This verse novel follows an itinerant Everyman from Australia, afflicted with an unusual power, as he travels through the horrors of the 20th century.
FREEDOM SONG: Three Novels. By Amit Chaudhuri. (Knopf, $24.) Brilliant, artfully plotless narratives by a writer less interested in any particular story than in the bits of life and temporary states out of which lives are made.
GAP CREEK. By Robert Morgan. (Algonquin, $22.95.) Rotten luck almost always prevails for the penniless characters in Morgan's third novel, set in rural North Carolina at the turn of the century; but the book sings with its detailed evocations of daily life and strategies for getting through it.
A GESTURE LIFE. By Chang-rae Lee. (Riverhead, $23.95.) In this wise and tender novel, kindly Franklin Hata, Korean-born, prosperous in a New York suburb, reflects on his acts in World War II and tries to work out his true identity.
THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET. By Salman Rushdie. (Holt, $27.50.) Gods, humans and rock performers mix and match conduct -- some horrific, some charming -- in a novel not of our world but of a dangerous, fragile one, riven with earthquakes and set at a refractive angle to ours.

HEAVY WATER: And Other Stories. By Martin Amis. (Harmony, $21.) Stories in which Amis's comic timing, perfect pitch and curatorial eye are applied to issues like sexual norms, the rewards of poetry and the date of the end of the world.
HOMESICKNESS. By Murray Bail. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, paper, $14.) An Australian novel that cogitates on the dubious pleasures of mass tourism as a group of 13 follows a senseless itinerary through surreal and baffling museums.
THE HONEY THIEF. By Elizabeth Graver. (Hyperion, $22.95.) An elegant, straightforward novel in which a troubled 11-year-old girl, her widowed mother and a reclusive beekeeper attain, not happiness, but a position in which it is possible.
HUMAN VOICES. By Penelope Fitzgerald. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) In her wry novel set during the blitz, the author uses the BBC's Broadcasting House as a microcosm in which the 9 o'clock news kept Britain abreast of the progress of its finest hour.

INCUBUS. By Ann Arensberg. (Knopf, $24.) Symptoms of witchcraft (wilted crops, monstrous births), followed by bodiless sexual entities, descend on a Maine town, apparently as metaphors for its social inadequacies, in this postmodern psychological Gothic novel.
IN SEPTEMBER, THE LIGHT CHANGES: Stories. By Andrew Holleran. (Hyperion, $23.95.) Finely made stories, sharply awake to the idioms, cadences and concerns of gay life in the late 20th century, obsessionally aware of the passing of friends, health and youth.
Interpreter Of Maladies: Stories. By Jhumpa Lahiri. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) In an elegant debut collection that navigates the cultural border between India and America, people marry in haste and, wondrously, acquire sympathy for their improbable mates at leisure.
THE INTUITIONIST. By Colson Whitehead. (Anchor, $19.95.) An ingenious, original first novel that pits empiricism against intuition in elevator inspection by way of approaching racial struggle and social progress.
ITALIAN FEVER. By Valerie Martin. (Knopf, $22.) Consciousness rather than plot develops in this novel that uses Italy as background to examine the effects of lovemaking on its reflective heroine.
JACKSTRAWS: Poems. By Charles Simic. (Harcourt Brace, $22.) In several poems addressed to the moral and eschatological dimensions of insect life, Simic snatches profundities from the air around him, like so many flies to some wanton boy.
Jem (and Sam). By Ferdinand Mount. (Carroll & Graf, $25.95.) A rollicking novel of the Restoration, told from the viewpoint of one Jeremiah Mount (in real life a drinking buddy of Samuel Pepys and a possible progenitor of the author), who, though gripped by a professional envy that would stagger Salieri, comes at last to find saving grace in failure.
THE JEW OF NEW YORK. By Ben Katchor. (Pantheon, $20.) Set in a shadowy, understated, mysteriously opaque New York of 1830, this graphic novel revolves, often at some distance, around a plan for a Jewish refuge upstate and a wandering, disgraced kosher slaughterer who has briefly been there.
A JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM. By A. B. Yehoshua. (Doubleday, $24.95.) Starting in A.D. 999, the pre-eminent Israeli modernist whisks some Jewish merchants across Europe to expose and examine the breaches between Sephardi and Ashkenazi, Jew and Christian, Muslim and Jew, men and women.
Juneteenth. By Ralph Ellison. Edited by John F. Callahan. (Random House, $25.) Assembled by his literary executor from mountains of notes, this story of a racist white senator raised as black may or may not be construed as Ellison's second novel.
KAFKA'S CURSE. By Achmat Dangor. (Pantheon, $22.) A novel of magical fables in which the lies and lunacy of apartheid in the old South Africa continue their work in the new -- when, for instance, a man who had faked his race for a higher notch is metamorphosed into a tree.
THE KIND I'M LIKELY TO GET: A Collection. By Ken Foster. (Quill/Morrow, paper, $12.) Mostly urban short stories about mostly urban characters on whom the author's delicacy and attention confer a measure of lovability, though one wouldn't really want to know them.
THE LAST LIFE. By Claire Messud. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) Messud's second novel concerns the conflicted history of the French who returned from Algiers and the thoughtful, prematurely wise narrator's imaginative efforts to trace that history in her own inner formation.

LITTLE GREEN MEN. By Christopher Buckley. (Random House, $24.95.) A witty, high-spirited political satire whose pretext is that flying saucers are a hoax by a government organization so secret even the president doesn't know about it.
THE LONG FIRM. By Jake Arnott. (Soho, $25.) This challenging first novel (with five narrators) constructs, from the elements of London's 1960's demimonde, a towering gay gangster, Harry Starks, who earns both our admiration and horror.
THE LONG HOME. By William Gay. (MacMurray & Beck, $24.95.) This first novelist fears no theme, however large; it's good versus evil in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better armed than evil and willing to exert violence.
LOSING NELSON. By Barry Unsworth. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A provocative, absorbing novel whose mad hero hides from his own life by his elaborate identification with Admiral Nelson, a folly he understands well enough to labor at the same time to destroy it.
LOUSE. By David Grand. (Arcade, $23.95.) An eerie and angry first novel that mirrors the anguish of workers in an age of job insecurity, video surveillance and shameless corporate euphemisms; its finest character is a monstrous capitalist modeled on the aging Howard Hughes.
Love in a Dead Language: A Romance. By Lee Siegel. (University of Chicago, $25.) An ambitious and imaginative novel, masquerading as a commentary on the Kama Sutra, becomes a literary puzzle in which Nabokov, Joyce and Philip Roth provide the clues.

MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN. By Jonathan Lethem. (Doubleday, $23.95.) An energetic, out-of-kilter detective novel that is as much about consciousness as crime; the narrator is a gumshoe afflicted with Tourette's syndrome.
MR. DARWIN'S SHOOTER. By Roger McDonald. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) An intellectually curious novel in which a devout seaman's life is distorted by helping Darwin's research and later believing Darwin meant all along to prove there is no God.
MR. WROE'S VIRGINS. By Jane Rogers. (Overlook, $24.95.) An engaging, serious novel whose hero, the real-life prophet John Wroe (1782-1863), asked his congregation for seven virgins for his "comfort and succor," and got them.
MUSIC FOR TORCHING. By A. M. Homes. (Rob Weisbach/Morrow, $26.) Another provocative novel from an author who was almost banned in Britain, this time about a very odd couple in a middle-class suburbia that even Cheever never imagined.
THE MUSIC LESSON. By Katharine Weber. (Crown, $21.) An elegant, suspenseful novel about a New York art historian who becomes part of an I.R.A. plot to steal a Vermeer painting.
MY DATE WITH SATAN: Stories. By Stacey Richter. (Scribner, $22.) Sometimes very funny, sometimes bizarre to excess, the stories in this first collection are linked to one another by a sense of common humanity, even when it is displayed by scary-looking rock stars.
MY FATHER, DANCING: Stories. By Bliss Broyard. (Knopf, $22.) The protagonists in Broyard's first story collection have lived relatively sheltered, privileged lives as the daughters of sophisticated, worldly fathers whose influence is hard to shake.
MY PEOPLE'S WALTZ. By Dale Ray Phillips. (Norton, $22.95.) A first collection of short stories, all concerning a family of bighearted sinners and their fortunes, which run to bad debts, bad love affairs and bad fishing trips but are always supported by a misguided capacity for hope.
My Russian. By Deirdre McNamer. (Houghton Mifflin, $24.) When her husband is shot and gravely wounded and her virile Slavic gardener disappears without a trace, the heroine of this novel does what any sensible person would do: drops out of sight and returns incognito to redraw the course of her own life.
THE NEW SWEET STYLE. By Vassily Aksyonov. (Random House, $29.95.) A luscious Russian novel with a love story at its heart, surrounded by picaresque events in America and demanding, the author insists, frequent help from the reader.
THE NIGHT INSPECTOR. By Frederick Busch. (Harmony, $23.) A Union sniper in the Civil War, encased in a mask to hide his disfigurement from a wound that ended his Army career, makes unlikely friends with a famous author down on his luck who sounds a lot like Melville.
NOTES OF A DESOLATE MAN. By Chu Tien-Wen. (Columbia University, $19.95.) The political isolation of Taiwan becomes a metaphor for the life of gay men in this lively, sharp-witted novel (written by a woman but narrated by a man) that directly addresses the consciousness of mortality.
NOVEMBER 1916. The Red Wheel: Knot II. By Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.) Disbelief is suspended in this huge novel as the mass of muddle and detail confronting ordinary Russians transcends the reader's knowledge of what really ensued.
ON THE BUS WITH ROSA PARKS. By Rita Dove. (Norton, $21.) In her meditations on Rosa Parks and other civil rights veterans, the poet's eye and voice, trained for the nearly invisible detail, rescue characters from obscurity by illuminating their ordinariness.
OPENED GROUND: Selected Poems, 1966-1996. By Seamus Heaney. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) A selection from earlier books, along with a few previously uncollected poems and his 1995 Nobel Prize address, that eloquently confirms Heaney's status as the most skillful and profound poet writing in English.
ORIGINAL BLISS. By A. L. Kennedy. (Knopf, $21.) A novel by a Glaswegian woman in which another Glaswegian woman, hungry for love and touch, enters into a dark romance with a pop-psych guru, more or less arranged, she understands, by divine providence.
OUT OF THE WOODS: Stories. By Chris Offutt. (Simon & Schuster, $21.) Lean, brilliant examinations of romantic obsessions whose love objects are not men and women but the whole state of Kentucky and in particular its landscape.
THE PALACE. By Lisa St. Aubin de Tern. (Ecco, $23.95.) Glittering, passionate, minute description of material acquisitions enhances this novel about a former political prisoner who rises in society and builds a palace for the girl of his dreams.
PARIS TRANCE: A Romance. By Geoff Dyer. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) A novel about a dithering young Englishman who comes to Paris to write a book and finds that contentment can curdle into inertia.
THE PECULIAR MEMORIES OF THOMAS PENMAN. By Bruce Robinson. (Overlook, $24.95.) This first novel by the writer and director of "Withnail and I" conveys an implausible empathy for a horrid British schoolboy searching for personal identity in the grim, unregretted 1950's.
THE PEKING LETTER: A Novel of the Chinese Civil War. By Seymour Topping. (Cornelia and Michael Bessie/Public Affairs, $25.)

The worship of beauty leads to murder and madness, as this English mistress of suspense charts a collision course for two preternaturally beautiful teenagers: an unloved boy who grew up to be a sociopath and the overprotected girl who grew up to be his perfect victim.
SOME DEATHS BEFORE DYING. By Peter Dickinson. (Mysterious Press/Warner, $23.) Only a daredevil stylist like Dickinson could pull off this tour de force of mental gymnastics, in which a 90-year-old Englishwoman, almost completely paralyzed, virtually speechless and very near death, exercises her indomitable will to break the code on a shameful family secret.
 
SCIENCE FICTION
THE EXTREMES. By Christopher Priest. (St. Martin's, $24.95.) This serious novel about violence in our time subjects its heroine -- and the reader -- to a series of harrowing scenarios before achieving a surprising yet, on its own terms, believable happy ending. A remarkable achievement.
THE MARTIANS. By Kim Stanley Robinson. (Spectra/ Bantam, $24.95.) Robinson is back on Mars, which should be recommendation enough for admirers of his "Red Mars," "Green Mars" and "Blue Mars." This is not a sequel but rather a series of disquieting meditations on "terraforming" and other themes that informed Robinson's landmark trilogy.
PARABLE OF THE TALENTS. By Octavia E. Butler. (Seven Stories, $24.95.) Continuing the story she began in "The Parable of the Sower," Butler finds pathos and hope in the life of a 21st-century prophet who, at great personal cost, preaches that the true test of a religion is whether the solace it offers conforms with the nature of the universe we live in.
STARFISH. By Peter Watts. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95.) Since no one in his right mind would sign on for long-term duty in a fragile metal bubble on the ocean floor, the miles-deep Beebe Station is crewed by certifiable crazies. Watts, a marine biologist by trade, wrings both beauty and pity out of their attempts to triumph over their circumstances and themselves.
THE STONE WAR. By Madeleine E. Robins. (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $23.95.) Hard to read, hard to forget, this disaster novel about a New York City suffering from a reality meltdown is, in the end, a story about love and the price to be paid when we ignore the human disasters in our midst.

The Cigarette

BYLINE: By Bruce McCall; Bruce McCall is the author of "Zany Afternoons."

 BODY:
An amerindian invention (circa a.d. 1400) designed to wreak revenge on genocidal Europeans by addicting them to the inhalation of carcinogenic fumes from a lighted bundle of tobacco leaves. Far and away the most popular form of recreational suicide ever devised, by the late 20th century smoking had become the object of an ethical/medical/legal imbroglio that reached its apogee in 2010, when the precedent set by government bans on smoking was used to forbid fried eggs, going without an overcoat in cold weather, not using sunscreen at the beach and thousands of other human activities alleged to be self-destructive. Narrowly defining the pursuit of happiness, the United States Supreme Court had ruled in Snopes v. Lucky Strike (2007) that happiness by definition excluded any and all activities posing potential dangers to health and safety and awarded Snopes $16 billion in damages. Secretary of Public Safety Ralph Nader (see "The Cromwell of Connecticut," p. 398) interpreted the ruling narrowly and applied it vigorously, ultimately banning the driving of automobiles, aviation, swimming, contact sports and even living in houses -- where statistics showed most fatal accidents occurred -- as risky and thus inimical to the pursuit of happiness. The long-term results were by and large salutary: for example, class-action lawsuits dried up and lawyers vanished overnight and the difficulty of dying spurred such population growth (see "The Safety-Boomer Generation," p. 983) that America's No. 1 export by 2342 was families, leading to the colonization of the moon, Mars and Detroit. The biggest winner of all would, oddly, be France, where the sale of so-called "smoking visas" to visitors from the outside world led to an economy so wealthy that, in 2763, France purchased Germany, ushering in an era of European amity and stability that has obtained to this day.

HEADLINE: CHOICE TABLES;
Sonoma Harvests a Home-Grown Cuisine

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN; MARK BITTMAN writes for the Dining section of The Times.

 BODY:
CALIFORNIA food is being defined at last, and nowhere better than in Sonoma, which is finally escaping from the long shadow of Tuscany.
Though the valley -- about an hour north of the Golden Gate Bridge -- and the surrounding county look a little like central Italy -- as does Napa, Sonoma's more famous neighbor to the east -- and though they are indeed similar in climate and in their wine-based economies, Sonoma is a distinctively American place. A few years ago, menus featured little more than pasta, pizza and grilled vegetables. Maturity demanded that Sonoma strut its own stuff. 
 And now it is doing so: Many restaurants have similar menus and similar atmospheres, pointing to a regional Sonoma style. Better still, many feature the same ingredients on any given day, a sign of fresh produce, meat and fish. When three restaurants within a few blocks of one another have beets on their menu, it isn't just that beets are a hot ingredient -- it's because fresh beets are in the market. And that's when you want to cook and eat them.
Many restaurants offer Liberty duck from the Sonoma Poultry Company in nearby Petaluma, beef raised at the Niman Ranch in Marin County, and local goat cheese, more often than not from the nationally known Laura Chenel Chevre in Sonoma. In addition, ingredients that are considered exotic elsewhere in the country are near-weeds in Sonoma, including figs and pomegranates.
Not everyone is jumping on this Sonoma-style bandwagon: There are still a handful of fusion restaurants, a couple of upscale Asian restaurants (Mariposa, in Windsor, is a good one), a fine Portuguese place (La Salette, on the outskirts of the town of Sonoma), and a Western-style steak house (Macarthur Place, near the center of town).
But I was more interested in the region's own developing style, an informal, loosely defined cuisine that is vaguely Mediterranean. Three of the restaurants I visited are in town, and a fourth is a short drive away.
Like the food, the atmosphere in these places is deceptively informal. Though jeans and T-shirts are more-or-less acceptable nearly everywhere, though the typical greeting might be "How you guys doin'?" and though the best seating area in two of these restaurants is outside, the service in all of them is precise and correct. These places may have a laid-back feel, but the food arrives hot and on time, the wine service is attentive and napkins are cloth -- even when the tablecloths are not.
 
Cafe La Haye
A tiny place just off the square in Sonoma, Cafe La Haye is stark, minimalist and nearly monochromatic: white, black and various shades of gray dominate. This Manhattan feel is countered by large windows and an open front door, both of which bring in light and air. And the food provides color -- lots of color. The produce is local, organic and superb, and almost every dish is determined not as much by what might be called the main ingredient -- the protein -- but by the vegetables, which provide character.
This goes for the nicely done pot roast, overshadowed by the accompanying root vegetables and horseradish mashed potatoes; the gorgeous Liberty duck breast, made all the more so by the turnips and carrots served with it, and even the smoked salmon with potato pancakes and creme fraiche, which was outshone by an apple-horseradish compote.
The dishes based on vegetables -- heirloom tomato salad, or greens with nuts, blue cheese and roasted beets (a classic combination that appears on nearly every menu in town) -- are sure winners. One salad was spiked by hyper-aromatic basil and fragrant olive oil, another was served with a super vinaigrette containing preserved lemons.
In fact, nothing disappointed; the crowded, closet-sized, semi-open kitchen produces shining examples of updated bistro food, and it can keep up the pace nicely because the dining room has only 32 seats.
The wine list is as local as the food, with exotic selections coming from as far away as Napa, and no farther; the by-the-glass selection is superior to most. The excellent sour dough bread comes from the Artisan Bakers, an award-winning operation in town. Service is attentive without being annoying.
Finally, desserts are delicious and nicely presented: intensely dense chocolate pots de creme are served in black cups; Basmati rice pudding -- mine could have been cooked until the rice was fully tender -- is graced with caramel sauce, and the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce was, well, great.
 
The Girl & the Fig
Nearly as small as Cafe La Haye, but with an entirely different atmosphere, the Girl & the Fig in Glen Ellen, 10 minutes north of Sonoma, is colorful and eclectic. The structure is an A-frame, with rough, yellow walls, bright blue rafters and a Mexican tile floor. Chairs don't match, the tablecloth is covered with paper, and the artwork is cheerful rather than thoughtful. The sum total of all of this is country-pleasant, the kind of ambience that makes a city boy dubious.
Never mind: The food is very, very good. The chef, John Toulze, seems determined to use every local vegetable he can get his hands on, and he should -- this is real cooking from the garden. A salad of beets, mixed greens, mint and lavender croutons is tossed with a mild dressing, allowing the herbal flavors to stand out. A more powerful salad features arugula, pancetta, Chenel goat cheese, pecans and grilled figs; a double portion of this would satisfy me as a main course at almost any meal. Creamy celery and parsley soup was underseasoned, a shame.
Here, too, main courses are dominated by their vegetable garnishes. Roast lamb with mustard sauce was good, but better still were its accompanying mashed potatoes, gorgeous haricots verts, grilled zucchini and yellow squash, baby carrots and spinach. Who needs the lamb?
In fact, the other choice my wife, Karen, and I made, grilled polenta with eggplant, mushrooms, zucchini and yellow squash, and a roasted tomato sauce, was probably more in keeping with the spirit of the place. Though the word "vegetarian" isn't mentioned anywhere, and the menu is filled with meat, poultry and fish, a person of that persuasion would be ecstatic here.
Desserts were equally seasonal: Fig crumble was real country food, simple and scrumptious, and creme caramel with pears and pomegranate sauce sophisticated and delicious.
In keeping with the general ambience, service here is a tad on the overfriendly side (this could be an East Coast prejudice), but was perfectly efficient. Though we reserved only two hours before our appointed time and the place was full, we were given a lovely table in a corner.
The wine service is notable. First off, the list contains only wine made from Rhone varietals, mostly from California but with a few holes (very few) filled by wines from France. Second, they are listed by varietal grape -- viognier, marsanne, grenache, syrah and so on. And third, there are several tasting flights, all of which are interesting. You might get three viogniers, for example ($10), or a flight of red varietals: one each of grenache, cinsault, carignane, mourvedre and syrah ($14).
 
Heirloom
Almost precisely in the center of town, Heirloom is impossible to miss if you stroll in Sonoma -- the restaurant is part of the 16-room Sonoma Hotel. The reception area and dining room are lovely and appear to be a tasteful Western saloon, formally done, with loads of Mission-style oak, wainscoting and heavy chandeliers.
But the patio is really the place to be, perfectly pleasant, with an attractive arts-and-crafts feel: mostly marble tables (some are wood), heavy wrought-metal chairs, a small fireplace and tiles on the ground.
In fact, it is all so casual that it's easy to assume that service will be shoddy and slow and the food uninteresting -- so the fact that none of this is the case makes it doubly delightful. There's a fig tree at one end. It's quiet. And lunch here can seem like a short vacation.
Once again, look for the vegetables. Rabbit rillettes were underseasoned, though aided mightily by the super-crispy, not-too-sour baguette. But the rillettes were served with a light, mustard-laced stew of beets, spinach, turnips and carrots, all young, tender and flavorful. Light and delicious dumplings -- actually gnocchi -- were made with good potatoes and served in a meaty mushroom broth with fresh wild mushrooms and chives.
A few slices of grilled Niman Ranch flank steak were, as expected, perfect, served with nothing more than a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar and a wonderful side dish of spaghetti squash and fennel. The portion, I thought, was a little stingy. (Had I been able to return for dinner, I would have ordered a Niman pork chop, grilled and served with Savoy cabbage with ham hock ragout.)
The crust of a flatbread -- most of us would call this pizza -- was undercooked, but generously topped with tender duck confit, splendid caramelized onions and Maytag blue cheese, all garnished with crisp watercress.
Two desserts were notable: Pear and huckleberry crisp with ginger ice cream sparkled with flavor, and lemon verbena creme brulee was dreamy. The bittersweet chocolate pots de creme, evidently a local standard, were near-perfect.
Heirloom's wine list is more catholic and less distinctive than those of the Girl & the Fig and Cafe La Haye, but the selection is good and the prices are in line with theirs. 
 
Deuce
Most people drive into Sonoma from the south -- that is, from San Francisco -- which brings them right past Deuce, a huge yellow farmhouse with a dark green porch on Broadway (Highway 12), the road into town.
As at Heirloom, the dining room is quiet, formal-looking (though some diners wear shorts or work on laptops) and oak-laden. But, in another similarity, the patio is the place to eat as long as the weather is good. It's shady, private, quiet, with the feel of a garden, with gas heaters and comfortable chairs. There are cloth napkins but no tablecloths; otherwise, the table settings are better than adequate.
A spinach salad with bacon, caramelized onions, manchego (a Spanish sheep milk cheese), candied walnuts and a light cider vinaigrette worked nicely, as did a salad of four kinds of roasted baby beets with frisee, feta, candied walnuts and grapefruit dressed with a champagne vinaigrette. A third salad, warm Chenel goat cheese on arugula with roasted garlic, is also a good choice.
Main courses are generous and good, though unlike the other places, the vegetables do not quite steal the show. Of course, it would take quite the vegetable to steal the show from a thick, perfectly grilled (medium-rare, as requested) slab of liver, accompanied by garlicky mashed potatoes and beautiful sugar snap peas with butter.
The least local dish I sampled all week, grilled salmon with leek confit, crisp potatoes and red wine butter, was perfectly done. Pasta with nice, small clams featured four kinds of delicious tomatoes -- red, orange, green and yellow.
Someone had recommended that we sample the lemon pots de creme here, and they were tart, sweet and mysteriously rich. I guessed this was the result of ultra-heavy cream, but I've been told that the secret ingredient is duck eggs. Apple-pear cobbler was simple and perfectly seasonal.
The award-winning wine list is a gem, and as far as I could tell, features mostly Sonoma wines. The majority of the selections weigh in at under $30, which is unusual and enticing. Some of these are established wines selling for considerably less than they do elsewhere.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Hotels Mobbed, But a Bit Less So

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL; EDWIN McDOWELL, a business reporter for The Times, covers the travel industry.

 BODY:
IF you've tried to book a hotel room in a major American city lately, you may have trouble believing this. The latest figures from the hotel industry, covering the first nine months of this year, show that occupancy rates are still in decline, continuing a trend that began in 1997. In fact, occupancy through September 1999 was down from the same period last year in 17 of the nation's 25 biggest markets, according to Smith Travel Research, the scorekeeper for the United States hotel industry. And industry analysts project falling occupancy for each of the next two years.
But don't be lulled into thinking that it is now easier to book the room of your choice at the last minute, or that room rates will plummet to reflect lower demand. The nine-month occupancy rate, 65.2 percent, is still slightly above the 25-year industry average of 65 percent. And unless you are willing to stay in the boondocks or at the Hotel Last Resort, city-center hotels, luxury and full service hotels may be as tough as ever to get into, while room rates, which have averaged $81.06 so far in 1999, are likely to continue rising. 
 To understand why, consider this: while occupancy rates have slipped this year in New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Miami-Hialeah, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, occupancy in all those markets remains in the 70-percent range.
Furthermore, the slippage in those cities has ranged from less than 2 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul (1.7 percent, to be exact) to a minuscule 0.1 percent in Philadelphia. And in most of those cities, rooms that are centrally situated or in trendy outlying neighborhoods are still scarce unless booked well in advance. (There is another possibility for reserving a desirable hotel on short notice, but you'll have to read on to learn how.)
In fact, occupancy rates have been virtually flat in the most expensive markets -- those with average room rates over $100 a night -- so the pattern is much the same as in each of the past several years. For example, occupancy is down only 0.6 percent in New York, where the average room rate is a whopping $178.60; 0.4 percent in San Francisco ($135.01 a room); 1.0 percent in Boston ($131.36), 0.4 percent in New Orleans ($113.94), 1.0 percent in Chicago ($109.51), 1.6 percent on Oahu ($107.54), 0.9 percent in Miami-Hialeah ($107.40) and 0.5 percent in San Diego ($103.23). So far this year, only Washington has had room rates averaging above $100 ($108.90) as well as increased occupancy (up 1.5 percent).
 
More Rooms, Higher Rates
Largely because of a glut of new hotels, after seven consecutive years of good financial news for the industry, even hotels in cities with big drops in occupancy this year have raised room rates modestly. These include Houston (a drop of 5.4 percent), Dallas (down 5.3 percent) Seattle (5.3) and Orlando (3.4). A notable exception is Denver, where occupancy has fallen 3.8 percent this year, to 69 percent, but where room rates have also declined a smidgen, to $78.68 from $78.80.
By contrast, in only 2 of the top 25 markets have room rates dropped at least 0.5 percent this year: Phoenix, where rates dropped 1.6 percent, to $98.35, and occupancy fell 4.1 percent, to 62.9; and Oahu, where despite a slight rise in occupancy, room rates fell 4.1 percent, to $107.54. While Phoenix was affected by a 10.3 percent increase in available rooms, Oahu's prices were driven down largely by the perception that too many of its hotels are overpriced and in need of refurbishment.
The industry expects a boost in occupancy and room rates in the fourth quarter, a period that includes multitudes in search of fall foliage, the Thanksgiving holiday, legions of fans following college and professional football teams, as well as the runup to Christmas and New Year.
In fact, room rates nationwide have risen each year since 1995, when the average was $66.11, to $81.06 through this September, and according to a forecast two months ago by PricewaterhouseCoopers, rates will rise to $84.15 next year and to $87.25 in 2001.
But even hotels in cities outside the top 25 markets -- including Cleveland, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Providence, R.I. -- are having banner years. A recent survey by PKF Consulting in San Francisco turned up occupancy rates above 70 percent this year in Austin, Tex.; Baton Rouge, La.; Nashville; Boise, Idaho; Colorado Springs; Portland, Ore.; Santa Fe, N.M., and Sacramento. Salt Lake City's occupancy is 71 percent for this year so far, 4.1 percent less than the 74 percent over the same period last year.
 
A Room in Brooklyn
One of the more interesting occupancy rates is at a single hotel, the New York Marriott Brooklyn. When it opened in July 1997, it was the first new hotel in Brooklyn in almost 70 years, and the hotel, which has 376 rooms, had an occupancy rate of almost 83 percent during the first six months of this year. Marriott expects it to hit 85 percent by year-end, driven by the high holiday demand in New York and the fact that it is the only notable hotel in the borough.
This year's overall occupancy rate of 65.2 percent is all the more significant (especially to hotel owners) in view of the PricewaterhouseCoopers finding that United States hotels had achieved a record low break-even occupancy rate, the rate at which expenses and revenues are equal. From a 62.6 break-even rate in 1992, it is now down to 55.5 percent. That lower rate, according to Bjorn Hanson, chairman of the lodging and gaming group of PricewaterhouseCoopers, is attributable to the rising room rates, lower debt and equity costs for the industry, and more emphasis on revenue from rooms than from low-margin food and beverage operations.
Many travelers are likely to be surprised to hear "low margin" used to describe hotel food and beverage, especially in view of the trend even in upscale restaurants toward breakfast and lunch buffets, which require far less labor than traditional menus. And anyone who has eaten in luxury hotel restaurants, or ordered room service, is almost sure to regard "low margin" with suspicion.
Nevertheless, Mr. Hanson said that at the same time that top chefs with celebrity status are in greater demand than ever at luxury hotels, the food and beverage share of overall hotel revenue has fallen from as much as 50 percent in 1960 to about 20 percent today. And after subtracting the cost of credit card commissions, insurance, energy, marketing and other expenses, he said, "food and beverage operations usually result in a financial loss for hotels."
Stanley Turkel, a hotel consultant in New York, also said that hotels lose money on food and beverages, except for banquets. "Even Las Vegas, where they used to practically give rooms and food away, is now trying to make food and beverage profitable," he said. (Las Vegas, the No. 1 hotel market in the United States, is not included in Smith Travel Research reports because of its unique attractions and reliance on gambling, but its 120,444 rooms, the most of any city, have averaged a torrid 89.2 percent occupancy so far this year.)
The rise of the Internet is having a growing impact on hotel bookings, especially in enabling potential guests and travel agents to view guest rooms, lobbies and hotel exteriors. Hotel Reservations Network, a Dallas-based consolidator that sells discount rooms in 38 cities worldwide, said that it derived more than 85 percent of its revenues from the 1.2 million room nights a year that it books on the Web, and Priceline.com and some other Web discounters are sprouting up.
Internet bookings are poised to soar -- to some $3.1 billion in revenues by the year 2002 from less than $100 million in 1997, according to a forecast by Bear, Stearns & Company. "The introduction of toll-free telephone service in the 1960's was the last great technology innovation to greatly affect the economics of hotel booking, and that's nothing compared with the mighty punch of the Internet," said Jason Ader, who heads the Bear, Stearns hotel, gaming and leisure research group.
Still, so far the Internet has had little overall impact on room rates or availability.
Finally, about booking a hotel room on short notice: the surest way is to plan your stay for Sunday night, because it is the slowest day of the week. Try for an upscale chain hotel, the segment with the biggest falloff in occupancy on Sunday, according to Smith Travel Research. The drawback is that you will probably have to vacate your room the next morning; but you might get a break on the price, which gives a thrifty traveler a chance to enjoy a different lodging experience.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Spanish Movies Mine a Rich Vein

BYLINE: By VALERIE GLADSTONE; Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about the radio station WNYC.

 BODY:
UNTIL Pedro Almodovar's first zany comedy "Pepi, Luci, Bom . . ." in 1980, Spanish films rarely caused a stir. Then came his hit "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" in 1988. His latest, "All About My Mother," which opened here last month and in Europe six months ago, is topping his previous box-office records. But Mr. Almodovar is just one of many Spanish directors who are making waves.
At the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Richard Pena, the program director, began tracking the Spanish film revival in 1992 when he inaugurated the first Spanish film festival in New York. "When we began, it was at a low point," Mr. Pena said recently. "Now it's become one of the strongest in Europe. Along with Iran, Spain makes the most interesting films today." 
 Beginning Friday, 18 independent films, most of them American premieres, will be presented through Dec. 24 at the Walter Reade Theater by the Film Society, in collaboration with the Instituto Cervantes, which supports Spanish culture abroad, the Spanish Society of Authors and Publishers, and the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture.
 The featured director, the 54-year-old Ventura Pons, will be represented by six films, among them the probing drama "Beloved/Friend" ("Amic/Amat"), a prize winner at the recent Berlin Film Festival, and his first film, "Ocana, Intermittent Portrait" (1978), a documentary about a famous Barcelona transvestite. Made in his native Catalan language, these films are among several from three distinctive regions of Spain -- Catalonia, Andalusia and the Basque country. Regional film production is another growing trend in the industry. The festival also brings back Ivan Zulueta's 1979 cult classic "Rapture" ("Arrebato"), an off-beat vampire tale.
"The series should give a real snapshot of Spanish cinema," said Mr. Pena, adding that every year a few more films from the festival are picked up for commercial distribution. Samuel Goldwyn Films has already acquired Benito Zambrano's "Alone" ("Solas"), to be shown in the United States next year.
Hard-hitting, sophisticated and beautifully acted, the entries cover the spectrum from Manuel Cusso-Ferrer's fantasy love story "Babaouo," based on a 1932 scenario by Salvador Dali, to the near-pornographic "Between Your Legs" ("Entre las Piernas") by Manuel Gomez Pereira, a director in the flashy, stylized manner of Mr. Almodovar. The generational span is also broad. The eminent 67-year-old Carlos Saura, renowned for his flamenco trilogy, "Blood Wedding" (1981), "Carmen" (1983) and "A Love Bewitched" (1986), and the recent "Flamenco" (1995), contributes "Goya in Bordeaux," an eloquent homage to his favorite painter, and the 32-year-old actress and director Iciar Bollain offers "Flowers From Another World" ("Flores de Otro Mundo"), a comedy concerning mail order brides in an isolated Spanish village.
"OUR filmmakers have moved away from the great transcendental themes of Bunuel," said Maria Lozano, director of Instituto Cervantes in New York, referring to Luis Bunuel, one of the century's great directors, perhaps best known for "The Andalusian Dog" (1928) and "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" (1972). "And they no longer treat love and death in grandiose terms. By treating everyday realities, they connect better with young audiences. Whether for good or bad, we've become more European." It has been a long journey.
During Francisco Franco's dictatorship, from 1937 until his death in 1975, many of the subjects Spanish directors deal with now -- homosexuality, racism, marital abuse and drug addiction -- were forbidden. Moviegoers had to be satisfied with corny folklore musicals or films that glorified Spain, although by the 1950's a few directors had begun to successfully challenge the ultra-conservative status quo.
Bunuel, who died in 1983, retained his artistic integrity by working in France and Mexico, while Mr. Saura, among others, adopted an allegorical and metaphorical style to mask his themes, notably in "The Chase" (1965). Once freed of constraints, Spanish directors often dedicated themselves to reconstructing the past, trying to depict their history more authentically. So great was the need to resurrect the "true" Spain that 300 historical films were released between 1976 and 1982, more than half of all Spanish films made during that period. Mr. Saura challenged the idea of whether we could ever even know what is historically true in "Blindfolded" (1978).
Filmmakers born toward the end of the Franco era and afterward did not share their elders' preoccupation with the past. Enamored of Hollywood films, they adopted the American thriller, the film noir and screwball comedy as models and made them their own. The continuing transformation of their cinema was also fueled by economic exigencies. In 1994, the government changed its policy of granting subsidies to projects it deemed of artistic merit to one retroactively dependent on a film's success in the market place. Now directors don't receive government money unless their films attract an audience of about 70,000, a moderate number in Spain. As a result, the industry reached its production nadir in 1995.
ENTER the savior: television. Today, 80 percent of Spanish film production relies on co-financing arrangements with public and private television stations, with the remaining 20 percent still provided by government and private subsidies. But the stations, too, expect the films they finance to have popular appeal, since a television broadcast is part of the deal. In this new atmosphere, the industry is thriving. In 1998, Spain produced 96 features, up from only 44 in 1994. What's more, audiences have doubled, foreign distribution is up and, increasingly, young Spaniards are choosing to become filmmakers. In 1995, the National Film School reopened after being closed for 25 years.
Spain's film industry still lags behind its European counterparts in production but not, crucially, in energy and creativity.
Mr. Saura's passion for his trade has weathered the vicissitudes of his country's film history. In fact, he first began thinking about making his new film "Goya in Bordeaux" at the start of his career in the 50's. "Long ago, Goya inspired me with his statement, 'I don't see lines and colors, only shadows,' " Mr. Saura said. "I wanted to create his atmosphere in film. There's something strange and mysterious that unites the greatest Spanish artists -- Goya, Picasso, Bunuel. They all had enormous ego, strength, passion and sensitivity. My next film will be about Bunuel."
Two themes run through most contemporary Spanish films -- personal responsibility and the difficulty of establishing honest relationships. They are at the heart of Mr. Pons's "Beloved/Friend," which documents the final days of a dying professor who wants to leave his best friend a self-revealing essay. Frustrated in his attempt, he finds that a young, sadistic, gay hustler may be his only avenue to immortality. "I show the struggle between generations and how each grasps for its future," said Mr. Pons.
Ms. Bollain and Antonio Hernandez, director of the thriller "Lisbon," approach the same themes very differently. In her poignant "Flowers From Another World," three lively women from Cuba, the Dominican Republic and the Spanish city of Bilboa seek mates among the bachelors of a provincial town. A love story, it also addresses Spain's persistent racism. Mr. Hernandez, a filmmaker for 20 years, pairs an embittered woman and a cowardly salesman in a search for her husband's killer. While a major studio asked Mr. Hernandez to rewrite the story in English and direct it for American distribution, he declined. "Why repeat myself?" he said with a laugh.
Would he have been able to keep the original's inconclusive ending? "Oh, no," he said. "That's another reason why I can't do it. They wanted everything to work out fine."

A Golden Bounty Reclaimed From the Ocean Floor

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
A GOLD-RUSH treasure, burnished by 130 years in the icy depths of the Atlantic, has finally reached its destination -- New York. Mined, sifted, assayed or minted in California, the three tons of gold bars, ingots, coins and dust was shipped on Aug. 20, 1857 from San Francisco bound for New York, but not even a small portion of it ever made it until a year ago.
The cargo that many people envisioned would stop a monthlong run on New York banks was taken by the S.S. Sinora to Panama and transferred by rail to the paddle steamer Central America. After a stop in Havana, the boat steamed north, and into the path of a hurricane. It went down in the storm 160 miles off the coast of Cape Fear, N.C., in one of the greatest peacetime marine disasters in American history. 
 The shipwreck took the lives of 425 passengers, officers and crew -- two-thirds of those on board. And the loss of the bullion -- valued at $1.2 million, or about one-fifth the gold then in Wall Street banks -- compounded the financial crisis that had dangerously lowered gold reserves in New York banks, spurring the Panic of 1857. Then, though insurers made swift payments to the gold's owners, the recession deepened: 980 businesses failed in New York and 1,400 banks closed nationwide.
Now, a decade after the treasure was salvaged and a year after the battles over its ownership ended in the Federal District Court in Norfolk, Va., there are once again powerful expectations for at least a fraction of the gold. The American and British insurers or their successors were awarded nearly 400 pounds, about eight percent of the total. The rest of the gold went to the salvagers, the Columbus America Discovery Group of Ohio, which was founded by the engineer-explorer Tommy Thompson. From 1986 to 1989, Mr. Thompson and his crew, using a robot vehicle to scour the wreckage and vacuum the ocean floor, wrested gold and artifacts from the rotting timbers and rusted iron ribs of the Central America. Mr. Thompson has not yet disclosed what he intends to do with his much larger hoard.
The insurers' gold, which arrived in New York at Sotheby's a year ago, will be sold first in a live auction and then hours later on the Internet. In the past, Internet sales have come a week or more after the live ones. The total expected for the treasure, now on view on the Internet (sothebys.amazon.com), could reach $10 million.
The more valuable pieces will be auctioned live in 250 lots, to sell for $1,000 to $350,000 each, on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday evening the sale moves to the Web site, which is operated jointly by Sotheby's and Amazon. There, 1,000 lots of gold -- nuggets, 40 pounds of dust and one bar -- will be offered over two weeks. The estimates range from $100 to $1,000 for each of the nuggets and vials of dust; the hefty gold bar, weighing 374 ounces, may sell for from $125,000 to $175,000. All told, the sale may bring as much as $700,000.
"There are very few pieces of gold out there with a provable provenance from the gold rush," said David E. Tripp, a Sotheby's coin consultant in charge of the sale. "The gold has an allure, over and above its intrinsic value. This is fairy dust from the bottom of the ocean -- far better than a snapshot of an important moment in history."
Gold sold for roughly $20 an ounce when the Central America went down; today it's worth is about 15 times that, or $300 an ounce. But historical gold is so valued by coin collectors and history buffs that it commands much higher figures depending on its fineness, story and look. The gold bars, produced by five different assayers, bear stamped markings ranging from crude to fine, and some pieces are gloriously colored, from blood red to iron brown, patinas left by the ship's rusting ribs.
The tiniest ingot in the sale, a five-ounce piece stamped Blake & Co., looks good enough to eat, like a foil-wrapped chocolate. It is estimated to sell for $30,000 to $50,000. A brick-like bar, by Kellogg & Humbert at 663 ounces, the largest in the sale, may bring as much as $275,000. But the bar, by Justh & Hunter, with the highest valuation -- $350,000 -- weighs 652 ounces.
Miraculously, the gold had remained intact after the Central America sank, and much of it was together on the ocean floor. The bars, once boxed, had toppled like dominos, and many coins were found still stacked. But the gold dust, which looks like Grape Nuts and was probably carried aboard in sacks or pouches that men wore around their waists, was widely strewn about the site.
TO David Redden, an executive vice president at Sotheby's who oversees books, collectibles and Internet sales, it is the gold dust that inspires the mystique about gold and greed. "The gold dust, panned in the mountain streams of Northern California, was brought to town in the pockets of the miners," he said.
But even the greed of those who knew that gold fetched a higher price in New York dissolved when lives were at stake. "The people who went down on that ship would have discarded anything weighty -- the coins, nuggets and even the gold dust -- as they were swimming for the doors and an escape."
"The gold dust is an extraordinary human story," he said, "that takes us from the top of the Sierra Madre to the bottom of the Atlantic."

HEADLINE: FILM;
The Labor Pains Of a Leftist Musical In an Angry Era

BYLINE: By DAVID SCHIFF; David Schiff is a composer on the faculty of Reed College in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
FOR the thousands who cheered it in the late 1930's, Marc Blitzstein's musical play "The Cradle Will Rock" blazed like a comet of hope in the dark Depression skies. The millennium was far away, but Armageddon was now. Germany was rearming, Mussolini had seized Ethiopia, and the Spanish Civil War seemed like a dress rehearsal for a final confrontation between Left and Right. The American economy was again on the slide, and labor strife across the country was taken as the beginnings of class warfare.
A series of razor-sharp satirical songs, "The Cradle Will Rock" presented these conflicts as a battle between the good of unionized labor and the corruption of everyone else. It opened on June 16, 1937, under circumstances so dramatic that Orson Welles, who had directed the production, later wrote a screenplay about the show's creation. But it was never filmed; and as times changed, "The Cradle" disappeared into the recesses of cultural outer space. 
 Tim Robbins, who has taken on politically charged subjects in his previous films "Dead Man Walking" and "Bob Roberts," brings Blitzstein's show back to life in his new movie, "Cradle Will Rock," opening on Friday. Not simply a cinematic rendering of Blitzstein's play, or the story of its premiere, the film is a panoramic view of New York in the Depression years, filled with such historical characters as Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, William Randolph Hearst, Margherita Sarfatti (Mussolini's former mistress who wrote pro-Fascist stories for Hearst) and the young Orson Welles, a fireball of theatrical energy. Mixing fact and fiction and blending the directorial styles of Welles and Preston Sturges, Mr. Robbins surrounds the story of the show's birth with a web of plot lines about artists and patrons and timeless questions of opportunism, compromise and integrity -- and just putting on a show.
Though his music is rarely performed today, Marc Blitzstein revolutionized American musical theater, and not just politically. Critics and composers have recognized that he created a new idiom, distinct from the Broadway musical and European opera. His style sprang from popular music yet kept a sharp edge of satire and psychological insight. In "The Cradle," he leans heavily on the manner of Kurt Weill (who referred to it, somewhat bitterly, as "my latest show"), but later he developed a lyrical, jazzy melodic style of his own. His influence has permeated the genre for the last 60 years, especially in the works of Leonard Bernstein.
In the film, Blitzstein, played by Hank Azaria, composes "The Cradle" as a man possessed. "I read that he worked in a state of white-hot inspiration," Mr. Robbins says, "and that gave me the image of Blitzstein's character." Indeed, driven by the political ideas of his wife, Eva Goldbeck, who died of anorexia in May 1936, and of Bertolt Brecht, Blitzstein wrote the words and music for "The Cradle" in just five weeks. A political soul-mate to the homosexual Blitzstein, Goldbeck had introduced the composer to Brecht's writings, and to Brecht. Before her death, the composer had played Brecht his song "Nickel Under the Foot" -- which tells of a woman forced by poverty into prostitution. According to Blitzstein's biographer, Eric Gordon, Brecht said, "Why don't you write a piece about all kinds of prostitution -- the press, the church, courts, the arts, the whole system?" Despondent after his wife's death, Blitzstein recalled Brecht's advice and feverishly set to work.
Beginning with "I'm Checking Home Now," sung by the Moll, a hungry prostitute, "The Cradle" goes on to skewer the hypocrisy of the Establishment of Steeltown U.S.A., which dances to the tune called by Mr. Mister, owner of the steel mill, and his overstuffed family. The preacher advocates peace or war depending on the price of steel, a journalist defends his antiunion distortions as "freedom of the press," a painter and violinist describe their dependence on Mrs. Mister's patronage as "art for art's sake," a doctor falsifies medical records to help the police, and a college president fires pacifists who will not endorse R.O.T.C. The two younger Misters fill their empty lives with marshmallow pop tunes. The only incorruptible character is Larry Foreman, a middle-class union supporter who rejects Mister's attempt at bribery and predicts the downfall of the social order and the coming triumph of unionism with the fiery anthem "The Cradle Will Rock."
Orson Welles and John Houseman, who had already directed and produced three shows for the Federal Theater Project, including an all-black "Macbeth" in Harlem, brought Blitzstein's musical to Hallie Flanagan, the project's head. She decided to present "The Cradle" even though she was under attack in Congress for promoting left-wing ideas. Citing Blitzstein's show as proof that the Federal Theater Project was fomenting revolution, Congress cut its funds by 30 percent. In the film, as in the actual hearings, congressmen brand Euripides and Christopher Marlowe as Communists.
THE day after the public dress rehearsal (with full orchestra and an elaborate set), the Works Progress Administration, the financing umbrella for the Theater Project, canceled "The Cradle" for lack of funds and padlocked the theater. Houseman quickly found an empty theater, the Venice, 20 blocks away. Word got out that the premiere would be moved, and the cast and an audience packed with union members -- Virgil Thomson wrote that the leftwing audience was "the most formidable army of ticket buyers in the world" -- walked uptown. One obstacle remained. Actors Equity and the Musicians Union would not let their members perform at the Venice.
Houseman and Welles explained the problem to the audience, and Blitzstein came out on a bare stage to narrate and sing his work at the piano. But as he began the Moll's song, Olive Stanton rose from the audience to play her role, soon followed by the rest of the cast, who were all seated in the theater and were risking their jobs with the Federal Theater by taking part. Art seemed to spring miraculously from life, and the evening ended with jubilation.
"I was less interested in the show," Mr. Robbins says, "than in the impact it had on people's lives, and the way it helped them understand the world around them." He centers his film on two of the actors in the show, the actual Olive Stanton, played by Emily Watson, and the fictional Aldo Silvano (John Turturro), an Italian-American anti-Fascist. Stanton, a homeless woman who had never been on stage before, found a job as a stagehand with the Federal Theater Project, then took possession of the role of the Moll as if it were her birthright.
Mr. Robbins says he invented fictions to connect facts: "Where there was an A and a C, I created a B." During rehearsals for "The Cradle," the film's Silvano, a struggling young actor, breaks with his parents because of their support of Mussolini. At the actual premiere, an audience member tore down the Italian Fascist flag hanging in the Venice Theater. Mr. Robbins gives that defining act to Silvano, who adds his own political passion to Larry Foreman's electrifying pro-union tirade. Performing in "The Cradle" despite the economic disaster sure to follow, Stanton and Silvano fuse their theatrical and political vocations.
Apiano on a bare stage and a cast emerging from the audience have become essential to performances of "The Cradle," even though Blitzstein had never imagined it that way. (For the film, David Robbins, the director's brother, has rescored the music for a klezmerish quintet.) Both Welles and Houseman later claimed that they had instructed the cast to create the illusion of a spontaneous performance. The movie script originally had Welles eloquently instructing the cast on how to make their entrances; but when he learned that members of the cast had recalled acting on their own, Mr. Robbins rewrote the scene as a spontaneous show of political courage.
As counterpoint to these stories of integrity, there are two subplots about treachery and self-betrayal: the story of the destruction of Diego Rivera's Rockefeller Center murals (which actually took place in 1934) and an account of the decline and fall of a fictional ventriloquist employed by the Theater Project. The young Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) commissioned Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural for the centerpiece of his family's contribution to the Manhattan skyline, after Picasso and Matisse had turned him down. When Rivera refused to remove the face of Lenin from the mural, "Man at the Crossroads," Rockefeller canceled the commission, paid Rivera handsomely and had the murals jack-hammered off the walls. The film shows Rockefeller announcing that from then on he would promote only nonpolitical art -- abstractions and nudes. It's a sly joke at the expense of the Museum of Modern Art, which was built with Rockefeller money and which still promotes an apolitical view of modernism as a series of aesthetic innovations.
Despite his credentials as a political filmmaker, Mr. Robbins has tried to balance political and nonpolitical characters in the film. "Welles didn't buy into the absolutism of politics," Mr. Robbins says. "He embraced celebrity and bacchanalia, arriving at the theater in an ambulance after partying all night in Harlem." The ventriloquist, played by Bill Murray, also seems to be non-political at first. But when he sides with the enemies of the Theater Project, his dummy turns on him, denounces his hypocrisy and dies. Mr. Robbins crosscuts the post-performance celebration for "The Cradle" with the dummy's funeral march. This slice of magic realism springs from fact. One of the Theater Projects's most successful productions was "Pinocchio." When Congress shut down the program in 1939, the cast placed the puppet in a coffin and marched up Broadway.
Blitzstein's musical play received accolades from critics spanning the political spectrum -- from The Daily Worker to Walter Winchell. The entire score was recorded -- the first original cast album of a Broadway musical (available now on a Pearl CD). Welles and Houseman went on to produce "The Cradle" on their own, touring steel towns and then returning to New York in January 1938 for a 13-week run. Productions popped up across the country, including one at Harvard, produced, directed and performed at the piano by the 20-year-old Leonard Bernstein.
Despite the avid support of Bernstein and Aaron Copland, Blitzstein became a neglected figure in the history of American music, remembered mainly as the translator of Brecht's "Three Penny Opera." His 1949 opera "Regina," based on Lillian Hellman's "Little Foxes," was praised after its premiere as "the most exciting music theater since 'Rosenkavalier.' " But it has yet to claim a place in the repertory. Blitzstein, who was murdered in 1964 at age 58 by three sailors he had met in a bar in Martinique, left three theater pieces incomplete, including an opera about Sacco and Vanzetti he was writing for the Metropolitan.
Blitzstein's work was always politically charged and far to the left, though the caricatures in "The Cradle" will not alarm anyone familiar with "The Simpsons." In both the "The Cradle" and Blitzstein's next musical play, "No for an Answer," he integrated dialogue and singing as no American had done before: the music continues the dramatic action so effectively that the audience barely notices the transitions from speech to song.
Blitzstein's shows may have languished and his hard line proved unpersuasive, but without "The Cradle Will Rock" there would have been no "On the Town," "Trouble in Tahiti," "Wonderful Town," "Candide" or "West Side Story." Indeed, two songs from "West Side Story" -- "Officer Krupke" and "A Boy Like That" -- are pure Blitzstein; "America" is Blitzstein plus Copland; and Bernstein even lifted the melody of "Maria" from "Regina." You can hear Blitzstein in Jud Fry's song, "Lonely Room," from "Oklahoma!" And Blitzstein's mordant, sleazy melodies are the models for "Cabaret" and "Sweeney Todd."
Free of the necessity (or even possibility) of producing hit tunes, and once again drawn to themes of social unrest, today's generation of music theater composers will find Blitzstein's work more relevant than ever -- even in the "miracle" economy of the late 90's. And so, Mr. Robbins hopes, will the movie audience. "They are still censoring art today," he says. "And there are still individuals who exercise their freedom of expression, and pay the price."

A Glitch Adds 250 Copies

 BODY:
Due to a perhaps fortunate glitch, a usually hard-to-get compendium of research on regulated rents, the city's economy and the housing market published by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board is a lot easier to come by this year -- and, for some buyers, cheaper.
"We printed 400 copies," said Anita Visser, the board's executive director, "but there was a slight glitch in the printing process -- a few pages in 250 of those 400 are a bit faded." 
 "But it's totally readable," Ms. Visser insisted.
And, she said, because "the printer kindly reprinted those 250" the board -- which annually sets rent-adjustment rates for the city's 1 million regulated apartments -- now has 650 copies of "Housing NYC: Rents, Markets and Trends '99."
The report includes research on regulated rents, owner revenues and costs, mortgages for multifamily buildings, tenant demographics, housing supply, wage rates by industry and unemployment. "Some of the tables go back as far as 1960," Ms. Visser said.
The "price for the perfect one," she said, is $23 plus tax, "but if someone wants a slightly irregular copy we'll sell them at $18."
Copies can be purchased at the Citystore, in the lobby of the Municipal Building at 1 Centre Street, or by calling (212) 669-8247.

Luxury Complexes Find Room at the Top

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
WHEN Jackie Cottrell's husband, Karl, a research engineer, was transferred two months ago from Rhode Island to Tarrytown, the couple didn't feel ready to purchase in Westchester. They decided to rent instead for a couple of years, see how the job worked out and how they liked the area.
"We're not ready to buy anything," Ms. Cottrell said. "Right now we're happy renting and are still trying to figure out the area and decide what to do next." The Cottrells now live in a one-bedroom apartment with a loft at Avalon Willow, a 144-unit luxury rental development in Mamaroneck. 
 Avalon Willow is representative of the kind of rentals now being built in the county. Started in 1998, it targets high-end customers who want amenities, such as a concierge desk, fitness center, and sometimes, if space permits, a pool. Rents for one-bedroom apartments range from $1,597 to $1,960 and $2,387 to $2,891 for two-bedroom units.
An additional 75 units are now in the final stages of construction at Avalon Willow. "We expect them to be ready for market by the spring or summer of next year," said Fred Harris, a vice president of development for Avalon Bay Communities, a real estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va.
Avalon is by far the most active builder of rentals in Westchester, with three communities now operating in the county, and a fourth just starting construction in New Rochelle. "We're actively looking for more sites in southern Westchester now," Mr. Harris said. "We'd definitely be building more if the land were available."
Another developer, RFR/Davis, which has put up several residential buildings in Manhattan in recent years, is building an 88-unit luxury rental development called Rivervue near the Tuckahoe train station. Rents have not yet been set, said Trevor Davis, a principal of the development company.
Had the Cottrells been looking a few years ago, they would have found the rental market in Westchester practically nonexistent. "With the conversion of most of the apartment buildings into condominiums and co-ops during the 1980's, it left the rental market in negative production, especially at the upper end," said Mr. Harris. "And the kind of product we're offering just didn't exist."
The situation created a pent-up demand, according to Mr. Harris. "All of our projects have leased up quickly," he said, noting that most are near train stations for ease in commuting to midtown Manhattan as well as to White Plains or Stamford, Conn.
Last summer, in partnership with Collins Enterprises of Old Greenwich, Conn., Avalon Bay completed the Avalon, a 110-unit project in Bronxville directly across the street from the Metro-North train station. It is now fully leased, Mr. Harris said.
Rents range from $2,100 for a one-bedroom apartment to $5,000 for a three-bedroom duplex. Residents sign 15-month leases, Mr. Harris said. "Typically at the expiration of the lease, there are rent increases, based on what's happening in the market," he said. "Generally they keep pace with inflation, at around 3 to 4 percent."
FIFTY-NINE percent of Avalon residents in Bronxville commute to Manhattan, compared with 39 percent of Avalon Willow residents in Mamaroneck, according to Tracey Appelbaum, a senior development director for Avalon Bay Communities. Both projects are within walking distance to the Metro-North train stations.
"In Bronxville, around 12 percent of our residents are retirees," Ms. Appelbaum said. "That's higher than in many of our other projects. In Mamaroneck, there aren't as many retirees and more first-time Westchester residents, like the Cottrells."
Six months ago, Anita Judice and her husband, Peter, sold a house in Larchmont, "sort of on the spur of the moment," Ms. Judice said. "It just worked out that we had an opportunity to sell quickly and needed a transition," Ms. Judice said. The couple, with grown children in the area, decided to rent a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment at Avalon Willow.
They lived there for five months and have since moved, but still rent an apartment, in a prewar building in Larchmont. "We wanted to stay in the Village of Larchmont," Ms. Judice said. "But we're continuing to rent because we don't want to take care of anything after owning a house for so long. I guess we'll be renting until we get it out of our systems."
As for first-time householders, many choose rentals because, while they can afford higher-than-average rents, they don't have the money for a down payment on a house. "The down payments for houses can be prohibitive for a lot of people, even those making a good income," said Sharon Hart, an executive vice president for Summit Property Management of Valhalla, which operates two rental projects, Talleyrand Crescent in Tarrytown and Ridgeview in Elmsford.
THE majority of renters at Avalon's projects come from the local area, according to Ms. Appelbaum. In Bronxville, for instance, 17 percent come from within the Village of Bronxville, 30 percent from elsewhere in the county and 16 percent from New York City.
"The numbers vary a bit in our other projects," Ms. Appelbaum added, "but the markets we draw from are pretty consistent."
Susanna and John Le Boutillier moved to Avalon Willow last April after selling a co-op apartment in Manhattan. Ms. Le Boutillier said she sees living at the Willow "as an interim step, while we look for a house, which we're actively looking for now." The couple expects the process to take about the term of their lease, which is 15 months.
Rentals are also appealing to those on temporary work assignment, such as David Partridge, who develops business strategies for I.B.M. He and his wife, Diane, rent a one-bedroom at Avalon Willow. "We have no intention of making Westchester our permanent home," Mr. Partridge said. The couple still maintains its family home in Dover, Del. "It's a practical matter," Mr. Partridge said. "The company and I decided that renting was best for what will probably be a three-year stint at most."
While they may be transient, renters in Westchester can be extremely demanding, according to Ms. Hart. "They refuse to live anywhere more than six or seven years old," she said. "And they expect a great deal of service."
Avalon's renters in Westchester tend to be affluent, according to Ms. Appelbaum. "The average household income of our residents in Bronxville is $180,000," she said. "in Mamaroneck, it's $170,000."
Ms. Cottrell said she liked the sense of community that exists at Avalon Willow, where there are regular parties for the residents. "I've met a lot of interesting people at the parties," Ms. Cottrell said, "and they let you take home all the leftover food."

HEADLINE: Only Black Commissioner to Resign

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THE county's only black commissioner is resigning next month, prompting concern from some influential blacks that he is being unfairly forced out.
Larry Schwartz, chief adviser to County Executive Andrew J. Spano, confirmed that the transportation commissioner, Marvin V. Church, will leave his position in mid-January. 
 Asked why, he declined to say more. Mr. Church, on vacation, could not be reached for comment.
The confirmation of his resignation comes at a time when one of several employees of the Department of Transportation whose jobs are being eliminated in the proposed 2000 budget is contending, through his lawyer, "mismanagement and political patronage" in the department.
It was unclear whether the two developments were related, because Mr. Spano's office did not respond to several requests for information about the layoffs.
Andrea Stewart-Cousins, one of three black legislators on the County Board of Legislators, said Mr. Church's resignation took her by surprise and she questioned whether Mr. Church was being held to a higher standard of performance than other commissioners. "I certainly want to urge the Administration to search for quality people of minority backgrounds," she said.
M. Paul Redd Sr., the president, publisher and editor of The Westchester County Press, a weekly that focuses on news of interest to blacks, said in a front-page article last month, "It is not clear the real reason for Commissioner Church's resignation, since he apparently possessed the skills for transportation commissioner."
He went on to write: "Word of his resignation surfaced throughout Westchester and has made some leaders in the black community very unhappy. Some blacks feel we have not had enough people of color in commissioner or directorship positions and want Mr. Spano to address the issue of why Mr. Church has resigned."
The accusations of mismanagement and political patronage are included in a Nov. 18 letter to the Board of Legislators from Jonathan Lovett, a labor lawyer, who represents Terry Cameron, a transportation department employee.
Mr. Church, a Republican, was appointed transportation commissioner by Mr. Spano, a Democrat, in June 1998. The commissioner oversees the operations of the county's public bus system, transit services for the disabled and the county airport. The commissioner's salary is $104,370.
The resignation, coincidentally, leaves Mr. Redd's daughter, Paula Redd Zeman, the personnel officer, as the highest black-appointed official in the county government.
Mr. Church has worked in various government positions. He had served as Gov. George E. Pataki's regional director with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Before that, he was appointed by William F. Weld, then governor of Massachusetts, as an associate commissioner of the Massachusetts State Highway Department.
The resignation leaves Mr. Spano with two openings in his cabinet. Dr. Harold N. Adel, who served as health commissioner for the last three years, has announced his retirement, effective Jan. 31. Mr. Spano announced that he was accepting that resignation "with deep regret." In contrast, there was no formal announcement of Mr. Church's resignation. DONNA GREENE

HEADLINE: Deregulation Ignites a Building Boom

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AS the electric industry prepares for deregulation on Jan. 1, when many Connecticut residents will have as much choice in choosing their electric company as they do their telephone service, utility companies are rushing to put in power plants all around the state.
New natural gas-powered power plants have won state approval in Bridgeport, Meriden, Killingly and Oxford. There is an application pending on a plant in New Milford, and the Connecticut Siting Council expects applications soon from Wallingford, Haddam, South Norwalk and other towns. 
 Suddenly, Connecticut, dominated for generations by only two power companies, Northeast Utilities and United Illuminating, has become a hot electricity market. On Jan. 1, the two companies will stop selling power and instead will simply transmit the power that residents buy elsewhere (although both companies have formed subsidiaries that will still generate electricity). So others are clamoring to fill that void. And they expect it to be a profitable void to fill.
The state consumes about 30.6 million kilowatts of electricity a year, but experts predict that will rise to 39.1 million by 2018.
"In a nutshell, it's energy deregulation that's driving all the interest," said Janis G. Lipman, president of Towanic Energy, which has won approval to build a 512-megawatt plant in Oxford, where she expects to break ground early next year.
Oxford is welcoming the plant, as is Bridgeport, where developers proposed a 520-megawatt plant at the site where United Illuminating already operates three other power plants. But in other towns, plans to build the plants have been opposed by resident and environmental groups.
"The applications are very complicated, and the issues are generally very controversial, involving the environment, water use, noise and construction effects, traffic and fuel use," said Joel M. Rinebold, the executive director of the Siting Council. "People are going to be living with these plants for 30 or more years, so the council undertakes a very detailed analysis."
In Southington, neighbors turned out at state hearings to criticize plans for a 720-megawatt generating plant, and despite support from the local officials, including the Conservation Commission, Planning and Zoning Commission, and the City Council, the Siting Council rejected the plans.
"The Siting Council gave a variety of technical reasons for the decision, but I think the neighborhood opposition was the critical factor," said the Southington Town Manager, John Weichsel. "They were very organized, which made a big difference."
Mr. Rinebold, however, said the problems with that application went beyond the neighbor complaints.
"It was a combination of things, including the potential for fogging and steam plumes that could affect a residential community and an interstate highway, the fact that it was located on the Quinnipiac River flood plain and would have affected some wetlands, and the visibility of the plant," Mr. Rinebold said. "There was also concern about the location of the new gas pipeline and the electric transmission lines the plant would have needed."
In New Milford, a group known as Poweralert has been opposing the pending application for a 500-megawatt natural gas plant. Dr. Peter Orenski, a member of the group who spent 20 years helping Union Carbide win approval for chemical plants around the world, said much of the opposition stemmed from what he said was the unwillingness of the Sempra Energy Company to answer residents' questions.
"They simply refused to do the one job we asked them to do, which was to track the wind patterns so they could tell us what will happen to their 400 tons of emissions each year," Dr. Orenski said. Besides the environmental concerns, people were also worried about whether there would be a fire risk, and there were lingering questions about how much impact the plant's water use would have on groundwater sources, he said.
"The way to answer those questions would be to bring an engineer in, and say, 'here are the plants we operate, this is how we handle safety, and here is our operating record'," Dr. Orenski said. "They keep saying this is so much cleaner than coal plants, but it's not clean by comparison with what we have now, which is nothing."
William B. Keller, vice president for project development at Sempra Energy Resources, said the town's fire department had reviewed the plans for safety, the town did a $65,000 air quality study that found no problem and its health department had certified the plan as safe, and the local water authority had said water use would not be a problem. "There are a lot of independent third parties looking at this, and they have all said this will be clean and safe," Mr. Keller said. "It's not unusual for these projects to have opposition. But there's also a group, More Power To You, that has sprung up to support this proposal."
Kevin M. Case, executive director of the Farmington River Watershed Association, which was involved in the hearings on the 544-megawatt Meriden plant, said that in some cases the plants could be beneficial.
"We think in the big picture, their emissions are lower than a lot of the existing plants, they're much cheaper, and the impact on the environment should be reduced," he said.. "What we are starting to see is that some of these plants are re-using existing industrial sites, brownfield sites, which we think is wonderful. If you take a site that used to have a factory on it and re-use it for one of these natural gas plants, the impact is really minimal."
"The only issue in most of the cases is going to be the cooling water," Mr. Case said. "Gas plants can use 3 million or 4 million gallons of water a day for evaporative cooling, so our interest is, where is that water going to be coming from?"
Margery Winters, director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, which intervened on the Meriden and Southington applications, is also a member of a State Rivers Advisory Committee that is looking at the issue of the diversion of water from rivers. Many rivers in the state already experience low flow during the dry months.
"If every business withdrew all the water from the rivers that they are registered to withdraw, some of our rivers would be running dry," Ms. Winters said. "We're not at that point yet, but it creates a difficult management situation."
Northeast Utilities has also intervened in the cases, although a spokesman, Frank J. Poirot, said it was only to make sure that the connections to the Connecticut power grid would be up to Northeast's standards.
"We don't have to go any further back than this past summer to realize that in Connecticut, we don't generate as much power as we consume," Mr. Poirot said. "More often than not, we're importing more power from out of state, and it would be a great help if these plants were running. If the market was so saturated these plants might exceed demand, we might have a different point of view on this, but that's not the case now, and our demand has been growing fairly steadily the last five or six years, so it's probably not going to be the case in the future."
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association has also issued a statement strongly backing the new power plants, not only because of the potential for cheaper power -- the association says power costs in Connecticut are 72 percent higher than the national average -- but for the reliability it will give to the power supply.
"Many of Connecticut's manufacturers are using extremely sensitive equipment with computer chips that require a consistent source of power to function properly," said John R. Rathgeber, executive vice president of the association. "Uncertainty about electrical capacity and reliability is a concern we now can address because of the change to a competitive electric marketplace."
In Killingly, most townspeople welcomed the late September ground-breaking for a 792-megawatt power plant on a 50-acre site in the town's industrial park, that will provide enough power for about 800,000 homes when it opens in 2001.
Elsie D. Bissette, the town's economic development coordinator, said Pacific Gas & Electric would provide about $50 million in taxes to the town over 20 years, plus $5 million during the two-year construction period. It will create 25 to 30 permanent jobs, and more important will be a steady, reliable source of inexpensive power that she hopes will draw more industry to town. In fact, the town is negotiating to buy 70 acres to expand the industrial park. The current owner, coincidentally, is Northeast Utilities.
"When P.G.& E. first came to town we had just lost about 650 jobs because of the closing of two major employers," Ms. Bissette said. "There was some discussion about the fact that they wanted to use 4 million to 6 million gallons of water a day, but then it became an air-cooled plant, which will cost them a little more, but it made a tremendous difference in the public reaction.
"They've been very proactive, willing to accommodate the concerns in town, so it has been a very good relationship," Ms. Bissette said.
Oxford's First Selectman, Paul T. Schreiber, said his town has had a similar experience. The town acquired 474 acres of industrially zoned property in 1997 in lieu of $2.1 million in back taxes. Towanic will build a 1.5 million road with all utilities to serve its property that will also open 34 industrial lots.
"So even before we start talking about the tax dollars they're going to pay, they're developing our industrial park for us," Mr. Schreiber said. "They're going to pay an average of $2.1 million a year in taxes, and it will give us the opportunity to build a high school and other public buildings that we've been putting off for years. This project means financial health for the town of Oxford."

HEADLINE: Volunteer Connections: Returning the Favor

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
BEFORE handing him their Christmas wish lists, children on the streets of New Rochelle often tug at Frank Carlson's red pants and remind him how good they have been. They do not know that in real life Mr. Carlson, 41, who donates time as a sidewalk Santa for the Volunteers of America, is a former resident of a halfway house for alcoholics who now wants to return a favor to society.
Similarly, many patients at the White Plains Hospital Center who love her gentle touch do not realize that Melita Loew, 69, a volunteer massage therapist, is coping with the death of her husband and discovering a new direction in life. 
 When Dr. Glen T. Nygreen, 81, a retired college administrator, organizes a book sale for the Scarsdale Congregational Church, what matters to his co-workers is his business acumen -- not his desire to continue being productive. The same holds true when Dr. Nygreen, a former vice president of Lehman College in the Bronx, serves on the board of directors of United Way of Westchester.
Mr. Carlson, Mrs. Loew and Dr. Nygreen are among a growing number of people who donate expertise and time to causes they espouse. The Points of Light Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington and the leading organization for volunteering in the United States, says
109 million people -- the equivalent of 9 million full-time employees -- volunteered an estimated 19.9 billion hours last year, with the average volunteer contributing 3.5 hours a week.
And although volunteers are motivated by different reasons, they share common desires, said the organization, which was founded nine years ago.
The reasons for volunteering include a variety of personal benefits, the foundation said, with the top three being feeling compassion for those in need, having an interest in the activity or work and gaining a new perspective on things.
In the case of Mr. Carlson -- who now owns an ice supply company in the Bronx -- it was "a need to give something back to society," he said. "For so long, I took, and here was an opportunity for a second chance -- to return."
Or as Walter D. Hosp, the 41-year-old chief financial officer for the Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation in Tarrytown and a volunteer for United Way of Westchester and Putnam Counties, said, "When you donate your time, it affects your priorities and gives a realness to life."
Mrs. Loew said that volunteering had given her a feeling of accomplishment, "of still being connected."
And Dr. Nygreen weighed the economics of volunteering. "In many cases for nonprofits, the salary scales are so low that it's difficult to keep qualified staff," he said. "That's where someone at my point of life and with my experience fills a gap."
Ellen Del Colle, executive director of the Volunteer Center in White Plains, a clearinghouse since 1959 for volunteers in Westchester and Putnam Counties, observed that many nonprofit organizations by themselves could not generate sufficient funds to accomplish their goals without volunteers.
As part of Mr. Carlson's rehabilitation, he was assigned to a special school to learn how to be a Santa Claus and collect money for a Volunteers of America food program that gives $25 grocery store vouchers to needy families at this time of year.
Mrs. Loew is among what Tammy Mortensen, the director of volunteer services at White Plains Hospital Center, described as "a group of 300 people who are an essential part of running the hospital." Unable to find a job when her husband died two years ago, Mrs. Loew turned to the volunteer center at the 307-bed community hospital and is now booked five days a week, massaging new mothers with high blood pressure in the maternity ward and also working in the greenhouse at the Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains.
Dr. Nygreen, too, is fully occupied and almost as active, he said, as when he worked at Lehman College. "The only difference is I get to read the newspapers in the mornings these days instead of wedging them in later."
At the Volunteer Center, which serves about 1,400 nonprofit agencies, Mrs. Colle observed that many people "get hooked on volunteering."
Like many who donate their time to worthy causes, Mr. Hosp is not fussy about his volunteering activities, on which he spends nearly 10 hours a month. Working through United Way, he sometimes rakes leaves for a worthy cause, or serves spaghetti to hungry people, or serves as a member of the organization's finance committee.
At the Volunteer Center, which is the largest of its kind in the county, Mrs. Del Colle said 5,000 volunteers a year are assigned to hospitals, nursing homes, senior centers, food panties, museums and thrift shops.
She said the cast of volunteers is broad-ranging in both age and interests, with a 4-year-old girl folding napkins with her family at a Salvation Army soup kitchen in Westchester and a 98-year-old resident of a home for the elderly performing clerical tasks for a hospital and sewing for terminally ill patients at a nursing Home.
Among the other volunteering jobs available are driving patients undergoing chemotherapy, working in aviaries and taking birds and other animals to patients in nursing homes and hospitals and rocking young patients, like those at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, to help them fall asleep at night.
Arthur Stein, a retired sales engineer, and his pet, Willett, a 2 1/2-year-old deaf Shetland sheepdog, travel to several area institutions, like the White Plains Hospital Center, to help comfort patients. The ill and disabled relate especially to the fact that Willett cannot hear, because as Mr. Stein of White Plains, observed: "Even though Willett has a disability, you'd never know it. Patients connect to the fact that he is happy despite his problems."
Despite the increasing need for volunteers, the Volunteer Center carefully screens all applicants, with many nonprofit organizations also requiring background checks for those who work with children and the elderly.
"We never want to make a mistake, a bad match," Mrs. Del Colle said.
In part, the increase in the popularity of volunteering is the result of growing community service requirements from schools that encourage students to make a contribution and from churches and synagogues that want confirmation and bar mitzvah students to do the same.
The youngsters working through the Volunteer Center have helped businesses create Web sites and have worked on computers, assisted at animal shelters and read mail and newspapers to people with failing eyesight, among other things.
"It has led to many warm relationships between the generations," Mrs. Del Colle said.
Clifford D. Schneider, regional director for the Mid-Hudson chapter of the Volunteers of America, said his organization places 130 volunteers a year in jobs. Some are relief workers for people caring for AIDS victims. Others -- "often former alumni of recovery programs," Mr. Schneider said -- help out at meetings for halfway house residents.
Despite the increasing interest, there are still too few volunteers to go around. "Around Christmastime, the ranks of volunteers increase, but not as much as we'd like," Mr. Schneider said, adding that there is a continuing need for people to relieve AIDS helpers, recreational workers and sidewalk Santas.
Founded in 1896, Volunteers of America provides shelter and housing for homeless people and families, services for troubled youths and treatment and recovery programs for alcoholics and drug abusers, among other things. In Westchester, Volunteers of America runs a 58-bed, 24-hour emergency shelter for homeless men at the County Airport in Harrison.
It also manages Crossroads, a 17-bed halfway house for men and women recovering from alcoholism, with a goal of preparing clients for independent living within three to nine months. In addition, it runs shelters in Yorktown and Valhalla for homeless single adults and couples.
Those interested in volunteering can approach individual agencies like Volunteers of America or clearinghouses like the Volunteer Center. Or they can try the Internet, which is fast becoming a source of referral services for volunteers.
E-volunteering, as it has been identified by philanthropic industry experts, accounted for about 1 million of the 109 millions of Americans who volunteered in 1998, according to a new study by Independent Sector, the Washington-based research organization that studies the nonprofit market.
A two-year-old online matchmaking service, volunteermatch.org, informs would-be volunteers of thousands of opportunities across the United States. Volunteermatch uses the Internet to help people nationwide find volunteer opportunities posted by local nonprofit and public sector organizations.
It works like this: type in your zip code, the number of miles you would be willing to travel and the field of work you are looking for -- like arts and culture, human and civil rights or sports and recreation, for example. And voila!
As an example, a search from postal zip code 10605 in White Plains, for a person willing to travel 10 miles to a volunteering position and eager to try a variety of jobs, yielded 10 possibilities. One could join the Prompters for productions at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, become a mentor for the White Plains Youth Bureau, volunteer for the American Heart Association or become an assistant to Donald S. Tedesco, the elementary school teacher in Mamaroneck who recently won a Disney Teacher of the Year Award.

HEADLINE: A Locked-In Vancouver Is Bulging to the East

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING 

DATELINE: CHILLIWACK, B.C.

 BODY:
THE direction of growth in the metropolis of Vancouver has been governed by geography. It can't go west because of the Pacific Ocean, or north because of the mountains. It can't go too far south because of the United States boundary. So it has gone eastward, through the broad Fraser River Valley, and now it has reached Chilliwack 65 miles from downtown Vancouver, which is about as far as the growth can go.
Chilliwack is a picturesque farming community known for its corn and peas and its fast-running waters. Every year fishers stand elbow to elbow to catch salmon running in the Fraser and Vedder Rivers. But beyond Chilliwack the flat valley land disappears into the rugged western foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and development potential vanishes.
 "I'm here because most land elsewhere is taken up," said Rick Wellsby, one of a multitude of developers turning their sights toward Chilliwack, where there is plenty of available land. "People used to think an hour is a long commute. But if you're from Toronto, Seattle or Los Angeles, this is not the case today." 
 Three years ago, Mr. Wellsby built the Falls Golf and Country Club, with an 18-hole golf course, as the centerpiece of his development. He has a list of 900 people, especially golfers, interested in buying one of his 2,100 housing units, 75 percent of which will front on fairways. He has just reached agreement on sewer connections with the city, and construction of the housing is expected to begin early next year.
HOME builders have been active in Chilliwack since 1993 and have already constructed detached homes, town houses and apartments for about 15,000 residents, raising the city's population to 65,000. They are now attempting to fill the housing demand from an influx of new residents that could nearly double the population within 25 years.
 "To think we can stop growth is preposterous, so we must manage it well," said John Les, Mayor of Chilliwack. The city is under pressure because half of British Columbia's four million residents live in Greater Vancouver. Since 1990, some 400,000 people have moved there from other Canadian cities, Asia and the United States and planners are preparing for an additional million residents by 2021. Since 1994, $8 billion in housing has been built. (All figures are approximations in United States dollars, worth about $1.47 in Canadian dollars.)
Restricting Chilliwack's development is the fact that 70 percent of its 100 square miles is locked into farming. In 1973, the government created the Agricultural Land Reserve because the mountainous province was losing 18,000 acres of prime farmland a year to construction. In the Greater Vancouver region, 318,000 acres are protected and Chilliwack is the third largest farming center, with an agricultural revenue of $100 million a year, following neighboring Langley with $105 million and Abbotsford with $215 million.
 Chilliwack's remaining undeveloped flat land has been designated industrial for manufacturing and service industries as the city diversifies its economic base to provide jobs for residents. One of the latest companies to announce that it is moving into the city is Oak West Furniture, which plans to start building a $9 million plant early next year that will employ 50 people.
 The city is requiring new housing to be built on the only remaining land -- the steep sides of forested hills to the south of the valley that tower more than 800 feet above the valley floor, said Kim Fowler, Chilliwack's manager of development services. When fully developed the hillsides will be able to support a population in excess of 100,000, city officials say.
 Mr. Wellsby's Eastern Hillsides project, which will house 13,000 people, will be the latest in that effort. The company he heads as president, Blackburn Developments Ltd., amassed six forested properties covering 430 acres. Home buyers -- young families, retirees and golfers, about 60 percent of them from Greater Vancouver -- will be treated to a panorama of mountain peaks that form a backdrop to farms that dot the valley below.
 Mr. Wellsby expects his development will cost $400 million when completed in 15 years. His plans call for 300 detached homes, 600 town houses, 700 apartments and 500 time-share units in a resort hotel. Next year's first phase will consist of 60 single-family homes and 40 multifamily units. A lot on a fairway with a 3,000-square-foot house is expected to cost about $225,000. Town houses with 1,400 square feet are expected to start at $145,000 and range up to $240,000 for 3,300 square feet.
 Mr. Wellsby said a Chilliwack home was as much as 60 percent cheaper than one in Vancouver. City statistics indicate the average Chilliwack price of a house is $130,000 and the city's average annual household income is $40,000.
Chilliwack's first hillside neighborhood is Promontory, where there are 2,600 residents now and 7,000 are expected in a couple of years. At the Thom Creek Ranch subdivision, detached two-bedroom ranches with 1,326 square feet start at $110,000 and three-bedroom ranches with 2,268 square feet start at $150,000.
 Another hillside community, Chilliwack Mountain, now has 374 housing units and in 10 years is expected to have more than 1,100 units. City officials say they expect the neighborhood, which will have a future emphasis on town houses and multifamily development, to have 3,000 residents in a decade.
The city also plans to revitalize its aging downtown, where many buildings were erected a half century ago or longer. (Chilliwack has its roots in the 1860's when more than 30,000 prospectors passed through the pioneer farming enclave along the Fraser River on their way to the nearby Fraser River Canyon, where gold had been discovered.)
 In time, said Ms. Fowler, the manager of development services, older downtown buildings will be torn down and high density multifamily housing will spring up there.
 A crucial element in this urban renewal plan was the selection in September of RG Properties of Vancouver as developer of a $40 million project on city-owned land that will include a hotel, convention center, swimming pool complex and an arena with 5,000 seats for rodeos, rock concerts and sporting events. The project will be adjacent to the downtown on 37 acres that have served as an exhibition ground and race track. "This will be a real catalyst for the city's redevelopment," said Graham Lee, RG's president and chief executive.
SOME Chilliwack residents have successfully opposed any construction in the 11,000-acre Ryder Lake recreation area and as a result home building will be deferred there for 10 years.
 The city must now figure out geotechnical solutions for sending sewer and water up steep hillsides, which will cost an average of $8,500 per dwelling, says Mayor Les. "I sense a nervousness in our population that hillside development is fine, but do it carefully," he said. "The City Council is cognizant of this so they do not incur a growth backlash."
 Jim and Marcia Sutter, who sold a hand-held video game manufacturing business in Hong Kong and returned to North America, recently moved to Chilliwack. They also have a winter home in Mexico. "People ask me, 'Why Chilliwack?' " said Ms. Sutter. "We like the country and small-town feeling of going into shops or the bank where people know you by your first name."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Plays, Gay and Otherwise

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
ASK Craig Lucas what a gay play is and he is likely to, purposefully, reel off flip definitions: "A gay play is a play written by a gay playwright." Or, "It sleeps with another play of the same gender."
William M. Hoffman, who wrote "As Is," a so-called gay play that is one of the American theater's trailblazing dramas about AIDS perceives and emphasizes gay elements in a vast reach of plays through the ages, including Shakespeare's "Edward II," two obscure comedies by Mae West (not including "Sex") and "God of Vengeance," a Yiddish classic of 1903. Not to mention "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" by Tennessee Williams, "Streamers" by David Rabe and "The Dying Gaul" by Mr. Lucas.. 
 As director of the dramatic writing program at Purchase College, Mr. Hoffman has assigned all these plays. And, as an offshoot of the course, "Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Theater," he holds conversations with gay and lesbian playwrights. .
His conversationalist Dec. 14 is Holly Hughes, author of "The Well of Horniness."
"I don't have to come in and do a manifesto -- or possibly I will at the slightest provocation," she said in an interview. Not to worry, Ms. Hughes, provocation awaits.
Mr. Hoffman fully expects Ms. Hughes to "do a performance," one could say a piece of a performance piece -- 10 minutes or so. Ms. Hughes's new work, "Preaching to the Perverted," by her description a "low-tech show on an almost bare stage" is to be performed at Public School 122 on the Lower East Side in April and May. It is about her Supreme Court confrontation of 1998, a case arising over a National Endowment for the Arts grant. Ms. Hughes's grant was withdrawn because of sexually explicit content, language and gesture. It was then reinstated. "I focused on the Supreme Court hearing as a piece of theater," Ms. Hughes said. "Judge Judy did not prepare me for this. In retrospect, I would rather have had Ed Koch, who represents more respect for the rule of law than the United States Supreme Court."
Given Ms. Hughes's gift for candor, not to mention ineffable charm and wit, a conversation with her is sure to elicit funny and dazzling rejoinders; it is not possible to believe that listeners will not jump to be participants. Once quoted as saying she had a "mission to change the world," Ms. Hughes will be expected to explain just what a performance artist -- her designation -- is or does.
"I can expound on that," she said. "I will entertain the questions, if not necessarily answer them."
Although she was inspired by such seminal underground theater and avant-garde influences as Charles Ludlam and his legendary Ridiculous Theater Company, Ms. Hughes said: "In the 70's, a lot of what is called performance art was coming from visual artists; Laurie Anderson started out as one. Her photos were accompanied by tapes, and she put on a headset. It is not coming out of the theater artists but was intended to push the limitations of various media to produce a hybrid art."
What started out as an anti-theatrical movement, "In the ensuing 30 years, has become autobiographically driven, like Spalding Gray, more than questioning forms of theater." she said.
Of the present arts scene, Ms. Hughes observed: "We are in a cynical comodified moment where the big impact is economic. Theater is a commodity to be consumed. It is not about asking questions or about who we are. With less funding, it has to be concerned with the bottom line."
But it is all in the cause of theater, "which will never be able to compete with the spectacle of movies," Ms. Hughes said. "What theater has to offer is unmediated human presence. That is its strongest, wonderful, irreplaceable fact."
She continued: "The need for gay and lesbian courses is almost hilarious. So many works in the canon have been disguised by closeted writers. And there is now a wealth of interest in gay and lesbian writers who have a particular sensibility and explicitly gay characters, but it is located in a larger world, as it exists in a larger community.
"A play like Christopher Durang's 'Betty's Summer Vacation' of last season is not a gay play. It follows a tradition of gay male sendups of heterosexuals, of gender, of family relationships -- without a gay character in it. I'll ask Bill, who comes out of a more naturalistic tradition (he edited a gay play anthology) some questions. 'Why is he offering this class?' 'Why is he inviting riffraff like me?' "
A conversation with Mr. Lucas is to take place on Thursday. The playwright, who lives in Putnam County with his male companion -- the couple intends to adopt an infant -- is best known for, "Prelude to a Kiss" and "Reckless," neither of them ostensibly gay. But most recently, "The Dying Gaul," which he considers his most highly praised work, was a decidedly homosexual play. A gender changed -- two men instead of one man and one woman -- version of "Marry Me a Little," a revue based on songs by Stephen Sondheim, which was developed by Mr. Lucas and Norman Rene, is a hit in Hollywood, where it opened last month to rave reviews.
Mr. Lucas said: "I balk at being called a gay playwright. It marginalizes you. I can imagine a straight woman, a black boy, an old Jewish man. I live in the real world, not in a gay village. My job is to imagine, not report on some factoid of my life. It would be odd if Shakespeare had written only what he 'knew.' I'm a white gay male in America. That's one of the reasons I want to talk to students, as an out person who speaks candidly about experience informed by art. No one has ever told them the truth about anything. To hear an adult talk about any aspect of life from a lived perspective shocks and means something to them."
Ms. Hughes, as teacher, is on the Purchase College semester list for January. The course is gay and lesbian performance art. It will be offered under gay and lesbian studies and "cross listed with dramatic studies," she explained, trying to avoid the academic jargon of complicated, overlapping departmental structures. It is sufficient to say the "lesbian, gay and bisexual theater" course, five years old and being conducted by Mr. Hoffman for the first time, is "an open course; it's out there."
Describing it that way, Mr. Hoffman intended neither a wordplay about being openly gay or gay outing. It is an elective, open to everyone. Major and dramatic writing, however, is required in order to be a member of that department, and the other two courses he is teaching this semester (dramatic writing and script analysis) go under the heading conservatory program for freshmen and sophomores, leading to a bachelor of fine arts degree.
Of the students in Mr. Hoffman's dramatic writing course, he said: "We don't offer false encouragement. You have to be obsessed and you better be someone who wants it. It's not for the casual."
On the origins of gay and lesbian drama as a course, Mr. Hoffman said: "I don't have a clue, but it must be taught."
In "Conversations With," as he prefers to call the series at the Neuberger Museum of Art, "I want to get the best playwrights and directors of national repute," he said, although his focus is on playwrights who are gay: Lanford Wilson, Christopher Durang, Terrence McNally, Nicky Silver. This year's conversations began with Mr. Kramer and then went to Maria Irene Fornes, whose body of work is being seen Off Broadway this season at the Signature Theater. The conversations with Mr. Lucas and with Ms. Hughes are being held on Thursday and on Dec. 14, respectively, at the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College at 4 p.m. Admission is free, but the capacity is about 75. For more information, the number to call is 251-6113.
Mr. Hoffman, who has also written the libretto for "The Ghosts of Versailles," with music by John Corigliano, has had teaching assignments or stints at Arizona State University in Tempe, at Juilliard (on the art of the libretto), at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, and the New School.
"But I'm beginning to have an academic home here," he said.

An Added Anchor for Newark's Downtown Revival

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
LESS than a month after the last workers at the former Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company headquarters in downtown Newark packed up and left, a new single tenant, International Discount Telecommunications, began moving into the 20-story building.
IDT, a provider of high-speed Internet access and discount long distance telephone service, signed on to lease the 450,000-square-foot structure at 520 Broad Street as its world headquarters on Nov. 19, a Friday. That weekend it began relocating about 100 of its 1,100 workers to the building from Hackensack, replacing the insurer, which had ceased operations last summer. 
 IDT signed a 20-year lease with three 10-year options with the Kushner Companies, of Florham Park, which acquired 520 Broad Street for $10.5 million in June. People close to the deal say IDT is renting the building, which has a health club and an 850-car garage, for $4.3 million a year initially, with increases in the 10th year and every five years thereafter -- plus property taxes, utilities and operating expenses.
In the process the company gains the right to put its name on the mid-1950's structure, which is visible from the New Jersey Turnpike. It is also receiving a tax abatement and other incentives worth more than $1 million from Newark and is working with the state to arrange financing to renovate the building.
Commercial brokers say that the fact that IDT is the first sizable company in more than a decade to relocate from outside Newark is a step forward in the revitalization of the city, which has been trying to mend itself since the 1967 race riots pushed it into decline.
Mayor Sharpe James called the building, which is close to the minor league baseball stadium that opened this summer and the two-year-old performing arts center, another anchor for the downtown area. The area still has some 700,000 square feet of empty space.
The arts center "was about bricks and mortar," Mayor James said. "This is about people and about bringing life back to that corner of Broad Street."
IDT is a fast-growing company, adding more than 50 employees a month, its officials said. Most of its employees, who share the work seven days a week, 24 hours a day, will move into the Newark building over the next five months, filling about half the space. The other half is for expansion.
IDT now occupies some 150,000 square feet of space in six separate leased or owned buildings along Main and State Streets in Hackensack. For months it scoured Bergen, Essex, Passaic and Union Counties as well as Manhattan for a new home before choosing the Newark building over 60 others.
The choice also reflects the trend of telecommunications and technology-based firms moving into older cities because they offer less expensive space as well as access to labor, highways, mass transit and fiber-optic links. All of these considerations were factors in IDT's decision to move to Newark, as were proximity to Manhattan and ample parking, said James Courter, the company's president and vice chairman.
For a company competing for workers with giants like AT&T and Lucent "those factors will also help in our recruiting efforts," said Mr. Courter, a former Republican Congressman who lost the race for Governor to Jim Florio in 1989.
For Newark, said Mitchell Moss, director of the Center for Urban Studies at New York University, "this is the great story of telecommunications firms helping to revive cities," adding that Newark now has "a technological infrastructure in place."
In recent years investors have acquired nine old downtown buildings to renovate and rent them, drawing as tenants a crop of telecommunications and computer-based companies in addition to law, health-care and insurance concerns. While the vacancy rate for Class B buildings was 32.7 percent as of the third quarter, according to Grubb & Ellis, the national commercial brokerage expects that figure to drop significantly when the IDT lease is taken into account.
AT the same time average annual asking rents rose to $20.10 a square foot from $18.86 in 1998. The rate for Class B space in the 11-county northern and central New Jersey office market averaged $21.83 a square foot, reported Grubb & Ellis.
The "technological infrastructure" that Mr. Moss cited includes the tangle of fiber-optic backbones and cables under the city's streets that computer-based firms need to connect the devices they use. New Jersey Bell, the predecessor of Bell Atlantic, whose New Jersey headquarters is in Newark, laid some of the initial wires when it made the city one of its regional hubs decades ago. Its successor has enhanced them in recent years.
Other providers that have emerged since the deregulation of the telephone industry have also recently put in fiber optic backbones along the railroad right of way that runs through the city and, like branches from a tree, extended the cables into its core.
The need to locate in buildings close to fiber-optic networks, brokers said, has lured some two dozen telecommunications companies as well as a technology concerns to the city. The telecommunications companies have set up Internet switching and transmission stations, mainly at the 1.2-million-square-foot former Macy's building at 165 Halsey Street.
Other newcomers operate from the lower floors of 744 Broad Street, a 630,000-square-foot building, which its owner, Cogswell Realty Group of Manhattan is renovating at a cost of $45 million. In the two years since Cogswell bought the building its occupancy has doubled to 60 percent.
Most of the space leased by telecommunications companies is occupied by machines. But this, say downtown-revival advocates, is not enough. IDT helps give the city "legitimacy" as a corporate headquarters location, said Jonathan Meisel, an associate director at the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial brokerage that handled both the sale and leasing of the 520 Broad Street building.
But Joseph Romano, managing director of the New Jersey offices of Grubb & Ellis, said he wondered whether IDT would be followed into downtown by other corporations. Since there "are only one or two other buildings that are of headquarters quality" that can support labor-intensive technology firms, he said, investors must renovate another building or build a new one.
One group planning to build is a partnership of Tishman-Speyer, Travelers and Morgan Stanley of Manhattan and Gale & Wentworth of Florham Park. The group is under contract to buy a site on Raymond Boulevard just west of the Pennsylvania Railroad Station to build a 400,000- to 600,000-square-foot office structure, said Mark Yeager, president of the Commercial Group at Gale & Wentworth. The group is also to close soon on the purchase of three prime downtown buildings totaling 1.3 million square feet.
"We intend to play to the city's strength as a hub for telecommunications and high-technology firms," Mr. Yeager said, adding that construction of the building would start once a tenant preleased half the space.
The IDT lease will bring 520 Broad Street full circle. Early this year Mutual Benefit Life -- which was seized by state regulators after it collapsed in 1991 and operated by the company under a rehabilitation plan -- sold the building. The company had earlier sold its insurance assets.
For Kushner, known mostly as a suburban residential developer, the purchase was part of a diversification strategy. "We also bought into what's happening in Newark," said Richard Stadtmauer, its managing director. He pointed to the arts center and baseball stadium as well as, among other things, plans for a downtown arena for the New Jersey Nets basketball team and a light rail system to connect downtown Newark to Newark International Airport.
"The worst-case scenario," he said, "was that we would carry an empty building and pay the taxes."
Mr. Stadtmauer said his company had been negotiating with several tenants for space before IDT entered the picture late last summer. The lease evolved following a decision by the two companies to join forces to supply Kushner's buildings with high-speed Internet and telephone access, as well as to market the service to other landlords. The result was the formation last September of a new company, Westmintech. L.L.C.
IDT initially was to lease half the building, but with the incentives from the city it took all the space. In addition to the abatement, which basically stabilizes taxes at $2 a square foot for 15 years, the city also will compensate IDT with a $1 million relocation payment and build a 500-car parking garage to supplement the existing 850-car garage and lease it to the company at a below-market rent.
Mr. Courter said the financing IDT hopes to get from the state will help the company make $20 million to $40 million in renovations to the building, mostly in advanced wiring and heating and cooling installations.
Mayor James said that with the payroll tax -- 1 percent of IDT's gross annual payroll -- and "getting people walking on the streets," the city will more than recoup its investment.
"It is," he said, referring to the IDT relocation, "a home run."

HEADLINE: Talks With Gay Playwrights Offered in Course at Purchase

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
ASK Craig Lucas what a gay play is and he is likely to, purposefully, reel off flip definitions, often heard by some people:
"A gay play is a play written by a gay playwright." Or, "It sleeps with another play of the same gender." 
 William M. Hoffman, who wrote "As Is," a so-called gay play, and one of the American theater's two trailblazing ones about AIDS -- the other is "The Normal Heart" by Larry Kramer -- perceives and emphasizes gay elements in a vast reach of plays through the ages, including Shakespeare's "Edward II," two obscure comedies by Mae West (not including "Sex") and "God of Vengeance," a Yiddish classic of 1903. Not to mention "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" by Tennessee Williams, "Streamers" by David Rabe, "The Dying Gaul" by Mr. Lucas and "The Well of Horniness" by Holly Hughes.
In his role as director of the dramatic writing program at Purchase College, Mr. Hoffman has assigned all these plays. And he holds conversations with gay and lesbian playwrights as an offshoot of the course, "Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Theater."
"I don't have to come in and do a manifesto -- or possibly I will at the slightest provocation," said Ms. Hughes, who is Mr. Hoffman's conversationalist on Dec. 14. Not to worry, Ms. Hughes, provocation awaits.
Mr. Hoffman fully expects Ms. Hughes to "do a performance," one could say a piece of a performance piece -- 10 minutes or so. Ms. Hughes's new work, "Preaching to the Perverted," by her description a "low-tech show on an almost bare stage" is to be performed at Public School 122 on the Lower East Side in April and May.
It is about her Supreme Court confrontation of 1998, a case arising over a National Endowment for the Arts grant. Ms. Hughes's grant was withdrawn because of sexually explicit content, language and gesture. It was then reinstated.
"I focused on the Supreme Court hearing as a piece of theater," Ms. Hughes said.
"Judge Judy did not prepare me for this. In retrospect, I would rather have had Ed Koch, who represents more respect for the rule of law than the United States Supreme Court."
Given Ms. Hughes's gift for candor, not to mention ineffable charm and wit, one would not reasonably expect from an artist with an agenda in response to restrictive, oppressive powers -- Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, is one of her most acerbically and humorously used adjectives -- a conversation with Ms. Hughes is sure to elicit funny and dazzling rejoinders; it is not possible to believe that listeners will not jump to be participants. Once quoted as having a "mission to change the world," Ms. Hughes will be expected to explain just what a performance artist -- her designation -- is or does.
"I can expound on that," she said. "I will entertain the questions, if not necessarily answer them."
Although she was inspired by such seminal underground theater and avant-garde influences as the great Charles Ludlam and his legendary Ridiculous Theater Company, Ms. Hughes said:
"In the 70's, a lot of what is called performance art was coming from visual artists; Laurie Anderson started out as one. Her photos were accompanied by tapes, and she put on a headset. It is not coming out of the theater artists but was intended to push the limitations of various media to produce a hybrid art."
What started out as an anti-theatrical movement, "in the ensuing 30 years, has become autobiographically driven, like Spalding Gray, more than questioning forms of theater," she said.
Of the present arts scene, Ms. Hughes said: "We are in a cynical comodified moment where the big impact is economic. Theater is a commodity to be consumed. It is not about asking questions or about who we are. With less funding, it has to be concerned with the bottom line."
Despite the lessening of fringe movements and spaces for emerging theater artists, Ms. Hughes still spoke of going "where the excitement and energy is" -- in the South Bronx, in Dumbo the acronym for Down Under Manhattan Bridge Overpass, a section in Brooklyn -- which even has a performance group that calls itself Dumba.
But it is all in the cause of theater, "which will never be able to compete with the spectacle of movies," Ms. Hughes said. "What theater has to offer is unmediated human presence. That is its strongest, wonderful, irreplaceable fact."
She continued: "The need for gay and lesbian courses is almost hilarious. So many works in the canon have been disguised by closeted writers.
"And there is now a wealth of interest in gay and lesbian writers who have a particular sensibility and explicitly gay characters, but it is located in a larger world, as it exists in a larger community.
"A play like Christopher Durang's 'Betty's Summer Vacation' of last season is not a gay play.

I'll ask Bill, who comes out of a more naturalistic tradition (he edited a gay play anthology) some questions. 'Why is he offering this class?' 'Why is he inviting riffraff like me?' "
A conversation with Mr. Lucas is to take place on Thursday. The playwright, who lives in Putnam County with his male companion -- the couple intend to adopt an infant -- is best known for, "Prelude to a Kiss" and "Reckless," neither of them ostensibly gay.
But most recently, "The Dying Gaul," which he considers his most highly praised work, was a decidedly homosexual play. A gender changed -- two men instead of one man and one woman -- version of "Marry Me a Little," a revue based on songs by Stephen Sondheim, which was developed by Mr. Lucas and Norman Rene, is a hit in Hollywood, where it opened last month to rave reviews.
Mr. Lucas said: "I balk at being called a gay playwright. It marginalizes you. I can imagine a straight woman, a black boy, an old Jewish man. I live in the real world, not in a gay village. My job is to imagine, not report on some factoid of my life. It would be odd if Shakespeare had written only what he 'knew.' I'm a white gay male in America. That's one of the reasons I want to talk to students, as an out person who speaks candidly about experience informed by art. No one has ever told them the truth about anything. To hear an adult talk about any aspect of life from a lived perspective shocks and means something to them."
Ms. Hughes, as teacher, is on the Purchase College semester list for January. The course is gay and lesbian performance art. It will be offered under gay and lesbian studies and "cross listed with dramatic studies," she explained, trying to avoid the academic jargon of complicated, overlapping departmental structures where, in this case, courses are identified as belonging in either a division (humanities) or a conservatory (theater arts and film). It is sufficient to say that the "lesbian, gay and bisexual theater" course, five years old and being conducted by Mr. Hoffman for the first time, is "an open course; it's out there."
Describing it that way, Mr. Hoffman intended neither a wordplay about being openly gay or gay outing. It is an elective, open to everyone.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
A New Idea For Unions: Forget the Past

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST

 BODY:
ASIDE from driving to work and perhaps breaking for lunch, what do more than 90 percent of private-sector employees in this country have in common?
The answer: They are not union members. The A.F.L.-C.I.O., groggily awakening to its increasing irrelevance, has lately been calling for stepped-up organizing efforts. But it might as well lobby for a ban on fax machines, for all the good it will do. 
 Recruiting new members may be tough, but it is easier than addressing the real reason for the collapse of organized labor in this country: the very nature of unions as they are currently constituted.
You won't find it displayed on union Web sites, but the motto of organized labor in this country might as well be "change is evil." Unions are most effective in situations where competition is minimal, capital is entrenched and technology cannot replace humans. Thus, unions are strongest among government workers, utilities, rust-bucket industries and transportation companies.
The picture of commercial America painted by that list is as current as a faded daguerreotype. Labor, capital and technology are just too mobile (and plentiful) in a world of six billion people and instant telecommunications. It's a joke to think you can make a cartel of some segment of the work force, raise the cost of doing business and prevent the kinds of economic changes you consider detrimental to your membership.
It has long been obvious that Luddite-ism is a dead end: Labor-saving innovation and change may be bad for, say, tollbooth attendants or Linotype operators, but everybody else gains. Trying to block such change is not only wrong (since to do so would impoverish the many to protect a few) but also very bad public relations.
Anyway, it's probably futile. The pace of economic evolution has accelerated irrevocably, even if the essentially conservative nature of organized labor has kept it from getting with the program.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s shortsightedness is most evident in its public posture on foreign trade, as events last week in Seattle underlined. Most economists agree that freer trade benefits almost everyone almost everywhere, from prosperous America to impoverished Bangladesh. But unions don't much like trade. The United Steelworkers, for example, has fought to suppress imports of low-cost foreign steel, even though doing so won't save America's doddering unionized steel giants from smaller domestic competitors. Indeed, trade barriers are much more likely to destroy jobs in industries that depend on cheap steel than to preserve them at the steel mill.
Organized labor also has an image problem. To many professionals, the word "union" implies enshrined mediocrity, indifference to customers and a closed shop, if not a closed mind. And corruption scandals haven't helped.
Yet workers do seem to benefit from the countervailing power of a union, which makes it all the more imperative that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor organizations re-examine their mission and the attitudes that have made them as relevant as calligraphy to the emerging American economy.
First, unions need to act as advocates for all workers, not just the handful they happen to represent. That means changing their attitudes toward trade and technology. But it also means pushing harder for universal health insurance and other programs to help the poorest workers close the wage gap (thinking of medical coverage as a form of income) and equalize an economic burden that now falls disproportionately on the bigger corporations that can afford to pay union wages and benefits.
Second, unions should cheerfully help their members move onward and upward in life. They should sponsor training, help finance college tuition and use their large memberships to negotiate breaks on mortgage fees and other benefits. A few already do some of these things on the side; they need to be central goals.
Third, unions need to help workers become owners. Instead of just negotiating raises, they should be pushing to get stock options for workers like the ones that enrich chief executives in quantities that unions love to get upset about. Every working stiff knows that toiling for wages alone is ultimately a sucker's game.
We started with a brain teaser, so let's finish with one: What proportion of American adults own stocks? The answer is half, several times the prevalence of union membership and up from just 1 in 10 in 1965. In fact, stocks are now the largest asset families own, exceeding even home equity.
Think of how fast Marx and Engels must be spinning in their graves: At a time when organized labor is evaporating from American work life, more American workers than ever own the means of production.
The trick will be persuading them that they ought to own a union card as well.

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE;
Is The Fur Still Flying?

BYLINE: By Alex Witchel 

 BODY:
I HAVE never worn fur. Maybe because my mother did. The women of her generation got mink coats from their husbands as door prizes for surviving the perils of car-pooling and keeping the dinners warm. And it didn't hurt that the neighbors would see that business was good.
Once acquired, the mink had a privileged existence. It went only to the best places -- the opera, the ballet, the bar mitzvah -- and it was always accompanied by "the pearls." Summers, when I went to camp, the mink went to cold storage. 
 In the last 10 years, of course, furs fell out of favor. Between the recession and the animal rights protesters, no one was buying. Celebrities posed for ads saying they'd rather be naked than wear fur, and women who did wear it were terrorized by threats of spray paint. If I had even a thought of joining the ranks of glamorous career girls a la Doris Day in "That Touch of Mink," it vanished. Who needed such aggravation over a coat?
Now suddenly, the country is suffering from a case of good old American amnesia. Problem with fur? What problem with fur? Many top designers are using it, and while the fashion industry is used to turning on a dime, what about the rest of us? A few years ago, people were lining their peacoats with the furs women had dumped at flea markets. Like lingerie, the attraction was that you would wear it, but only you would know. Now, fur is no longer immoral. It's not even crassly nouveau. It seems no more of a fashion faux pas than leg warmers. Why?
One reason, naturally, is the raging economy. With extra money to spend, why not pamper yourself with the ultimate luxury? Another reason is a definite backlash to the over-the-top tactics of the antifur zealots, (throwing a dead raccoon onto Anna Wintour's plate at the Four Seasons was a low point). But somehow, the return of fur, which started haltingly last season with trims and accessories, has morphed to full-blown fashion layouts in magazines showing big coats for big money.
And no one can keep it in stock -- not just the coats, but vests, jackets, pocketbooks, even headbands.
I recently visited three designers who loaned me different fur pieces reflecting the new casual chic attitude. For once, I would actually be in fashion.
Lisa Pomerantz, director of public relations at Celine, for which Michael Kors is the designer, greeted me wearing rabbit slippers. "Our rabbit vests are $1,275, and we sold out of them in one day," she said animatedly. "Michael did mink vests for $9,000, which were also gone in a day. Our mink-lined shearling coats sold out, too."
"It's not your mom's mink anymore," Ms. Pomerantz continued. "People want to wear fur in a more interesting way. The taboo has disappeared. People are tired of Big Brother. This year, it seems the more outrageous, luxurious and impractical the piece, the more it sells."
I left Celine with Ms. Pomerantz's own rabbit vest, a swirl of white, gray and tan, which is the trendiest item of the fur trend. She instructed me to wear it with a black sweater and pants to show it off to best advantage, and I did -- to the office, then to the Russian Tea Room. "Early Sonny Bono," one co-worker offered as fashion commentary. I felt more like Fred Flintstone, a little too bulky and masculine for my taste. By dinnertime, my clothes were covered with bunny hairs. My eyes itched and there were red marks on my face. I was allergic to the vest! Never mind. I'll be trendy in my next life.
At Tuleh, an upscale line sold at Neiman Marcus and Jeffrey, Josh Patner, who owns the company with Bryan Bradley, said: "Ours is a decadent collection, and the excess and frivolity of fur is a big part of the way our customer dresses. We used it this season in baseball jackets with cashmere sleeves, and we even sold out our samples.
"We don't treat fur as precious and heirloomy. Our remedy is to wear your fur all day long, to pick up the kids and the dry cleaning. You only have one life to live."
I left Tuleh with a dark burgundy sheared-mink bomber jacket that sells for $4,600. The sleeves were too long, but over my sweat pants and T-shirt, it looked fine. No one looked twice. The bunny vest, at least, was a statement. This was so understated it didn't even look like fur.
It acted like fur, though. It kept me so warm (the unseasonal weather recently has not been fur friendly) that once I landed on the pre-Thanksgiving day line at Citarella, I had to take it off. Mindful of protecting the fur, which felt softer than feathers, I turned the jacket inside out, and that's what caught people's eyes. The lining was gorgeous -- maroon satin with ruffles sewn along the collar. Once I made it inside the store, I put the jacket back on in self-defense. People were clambering for stuffing samples, and I could just see a dollop landing on my loaner. Mr. Patner's "one life to live" theory does not go far in the face of free food.
My final stop was J. Mendel on Madison Avenue. Gilles Mendel, the owner and designer, is the fifth generation of his family to run the company, whose original store is on the Rue St.-Honore in Paris. In October, he opened a boutique in Bergdorf Goodman. Mr. Mendel says that in his first six weeks there, he sold more fur than the store sold in its entire season last year.
Mr. Mendel specializes in Legend mink, which is the finest available, and he does not subscribe to the idea that fur should become a mundane purchase. "When you buy it, it's an event," he insisted. "A special product shouldn't be high volume."
He handed me a coat -- not a mommy coat -- but one with a more modern cut, slightly fitted and shorter. I put it on over my sweat pants, and voila! If I didn't look like a million bucks, I looked every penny of the $11,000 the coat cost. It was fabulous. Light, warm, shiny, elegant and stylish all at once. I started grinning.
"This year, there is a complete revolution in the fur business," Mr. Mendel said. "Sonia Rykiel and Thierry Mugler were against fur, now they're for it. I think people are tired of being told what to do. The extreme position that PETA takes is hard to understand," he added, referring to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. "But in America, everything goes to extremes. Americans are followers."
When I left J. Mendel, I walked along Madison Avenue and drew some admiring glances from other women. I should say, in all my fur-wearing adventures -- vest, jacket and coat -- I never got a second look from a man. Until the fur came off.
Two nights later I wore the coat to the theater even though it was 61 degrees. As my husband and I looked for a cab, it started to rain. I had no umbrella.
"Are we liable for that coat?" he yelled. I thought I would faint. I took it off and folded it under my arms, panicked. But no, it was fine. I, on the other hand, was soaked.
At the theater, the air-conditioning was on, I was still damp and I was freezing. Aah! The coat was a godsend. I never took it off even during intermission. I got some quizzical looks because of the temperature and one or two smirks from people who must have thought I was showing off, but I felt cocooned in luxury and absolutely nothing could ruin that for me.
I also wore the mink to an Indian buffet lunch, where I worried that it would smell like curry when I left (it didn't). Afterward, I walked 20 blocks up Broadway, reveling in the lushness of it. Face it, I thought. You have fallen madly, unabashedly in love -- with a coat.
Well, eventually the clock struck midnight. The coat went back. I petted it. I bid it farewell.
What I didn't do was call my mother. After years of making fun of her suburban trophy coat, I knew the last thing I would get was sympathy. She would instead reward me with four of every mother's favorite words in the English language: "I told you so."
Maybe it's time to start car-pooling.

HEADLINE: In the Glare of Baubles, Bangles, Bonuses

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL 

 BODY:
IT'S the holiday gift-buying season, of course. But at Harry Winston, where a simple bauble like a diamond pendant necklace costs $50,000, what is more important is that this is Wall Street's bonus-paying season. Investment bankers and hedge-fund managers receive the bulk of their yearly compensation in a lump sum, and so much money showing up in a bank account overnight can put one in the mood to spend spend spend.
At least, that was the hope at Harry Winston, the Fifth Avenue jeweler, which last week packed up a large selection of diamond-encrusted watches, five-carat engagement rings and $175,000 princess necklaces, like the one Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the Oscars in March, and took them to Bayard's, a restaurant in the downtown financial district. 
 Traditionally during bonus season, which runs from November through March, depending on when companies end their fiscal years, certain sectors of the New York economy -- from exotic cars to Hamptons summer rentals -- experience a sales surge. But never before, it seems, had any merchant so directly targeted Wall Street's bonus babies. Several hundred of them received engraved invitations to Bayard's over three nights for cocktails, hors d'oeuvres and an informal viewing of "the Harry Winston millennium collection." It was a case of bringing the mountain to Muhammad.
They were not just any bonus babies, either. The jewelry store specifically invited young, single Wall Streeters, primarily men, on the theory that they are sufficiently liquid to splurge on jewelry to please a friend, a fiancee or even Mom.
"The idea was to go for that group of six- and seven-figure bachelors," said Carol Brodie Gelles, the managing director of communications for Harry Winston, who put the event together.
Ms. Gelles spent many hours ferreting out the names of the newly rich for her guest list, speaking to friends like Pamela Gross, a co-founder of LuxuryFinder.com, an e-commerce site, which ended up co-sponsoring the event. She also drew on W. Randall Jones, the founder of Worth magazine, for a list of Mini-Masters of the Universe. But her networking was mostly among women. She asked whom they knew who'd recently been promoted to managing director of an investment bank, or made partner, or whose firm had gone public in 1999.
"You needed to be somebody who could afford to shop at Harry Winston," Ms. Gelles said. "It wouldn't be appropriate for someone who wasn't making $300,000 or $400,000. I went through their girlfriends or wives, so we didn't have to say, 'Do you get it?' The girls all get it."
One who got it was Rebecca Shalam, who'd chosen her wedding band at Harry Winston this year. Her husband, Ari Shalam, 29, is a graduate of the Wharton School and Harvard Business School, and Ms. Shalam was able to suggest dozens of his classmates for the invitation list for Tuesday night, including nearly 60 employees of Goldman, Sachs. Thanks to the double payoff of year-end bonuses and the company's initial public offering of stock in May, Ms. Shalam's Goldman friends are doing "frighteningly well," she said.
"We've known three or four people who have gone public with Internet startups this year," she said. "A couple of friends have started hedge funds and raised $60 or $70 million. Everyone is under 31. The investment bankers, it seems to me they're making after one year the money people used to make after three or four years." She named a figure of $750,000. (The total bonuses paid by the financial industry are expected to exceed last year's record $9.9 billion, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall says.)
Ms. Shalam arrived early on Tuesday evening at Bayard's, which is at 1 Hanover Square in a resplendently remodeled brownstone. By day the building, India House, is a private club, but in the evenings the year-old restaurant, which is all mahogany and nautical memorabilia, is open to the public.
The first guests were invited for 5 p.m., shockingly early for a cocktail party elsewhere in town, but appropriate for Wall Street, where the market closes at 4:30. Jewelry was displayed in a first-floor party room, on long tables cordoned off by security ropes (guests could lean over and ask to be shown a piece), or dangling from the necks, ears and wrists of models (even more inaccessible).
As trays of oysters and other canapes were passed and the room filled, Mr. Shalam, who works for Audiovox, an electronics company founded by his father, chatted with a group of friends from Harvard and Wharton. All in all, they seemed far less interested in jewelry shopping than in freshening old school connections. "Karin, this is John," Mr. Shalam said, introducing Karin Klein to John Troiano, who works for a leveraged buyout firm.
"Where do you work?" Mr. Troiano asked her. She named a private equity firm. Ms. Klein, in her mid-20's, had come with a younger sister, Jennifer Klein, who works at a hedge fund. They were grateful simply to have carved out time for socializing from their work schedules, never mind the gems on display. "The problem is," Karin Klein said, "we need to spend less time in the office and more time at things like this, so there'll be someone to give me these kinds of things."
Gary Millin joined the circle, dropping by from the offices at 11 Broadway of the Internet company he co-founded, Mail.com, where 250 people now work. Mail.com's I.P.O. in June has made Mr. Millin, 30, worth $26 million.
He was the only coatless man in the room but had put on a fresh tattersall shirt open at the neck. "I got dressed up," he announced. He looked bleary-eyed. "I'm the only one going back to the office after this party," he said.
A young woman hovering on the edge of the circle said in a whispered aside, "He also happens to be one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in New York." She wasn't referring to his looks (pleasant enough).
Over at the velvet rope, Ms. Shalam was being shown a watch by a Winston salesman, who described it in a metronomic cadence: "It has a blue enamel face with diamonds on the bezel. It's rectangular, with a very fine pink leather band. It's $12,500."
Ms. Shalam, who is due to give birth in May, said she hoped to buy it as a baby gift to herself. "If it's a boy, I'll have a blue band," she said.
In all, the tally of sales made on Tuesday night included three watches -- one bought for $44,000 by a woman for herself -- a pair of pearl and diamond earrings and a "suite" of matching earrings and a necklace. A half-dozen items were put on hold by customers who said they intended to look at them again at the store.
Despite the small number of items actually bought, Ms. Gelles pronounced Harry Winston's trip downtown, its first ever, "a huge success," explaining that in the ultra-luxury business, many sales aren't closed until months after a customer first inspects the goods. The store estimated it could ultimately make $2.5 million worth of sales to customers whose interest it piqued over the three nights at Bayard's.
"We won't see the full results of this exercise for at least a year," Ms. Gelles said. "We met many single men in the range where they're likely to get engaged, and maybe the guy who got a watch will be back to get his engagement ring. Getting these Wall Streeters when they're 29, that relationship will last until they're 80."
Or at least, until a market wipeout.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Mazda MPV;
'Me, Too,' Said the Little Japanese Van

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
MANY Americans say they dislike conformity, but when it comes to minivans, sameness sells.
Through their purchase decisions, van owners have sent a clear message to automakers: Stick to the familiar family recipe. Buyers want a conservative look that doesn't stand out in the school parking lot. They prefer front-wheel drive. They insist on four doors -- two sliding doors in the back -- and plenty of convenient cup holders. They like flexible seating, lots of nooks and crannies for storage and ample cargo capacity.
 Those who tried other formulas quickly learned a lesson. Smaller rear-drive, truck-based vans from General Motors and Ford never caught on. Then G.M. brought out front-drive vans with a Dustbuster shape; they sold poorly. Finally, it developed conservatively styled minivans, and they have done much better. At Ford, a second version of the front-drive Windstar, with a second sliding door, has also sold well. 
 The Jetsons-style Toyota Previa never had more than a cult following, but its successor, the simple, straightforward Sienna, is selling briskly. The Honda Odyssey started as a quirky, compact van with four hinged doors, but the second-generation Odyssey, a larger van with a conventional design, has been an unqualified hit.
Now it is the turn of Mazda, which has ditched its old MPV and brought out an all-new van with the same old name.
In fact, the previous MPV was the most successful of the minivans at being different. Introduced as a 1989 model, Mazda's first van for the American market was small but won praise for its spirited acceleration, its agility around corners and its maneuverability in parking lots. Although it had rear drive, the MPV offered a four-wheel-drive option, making it a good choice for snowy climates or for towing. It had a single, hinged door for rear passengers.
With Mazda in a financial crisis, the MPV got only a cosmetic makeover in 1996. A second hinged door was added to the driver's side, and an All-Sport package gave the van the rugged look of a sport utility. But little changed under the skin.
Now, with Mazda effectively under the control of Ford, the Japanese company is playing catch-up by offering a completely fresh MPV with new front-wheel-drive architecture. The 2000 MPV remains rather small. About the size of short-wheelbase vans from Chrysler and G.M. -- most consumers prefer the longer versions -- it is slightly shorter and narrower than two of the smallest vans in this country, the Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest. Mazda is pitching the MPV as "smart sized," but I suspect that it is too small for many families -- especially those in suburban and rural areas who tend to drive bigger vans.
Still, the MPV may be just right for small families that don't take a lot of long trips, or that live in congested areas where ease of maneuvering and parking is crucial.
 The new MPV's exterior styling will blend in nicely with the minivan crowd. The van now has two rear sliding doors as standard equipment. While the manually operated sliding doors worked well -- my 7-year-old son could open and close them just fine -- I missed having power-operated sliders that open or close by remote. That feature, one that has become increasingly common on vans, is not available on the MPV.
Inside, despite its rather small dimensions, the MPV doesn't feel cramped. The space is well used.
 Even the least expensive trim level, the DX, comes with air-conditioning, a tilt steering wheel and an audio system with a CD player. The midlevel LX adds power front and rear windows, power locks, heated power mirrors and privacy glass. The top-line ES has an alarm system, remote locking, leather seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, wood-grain trim, a nine-speaker sound system and front-seat side air bags. Anti-lock brakes are optional.
Front passengers have nine built-in storage compartments, including an overhead console, a glove box, a storage tray under the front passenger's seat, front door pockets, a coin box and a storage box that holds up to 12 CD's. The far rear also has storage compartments and a 12-volt power outlet. Separate climate controls can be ordered for rear passengers. The numerous cup holders can handle juice boxes, Big Gulps or water bottles.
 Though the MPV is relatively mainstream, it has some useful innovations, like windows on the rear sliding doors that actually roll down; on other vans, those windows are fixed in place.
Mazda has borrowed from Honda my favorite feature of the Odyssey: a third-row seat that magically folds into the floor. I find it nearly impossible to wrestle the bulky removable seats out of most minivans. And what if you find the trampoline that your daughter wants for Christmas? You have to drive home, take the seat out and return to the store to pick it up. With the Odyssey, and now with the MPV, I can single-handedly make the rear seat disappear into its footwell, creating a flat floor.
With the third-row seat upright, the deep footwell is a perfect place for grocery bags. Mazda offers another advantage: you can flip the third-row bench to the rear and use it for seating at picnics and tailgate parties.
 Another clever feature is borrowed from Ford minivans. The removable second-row seats allow you to create two captain's chairs with a demilitarized zone in between, or you can slide them together to create a bench. The bench also slides forward for more cargo space (or more legroom for passengers in the extreme rear), or it slides backward for more legroom in the second row. The second-row seats also recline, they flip forward to add cargo space and they can be removed. I could easily lift the seats (37 pounds each) out of the vehicle.
 The MPV is powered by a 2.5-liter V6 from the Mazda 626. Rated at 170 horsepower, it is among the least potent power plants in any minivan. While the test vehicle was adequate for around-town driving on Michigan's flat roads, it struggled as I tried to merge into fast freeway traffic, and I suspect it would quickly get winded in the mountains. The engine is coupled with a four-speed automatic transmission that was anything but smooth. Every gear shift felt and sounded like a major event.
The MPV still handles quite nimbly, by minivan standards, and its small size makes it easy to maneuver into tight spots.
The MPV competes most directly in size and engine power with the Villager and Quest. But its price is notably lower. Although my ES test vehicle, with just about every option, had a sticker of $27,730, the MPV starts around $20,000 -- about $3,000 less than a Villager.
 That is relatively reasonable, and with useful features like the folding third-row seat and roll-down rear windows, the MPV would be my pick of the small minivans. There is just one problem, though: Who wants a small minivan?
 
INSIDE TRACK: And now, for something completely familiar.

HEADLINE: Alter Egos Who Put the 'R' in R.S.V.P.

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI 

 BODY:
SEATED at her mahogany desk on the fifth floor of a town house on Sutton Square, surrounded by prints of thoroughbred horses, Meredith Palinjuggled the details of a busy life spent between homes in Manhattan, Southampton and Lyford Cay, in the Bahamas. Not her life, her employer's.
First, the Southampton housekeeper called to say the Christmas lights might need to be replaced before she and the handyman came to the city to decorate the Manhattan house for the holidays. Then there was a large box sitting on the desk that someone on the household staff had wrapped without noting who it was for. And the four phone lines were ringing with people R.S.V.P.-ing to one of two Christmas parties. 
 "It's tricky," said Ms. Palin, pulling out two lists from a desk drawer. "I have to make sure I put everyone on the right one."
Five days a week, eight hours a day, Ms. Palin works as a social secretary to Sandra McConnell, the lady of the house, whose late husband, Neil A. McConnell, was an heir to the Avon fortune. Mrs. McConnell is well known in Park Avenue circles for giving dinner parties, traveling the world, raising money for charity and just being, well, social.
As the uptown black-tie calendar opens to the busiest week of the year, Mrs. McConnell depends on Ms. Palin to make sure she hasn't responded to too many parties (three a night is her limit), to buy Christmas cards and gifts, to pay household bills, to return unwanted purchases and to make sure anyone she invites to lunch is reminded of the date in writing.
"I couldn't live the way I do without Meredith," said Mrs. McConnell, who this week plans to attend a Christie's auction for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, several private cocktail parties, a lunch at Harry Cipriani and a tree-lighting party at Brick Church.
She is not alone. As the lives of the ladies on the lunch circuit become ever busier, thanks to a booming economy and an abounding number of successful husbands who encourage their wives to circulate socially, the social secretary has returned from the musty Edith Wharton past to become a downright trendy staff member in the houses of the hugely rich.
Ricky Lauren has a social secretary. So do Nina Griscom, Audrey Gruss, Cathy Hilton, Carol Mack and Alison Stern. Ronald O. Perelman was one of the few men to have one, recalled the woman who once had the job, which at one point entailed visiting St. Barts ahead of Mr. Perelman to make sure he was on the guest lists for all the hot parties and would be seated at the No. 1 tables at restaurants. She asked not to be named, citing a confidentiality agreement. Mr. Perelman declined to comment.
"It's like having a wife," said Stephanie Stokes, a longtime decorator on the Upper East Side, who does not have a social secretary but has noticed that more of her friends do. "I think it's the only way that some of my friends could accomplish what they accomplish, by having a social secretary who books everything for them, their children and their husband," she said. Now, almost all lunch and dinner dates are made by social secretaries, she said, so she never talks to friends until she sees them in person. "No one wants to spend 10 minutes chatting just to arrange a lunch," she added.
Ann Rapp, an art consultant who divides her time between New York and Paris, said: "It's the 'in' thing now more than ever. For many of the newer set, it's about status and image. In many cases, it's imagined self-importance."
Maitres d'hotel at restaurants on the East Side report women use social secretaries the way their husbands use executive secretaries in their offices, to make reservations so they don't have to call themselves. Peter Geraghty, the manager of Swifty's, said the secretaries just mention their own first names and the number in the party. The same at La Goulue, said Sylvia Teisseire, a hostess there. It's confusing when they say " 'It's Audrey, for three,' " she said, adding, "I can't always remember who Audrey works for."
Marjane Kaswan, the owner of the 10-year-old Bouvier Agency, whose sole business is placing social secretaries, said, "I've never been busier." (The agency is named after a breed of dog Ms. Kaswan once owned.)
Similarly, Clifford Greenhouse, an owner of the Pavillion Agency, which places high-end household help, said that "there was an explosion of requests" in the last year for social secretaries.
"Men are sick of their wives asking their own personal assistants to address Christmas cards or hire a maid," he said. The assistants "find it demeaning and threaten to quit, so the husbands ask me to get their wives a social secretary."
Social secretaries are not to be confused with personal assistants or executive secretaries, who work in the business world. Social secretaries work from their employers' homes, generally for a woman who doesn't hold a full-time job (or any job, for that matter, other than socializing), and while they must be willing to write invitations and shop, their most important skill is the tact and decorum needed in the oh-so-perilous shoals of social life -- a skill their employers are sometimes lacking in.
"If you make a mistake, if you miss the social graces, you are pegged like your shoes would be at the club," said R. Couri Hay, the society editor of Ocean Drive's Palm Beach magazine. "The proper social secretary steers you through the tricky waters."
Many women who could well afford a social secretary recoil in horror at the personal helplessness it implies. Kathy Greenberg, whose husband, Alan Greenberg, is the chairman of the Bear Stearns Companies, hired a social secretary recently but let her go after a month, finding the whole concept silly. "It took more time for me to show her how to do things" than to do it herself, she said.
"My husband answers his own phone at work and writes his own letters, and so do I," she said. Her distaste was multiplied when she received a thank-you note supposedly from a friend but actually written by a social secretary who had misspelled her employer's own name.
Finding a well-qualified social secretary can be tricky, virtually everyone says. Although a few agencies place them, most are hired by word of mouth. Many seem to have grown up on the fringes of the rich -- private schools, a well-heeled neighborhood -- but never to have been rich themselves. One former social secretary put it this way: "They try to find someone with their lifestyle and taste -- but poor. Nice manners, that's the key. And discreet, discreet, discreet."
The description people give now for an ideal social secretary is not much different from the one W. Somerset Maugham gave of his character Miss Keith, the social secretary to the Princess Novemali, the wealthy American widow who marries a Roman prince, in his 1944 novel, "The Razor's Edge."
"She was a middle-aged Scotch woman, called Miss Keith," Maugham wrote, "with sandy hair, a freckled face, pince-nez and an air of determined virginity."
Mr. Greenhouse of the Pavillion Agency described social secretaries, who earn $40,000 to $160,000 a year, as "very preppy, attractive but not flashy, very well manicured but seldom wearing nail polish that's not clear." In the United States, the job has traditionally been held by women, although now, Mr. Greenhouse said, "I'm placing some wonderful gay gentlemen."
"Knowing proper etiquette is a given, and they should not care about being involved in their employer's world," he added.
When one does cross the line and aspire to the beau monde, there can be trouble. Michele Herbert, a Park Avenue social figure active in raising money for Alzheimer's research, fired her social secretary two months ago because, she said, "I had someone who wanted to be out there."
Ms. Herbert, whose husband, Lawrence Herbert, is the chief executive of Pantone Inc., which develops colors and graphics for the fashion industry, added: "That doesn't work for me. If I was holding a big dinner party, they wanted to be part of it, they wanted to be there."
But the biggest sin of all for a social secretary is to end up married to her employer's husband. The late Charles R. Lachman, a co-founder of Revlon, married Jaquine de Rochambeau, who was the social secretary to his third wife, Rita Lachman. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, though he never left Eleanor, had a liaison with Lucy Page Mercer, his wife's social secretary. And the late novelist Harold Robbins ran off with Jann Stapp, the social secretary to his fifth wife, Grace Robbins, and made her his sixth wife on Valentine's Day, 1992.
Grace Robbins, who had been married to her husband for 28 years, offered words of caution to today's ladies of the house: "Social secretaries get to know everything about you. You shouldn't let that happen. You shouldn't give her any of your clothes, and you shouldn't tell her the name of your plastic surgeon. What you'll have is an 'All About Eve' situation."
Ms. Robbins, who is writing a book titled "Cinderella and the Carpetbagger," a memoir about her life with Harold Robbins, said this of her social secretary: "She was very helpful to me and then helped herself to everything I had."
Judy Green insists that could never happen to her and her social secretary of 15 years, Marina Lakner, even though she describes Ms. Lakner as an "alter ego" and called her "a little me."
The brunette Ms. Lakner and the the blond Ms. Green, a novelist whose late husband owned the Cleve Pak Corporation, which specialized in paper packaging, don't particularly seem alike, at first glance. But after spending time with them, one finds many similarities. Ms. Lakner dresses like her employer, in a chic but conservative style, and both women share some mannerisms. "I represent Mrs. Green, so I must be dressed," Ms. Lakner said, absently twisting her Cartier watch on a brown alligator band. "You can never make a first impression twice."
One morning a few weeks ago, Ms. Lakner, who studied art and architecture at the Parsons School of Design, spoke of her job in the chintz-filled den of Ms. Green's Park Avenue apartment. "How do I descibe this?" she said, "I operate command central. I'm the hub. I feel like the control tower."
Most people who know Ms. Green know and love Ms. Lakner. They praise her handwritten place cards, invitations and reminder notes, a skill refined in private calligraphy classes. The one thing she does not write is Ms. Green's thank-you notes; that would be a faux pas.
A chief role for Ms. Lakner is to shield her employer from some of the everyday unpleasantries of human interaction. "I can't stand to break dates," Ms. Green admitted. "I have Marina close her door," she said, so she doesn't have to hear the dirty deed being done on the phone.
Ms. Green said she also has her social secretary deal with requests for money from distant relatives, visit her mother (not instead of her, but in addition to her) and arrange lunches. "Who wants to be bothered with all that stuff -- bills, insurance, addressing invitations, chatting endlessly with your friends?" Ms. Green said. "Marina does all the things I don't want to do."
Apparently, Ms. Green's friends don't begrudge her her dislike of idle chatter, because her lavish parties, some for celebrities and authors, are always well attended. Usually, Ms. Lakner greets guests in the lobby while they are checking their coats.
"I'll say, 'Hello Mr. Hayden-Guest,' " Ms. Lakner said, "and he'll say, 'How did you know my name?' They like that recognition. They may not be the people in People magazine, but I see that glitter in their eye on recognition."
Just then the phone rang, and Ms. Green left the den to take the call. When she returned she announced that the decorator Mario Buatta had been on the line and instructed her to "stop the interview." She reported what he had said: "Judy, don't do it. Marina will get a swelled head, a lot of offers, and you'll lose her. Seriously, don't let her do this."
Ms. Lakner shook her head and said, "That could never happen."
Ms. Green, fluffing her hair before an 80-woman lunch at Daniel, had one last thought about her social secretary: "If she could only do hair, I'd give her a huge raise."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Examining Nuts and Bolts In an Age of Rocketry

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
EVEN in this stock market, which continues to break all records, nothing quite compares to the history being made in the market for initial public offerings. The buckets of money pouring into fledgling companies' shares and the delirium that surrounds new-issue trading today have never been seen before.
This year, according to Sanford Bernstein & Company, capital raised in initial offerings will total more than $75 billion. That is roughly equal to the amount raised in new stock issues during all of the 1980's. 
 Monster moves in these stocks on their first day public are also breaking records. From 1986 to 1994, the average first-day move in an initial offering was about 10 percent. Today, the average stock rises 60 percent on its first day.
Many of these hot new issues are Internet concerns that operate in a sphere all their own: About one-third of those that issued shares this year paid more in investment banking fees than they booked in revenue in the most recent 12 months.
Even old-economy I.P.O.'s rise sharply today. First-day gains on all initial offerings have totaled $29 billion this year, more than the gross domestic product of Bolivia.
That is a hefty chunk of change for issuers to leave on the table. Many companies don't seem to mind; they like the buzz generated by a rocketing stock price and the investors who pile into the shares after they pop.
Nevertheless, all is not well in I.P.O. land. Steve Galbraith, the senior research analyst at Bernstein who compiled these stunning figures, says issuers and institutional investors are growing unhappy with the new-issue machinery. Many players see the big initial run-ups in these stocks as benefiting a few investors -- the lucky fund managers who get allotments in exchange for conducting fast and furious stock trading with the underwriting firm -- at the expense of the many. Big investors are restless, Mr. Galbraith says; he forecasts a change in the way I.P.O.s are issued.
For example, institutional investors, unhappy with small I.P.O. allocations, may demand more Dutch auctions, in which investors put in their bids and get allotments based on supply and demand, the same way most United States Treasury bonds are sold.
And some issuers, eager to pocket more of those first-day gains, wonder what services the investment bankers provide for their sky-high fees. Sure, bankers line up buyers when most investors are cool to initial offerings. But when the market is incendiary, as it is now, such support is unnecessary.
Some small firms have tried to change the business. But while other parts of Wall Street undergo transformation, most initial offerings are still done the old-fashioned way: with high fees and allocations to favored investors. While fees charged to debt issuers have plunged in the past decade, those charged to equity issuers have stayed remarkably high -- about 4 percent of the deal.
This cannot last. Mr. Galbraith thinks the investment banking powerhouses Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch are most vulnerable to change and the lower underwriting fees it would bring. "You don't need to prop up these stocks; you need to open them up," he said. "The market is determining the price of these companies, and the issuer shouldn't have to pay as much for that."

Messinger's Out of Politics, but Politics Aren't Out of Her

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
Last Tuesday evening, in the middle of teaching a class about city government at the Hunter College School of Social Work, Ruth Messinger indulged in a fleeting self-reference.
She and her students were discussing current events when she noted that while Hillary Rodham Clinton had pledged to serve a full term if elected to the United States Senate, her presumed opponent, Mayor Giuliani, had not. 
 "Then again, Giuliani didn't announce in '97 that he would serve out the whole term as Mayor," Ms. Messinger recalled. "And you may have noticed it didn't hurt him."
She was referring to the Mayor's 1997 re-election with 57 percent of the vote against 41 percent for her.
That said, it was time to change the subject, which Ms. Messinger does frequently, especially when the subject is career setbacks of historic proportions.
She begins each class by presiding like the host of a television talk show devoted to politics. With her students playing pundits, they run through the week's big stories, such as the timing and repercussions of Ms. Clinton's announcement that she intended to run for the Senate. Ms. Messinger said the First Lady's action was partly designed to dispel the hoary notion that women had difficulty making up their minds; the class, which consisted mostly of women, seemed to agree.
As for the surcharge on collect calls from New York State prisons that is collected by Sprint and shared with the Department of Corrections, Ms. Messinger observed that "if the government were not involved, this would be called a kickback." And on the man who attacked Nicole Barrett with a paving stone, she said, "I'm just waiting to find out if the person was really homeless or not." (Subsequently, the police arrested a suspect who apparently has spent some time on the streets.)
After concluding her term as Manhattan Borough President in January 1998, Ms. Messinger was unemployed until August of that year. "I didn't like it at all," she said.
She has worked since then as the president and executive director of the American Jewish World Service, a nonprofit agency that assists developing nations. In January she expects to fly to Turkey to inspect the agency's earthquake relief program. She also teaches a night course in urban studies at Queens College.
For the semester's last class, which meets this week, Ms. Messinger's Hunter College students are assigned a paper on a social service policy they would change and how they would do so.
One student, Iris Bishop, a training specialist at the Administration for Children's Services, said after class that the assignment reflected Ms. Messinger's pedagogical agenda.
"She wants us to realize that there's always something that can be done about an issue," Ms. Bishop said. "It's all about how to play the game politically." JIM O'GRADY

Selling to Argentina (As Translated From the French)

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: LA PLATA, Argentina

 BODY:
WHEN Wal-Mart opened its first store in Argentina four years ago, it found itself cast in the unaccustomed role of David -- against a Goliath of a competitor in Carrefour, the French general merchandise chain. And finding a slingshot has been anything but easy.
Carrefour's position here is formidable. Argentine shoppers have long felt at home in its stores, much as they historically have taken to other French trends and fashions. Argentine painters, architects and psychologists have all taken cues from France. Even the tango was only fully accepted by polite Argentine society after it became a hit in post-World War I Paris. Carrefour has been so readily accepted here since it arrived in 1982 that it is now the country's largest retailer. 
 Still, Wal-Mart executives felt that if Carrefour's fleur-de-lis logo could catch on in the Francophile Argentina of the 1980's, the yellow Wal-Mart smiley face could do the same when the cultural winds here seemed to be blowing America's way. Globalization, and with it American cultural influences, swept through the country in the early 1990's, and by 1995 Argentines were beginning to dress more casually, drink more beer and less wine, and even acquire a taste for jazz and the blues. And English was replacing French as the primary foreign language taught in schools.
So with typical Yankee can-do confidence -- some would call it arrogance -- Wal-Mart entered the Argentine market with a team of American managers and the same basic store model that worked from Des Moines to Dallas.
The meat counters featured American cuts like T-bone steaks, not the rib strips and tail rumps that Argentines prefer. Cosmetics counters were filled with bright-colored rouge and lipstick, though Argentine women tend to like a softer, more natural look. And jewelry displays gave prominent placement to emeralds, sapphires and diamonds, while most women here prefer wearing gold and silver.
The first few stores even had hardware departments full of tools and appliances wired for 110-volt electric power; the standard throughout Argentina is 220.
But the miscalculations went beyond the merchandise mix, and all the way to the widths of store aisles and the carpeting on the floor. Only by trial and error did Wal-Mart learn that far more Argentine customers than Americans were in the habit of stopping at a store each day. The much greater traffic meant more sales of small items, but also aisles that always seemed overcrowded and floors that always seemed dirty and wore out rapidly.
In entering Argentina, Carrefour had kept its Frenchness fairly subtle, At Wal-Mart, however, it soon became clear that the Americanness was too obvious, and counterproductive. Wal-Mart will not divulge any sales or income figures for its Argentine operations, but analysts here and on Wall Street say the company racked up huge losses in its first few years in Argentina and only began to break even, or perhaps turn a small profit, last year.
Credit Suisse First Boston estimated last year that Wal-Mart's sales in Argentina were running about $500 million a year, less than a quarter of Carrefour's. Carrefour has 23 big stores in Argentina, while Wal-Mart has 10, plus 3 warehouse membership clubs.
And Wal-Mart has overhauled its top management in Argentina four times in four years.
"Wal-Mart seemed to be learning by doing, and that can be very expensive," said Martin Redrado, an Argentine economist. "Carrefour better understood from the beginning the local idiosyncrasies and managed its strategy around local conditions."
 Wal-Mart's current leadership here concedes the point. "Following our blueprint too closely wasn't a good idea," said Donald C. Bland, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart Argentina.
It is a lesson that Wal-Mart may well take from Argentina as it expands globally and finds itself toe-to-toe with Carrefour in more and more countries. They already compete fiercely in Brazil, Mexico and South Korea, and when Carrefour has finished acquiring the Primordes chain, it will be the second-largest general merchandise retailer in the world after Wal-Mart, but with more international experience.
BUT Wal-Mart seems to be learning, as can be seen here in La Plata, 50 miles southeast of Buenos Aires. The American chain competes with a Carrefour store just down the street for an essentially suburban, middle-class clientele; in only one other place in the world -- near Sao Paulo, Brazil -- are the two companies' stores so close to each other.
When Wal-Mart came to La Plata in July 1997, it avoided repeating many of its early mistakes.
The aisles were made wider than in the first few Buenos Aires stores, and the floor was scuff-resistant tile, not carpet. Metal displays for fish gave way to ceramic tile reminiscent of traditional Argentine fish markets. Wooden wine shelves with overhanging arbors replaced metal racks, a change that bolstered wine sales by 20 percent in other stores.
Tailoring its La Plata store to Argentine tastes meant glazing doughnuts with dulce de leche, a caramel-like confection. Clothing racks hold more articles in medium sizes and fewer in large sizes, because Argentines are on average a bit smaller than Americans and like a tighter fit.
"Let's call it the tropicalized Wal-Mart way," said Cristian Corsi, an Argentine Wal-Mart district manager, with a smile.
THE chain even adopted some French touches here and in the nine other main stores around the country, like big supplies of croissants in the bakery department and tripe in the meat aisle.
"They have adapted pretty well," said David Shriver, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "And they have stolen a lot of ideas from Carrefour."
Still, while Wal-Mart has made progress, on one recent Tuesday the Carrefour store here was decidedly busier all day, and shopping carts seemed to be piled higher. It is not obvious why. Customers interviewed in each store were divided over which was cleaner, had better prices or selection or gave better service. If competing cultural affinities are at war here, Argentine shoppers do not seem to notice -- at least not consciously; few said they thought of either store as being American or French. Both stores fly Argentine flags prominently.
But that does not mean the Wal-Mart and Carrefour stores don't say, in their own way, "Vive la difference." Carrefour's wine selection is much greater and its produce and fish displays more elaborate: piles of shrimp and lobsters look as pretty as a still life. The cheese counter is a small outpost of France, with neatly stacked Roquefort, Gruyere, Chamois d'Or and St. Albray.
At Wal-Mart, the selection of microwave ovens, gardening tools and golf supplies is larger, but the cheese section is decidedly less fragrant, with a heavier emphasis on fontina and provolone.
"American, French -- workers like me don't care about the country," said Hugo Felgueras, a 51-year-old livery driver, as he eyed Carrefour's cheeses. "We just care about our pockets and prices." Yet there he was with the French cheese. If his tastes don't change, Wal-Mart will probably stock more Gruyere.

HEADLINE: The Small-Screen City

BYLINE: By NANCY HASS

 BODY:
ON a recent fall night, a detective from the 15th Precinct ambled along a shabby street downtown. Passing beneath a street lamp, he glanced up for a moment. His face, a road map of despair, was sheathed in white light.
Cut. 
 From the shadows, an assistant director popped out. Why had no one cued the sound of a woman shouting out her window in Brooklynese? And where were those extras hired as passers-by, the girl with the nose ring, the three homeboys with the superbaggy jeans?
For that matter, where was New York itself? The scene, from the ABC drama "N.Y.P.D. Blue," did not take place on location, but on an elaborate blocklong set known familiarly as Mulberry Street, built years ago on a studio lot near Century City. The Emmy Award-winning cop show has been lauded for its evocation of New York grit, but it is entirely written, shot and produced in sunny California.
"I feel the show is emotionally expressive of the rhythms and textures of New York," said its co-creator, David Milch.
It may seem strange that a show like "N.Y.P.D. Blue," in which New York is almost a member of the cast, has no real connection to the city itself. But from a historical perspective, Mr. Milch's disclaimer makes perfect sense. It has been said -- even sung -- that New York is a state of mind. Nowhere is that more evident than on television.
Movies are expected to create their own reality, reinvent setting, elevate locales to cinematic art. But just the opposite is expected from the small screen. Television bills itself as a reflection of everyday life, not surprising for a product made too fast and too cheaply for elaborate photography. Add that network television aims to be as one-size-fits-all as possible, and the result is the bland everyburbs and generic urban wastelands many shows wallow in.
Thus it is all the more remarkable that New York is among the only places television has ever bothered to bring alive. From the Yiddish lilt of "The Goldbergs" in the 40's and the black-and-white melodrama of "Naked City" in the 50's to the baroque urban lexicon of "Seinfeld" and the couture-inspired swagger of "Sex and the City," no locale has been more exploited, deconstructed, parodied, toned down and gussied up, not to mention more culturally influential.
While critics have long attributed negative perceptions of the city to violent imagery on the evening news, an argument can be made for the influence of prime-time entertainment on popular views of New York.
"You have to wonder what's the cart and what's the horse," said David Marc, a professor of television studies at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, "if how we've seen New York portrayed in sitcoms and dramas over the years reflects reality at all or whether it's just Hollywood responding to what it thinks the public wants and then creating an image to suit its purposes."
On television, New York has largely been used as shorthand for the extremes of human experience. It has at various times been cast as a way station for weirdos and ethnics, a caldron of violence, a haven for swells.
"If you look back at the progression of shows, you get a pretty clear idea of what the industry was trying to avoid and what it figured was a good idea to promote," said Norman Lear, the creator of "All in the Family," the influential sitcom of the 1970's. "You don't really need a voice-over."
 
In the Late 90's, The Picture Comes Into Focus
Lately there have been so many images of New York in prime time -- more than at any time in history -- that a big, messy composite of a big, messy city has at last emerged. Since 1996, most of the top-rated sitcoms have been have been set in New York, and increasing numbers of hourlong dramas are situated here. While movie production has fallen off this year, television production is way up. Next season 14 shows will be made in New York, including 8 new ones.
The city seen on the small screen in the last few years is both a racy, crime-infected snake pit and a latter-day Holly Golightly carnival. It is a preposterously luxurious launching pad for young things reluctant to grow up ("Friends"), a stainless steel jungle for high-end crime ("Law and Order") and a place where even a tasteless woman from Queens can marry a millionaire ("The Nanny").
There have been several golden ages for shows set in New York, and this is definitely one of the most multidimensional, though one that often seems lined with fun house mirrors. The insecurities of the young marrieds on "Mad About You" were comfortably contained in a prewar apartment that people like them would be unlikely to own. The title character in "Felicity" has had an undergraduate education free of fluorescent dorm lighting. Bill Cosby's new neighborhood in Queens is a mixed-race wonderland many New Yorkers might consider closer to Brigadoon than Kew Gardens.
But at least the New York now on screen is, like the real thing, as unclassifiable as the legendary elephant that stumped the blind men. Tom Fontana, the creator of "Oz" and "Homicide" who is now shooting his new police series, "The Beat," on the Lower East Side, said the show would be much more nuanced than it would have been 10 years ago.
"Back then," he said, "it would have been much more bleak and murderous, more full of graffiti and drug deals."
The change can be traced to the mid-1990's. Two events mark it: the slide in the crime rate and the immense success of "Seinfeld," which had its premiere in 1990. That show disproved a sacred Hollywood belief: that a series about the neurotic foibles of distinctly Jewish single people in their 30's could never be a hit in Iowa.
With site-specific references like street-parking etiquette and the trauma of having a girlfriend move "away" to downtown, the show, which was made in Los Angeles, was a virtual comedy of manners about contemporary life in Manhattan. Like Noel Coward, it limned a rarefied slice of society but touched on universal experience. That approach might not have worked if its territory were Minneapolis, but, as NBC executives discovered, there was a bankable fascination with New York in the hinterlands.
More important, the growing sense that the city was hospitable, both to residents and to production companies, induced some influential people, like Michael J. Fox of "Spin City," not merely to set shows in New York but to shoot them in the city as well.
Although his series makes more of its star's unique charm than its locale, Mr. Fox said he works hard on touches like insisting that office interiors "have some New York grime" and incorporating real passers-by instead of extras into the outside scenes. He said he was adamant about creating the show around a scrappy New York political operative rather than a Beltway type.
"I've always thought that the early career successes I've had were based a lot on the fact that I was an Irish kid with a little Cagney punim who could pick up New York rhythms," Mr. Fox said.
Even more than the networks, HBO has pursued shows with a New York sensibility, and shoots them here. Three of the cable channel's four series are set and shot in and around New York -- "The Sopranos," "Oz" and "Sex and the City." Of all the New York shows on television, "Sex and the City," with its carefully chaotic street scenes, avant-garde fashions and minutely observed social rituals, may be the one that most fully taps into the city's current mood.
"There is a reason the girls on the show pretty much only have bedrooms," said Sarah Jessica Parker, who is both the star and an executive producer. "It's not just to suggest sex. It's to convey a stylized but real idea of what life is like for girls in New York. People here don't live in their kitchens. They negotiate life from their bedroom."
 
From the Lower East Side Via the Borscht Belt
Despite the dramatically different way New York was portrayed when the medium first started, some things are strangely the same. During the late 40's, television was as New York as Broadway. The creators were the children of immigrants, straight from the Lower East Side and the Borscht Belt. They wrote about what they knew, which made economic sense as well; most of the television sets were in big cities anyway.
"The Goldbergs," originally a radio show that ran on television from 1949 to 1953, was centered on Gertrude Berg's recollections of her large Bronx family. Most of the action took place as Mrs. Berg's character, Molly Goldberg, hung out the window of her tenement, gossiping with her neighbors. "The Honeymooners," ostensibly set in the 1950's, was Jackie Gleason's homage to his Depression childhood in a Bushwick cold-water flat. Two of Sid Caesar's most popular characters on "Your Show of Shows" were the downtown jazz men Progress Hornsby and Cool Cees.
By the mid-1950's, the bulk of the writers had moved to Los Angeles. The public was also on the move, to the suburbs. Television followed them. Family sitcoms, now the most popular form of entertainment, largely abandoned New York for places like Mayfield ("Leave It to Beaver") and Springfield ("Father Knows Best"). The only other genre to emerge in the 1950's, the western, was also distant from urban life. Excitable immigrants were replaced by accentless adults and freckle-faced tots. Even the Goldbergs bailed out; in the show's last season, the family moved to the suburbs.
A handful of shows set in New York endured during the 50's and early 60's, but a clear division emerged in how Hollywood handled their inhabitants. Many New York characters were down-at-the-heels castouts, like the "Honeymooners" or the cops in "Car 54, Where Are You?" In "The Dick Van Dyke Show," Rob and Laura lived in New Rochelle, while Sally, the man-hungry spinster, lived in a dank one-bedroom apartment in Midtown Manhattan.
"The name of the town to which the Goldbergs moved said it all, Haverville," said Dr. Marc, the Syracuse professor. "Television became a place where the haves lived in the suburbs and the have-nots got left behind in the city."
The exceptions were the Ricardos and Danny Thomas's brood. Although "I Love Lucy" was shot in Hollywood, it conveyed the deeply New York sensibility of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, who controlled production in a deal virtually unheard of at the time. The Ricardos lived in a believable one-bedroom apartment in a building that might indeed have been in the East 60's.
Ricky was no Ozzie Nelson. He wore open-collared shirts and brilliantined hair. He worked in a smoky club brimming with chorus girls. The tone was set in the pilot: Lucy and Ethel wanted to spend an evening nightclub-hopping; Ricky and Fred lobbied for the fights.
"Make Room for Daddy" also portrayed 1950's New York with a Stork Club edge. Mr. Thomas, who was indeed a nightclub star, played one. The antithesis of the suburban dad, he was flashy, egomaniacal, sarcastic. Mr. Thomas's character was widowed in the series and remarried to a younger, prettier wife outfitted in Dior. Every season the family moved to a new apartment.
"That show was totally New York to me," said Mr. Fontana, the writer-producer who considers himself among a new breed of creators working strictly out of the city (he currently shoots HBO's "Oz" on a set above Chelsea Market). "It was so different than 'Leave It to Beaver' or 'Father Knows Best.' As a kid in Buffalo I would think to myself, 'That's why I want to come to New York.' "
Although "Naked City," the noirish crime drama shot entirely on location in New York from 1959 to 1963, began the careers of Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford and Peter Fonda, such stylish realism never had a chance in the television industry of the era.
By the mid-1960's, Hollywood embraced a more swinging ethos that left New York in the cold. Largely avoiding the era's politics, television latched onto two genres: broad farces like "Petticoat Junction" and "The Beverly Hillbillies" and series set in the surfer culture of Southern California. The few shows that used New York as a framework, like "Family Affair" and "That Girl," rarely alluded to the city.
But as the 1960's melted into the post-Watergate 1970's, television returned to New York through a glass darkly. Film had led the way, with Martin Scorsese's "Mean Streets" and Sidney Lumet's "Serpico." The city seemed a perfect venue for the newly popular hourlong police drama.
"Kojak" epitomized the genre. Shot virtually in shadow, the brightest thing on the screen was Telly Savalas's shaven head. Kojak's New York was teeming with prostitutes and addicts, on the verge of collapse. Only Savalas's strong hand kept chaos at bay. "Who loves ya, baby?" became a quintessential New York refrain.
Another quintessentially New York voice was emerging: Mr. Lear's. He insisted on setting his ground-breaking show, whose premiere was in 1971, in a working-class area in Queens, where he was raised. Although shot in Los Angeles and set largely in one room, the sitcom tasted piquantly of the boroughs outside Manhattan. Archie Bunker saw himself not merely as a regular guy in an average ethnic neighborhood, but as a New Yorker who was essentially superior.
Mr. Lear also set "The Jeffersons" in New York, this time on the Upper East Side, and in many ways it was more essentially tied to the city. Not only did it make fun of the pretensions of wealth, regardless of race, but the Jeffersons' neighbors also included prime time's first interracial couple. "You tell me what other city that show could possibly have been set in in 1975," Mr. Lear said.
Mr. Lear was not the only sitcom producer to rediscover New York in the 1970's. Others also returned, to portray a city that derived much of its personality from a single group: Jews. "Barney Miller," "Welcome Back, Kotter," "Taxi" and "The Odd Couple," all seminal 1970's series, were each dominated by characters not only instantly recognizable as New Yorkers but also clearly, though not explicitly, Jewish.
"You always have a delicate line between what's New York and what's Jewish," said Carol Leiffer, a comedian and writer for "Seinfeld," which walked that line more boldly two decades later. "At a lot of points, depending on the characters you're writing and the situations they're in, there really is no line at all."
By the 1980's, two things again brought an end to television's love affair with New York and its kooky ethnics: a protracted labor dispute, and Hollywood's growing obsession with glamor, which resulted in money-soaked series like "Dynasty," "Knots Landing" and "Dallas." The New York-based cop-buddy show "Cagney and Lacey" was more about female bonding than a sense of place. "Night Court" descended into a sexual farce. Putting "Kate and Allie" in New York seemed simply a device to render the plight of two divorced mothers less pathetic. Ditto "Bosom Buddies," starring Tom Hanks. Where else but in New York, where apartments are so expensive, would two young men re-enact "Some Like It Hot" in an all-girl hotel?
In 1984, "The Cosby Show" became the first sitcom in decades to be shot in New York, because Mr. Cosby wanted to continue living here. But the phenomenally successful show did little to highlight the city. The Huxtables' Brooklyn Heights brownstone might just as easily have been in Mr. Cosby's hometown, Philadelphia.
 
The Competition For Authenticity
Perhaps the most significant aspect of television's return to New York this past decade has been the simmering competition for authenticity, or at least soulfulness, among the tough-talking men who specialize in creating cop shows. In the past, no one cared about doing the city justice, but these days it is a text of moxie, or perhaps machismo. Next season, it will get even more heated. Some writer-producers like Mr. Fontana insist that the shows must be written, produced and shot in New York to feel truly real. "You need to taste the food and push past people on the streets," he said.
His show for UPN, "The Beat," due in March, will focus on two uniformed officers on the Lower East Side. To add a new element, the street scenes are being shot on videotape, while the scenes about cops' personal lives are shot on film.
Dick Wolf, who created "Law and Order" in 1990, disagreed that shows set in New York had to be written and produced in the city, though he is a big believer in shooting shows here on location. "Law and Order," which led the exodus back to New York in 1990, is shot here, as is his new series, "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit." A series he is developing starring Oliver Platt is about a New York City tabloid columnist who is "a cross between Breslin and McAlary." It will be shot in New York.
Mr. Milch also wants to shoot his next show here, for the first time. After six years of shooting "N.Y.P.D. Blue" on the Mulberry Street lot and on sound stages, he conceded that "the product probably would benefit from being shot on the streets."
The new show is a logical progression in his city-obsessed oeuvre, he said. "Hill Street Blues," which took place in an unnamed ghetto, "enacted the collision of liberal impulses with unmanageability of the city, optimism encountering despair for the first time."
"N.Y.P.D. Blue," he said, was "about the deals we make with fascism, how much we're willing to pay for order."
He won't discuss his next series in detail, but it will concentrate on New York as the "emblem of the city that works, the avatar of our aspirations." But as always with Mr. Milch, there is a dark side. The New York he will next portray is the "most fully realized of our theme parks."
Despite the obvious enthusiasm for New York shared by Mr. Fontana, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Milch, there is, predictably, a growing backlash against setting shows here. Michelle Ashford, a producer who is developing a pilot called "Silent Witness" for NBC, said she unanimously ruled out New York as a venue because it was overdone. Mr. Fontana had to fight UPN executives so he could situate "The Beat" in Manhattan.
"They begged me, anywhere but here," he said. "But I made them understand that there's an immediacy, an urgency about New York that holds infinite interest for people. It definitely has infinite interest for me."

Hey, Anybody Here Know of a Good Deal on a Company?

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
IMAGINE that it is 3 a.m. and you, the chief executive of a large corporation, are wide awake, worrying whether you are paying too much to buy a company you have your eye on.
You could try rolling over or taking two aspirin and calling your investment banker in the morning. Instead, still in your pajamas, you snuggle up to the computer and log on to an exclusive Web site especially for chief executives like you. There you find the newest research on how to price a deal. You scan a list of companies that are auctioning divisions you may want to buy instead. And, if you are curious about whether sharing power with a fellow chief executive in a combined company is a good idea, you dash off an e-mail message to a colleague who has done so and ask for advice. 
 However far-fetched it seems, online chat is making its way to the executive suite in the form of a new Web site, the M & A Group. Membership, and access to the juiciest parts of the site once it is up and running early next year, will be limited to one of the most exclusive clubs on Wall Street: well-heeled chief executives interested in mergers. (A mockup of the site can be viewed at www.themagroup.com.) Something of a cross between a support group for the acquisitively inclined and an eBay for corporate subsidiaries, the concept is raising eyebrows in corporate offices nationwide.
The group says it has already attracted a cadre of prominent deal makers to its ranks of subscribers, among them Michael S. Dell, chairman of Dell Computer; Richard A. McGinn, chief executive of Lucent Technologies; Harvey Golub, chief executive of American Express; and Pete Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group.
Members, who pay $20,000 a year and who already number 50, are invited to a power retreat, to be held twice yearly, that the Web site's organizers hope will become the deal maker's equivalent of the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland. The first retreat begins this Thursday in Scottsdale, Ariz., and promises to be yet another hotbed of incessant merger rumors for Wall Street to buzz about.
The Web site was the idea of Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Spencer Stewart, the executive search firm, along with L. Dennis Kozlowski, chairman and chief executive of Tyco International, and Jan Leschly, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham.
Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Leschly are no strangers to the merger scene. Mr. Kozlowski has bought about 110 companies, divisions or product lines in the last three years and recently found himself deflecting criticism of Tyco's accounting practices in mergers. Mr. Leschly's company tried to combine with Glaxo Wellcome last year, but the deal fell apart when the two companies disagreed about who would run the combined entity. Just last week, Mr. Leschly said he would retire in April.
The three men met in Mr. Leschly's Philadelphia office in June and came up with the idea as a forum for chief executives. Reasoning that there are not many merger combinations that companies have not already thought about, they perceived a need for a medium through which executives could talk among themselves without having to filter ideas through intermediaries like investment bankers.
So far, investment banks see little threat to their business. For one thing, publicly traded companies are still obliged to get a bank's opinion about whether a deal is fair to shareholders. And if more executives are talking with one another about deals, the bankers say, that might just generate more deals.
Organizers of the Web site concede that the next $80 billion megamerger will probably not be negotiated in an Internet chat room, however exclusive. The most likely users will be large companies looking to buy stakes in smaller companies or make acquisitions valued at less than $1 billion. The investment banking fees that would be paid in such transactions are relatively small, typically $500,000 to $3 million.
"No one is going to buy all of Tyco," Mr. Kozlowski said. "But some people who are interested in buying or selling a division are more comfortable appealing to me directly," rather than through lawyers or bankers. And vice versa: "If I can approach someone directly on the site, I can do it in my own time," he said. "I can lay out a case better."
Privacy, confidentiality and secrecy add up to a major issue for Mr. Carey and his colleagues. The idea of chief executives spilling secrets online raises two specters: possible violation of securities laws and the chance that a hacker will tap into sensitive information and profit by trading on it. Mr. Carey pointed out that similar concerns apply to any communications medium, even the United States mail. But he agreed that member executives would use the site only if they were satisfied that it was secure.
"We hope it will work, but who knows," Mr. Kozlowski said. "That is where we are going to have to trust each other."
CHIEF executives will use a protected password and be the gatekeepers for use of the site by others at their companies. Executives will be able to post questions on the site without using their names. And while there will be chat rooms for general topics, executives will also be able to converse privately through the site, Mr. Carey said.
Most sections will be open only to chief executives. But some parts of the site, including a "virtual investment bank" that lists companies and subsidiaries that are for sale, will be made accessible to selected colleagues, like chief financial officers.
And contributors like consulting companies and investment banks will be invited to publish research reports on the site at a cost of $50,000 a year.
Even Mr. Carey does not believe that the final details of any deal will be worked out over the Internet. "Once a party thinks they hit it off with another, they will most likely just pick up the phone," Mr. Carey said.
Other Internet sites have been based on similar concepts, but so far they have received little attention, in part because they have not been able to attract a roster of such prominent charter-member executives. But Mr. Leschly said the new site was an idea whose time had come. "There has been a lot of secrecy in our business," he said. "For me to call up Michael Dell is impossible. I don't know him, but he's a smart guy. I could learn something. Now I can talk to him any time."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
As Class Struggle Subsides, Less Pie for the Workers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
CAPITALISM is all about splitting the national income between profits and wages, a k a capital versus labor. Adam Smith and David Ricardo laid out this playing field long ago, and Karl Marx proclaimed that when labor's share fell too low, that was cause to throw off the chains. Economists still keep score, but not with the old passion. Class struggle does not seem as pertinent to them anymore.
There is some justification for this shift. After all, the labor roster now includes many more multimillionaire executives, managers and professionals, thanks to compensation that covers much more ground than in the past -- not just wages and salaries, but also bonuses, exercised stock options, profit sharing, fancy perks and more. Given the growing presence of these high-end Americans in labor, it is a wonder that labor's share of national income is not at a record high. It's not even close. 
 Clearly, labor in general has lost clout -- not the Bill Gateses or Shaquille O'Neals or Jerry Seinfelds, all of whom count as card-carrying workers through the wage portions of their fabulous incomes, but the millions of others whose wages are simply that: fixed hourly or weekly pay.
Fixed pay has risen a bit lately, particularly at the bottom end of the wage scale. The booming economy, with its low unemployment rate and shortages of workers, has delivered some payoff for ordinary workers. But the amounts are not on the scale that once made capital versus labor a livelier struggle, and more clearly defined.
"This is a shell game," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard University labor economist. "If Gates does not take his income in Microsoft profits, he pays himself a bigger salary, and labor's share goes up. But Harry Sixpack has little to show for that improvement."
NO wonder Mr. Freeman, like so many economists, has lost interest in keeping score in the game of capital versus labor. Most economists focus instead on economic growth, the assumption being that as the economy expands and productivity improves, labor's compensation will rise across the board, no struggle needed. Why, then, give much thought to a dichotomy that counts Mr. Gates on labor's side, in the wage column, when his main concern is Microsoft's profits?
But on closer examination, the numbers tell an important story. The handful of economists who still keep tabs differ in the percentages of national income assigned to profits and wages, but not on the broad trends.
National income, as defined in government statistics, is the value added when auto workers, for example, turn $10,000 worth of steel, plastic and parts into $15,000 worth of new car. The $5,000 in added value is split between profits and wages. Profits represent a company's return on the money invested in the equipment and machinery used by labor. Some of the scorekeepers concentrate on the private sector, while others include value added across the entire economy, including government and nonprofit organizations.
Whatever the practice, the trends are roughly those laid out by Edward N. Wolff, a New York University labor economist, in a new study covering the entire spectrum. Starting in 1965, labor began steadily gaining a larger share of national income at the expense of profits, Mr. Wolff found. But in the late 1970's, profits began a long recovery, regaining all the lost ground, and a bit more, by early last year.
The last 20 months have been a period of wage gains again. The score stands at 63.4 percent as labor's share of national income and 36.6 percent as capital's, compared with 63 percent and 37 percent in January 1998. But the current economic expansion is nearly nine years old, soon to become the longest in the nation's history, and labor's share, by Mr. Wolff's calculation, is still two to nearly four percentage points below the levels reached in the late 1960's and the 1970's.
Neither the injection of so much high-end income nor the booming economy has managed to lift labor's share back to its old levels. "I think it is due to the declining power of labor, reaching back to the Reagan Administration's decision to break the union of air traffic controllers," Mr. Wolff said. "That was a signal that government was not going to support labor anymore."
Perhaps that judgment is premature. Perhaps the economy, still growing strongly, will soon lift labor back to its old share of national income. Or perhaps capital will keep the upper hand, not only over wages but in other areas as well -- as the demonstrators in Seattle seemed to suggest last week.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Conrad B. Herrmann;
Franklin California Growth Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
CALL it the home-team advantage.
"We're able to keep close tabs on our investments," said Conrad B. Herrmann, lead manager of the $1.58 billion Franklin California Growth fund, which focuses on California companies. "We read local newspapers in California and socialize and interact with people who might be employed in the companies in our universe." 
 For Mr. Herrmann, cultivating his own backyard has paid off. The fund has returned 29.2 percent a year, on average, in the three years through Nov. 26, compared with 22.5 percent for its midcap growth peers, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
The fund holds 135 stocks, generally of small to midsized companies with market capitalizations of up to $2.5 billion; technology issues make up about half the assets.
In picking stocks, Mr. Herrmann, 39, and his second in command, Canyon A. Chan, 30, divide the 1,400-plus publicly traded California companies into four groups, and look at different criteria for each. The fund also owns a few companies that are based outside California but that have major business in the state.
The biggest portion of the fund, about 70 percent, is invested in somewhat out-of-favor growth companies, selling at a 20 percent to 25 percent discount to what the managers believe they are worth. "These are companies with good upside prospects," Mr. Herrmann said, "not just because of the growth of the business but because they trade at a lower value than we think they deserve."
Emerging growth companies, typically in technology and health care, account for 10 percent to 15 percent of the fund. These stocks tap into "the spirit of California's entrepreneurship and focus on innovation," said Mr. Herrmann, a native of New Jersey, from his office in San Mateo, Calif. "Most important, the scope of their opportunity must be large," he added, "but it has to be realistic as well."
To value emerging growth companies, the two managers, along with the 35 Franklin analysts, estimate their potential revenues and adjust for inflation. They will pay multiples as high as 20 times their average annual estimates of adjusted revenue over the next three years, Mr. Chan said.
An additional 10 percent is invested in what they call leadership companies. "These are companies with a leading or dominant market share," Mr. Herrmann said.
For such stocks, they are willing to pay for growth, but typically look for a price-to-earnings multiple of no more than two and a half times the company's comparable earnings growth rate. They said top-notch management is key at these companies, generally the fund's longer-term holdings. Most of the rest of the fund's portfolio, 5 to 15 percent, is invested in what Mr. Herrmann and Mr. Chan perceive as down-and-out value stocks.
"These are groups that might be severely undervalued," Mr. Herrmann said, "but we think the risk has been wrung out of the sector and the upside potential, long term, can be very good."
The managers are currently focusing on real estate investment trusts, which, Mr. Herrmann said, are trading at historically low multiples.
The fund's cash position is now about 6 percent, higher than its average of 2 to 3 percent. "The new-offerings market has been quite fertile lately," Mr. Herrmann said, "and we want to have money available to participate in new I.P.O.'s."
LAST month, they added shares of Spieker Properties, a REIT in Menlo Park, Calif., that acquires, develops, and manages offices and industrial properties, mainly in California, Oregon and Washington. "It has positioned itself in some of the most supply-constrained markets in the U.S.," Mr. Herrmann said, "and should also benefit from explosive market demand."
Half of its income is derived from Northern California, he said, where employment growth and new capital are bolstering demand for new office space.
Spieker's shares trade near their 52-week lows, while paying a 6.98 percent dividend. The fund first bought shares in March 1998 at just under $40; the stock closed on Friday at $34.9375, or 9.3 times his 2000 earnings estimate of $3.75 a share. He expects three-year annual earnings growth of 10 to 12 percent.
Another favorite is Liberate Technologies, of San Carlos, Calif., which makes operating system software for cable set-top boxes. The software lets cable companies provide interactive television services, Mr. Chan said, adding that the company is "in trials with a number of systems that could potentially be marketed to more than 150 million subscribers."
Liberate's goal is to "enable any content, in any device over any network," he said. The company has a solid management team, he added, and has formed partnerships with companies like U S West, America Online and DirecTV.
The fund bought shares of Liberate at $16 at the initial offering on July 28; they closed at $169.50 on Friday. Mr. Chan projects a three-year revenue growth rate, annualized, of 75 to 100 percent and expects Liberate to break even by 2002.
The managers also like Cisco Systems, the networking equipment giant based in San Jose. At 3.4 percent of assets, Cisco is the fund's second-largest holding, after JDS Uniphase, a maker of fiber optic components.
Cisco is "a good core holding despite its current premium valuation because it's entering new markets," Mr. Herrmann said -- for example, selling gear to phone companies for telecommunications networks. He calls the chief executive, John Chambers, "probably the most highly regarded manager in Silicon Valley," adding that the company "is very successful acquiring new technology if they haven't developed it themselves."
In 1991, the fund began buying shares at an average cost of $16.42; the stock is now at $95.5625, with projected earnings of $1 a share for the fiscal year ending in July 2000. The managers project a three-year earnings growth rate of 30 percent, annualized.

Is the Party Ending? 2 Views in Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
AS the euro hovers at virtual parity with dollar, European fund managers and equity strategists are engaged in a great stock-market debate: Is Europe looking at a glass half full, or one brimming with frothy valuations?
Almost a year after the common currency's introduction, there is a large degree of unanimity between Europe's bulls and bears. Both groups see that cultural changes in Continental Europeans' attitudes toward investment have begun pushing money out of low-earning bank deposits and into mutual funds. And they agree that Europe's merger frenzy is unlikely to abate. 
 They also know that Europe's markets, especially in the last two months, have been driven by a surge in technology and telecommunications stocks, raising hopes among the bulls that Europe's technology sector is where America's was a few years back -- poised for explosive growth.
In local currencies, the British FTSE-100 index is up 14.6 percent so far this year, while the French CAC-40 index is up 38.7 percent. Other gains include 22.3 percent for the DAX index in Germany and 5.6 percent for the Milan MIB 30 in Italy. For American investors, of course, the euro's weakness has cut into those returns.
But some do not believe that the future will be as profitable as the recent past. As is the case in the United States, positive performances mask a fairly narrow bull market. Only about one-third of Europe's top 300 stocks have outperformed expectations, while most of the rest have languished.
"The market has all its eggs in one basket," said David Bowers, an equity strategist at Merrill Lynch.
There is also the worry that there is not enough uninvested money to sustain a market rise. "Cash has all been put to work. There is little to defend the markets if they start to fall," said Adrian Holmes, who manages $3 billion at the Merrill Lynch Eurofund and is worried about the speed of stocks' gains this fall. "There has been a trough-to-peak in six weeks or two months, and I have never seen such a ludicrous move in my entire investment career."
This, Mr. Holmes said, is cause for concern. "Fundamentally, I think the markets are too high and technically too extended," he said. "My guess is that the markets will go down and go down reasonably sharply."
The problem, he said, is that people "have given up on looking at valuations." Indeed, the price-to-earnings multiples on the FTSE-100 and CAC-40, at 29 and 30, respectively, are just a bit lower than that of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The P/ E's on the DAX and MIB 30 are higher.
CONTRAST that view, though, with the assessment of Mark Howdle, chief European equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney here. He thinks the market is set to broaden, driven in part by liquidity. "Telecommunications and technology will be the froth on a rising market" for the next three to six months, he said. "When we hit the glass ceiling and realize that the market isn't going any higher for a few months, people will want to sell off and rotate into safer havens for a while. I don't think they are clearly overvalued yet."
Various factors have maintained the demand. According to Mr. Howdle, some $8 billion a month has been flowing into European equity mutual funds since the beginning of the year. And international investors who had shied from European markets earlier are beginning to return. While American investors represent only a relatively small part of the market, said Mr. Holmes at Merrill Lynch, they exercise a "disproportionate influence" on prices because they pursue more active management than some of their European counterparts.
But other experts think it is European demand that will push stocks higher. The flow of new money into European pension and mutual funds is set to increase to $500 billion next year from $400 billion this year. "It's about Europeans learning about equities on a scale we have never seen before," said Michael J. Browne, head of European equities at Chase Global Asset Management, who is particularly bullish. "I think we are one year into the returns you have seen in the U.S. market in the last three, four, five years," he said.
Specifically, he predicted that shares of Nokia, the Finnish cell phone company, would be around 200 euros in 12 months, versus 154 on Friday, while Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, would hit 550 kronor, versus 475.5 on Friday.
Other telecommunications and related stocks -- Sonera in Finland, Bouygues and Vivendi in France and Mannesmann in Germany -- will keep rising, he said, largely because of Europe's lead over the United States in the wireless business.
Of course, the risks are familiar. "An unexpected shock from Wall Street" could upset all of Europe's calculations, said Mr. Bowers, the Merrill Lynch strategist.
And, nobody seems sure where the euro will go next. The currency started the year at $1.18 but last week it dipped briefly -- and for the first time -- below the psychologically important parity level with the dollar. But that weakness may serve investors' interests. "We take the view that it's going to strengthen next year," said Mr. Howdle of Salomon. That means the current price offers a nice buying level for non-European investors to pick up European assets.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;
The Celtic Tiger Draws Many of City's Irish Home

BYLINE: By GUILLAUME DEBRE

 BODY:
For years the Irish have moved to New York City in search of jobs. Now, with Ireland's economy booming, the city's Irish are going back.
"Today, if you look for a job at home, you'll get it like that," said Packie Bonner, a carpenter who came to the New York City area three years ago and plans to be returning to Ireland on Dec. 19. "Because the economy is so good, you can make the same wage there that you make here. And there is no place like home." 
 Indeed, more Irish are leaving New York City, and the United States as a whole, than are arriving. Eamonn Dornan, director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, a private group in Woodside, Queens, said that over the past few years there has been "a net plus migration to Ireland for the first time since the 70's." In the past six years, more than 30,000 Irish citizens in this country have been lured back to the Celtic Tiger, the name given by analysts to Ireland's thriving economy. In the 12 months ended in April, 5,700 left, according to the Irish Central Statistics Office.
Whether newly arrived or well established, many Irish here are touched by the trend. Robbie O'Dowd has been living in New York City for nine years. A college dropout in Ireland, he refused a factory job that he called dead-end and flew to the United States. He started as a laborer and is now a bartender. Not yet gone -- he is planning to leave for Ireland on Dec. 14 -- he already has interviews scheduled there for jobs as a bar manager.
"Ten years ago, we had nothing like that back home," Mr. O'Dowd said of his prospects.
But after years of absence, Mr. Dornan said, returning home might be harder than most expatriates expect. He has talked to friends who have had trouble adjusting to a home they hardly recognize.
"Their expectations have changed given the environment they are now used to," he said. "But the country they have left has also changed in the past 5 or 10 years and people find it hard to adjust."
In a related trend, fewer Irish are settling in the United States and the trend is particularly striking in New York City. According to a study by the city's Planning Department published last month, an average of 2,500 Irish people moved to the city legally each year from 1990 to 1994. But within the next two years, the annual average dropped precipitously, to about 600 a year.
Mr. Dornan, however, cautioned that despite these numbers, immigration to the United States is still strong. Young graduates from Irish colleges are being replaced as immigrants by less-educated workers who are more eager to stay illegally, he explained.
"There is still a high number of immigrants who leave Ireland for America -- like the people who missed out on the benefits of the Celtic Tiger," Mr. Dornan said.

HEADLINE: Nobel Economics: Spending theCheck

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
ON a late October morning, Robert Alexander Mundell sat Buddha-like amid stylish clutter in his Claremont Avenue apartment, two blocks from Columbia University in Manhattan. The magic moment when, amid fairy-tale pomp, he will receive from the King of Sweden the heavy gold medal engraved with Alfred Nobel's stern profile was still weeks away. But life had already changed profoundly for Mr. Mundell, 67, the flamboyant Canadian-born economist whose ideas paved the way for the euro, the European currency.
Since the announcement of the prize two weeks earlier, The Wall Street Journal had already described him as more important than Keynes, a television network had filmed a documentary on his life and 3,000 e-mail messages had clogged his "in" box. Invitations were pouring in so fast on this particular morning that his wife, Valerie Natsios, desperate for the last hour to take a shower, couldn't leave the phone: It wouldn't stop ringing. 
 Mr. Mundell, who "half expected" the prize for some 15 years, had already decided how he would spend the nearly $1 million prize (to complete the renovation of his Tuscan palazzo, once featured in Architectural Digest, and to buy a pony for his 2-year-old son, Nicholas). And he had already decided that he would have the honorarium transferred to his bank account in euros, because he thinks the euro, though sinking of late, is bound to appreciate against the dollar. But one detail appeared to have escaped the man who, during the Reagan presidency, became the intellectual guru of the supply-side tax revolution: "You mean . . . " he asked, a tiny frown now evident on the capacious brow, "it's taxed?"
The world's great economic thinkers aspire to the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for some of the same reasons that actors hanker after the Academy Award and athletes hope to enter the Hall of Fame. "People like crowns," said Mr. Mundell, who will receive this year's prize on Friday.
No one has ever refused the economics prize, which was added to the five original Nobel prizes in 1968, although one laureate, Gunnar Myrdal, said publicly that he would have done so had he not been so sleepy when the predawn call came from Stockholm, and another winner seriously considered turning it down because a friend's work had been ignored. The prize, after all, is the only one that can vault a social scientist into the same pantheon as Einstein, Curie and Bohr. William Breit, co-editor of "Lives of the Laureates" (M.I.T. Press), calls the Nobel nothing less than "the maiden's kiss that turns the toad into a daring, dashing fellow."
As its cachet has grown -- in step with the awareness of economics' role in public and private life -- the prize has had a bigger impact on the laureates. They are tempted with new opportunities -- financial, professional and personal -- as well as new risks. Research can be disrupted, and, said Milton Friedman, who won in 1976, "the temptation to shoot off your mouth is nearly irresistible."
The media hoopla accompanying the announcement may even have hastened the death of William Vickrey, who won in 1996 for his modern auction theory. Three days later, Mr. Vickrey, who was 82, died of cardiac arrest, possibly set off by the unusual stress.
AND then there is the money. Woody Allen, that notorious Academy Award absentee, once acknowledged that he would, if called, show up in Stockholm: "Apart from everything else," he said, the prize "carries an interesting amount of cash."
Assar Lindbeck, the Swedish economist who was long the leading force on the five-member prize committee, put it this way: "People say that the money doesn't matter, but they are just being politically correct."
What makes the money so important isn't the absolute sum. Though it varies, it is never enough to let a laureate quit his day job, as Alfred Nobel might have hoped. Rather, the prize is like a movie deal for a writer or a bundle of stock options for a middle manager: one of those rare windfalls in a middle-class life big enough to make the question "What shall I do with it?" really worth asking.
Interviews with a sampling of economics laureates show that for all their sophistication, they seem no more, nor less, canny about money than mere mortals. Surprisingly few have entrusted their winnings to Wall Street, apparently agreeing with the sentiment of Wassily Leontief, who, upon winning the prize in 1973 for inventing input-output analysis, said: "I like to speculate in ideas. I don't like to speculate in money."
Rather, some laureates have spent their windfalls to take a planeload of family and friends to share the festivities in Stockholm, others to buy real estate -- in Mr. Friedman's case, an apartment in San Francisco. A surprising number have given the money to their children or used it to become charitable benefactors. Some have bought time to pursue favorite public causes or -- despite the fact that their average age on receiving the prize was 69 -- have started new research careers.
In part, the variation arises because the laureates haven't all received the same sum. More than one-third of the prizes have been shared with one or two co-winners. The amount, like that of the science prizes, is set each winter and varies with the fortunes of the Nobel Foundation's investment portfolio. The prize became much richer at the end of the 1980's thanks to the bull market in stocks and a hugely profitable real estate deal in Stockholm. Mr. Mundell's take will be 7.9 million kronor, or nearly $1 million at current exchange rates. That is about twice the amount, in nominal terms, of awards in the mid-1980's.
Mr. Mundell is lucky. When Paul A. Samuelson won in 1970, the prize amounted to a mere $77,000, less than 40 percent of the purchasing power of the original science prizes in 1901. By 1976, it was $180,000, a sum that hardly bothers the winner, Mr. Friedman, one of the earliest and most vocal proponents of the free market. He argues that, while his prize was delayed for several years by his ideological enemies, they actually did him a favor. Allowing for inflation and tax changes, his has been the biggest prize, before or since. "I know. I calculated it," he said recently.
As Mr. Mundell discovered, the United States government has lately become a prime beneficiary of the Nobel Foundation's investment success. Since 1986, when Congress changed tax laws to equalize the treatment of various kinds of income, regardless of source, the prize has been taxed as ordinary income, a little-known fact that, when discovered, has led to an occasional petition to Congress. Starting with Robert M. Solow, who won in 1987, American laureates have had to pay up to 50 percent of their winnings to city, state and federal governments.
The timing of the prize introduces its own vagaries, as Robert E. Lucas Jr., the creator of the theory of rational expectations, discovered in 1995. Like Mr. Mundell, Mr. Lucas knew he was in the running. When negotiating their 1989 divorce agreement, his wife, Rita, thought the odds good enough to have her lawyer insert a clause in their agreement stipulating that "wife shall receive 50 percent of any Nobel prize" won prior to Oct. 31, 1995. The prize arrived a few days before, and Mr. Lucas wound up pocketing roughly $300,000 after taxes, instead of the $600,000 or so he would have received if he had won the next year.
"A deal is a deal," Mr. Lucas told reporters afterward, adding that he might have resisted the clause more strenuously had he been more sure of winning so soon. But Mr. Lucas, who teaches at the University of Chicago, is quite philosophical about it now: "She got the whole house," he said recently. "Getting half of the prize was better than nothing."
Mr. Lucas says that he parked his share of the prize money in his retirement account and more or less forgot about it.
At the opposite end of the spectrum is Franco Modigliani, who won in 1985 for his theory of saving and financial markets. Mr. Modigliani, now retired and living in Cambridge, Mass., says he owes his substantial net worth partly to the fact that his tax-free $225,000 prize, mostly invested in stock index funds, has been multiplied many times over by what he calls "the stock market bubble." He declined to say what his bundle is now worth, but said he leaves the day-to-day management of his portfolio to a professional.
Still, he has not relaxed about the future. Before the 1987 market crash and again this year, he acted on his suspicion that the bubble was about to burst. Using a combination of put and call options that allow one to lock in a gain, he bought what is called a "collar." It produces the same effect as if he had sold everything, but without incurring huge capital gains taxes. "The cost is that you freeze yourself out of the market," he said.
THERE is no way to tell, of course, if he will turn out to be right. But when laureates have followed their own investment instincts, the results have sometimes been less than impressive. Douglass C. North, who won the prize in 1993 for his contribution to economic history and is now teaching at Washington University in St. Louis, delights in the fact that entire countries like Venezuela are asking him to redesign their economies.
But in financial terms, he has not fared as well.
"We got a bad year," recalled Mr. North, who shared the prize with Robert W. Fogel. The prize was worth only $880,000; after dividing it in two and paying taxes (46 percent in his case), "it got to be a manageable sum of money," he said. "We thought the stock market's too high -- the Dow was at 2,000 -- so we put it in tax-exempt municipal bonds, which shows you this economist doesn't know a damn thing about investing." The Dow closed on Friday at 11,286.18.
Laureates have also been caught by sudden swings in the currency markets. In announcing the winners, the news media usually report the prize in dollars, but the amount is actually set in kronor. If the kronor heads south between mid-October and mid-December, when the laureates collect, the dollar value of the prize can be a lot smaller.
Gary S. Becker of the University of Chicago, the 1992 winner for his application of economic theory to a wide range of human behavior, including racial discrimination and crime, now says that he had intended to hedge against a sudden depreciation of the kronor by buying dollars on the forward market. He never got around to it, and two weeks after he got his call from Stockholm, a currency crisis erupted in Sweden. His prize, worth about $1.2 million in mid-October, shrank by 25 percent, to about $900,000. "I was too overwhelmed by all the hoopla in the first two weeks," Mr. Becker said ruefully. "So I suffered some."
NO laureate's life has been as thoroughly transformed by the prize as that of John F. Nash, a co-winner in 1994. The award literally brought the world back to Mr. Nash, now 71, whose life was shattered at 30 by paranoid schizophrenia. Mr. Nash's slim doctoral dissertation, written in 1949 when he was a 21-year-old graduate student, revolutionized the way economists thought about competition, but on the day that the prize was announced, Mr. Nash told reporters that he might now be able to get a credit card. They thought he was joking, but he was not.
When the long-delayed honor finally came, Mr. Nash had been without a job for 35 years, getting by on only a few hundred dollars a month from a trust his mother had established before her death, and avoiding homelessness only because of his former wife's compassion.
After years of grinding poverty, Mr. Nash now has some measure of financial security. The prize, which he shared with John C. Harsanyi and Reinhard Selten, netted him some $200,000, most of which he put first in tax-free municipal bonds and later into a global mutual fund. He even has the luxury to indulge in what was a passion of his youth, dabbling in stocks, mostly making long-shot bets with small amounts of money.
"Without the money, it wouldn't be the same thing," Mr. Nash said of the prize, adding that "the honor is worth more money than the money." After he won the prize, Princeton University offered him a part-time research post that pays about $25,000 a year. And a major Hollywood producer has bought the rights to his life story for a high-six-figure sum.
These days, Mr. Nash looks like his old elegant self. He has paid part of the mortgage on the house he shares with Alicia Nash, his former wife, and shared his good fortune with her and his two sons. Asked what difference the prize had made in his life, he said: "I feel I can go into a coffee place and spend a few dollars. Lots of other academics do that. If I was really poor, I couldn't do that. Previously, I was like that."
Robert C. Merton, while hardly unlucky, was a less fortunate winner. A mere 53 when he won the prize two years ago, Mr. Merton had been a superstar since his graduate school days at M.I.T. His method for determining the future value of stock options, developed with Fischer Black and Myron S. Scholes, had an impact that few other contributions in economics have matched: they helped hatch a $70 billion market in financial derivatives.
HE had long been a professor at the Harvard Business School and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. After years of consulting on Wall Street, Mr. Merton had a personal fortune that was sizable even before he became a founding partner in Long Term Capital Management, a hedge fund started by John W. Meriwether, the renowned former Salomon Brothers trader, in 1993.
Mr. Merton netted some $250,000 after splitting the prize with Mr. Scholes and paying taxes; he spent a large chunk of it to take family and friends to Stockholm to share his moment of glory.
It was the fame that proved a bit overwhelming. "This is very different," he said, "no matter how much attention you've gotten before." In his apartment after receiving the news, he hesitated before facing the reporters who had gathered in the lobby. "I realized that if I said something stupid or out of context it would be in every newspaper in the world."
THAT was the easy part, though. A year later, Long Term Capital imploded and once adulatory headlines like "The Right Option" gave way to ones like "Scrambled Eggheads" and "Teachings of Nobelists Also Proved Their Undoing."
"It was very painful," Mr. Merton recalled -- "the extraordinary destruction of value, mostly of the partners, including myself, the effects on reputations."
"For 25 years these ideas were used all over the world -- on stock exchanges, asset management firms, banks, insurance companies," said Mr. Merton, his voice still raw from the experience. "If the media had asked, 'Do you still use these models?' the answer would have been yes.
"I'll never really get over what happened to L.T.C.M.," he continued.
Mr. Merton, who never quit his full-time post at Harvard, retired from Long-Term Capital last June. He now has an exclusive consulting relationship with J. P. Morgan.
For Amartya Sen, the first Asian to win the economics Nobel, the 1998 prize had a different significance. Charming and immensely cultured, Mr. Sen has spent a lifetime shuttling with apparent ease between his native India and England and the United States. Married to a Cambridge University economist, Emma Rothschild, he is the first non-Briton to be master of Trinity College, the richest of Cambridge's colleges. He is also a professor emeritus of philosophy and economics at Harvard.
"I've been writing for 40 years about inequality and the terrible neglect of education in India," said Mr. Sen, who was cited by the Nobel committee for his contributions to the economics of social welfare, including poverty, famines and human rights. "Now I have more of a voice."
Mr. Sen's voice is indeed being heard, particularly in Asia, where he has been greeted as a demigod. Ten thousand people crowded into a Calcutta stadium to celebrate his prize, a generation of babies has been named Amartya (which means immortal) and Asian leaders -- including Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew, of whom Mr. Sen has been particularly critical -- are eager to meet him. Among other things, his prize prompted the finance minister of West Bengal to commit to building 8,000 new primary schools.
IN keeping with his lifelong desire to make a difference to the world's poor, Mr. Sen, who witnessed the 1949 Bengal famine, used $400,000 of his $940,000 prize to set up two trusts -- one in India, the other in Bangladesh. He said the trusts, named Pratichi after his boyhood home, would "work toward the removal of illiteracy and ignorance, the lack of basic health care, and the special disadvantages from which women, particularly young girls, suffer."
Mr. Sen, who has an American green card although he remains an Indian citizen, will be able to keep roughly $250,000 after paying United States taxes. "I don't think I will invest it," he said. "I'll use it for useful purposes." That means, first, paying for his three grown children's air fares for regular trips to India so that they can maintain their ties to family and culture. "It's nice to have money," Mr. Sen said. "But now I don't see that life would be that much better if I had more money. If I were to get another big cash prize, I'd give it all to the trusts."
Like Mr. Sen, Tjalling C. Koopmans, the quiet Yale professor who won in 1975, gave away a large portion of his prize. Mr. Koopmans, who won for his contribution to the theory of optimum allocation of resources, was upset that George B. Dantzig, the inventor of linear programming, was not included, so he called another laureate, Kenneth J. Arrow, to ask him whether he should refuse the prize. Mr. Arrow recalled: "I'm sure he was glad when I said, 'Go ahead, take it. You deserve it.' "
Mr. Koopmans took the advice but couldn't quell his conscience after splitting the $240,000 prize with his co-winner, Leonid V. Kantorovich. So he donated $40,000 to the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, a research organization in Vienna with which he and Mr. Dantzig were affiliated. The donation reduced his personal gain to $80,000, the amount he would have received had Mr. Dantzig shared the prize. An explicit condition of the gift was that it be kept secret, though a friend has since told Mr. Dantzig about it and published an account after the death of Mr. Koopmans in 1985.
Ronald H. Coase, who was 81 when he won the 1991 prize for his work on transaction costs and property rights, is intent on parlaying his award into more influence. He netted about $700,000 after taxes, partly by getting the Nobel Foundation to push part of his payment into the following January, by which time the kronor had appreciated. That sum has grown to $2.4 million in a Merrill Lynch mutual fund.
Mr. Coase, who retired from the University of Chicago Law School, now regards the economics profession with a jaundiced eye. And he would like to use his new fortune to establish a program to encourage more empirical research. But finding the time has been difficult. "I'm fully engaged now, engaged and overwhelmed," he said from his home in Chicago. Besides, as he has learned, he said, "it's very hard to give money away" to good effect.
The prize has tugged a different laureate back into economic research. By the time William F. Sharpe won the prize in 1990 for his theory of capital asset pricing, he had already retired from the Stanford Business School and was a principal in a company that advised pension funds. He shared the prize, $380,000 before taxes, with two co-winners so it "wasn't huge," he said. Once, when a fellow laureate, Merton H. Miller, was asked how he spent his share, he joked, "Well, I took my family to dinner in Stockholm."
Mr. Sharpe did the same, taking "my full extended family -- stepmother, mother, children, stepchildren" along.
The prize inspired him, then 56, to return to his old position at Stanford. "I was in a commercial phase of a my life, but I wanted to go back to writing and research," he said. A burst of publications has followed. "I've published a lot of what I've done on my Web site, including a book I've had under construction since I went back," he said.
Mr. Sharpe has since retired a second time and joined an online investment advisory firm, but this time strictly in a research capacity. "You really feel increasingly that what you do should really add to knowledge or welfare in some important way," he said.
Even when the prize amount is small, the Nobel creates money-making opportunities -- five-figure speaking fees, fat consulting contracts and post-retirement job offers, not to mention glamorous opportunities like opening-night tickets to La Scala and first-class travel around the world. For those who consult, join financial firms or hire themselves out as expert witnesses in court cases, the payoff can be huge.
BUT perhaps true to their lifelong devotion to scholarship, some laureates do not find such opportunities all that seductive. At first, for example, Mr. Lucas reveled in the invitations. But after five or six trips, he realized that he wasn't having that much fun. "I'm still excited by mathematical economics," he said. "The other stuff is just a diversion. It doesn't advance any ambitions I have." Mr. Lucas, 62, finds that the higher profile the Nobel has given him in the economics profession is "extremely stimulating." His recent work on growth theory may make him the first economics laureate to win the prize twice, as the award is given for specific, not lifetime, achievements.
Mr. Mundell, meanwhile, is thinking of calling his Nobel lecture "Reconsideration of the 20th Century." For him, like most other laureates, it is the intellectual contribution -- and the stamp it leaves on the world -- that counts far more than the money.
Harriet Zuckerman, the author of a classic study of the science Nobel Prizes and the stepmother of Mr. Merton, said: "Posterity is the ultimate gold ring. The prize has a way, if not of insuring one's place in history, of giving one a better chance of being included."

HEADLINE: AIDS, the Worsening Catastrophe

 BODY:
Even though new drug therapies continue to cut AIDS death rates in wealthy countries like the United States, the news from the AIDS front is chilling. In the developing world, the situation is catastrophic. Even in the United States, where AIDS deaths have been declining, the spread of the AIDS virus continues unabated, with new infections accruing at roughly 40,000 a year for several years now. The only real gain is that drugs are helping the victims live longer. Infection rates are on the rise among minorities, women and young people as AIDS in this country becomes increasingly a disease of the poor and disadvantaged.
A new report from the United Nations shows that this year AIDS is expected to kill a record 2.6 million people worldwide, higher than in any year since the epidemic began nearly two decades ago. More than 33 million people are infected with H.I.V. But these numbingly high numbers cannot begin to show the impact that AIDS is having on societies being ravaged by the disease. International aid agencies now consider AIDS a major obstacle to economic and human development. 
 In sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS is single-handedly destroying the health and welfare advances of the last four decades. In some countries like Botswana, one in four adults is infected.
Average life expectancy in southern Africa reached 59 years in the early 1990's but is expected to plunge back to 45 years in the next decade due to AIDS. Roughly half of the new infections in Africa are in people 25 years old or younger, who will typically die before their 35th year.
The social impacts are staggering. More than 11 million children have been orphaned by AIDS since 1981, 95 percent of them in Africa. Soaring death rates among the young, who form a big share of the labor pool, will cripple economic development in many African regions.
The industrialized nations up to now have provided less than $500 million a year for international AIDS programs. Under the new budget signed by President Clinton, the United States will increase its contribution to global AIDS efforts to $225 million for this year. That move is welcome. But the developed world needs to provide more leadership and resources to attack an epidemic that is overwhelming the world's poorest societies.

Gimme Shelter: Same Song, New Tune

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

 BODY:
NO big city can match New York City for its ungrudging support of the destitute. Alone among American cities, the city has legalized the right to shelter, and no city can touch the scope or the magnitude of benefits that New York City spreads among the poor. But now the city has become a model of toughness with a series of new demands on the homeless.
Soon, most likely by the start of the year, the city will require that anyone living in shelters follow the same rules as those receiving welfare: work, or lose their beds as well as their benefits. The police have also begun cracking down on homeless if they refuse to leave the streets and accept shelter. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's initiative reflects a growing national discontent with the homeless and impatience with solutions that fail. "The average American is thinking, 'I've been seeing these people sleeping in the streets for 20 years, and nothing seems to happen,' " said E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist in Washington and an expert on disorders like schizophrenia and manic depression that, he said, afflict about a third of the nation's 400,000 to 700,000 homeless.
"Is there a right to basic shelter?" Dr. Torrey asked. "The answer in most cities has been yes. Giuliani is questioning whether you need to do something about that. He's saying that we as a city are going to require you to work. You can push a broom four hours a day and make that your rent money."
Cities that once pitied the homeless for their poverty, addictions, disabilities, mental illness and twists of fortune that put them on the street now see them as threats to safety and public order.
Tampa has ordered that they not be served food in public parks. Tucson is considering privatizing sidewalks so adjacent businesses can shoo them away. The National Law Center on Homeless and Poverty says that of 50 cities it surveyed, 48 percent have initiated police sweeps of the homeless over the last two years.
In New York City, Mr. Guiliani announced the new work requirements as part of a broader campaign to bring the homeless under the same rules that apply to welfare recipients. The tougher arrest policy came after a woman was attacked by a man who was first labeled homeless, although after his arrest it turned out he had a home in an abandoned apartment in the Bronx.
Mr. Guiliani's measures have already drawn the condemnation of his Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as protests this weekend by homeless advocates. The new rules, shelter operators and homeless advocates said, can be draconian. Showing up for work an hour or more late without an excuse can result in a loss of benefits -- and now shelter -- for 90 days for the first infraction, 150 for the second and 180 for the third. Recipients can also be penalized for missing appointments with doctors and caseworkers, or for not being home when their children return from school.
Others suggest that the rules can serve a good purpose in steering the homeless into jobs, depending on how they are enforced. But once they're brought into the system, the city must help them move toward self-sufficiency, said Douglas J. Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute said. "The nuance here is how real is the offer of help and how helpful are the services," he said.
GOOD or bad, New York City's new regulations apply to an unusually comprehensive shelter system that developed after public outcries about the homeless in the 1980's. The city also built an extensive network of subsidized apartments; currently placing about 3,500 families in permanent apartments and about 1,000 single adults in single-room occupancy homes. The city also houses about 4,800 families and 6,800 single adults in its shelter system.
Many homeless people are already required to meet the work requirements because they receive welfare. Nearly all homeless families receive welfare benefits, and about one-quarter of single adults in shelters now receive other general assistance, said Susan Neibacher, executive ditrector of Care for the Homeless, which operates a shelter and counseling service. Now both these groups may lose not only welfare benefits but also shelter if they refuse to work. Once out on the street again, the parents will have the choice of finding friends or relatives to take their children or of turning them over to the courts and foster care.
Heidi Petersen, 31, who lives in a shelter in St. Paul, Minn., with her three children, ages 2 to 9, presents the test of any policy maker's intentions to help the homeless. After receiving welfare from 1994 to 1996, Ms. Peterson learned drafting and worked at an architectural firm for $10 an hour. It was enough to get by, even without child support from her children's two fathers.
But the drafting school started dunning her for about $10,000 in student loans. She was laid off, which put her behind on the rent for the lot where she parked her trailer, so she was out of a home. Meanwhile, the debt on the loans soared to $21,000.
For many Americans, there's the issue about how much to help someone like Ms. Peterson. They struggle with the conflict between extending a paternalistic hand and allowing Ms. Peterson the liberty of helping herself.
"Sometimes I think we go too far in saying, 'That's their choice,' " said Isabel V. Sawhill, economist and expert on poverty at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "But if we felt better about the kind of support we are providing, we wouldn't agonize about these people."
To many advocates for the homeless, however, the most acute problem is the most obvious: the cost of a home. "The fact is," said Cushing Dolbeare, a consultant and recently retired founder of the National Low Income Housing Council in Washington, "there are many households paying more than half their income for housing, or they're living in seriously substandard housing, or they're homeless."
In a study this year of incomes and rents, Ms. Dolbeare found that in New York City a minimum wage worker earning $10,712 a year, or about $893 a month, can afford a monthly rent up to $267.80 and still have enough for other basic needs. The fair-market rent of a two-bedroom apartment is $825. So to pay the rent and stay off welfare, she calculated that two adults must work 123 hours a week, or more than 60 hours each.
"We do have solutions here," said Doug Lasdon, executive director of the Urban Justice Center in New York, an advocacy group. One, he said, is government-supported housing. "That's much cheaper than psychiatric hospitals, jails and shelters."

HEADLINE: The Year 2000 and the Force of Change

 BODY:
It is early December. Before long, people all around the world will be counting off the final seconds as midnight leaps westward from time zone to time zone, carrying us all at long last into the year 2000. The closer the moment comes, the clearer it seems that our expectations for it have been, in some sense, overly dramatic. The mere arrival of the midnight hour will not occasion a rip in the surface of time nor, with any luck, will it trigger a generalized electronic debacle. But the coming of the year 2000 does have the merit of drawing our awareness of history and our expectations for the future into a tighter focus. With that in mind, this page will present over the next few weeks some reflections on what that focus reveals about the human journey through the past millennium and into the new century.
A year called 2000 was bound to come along sooner or later, no matter what calendar was used. But it was never certain that the year 2000 would turn out to be the year 2000 we are preparing to have. The end of the second millennium might have arrived at the crux of a little ice age or a century-long dust bowl. It might have brought a meteoric twilight of the kind that probably exterminated the dinosaurs, or it might have dawned on the ashes of global thermonuclear conflict. 
 Instead, the year 2000 arrives as the exclamation point in a sustained chapter of social and technological change that seems to be growing swifter and more global minute by minute. That fact can understandably tempt Americans toward triumphalist thinking. For it seems, at times, as though the volatility of American life, our social exuberance, our cultural restlessness, have come to a head at the end of this century, a time when the ideas of freedom, innovation and market-created wealth, so vital to our own identity, have spread around the world.
But our national history and events as fresh as the riots against the World Trade Organization in Seattle last week should sway us toward humility rather than hubris as we mark the approach of the year 2000 in a climate of hastening change. Our problem, the world's problem, is how to manage a global appetite for the fruits of that change.
In technologically advanced countries, especially as a result of this economically dynamic decade, the sense of movement, propulsion, velocity, even naked promise in these times is striking. But that promise is felt nowhere more hungrily than in parts of the globe relatively untouched by wealth. What we feel as the rush of change, the breeze blowing through our hair, they feel as a desiccating, hindering wind as they watch us advance into a future that threatens to leave them behind. The very dynamism that energizes us often exploits them. Of the dangers we face in a new century, few are more threatening than an inability or reluctance to bring stability and prosperity, without the taint of cultural imperialism, to places where the conditions of life have gone largely unameliorated.
Managing expectations in a wired but unequal world will be a central task of the future. Yet a study of humankind's progress in the second millennium -- and especially in the last century -- gives reason for optimism. The quickening pace of change has made the future less predictable, but it has also made the world's state of constant transformation more familiar, less forbidding, to everyone. We may not know what the future will contain, but we have a better idea of how to keep our balance as we go there and a good idea, too, that we can arrive with the best of our old values intact. The spectacle of Seattle, with its shattered glass and its cleavage between developed and poor nations, serves notice that we will have to define inclusive new values we would be hard pressed to imagine right now. Humans have always been adaptable. The difference on the threshold of the new millennium may be that we have begun to count on and plan for our own adaptability.
The approach of 2000 pulls our thoughts toward the grand sweep of history. Even so, most of us will probably read the end of this millennium in ordinary human terms, in light of our frailties as well as our possibilities. The eschatological dread inherent in true millennial thinking has been replaced by worries about Y2K, a secular eschatology in which the world does not end but the lights go out and it becomes hard to get cash at foreign A.T.M.'s. Instead of a day of omens and auspices, the 1st of January, 2000, will be a day of bowl games and parades, a festival of mild secular optimism, a holiday of inauguration and, perhaps, recovery from the old century's last hurrah on the night before. Above all, it will be a day to be grateful that we come to the end of this millennium in an expansive mood, the world all before us. What we make of it is ours to choose.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Protest Studies;
Skywriting, Collective Disappearance And Other Ways to Up the Revolution

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
HEY-HEY! Ho-ho! L.B.J. has got to go!" The classic syncopated chant from the antiwar movement of the late 1960's was borrowed by protesters who took to the streets of Seattle last week during the meeting of the World Trade Organization. But the words were tweaked to fit the multisyllabic objects of a broad new range of outrages, including corporate globalization, automatic teller machine fees, environmental imperialism, coffee-bar gentrification, genetically modified food, endangered turtles, logging, shrimp farming, aggressive landlords and unemployment among Hollywood studio workers.
"Hey-hey! Ho-Ho! W.T.O. has got to go!" was the closest the Seattle demonstrators got to a foot-stomping beat. 
 It's been a long time since Abbie Hoffman was able to speak volumes against the establishment by publishing a manifesto with the perversely simple title, "Steal this Book." A generation later, courses in "protest studies" are taught by colleges and even high schools. Demonstrations are now firmly supported by academic theory and even boot-camp training.
Perhaps inevitably, political action has moved from the dorm room to the Internet. Here are excerpts from two Web sites that had links to organizers of the Seattle protests. JOE SHARKEY
The Ruckus Society, founded in 1995 in Berkeley, Calif., sponsors camps and seminars to train protesters for environmental and human rights groups. Neatness counts when it comes to dealing with the news media, the Society says on its Web site (www.ruckus.org):
This chapter includes a checklist of what you should do, and when you should do it, to have the best shot at getting your action's message out. But these steps can be for naught if not done with thorough professionalism. Journalists are professional cynics, and if you're sloppy, they will notice it, and it will color their coverage. So go the extra mile; proofread the press release again; make the extra phone call. Never cut corners.
Ruckus says it has trained hundreds of activists in nonviolent civil disobedience, many at rugged camps at more than a dozen rural locations in North America.
Our showcase venue is Action Camp. Through these trainings, we help people learn the skills they need to practice civil disobedience safely and effectively. These trainings contain cerebral elements as well as physical, like classroom-style instruction for action planning, communicating with the media and nonviolent philosophy and practice. Safety and nonviolence are integral themes of each subject taught.
Among the courses taught at the camps:
Basic ropework, belaying, rappelling, knots, harness and hardware. Anchors, hammocks and platforms, jumaring, equipment care and repair. Protest situations such as tree sits, bridge blockades, building climbs, stack climbs, etc. will be illustrated, discussed and practiced.
Blockades:These are, in some regard, the brown bread basics of direct action. Among the subjects we will demonstrate, discuss and practice are: tree sits, tripods, lockboxes, railboxes, barrel blockades, vehicle blockades, water blockades, bridge actions, cattle guard blockades, putting cup blockades, etc. Learn how to lock your head to something. . . .
How to Hang Yourself from an Urban Structure: Disclaimer -- This is a basic guideline for how to create the image of a hanged man from a company sign (generally oil companies). Only an EXPERIENCED climber can comprehend and practice this form of direct action, and even then only with extensive training.
Rock-climbers, mountaineers, and activists with the desire but not the experience DO NOT QUALIFY to try this activity. Only people who have years of urban, direct action . . . should even consider training for this. You WILL get hurt attempting this without proper training, setting the movement for social justice, environmental security and human rights back in the eyes of the world. A good activist is a living activist.
Nonviolence Works expounds on the theory of modern social activism and provides links to human rights groups. One expert cited on its Web site (www.nonviolenceworks.org) is Gene Sharp, a director of the Albert Einstein Institution in Cambridge, Mass, and author of "The Methods of Nonviolent Action" (1973). In it, he lists 198 techniques for fighting the good fight, including:
5. Declarations of indictment and intention
12. Skywriting and earthwriting
14. Mock awards
22. Protest disrobings
23. Destruction of own property
28. Symbolic sounds
30. Rude gestures
31. "Haunting" officials
35. Humorous skits and pranks
52. Silence
53. Refusing honors
54. Turning One's Back
65. Stay at home
69. Collective disappearance
102. Prisoners strike
144. Stalling and obstruction
148. Mutiny
158. Self-exposure to the elements
162. Sit-in
165. Wade-in
169. Nonviolent air raids
177. Speak-in
In the 60's, protest philosophy was short and sweet. Professor Sharp makes a more expansive argument in "The Importance of Strategic Training in Nonviolent Struggle."
If one wishes to accomplish something, the chances of achieving that goal will be greatest if one uses one's available resources and leverage to maximum effectiveness. That means having a strategic plan which is designed to move from the present (in which the goal is not achieved) to the future (in which it is achieved). Strategy pertains to charting the course of action which makes it most likely to get from the present to a desired situation in the future. This type of thinking and planning, which some individuals undertake for ordinary purposes in daily life, should be undertaken by leaders of social and political movements.
Unfortunately, however, strategic planning is rarely given the attention it deserves with such movements. . . .
It's a long way from spring break in Fort Lauderdale, but those immersed in today's no-nonsense protest studies need a holiday trip from time to time, like this one offered by the Ruckus Society:
Alternative Spring Break Action Camp 2000
When: March 2000, exact dates to be announced later.
Where: Florida, exact location to be announced later.
Who: Student activists from all over the United States.
The Ruckus Society, Ozone Action, and Free the Planet have teamed up to co-sponsor the first Alternative Spring Break/Climate Change Action Camp. This ground-breaking training will bring a vanguard of student activists . . . to Florida for a spring break celebration markedly different from the standard fare.
The training is designed to increase the overall effectiveness of student advocacy by providing participants with a new set of technical campaign tactics and strategies, while building stronger ties of cooperation. We will emphasize campaign work that challenges the corporate culture that has laid claim to colleges and universities alike. While our primary focus will be on global warming, the Action Camp will also offer . . . skills to tackle a wide array of environmental, human rights, fair-trade, and social justice abuses that are inextricably tied to the "corporatization" of our academic institutions.

HEADLINE: The Nation: New World Disorder;
Free Trade Takes On Free Speech

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
THE biggest trade conference ever held on American soil was supposed to go like this: a Pacific rim city, grown wealthy on sales of software and planes to the global economy, would show off the fruits of unfettered commerce. Meanwhile, carefully choreographed street protests would enable President Clinton to nudge the delegates into taking action against such excesses of the global economy as child labor and pollution.
In this narrative, Seattle was to play the hero, while its companies and citizens were cast as bit players. Here was a dynamo of dot.com millionaires. A port full of ships stuffed with goods from every nation. A region that provides half the world's commercial jets. Protesters who behave while walking on stilts. 
 But the cast refused to follow the script.
Instead, the world saw neighborhoods choked by tear gas, homegrown Starbucks stores looted and more than 500 people arrested by a police force that looked, at times, like Ninja Turtles.
Perhaps more significantly, the weeklong Battle of Seattle left many participants with a sense that the transition to a new economic order might not be so easy or so smooth.
The troubles in Seattle last week exposed some of the free-form anger directed at globalization. It also turned the W.T.O., a meaningless acronym to most people, into organizational Velcro, to which everyone with anxieties about the future attached themselves.
A baffled delegate from Swaziland wondered how there could be so much objection to free trade in a city that is surrounded by its benefits.
But Seattle, for all its evident prosperity and surface civility, is, like the rest of the world, still getting used to the rapid change and consequent disorientation that high technology and global commerce have brought to so many people's lives. This could be heard in the voices of many of the 30,000 peaceful protesters, who fit into none of the traditional political categories of left or right. A primer on social protest methods, page 7.
Jennifer Talbot, for example, held up a cardboard symbol of genetically modified corn, a prime target of critics who believe that the new products of agribusiness will lead to a Frankenstein green grocer. "I'm not super-radical or anything," said Ms. Talbot, a Seattle resident. "I'm for democracy, human rights, labor and the environment. The world has to be about more than money."
Money, a seemingly endless torrent of it, has transformed this sleepy port city, the most unionized in the United States, a place where Teamsters could afford summer homes, into an urban area where 60,000 households have a net worth of more than $1 million. With the money has come regional cuisine, elegant shops and a hip image. But the gold rush has not touched every home. In fact, for every new millionaire, there is a household whose net worth has remained stagnant, or gone down. Working class streets and neighborhoods have been rapidly gentrified, tossing out one population in favor of a newer, wealthier one.
Small wonder that, for a long time, perhaps the best known organization here was a semi-humorous group called Lesser Seattle, dedicated to Edward Abbey's credo that growth for the sake of growth is the philosophy of the cancer cell.
"If you were to do a time lapse of newspaper headlines over the last hundred years, you'd see all these somewhat typical Seattle things, and then suddenly it's all about getting rich and go-go-dot-com," said Walt Crowley, a Seattle historian, whose Web site, historylink.org, served as a digital diary of the disturbances . "A lot of people feel left behind, and we haven't heard much from them until now."
Amazon.com, which sells everything under the sun from its headquarters atop one of the tallest hills in Seattle, did not even exist 10 years ago. And for those Seattle residents staring at Amazon's big brick palace while stuck in traffic that is not supposed to exist in the city often labeled the nation's most livable, the new economy is a decidedly mixed blessing.
For one thing, it is ruthlessly competitive. Boeing may be making more airplanes than ever before, but Airbus, the European consortium, has become a serious challenger, forcing the company to control costs, which in turn has made its work force increasingly anxious about contracts being farmed out overseas.
At the very time that W.T.O. dignitaries were touring Boeing factories around Seattle, members of its second largest union last week overwhelmingly rejected a new contract offer that the company had labeled final. And Boeing machinists marched in the demonstrations.
Washington apple growers, who export much of their crop, complained to President Clinton that expanded trade was not turning out to be the bonanza they thought it would be. Instead, international competition was keeping prices low and profits slim.
Even that most venerable of Seattle institutions, the Pike Place Market, where merchants sling salmon and sell the produce from the region's dwindling farms, staged a protest by people concerned about corporate agriculture.
The week was full of such vignettes, which taken together suggest that Seattle could turn out to be emblematic, but not at all in the sense that the trade conference organizers had hoped.
In fact, polls show a deep divide between rich and not-so-rich over the spoils of world trade. Among American families earning less than $50,000, just 37 percent hold a positive view of global free trade, according to the Pew Research Center. The figure rises to 63 percent positive for families earning above $75,000, then continues higher as the income brackets rise.
The trick of convincing the bottom half to get in on the ride and be happy appears to be far more difficult than many Seattle officials seemed to believe.
The most anguished of them all was probably Mayor Paul Schell, a free trade advocate and former port commissioner. But he also marched in demonstrations during the 1960's. When asked, a week before the conference opened, what was to prevent Seattle from becoming like Chicago of 1968, the year of a massive police crackdown against antiwar protesters, Mr. Schell said, "The difference is I'm no Mayor Daley," referring to the leader who ordered police to make mass arrests. "We are a gentle city where people agree to disagree about everything," he said.
Now, Mr. Schell has the distinction of being one of the few American mayors in recent years to call out the National Guard, declare a civil emergency and order police to disperse citizens with tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets.
For the W.T.O., it is not clear that matters will quickly change for the better. President Clinton had hoped that vigorous protests in Seattle -- he had urged people to "get it all out of their system" -- would move trade ministers to include concerns about the environment, labor and human rights. But the talks collapsed as many delegates rejected of Mr. Clinton's call for openness.
After looking at the shattered windows of downtown in the most trade-dependent city in the United States, Mr. Schell said his belief in globalization and Seattle's place in it had not been altered. But his heart and gut were affected. "What happened here this week makes sick," he said.

HEADLINE: Saying No to W.T.O.

BYLINE: By Michael Kazin; Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown, is co-author (with Maurice Isserman) of "America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960's."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle last week may seem like a postmodern update of the 1960's. "Whose streets? Our streets" was the chant as young demonstrators dared the flak-jacketed police to drag them away. But the antic style of the loose coalition of environmentalists, unionists and others obscures an earlier and more instructive historical parallel: the anticorporate insurgency of the 1890's.
A century ago, there was mass outrage against big business in the United States. Best-selling books and popular magazines blasted the concentration of wealth and the fecklessness of mainstream politicians. The People's Party assembled a broad coalition of small farmers, craft workers and middle-class reformers to battle the "monopolists" and "plutocrats" accused of plundering the hard-working majority in America and other industrial societies. In 1892, Ignatius Donnelly, a Populist spellbinder, charged that "a vast conspiracy has been organized on two continents and is rapidly taking possession of the world." Favorite culprits were J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie and railroad barons like George Pullman on this side of the Atlantic, and financiers like the Rothschilds on the other. 
 Of course, the alleged crimes of these magnates were not the same ones that have been roiling the streets of Seattle. A century ago, most of the Populists viewed trade tariffs on imports as nothing more than subsidies for big corporations, and, aside from the work of pioneers like John Muir, the environmental movement had not yet arrived.
But then, as now, Americans of different backgrounds and ideologies could agree that big business had gained sway over national governments and local communities and that it cherished no value save the bottom line. Prohibitionists and Christian Socialists joined the Populist uprising in hopes of curbing unregulated businesses that ran 24-hour saloons and exploited child laborers. The moral reformers publicized the demands of hard-pressed farmers and wage earners alongside their own.
As every schoolchild once knew, the bubble of the dissenting alliance burst in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan, an anticorporate Democrat endorsed by the Populists, lost the presidential election to William McKinley, the Republican nominee, who outspent his rival by more than 10 to 1. But mass discontent blazed on. And this discontent helped progressives and, a generation later, New Dealers establish some protections for workers and a limited welfare state that gradually lifted many Americans into the middle class. Those reformers were motivated by the belief that, as Bryan bluntly put it in 1896, "One of the most important duties of government is to put rings in the noses of hogs."
For most of the past 60 years, hot wars and the cold war pushed anticorporate resentments to the background. The conflicts of armed states and their militant ideologies made the old Populist movement seem outmoded and even quaint. And in the 1990's, prosperity convinced many Americans that the free market lifts all boats. But wage inequalities have grown starker, too, and to many, the promises of globalization have seemed ephemeral.
The protests in Seattle should remind us that big business retains its power to enrage as well as to enrich. The brave new marketplace -- as represented by the W.T.O. -- regards labor rights and environmental protection as "externalities," potential impediments to the free flow of goods, bytes and profits. Even political leaders seem ancillary to the real center of power. In Seattle, few protesters bothered to denounce President Clinton; Nike, Starbucks and the producers of genetically engineered crops were seen as far more potent enemies.
To advance their cause, the leaders of this still embryonic movement will have to surmount obstacles their predecessors at the turn of the last century could not have imagined.
Multinational corporations manufacture affordable products that make life easier and more pleasurable for millions of consumers. No doubt the Seattle protesters have benefited as much as anyone else from the efficiently produced goods and services of the global economy. The corporate chiefs of today are much harder to loathe than the robber barons who crushed the trade unions and ruthlessly exploited their workers.
There is also the incongruity of today's coalitions: unionists and environmentalists are not the most compatible of allies. They have often clashed over whether jobs or the environment should come first, and the needs of workers in poorer nations could inflame this conflict anew.
Then again, like the Populists, today's foes of globalization could become victims of their own success. Despite Bryan's loss in 1896, he remained the most prominent force in his party and led the Democrats in embracing reforms to aid workers and small farmers. In 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt, who was no Populist, but a progressive Republican, scorned the "malefactors of great wealth." During his presidency, he battled their power, most notably ordering the prosecution of a railroad monopoly for violations of a rarely enforced antitrust law.
As a result, most Populists rejoined the old parties while a minority rejected the entire system and became Socialists. In the end, the Populists fell far short of achieving the radical democracy they had yearned for. But America's leaders did adopt some of their main proposals, including the income tax and the popular election of senators.
It's too soon to gauge the significance of the battle of Seattle: will future historians view it as the coming-out party for a truly international populist movement or a mere spasm of outrage by misfits in the new global economy? But one thing is certain. Once more, ordinary citizens have asserted what the historian C. Vann Woodward decades ago called their ability "to shock the seats of power and privilege and furnish the periodic therapy that seems necessary to the health of our democracy."

HEADLINE: Bastion of Confederacy Finds Its Future May Hinge on Rejecting the Past

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In earlier decades, when the battle flag of the Confederacy still defined Alabama's racial climate from atop the State Capitol, other states made sure that businesses on the move knew the precise nature of the flag's divisive symbolism.
"It's no secret they used it as ammunition against us when we were trying to get businesses to come here," said Robert Sutton, a spokesman for the Alabama Development Office, the state's economic development agency. "We would see the clippings they would distribute about our racial problems. We knew what they were saying about us, and we'll never know how many companies it scared off." 
 But to the relief of its economic recruiters, Alabama took its flag down in 1993 after a lawsuit by black legislators. Although there were many other factors at work, the state's efforts to move past its history helped create an economic boom in the 1990's, attracting major manufacturers like Mercedes and Honda with promises that the romance of racism had ended. Now company officials scouting the state are often given a tour of the Civil Rights Institute, a popular museum in Birmingham.
Today, the Confederate flag flies over only one Capitol dome, in South Carolina, which is conducting the latest in a series of anguished debates about whether the flag represents a war for slavery or for states' rights. For the first time, however, the state's business leaders have moved to the forefront of the efforts to lower the flag, making precisely the same arguments that Alabama knows so well. If South Carolina -- and for that matter, the rest of the South -- is to join the pitiless competition of the global market, many business leaders are saying, it must put behind itself the tokens of an earlier, isolated era.
"The Southern states have historically been fiercely independent and proud, always convinced they could row their own boat and make it alone," said Paula Harper Bethea, the chairwoman of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. "But the shrinking world in which we live, the way technology has brought us together, has made us come to realize that we are not islands unto ourselves. If we're going to be part of the next millennium, we have to move that flag off our Statehouse dome, and put it in a place of honor elsewhere."
The business leaders are utterly serious about the current effort, which they say is only marginally related to fear of the economic boycott declared this summer by the N.A.A.C.P. that gave rise to the latest flag debate. State legislators, who must assent before the flag can be removed, say they are under heavy pressure from corporate executives around the state who are warning privately of political consequences if the flag stays up. On Thursday, leaders of the chamber of commerce bluntly told their usual allies in the House Republican caucus that businesses were considering cutting off campaign contributions to lawmakers who support the flag.
That did not go over well among the Republican forces who have kept the flag flying, many of whom are from essentially all-white districts and have no real fear of a re-election battle. One House member, Jake Knotts of Lexington County, said no threat of reduced campaign contributions could possibly get him to change his vote and lower the flag.
"I'd like to tell you one thing," Mr. Knotts told the business group. "The Confederate flag's not for sale here."
But many less passionate South Carolinians predict that the flag will eventually fall, and that when it does, it will be not because of the historical or moral arguments against it, but because of the economic pressure that so often is the jackhammer of change in the South. It was business that first conceded to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birmingham protests against segregation in 1963. It was business that first helped integrate the South Carolina schools around the same time. And it was business that first supported the "New South" governors of the 1970's and 80's who began transforming the region's politics.
One of those governors was David M. Beasley, the previous governor of South Carolina, who waged a lengthy but unsuccessful campaign to remove the flag, and who did everything possible to keep it out of state pamphlets and official photos. The current governor, Jim Hodges, has tried to broker a compromise that would move the flag elsewhere on the Statehouse grounds, but has encountered opposition from legislators who refuse to act as long as the N.A.A.C.P. is urging tourists and conventions to stay out of the state.
"This is how progress gets made in the South -- driven by economic concerns," said Bernard E. Powers Jr., professor of history at the College of Charleston. "There is a realization that the inequitable provision of education not only hurt black Southerners but also retarded the economic progress that any state hoped to make. You can't go on celebrating the oppression of African-Americans and expect to attract outside dollars and corporate interests."
Or, in the words of Julian Bond, national president of the N.A.A.C.P., "Money talks."
In the days of the civil rights movement, money talked about the need for the South to join the American mainstream. Now, if anything, the pressure is even greater to join the global economy, and foreign employers do not want the slightest hint of a divided work force or a reputation for backwardness.
"Anything that causes division within a state makes it less attractive to a potential employer, particularly from overseas," said Neal Wade, president of the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, a business-financed organization that promotes job creation in the state. "You have to do everything you can to minimize those controversies, because that's the last thing a company wants to come in the middle of."
South Carolina has already enjoyed considerable success in attracting foreign investment, drawing large manufacturing plants owned by BMW and Michelin and dozens of related suppliers. (Both companies have urged a quick resolution to the flag issue, with Michelin being particularly vocal about the need to move the flag off the dome.)
But the state is eager for a larger share of the high-technology industries that have found a more congenial home in North Carolina, and many of those companies do not want to be associated with a state that seems more interested in its past than its future. While state legislators have found ample time to debate the flag, other issues have been neglected: the average College Board score of South Carolina's high school students has remained at or near the bottom of the 50 states.
"Because of this flag issue, the more sophisticated businesses don't view us in the light that would encourage them to expand in South Carolina," said Joel Smith, president of the Bank of America's east region, based in Columbia. "It reflects poorly on our reputation, and we have more important things to talk about, like education."
Almost despite itself, however, the South continues to be preoccupied with struggles over Civil War symbolism, even in some of the more progressive states. Many black residents have chafed for years about elements of the Confederate Flag that still remain in the state flags of Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, but none of those state legislatures are interested in changing the design. Alvin Holmes, a black state representative from Montgomery who was instrumental in having the flag lowered, has also tried unsuccessfully for years to make the phrase "Heart of Dixie" optional on Alabama license plates.
Those who remain attached to the memory of the Confederacy say that the drive toward globalization has homogenized the South as surely as it has begun to erase some of the cultural differences between countries.
"We're losing the things that make the South the South," said Michael Chappell, director of the Alabama Flag Trust, a group that is trying to restore the rebel flag to the Capitol on Confederate holidays. "When tourists come to Montgomery, and they go to the visitors' center, the first thing they ask is where they can buy Confederate stuff. Take away all those symbols, and we'll lose our tourism."
But many people in South Carolina say the recently discovered common purpose of disparate groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce could herald a new moment for the state, in which symbols are disentangled from reality, and history ends its dominion over the present.
"I think this is about more than money," said John S. Rainey, a prominent white businessman and Republican who until last week served as chairman of Santee Cooper, the state-owned water and electric utility. "It's about doing the right thing, the honorable thing. There is a sea change going on in South Carolina, an awakening to what we can be if we really start tackling the old, hard issues."

HEADLINE: Japan Beckons, and East Asia's Youth Fall in Love

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon in Taipei's fashionable Hsih Men Ting district, a sales clerk in Tower Records switched the store's background music from mellow jazz to the upbeat ballad "First Love" sung by the Japanese pop star Hikaru Utada.
Suddenly, a group of Taiwanese teenagers who were perusing the store's vast Japanese music section screamed at the top of their lungs and began singing the Japanese lyrics to "First Love." 
 "Whenever we want to liven things up around here, all we have to do is play a Japanese artist," said Johnny Chung, a cashier. "We Taiwanese go crazy for just about anything that's Japanese."
Around the corner from Tower Records, young Taiwanese women gathered in Hsih Men Ting's main square to show off their brown-dyed hair, salon-tanned skin, platform shoes and glittery teardrop stickers, long the fashion rage in Japan.
The young women, who looked as if they just stepped off a Japanese tour bus, talked of rushing home to see their favorite soap opera, "Great Teacher Onizuka," a Japanese drama starring the handsome actor Takashi Sorimachi.
"We like Japanese things because Japan is a very advanced country with a very sophisticated lifestyle," said Vicky Chen, 18, a high school student. "I dream of visiting there one day."
Her classmate, Kelly Chou, concurred: "Taiwan is too conservative, but Japanese fashion and music are so daring, so cutting edge. I love them."
The Taiwanese are not the only devoted fans of things Japanese, which have become immensely popular across East Asia, especially among young people who adore Japanese music, movies, television, animation, fashion and food. The current craze for Japanese popular culture products among young Asians is unprecedented in its scope and size.
In South Korea, for example, Japanese culture cafes and teahouses are quickly replacing American fast-food restaurants and European-style coffee houses as the preferred meeting places for college students. Japanese rock and jazz bands are more popular than their Korean counterparts, and many soap operas, game shows and television dramas are direct copies of Japanese programs.
In Hong Kong, newsstands cannot stock enough copies of Japanese comic books and fashion magazines. Japanese television dramas have huge followings.
In China, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, bootleg copies of Japanese music, movies and merchandise like Hello Kitty dolls are popular.
The number of Asians studying Japanese has increased 29 percent in the past five years, according to the Japan Foundation. The foundation, a government agency that promotes cultural exchanges, attributes much of the growth to young people who are interested in Japanese popular culture or joining a Japanese firm.
"I don't think we can ever underestimate the power of Japanese culture, which now ranks second in terms of global market share" behind the United States, said Kang Hun, a leading Korean cultural critic who teaches a course in popular culture at Hong-Ik University in Seoul.
"Culture is like water," he said. "It flows from stronger nations to weaker ones. People tend to idolize countries that are wealthier, freer, and more advanced, and in Asia that country is Japan."
Other factors contributing to the popularity of Japanese culture include Japan's proximity, the availability of Japanese programs on cable and satellite television and aggressive marketing and packaging.
"Geographically and culturally, we are closer to Japan than to the United States and Europe, so it's natural that Japanese products would be a hit here in Hong Kong," said Lisa Leung, who teaches cross-cultural studies at Hong Kong's Lingnan University. "Just look at Japanese fashion: it fits us better than American and European styles."
But Mr. Kang said that perhaps the main reason Japanese cultural products are so popular in Asia is that they borrow heavily from Western culture, particularly in their reliance on sex and violence.
"Much of Japanese popular culture is Western culture with an Asian face," Mr. Kang said. "So Koreans and Chinese who are familiar with Western culture feel a unique Asian trait in Japanese culture that is very appealing."
Winnie Lan, research director for Ogilvy & Mather Company in Taiwan, said that Japanese cultural products are popular because they are generally of high quality, and well marketed.
"The Japanese make all their products look good at least on the outside," Ms. Lan said. "That's why almost all the Japanese artists we know are packaged as idols."
The keen interest in Japanese culture among young Asians is a major departure from the decades of disdain that their elders who lived under the iron hand of Japanese colonization have had for things Japanese.
Many older Asians have told their children and grandchildren of the sufferings they endured under the Japanese and warned them of the "evils" of Japanese culture. South Korea, reacting to Japan's brutal colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945, long restricted both the import of Japanese cultural products and the performance and display of Japanese art forms.
Today, South Korea allows the staging of Japanese dance, classical music and theater performances without restrictions. New rules announced in September permit performances by Japanese entertainers in medium-size sites and screenings of Japanese G-rated movies that have received international honors.
Indeed, long before the government began lifting the restrictions, Japanese cultural products were being integrated formally and informally into Korean society. "The government saw the handwriting on the wall," Mr. Kang said.
At Kakehashi, a Japanese cafe in Seoul, college students gather to practice Japanese, read Japanese fashion magazines and watch videos by their favorite Japanese bands like Kinki Kids and Malice Mizer.
Takizawa Ushio, 25, a Japanese graduate student who teaches Japanese literature in Seoul, said that given the history of bad blood between Korea and Japan, he was concerned that he would not be welcomed in South Korea.
"I was afraid that the Koreans wouldn't like me, and there are some who don't," he said. "But I have been surprised that so many Japanese things are popular here and that there are many Koreans who want to know me just because I am Japanese."
Still, some Koreans feel that their government has moved too quickly, and fear that some aspects of Japanese popular culture, like its liberal depiction of violence and sex and strong emphasis on commercialism, might negatively effect Korea.
The Seoul Y.M.C.A. has established a media monitoring group that scrutinizes imported Japanese programs and Korean programs based on Japanese genres.
If the Y.M.C.A. determines that a program violates Korean norms and ethics, the group lobbies government censors to have it restricted.
"Opening Korea to Japanese culture may be correct logically, but from a historical and political point of view it couldn't be more wrong," said Lee Seung Jung, the executive director of the Seoul Y.M.C.A. "Because of Japan's occupation, many Koreans cannot tell which part of their culture is ours and which part came from Japan. There are too many issues that have not yet been resolved."
Nowhere outside Japan does its culture appear more cherished than in Taiwan, which was a Japanese colony for 50 years. Unlike in Korea and China, however, Japan's rule of Taiwan was fairly harmonious.
"Most of the infrastructure in Taiwan was established by the Japanese during the 50-year-rule, and that infrastructure later became the cornerstone of the government's extraordinary economic achievement," said Liao Hsianghsiong, deputy director of the governing Nationalist Party's department of cultural affairs. "Generally speaking, the Taiwanese don't hate Japan."
Back at Hsih Men Ting, a group of young Taiwanese men, sporting the latest androgynous look that is the mode in Japan, checked out the young women in the square. With brown-toned hair and arched eyebrows and dressed entirely in form-fitting black, Chung Shuan-lin was ready to make his move.
"Our look is cool," he said. "It's Japanese. It's what all the girls like."

HEADLINE: Economic Debate Emerging in Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The presidential candidates are setting out increasingly specific economic policy positions, highlighting differences within and between the parties over how to take advantage of and extend the nation's prosperity.
From sweeping issues like taxes, trade and Social Security to narrower topics like the Microsoft antitrust case, the candidates are starting to debate ways of building on the economy's strengths while addressing the problems of an aging population and the needs of people who have not benefited from the long expansion. 
 In some important areas, there is broad agreement across party lines. Although the large and sometimes violent protests surrounding the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle are sure to create political headaches for Vice President Al Gore, he and all the other candidates with the exception of Patrick J. Buchanan support free trade.
There is a consensus in both parties that the two-thirds of the projected federal budget surplus generated by the Social Security system should be off limits for tax cuts or general government spending.
"It's striking how the parties have really kind of melded together on a lot of issues," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group in Washington.
But on many economic issues, the divides between and within the parties remain substantial.
There are widely divergent views about what to do with the non-Social Security surplus, estimated at nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, and about how prudent it is to count on the surplus materializing.
There is a rising debate about how to put Social Security on a firmer financial footing, and particularly about whether any changes should include sensitive steps like raising the retirement age. And although Democrats have joined Republicans in viewing market forces as the most powerful tool for solving economic problems, there is a continuing ideological battle between the parties over what role government should play in dealing with issues ranging from poverty to the Internet.
By laying out his $483 billion tax-cutting plan this week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas set off a debate among his fellow Republican candidates over how far to go in returning the surplus to taxpayers, and he drew sharp criticism from Mr. Gore, who called the plan reckless.
Mr. Gore grew more assertive in claiming credit for the strong economy, and argued that his approach of prudent spending increases and continued debt reduction was the best way to keep the good times rolling. Bill Bradley, the former senator, defended his $65-billion-a-year health care and poverty-fighting programs as prudent and affordable in the face of increasing attacks from Mr. Gore.
Mr. Bush's plan, which includes reductions in all income tax rates, a tax break for many two-income couples and a doubling of the child credit, would use nearly all of the non-Social Security surplus for the next five years. His proposal would primarily benefit wealthier taxpayers, the people who pay the most in taxes, but he presented it as an effort to make it easier for the working poor to reach the middle class.
From the right, Steve Forbes attacked Mr. Bush's plan as too timid and reiterated his support for replacing the entire income tax system with a single-rate flat tax. Senator John McCain of Arizona said it would be a mistake to assume the projected surpluses would materialize, and argued for a more narrowly targeted set of tax cuts.
"I wouldn't count on these surpluses, although I'm very optimistic about the future of the economy," Mr. McCain said in the Republican debate in New Hampshire on Thursday. Mr. McCain said he would finance tax cuts by cutting pork barrel programs and government waste.
Mr. Gore made clear that he would emphasize the same themes as President Clinton in economic policy: allocating the non-Social Security surplus to a variety of programs, from the military to Medicare and education, while using all of the Social Security surplus to reduce the national debt.
Mr. Gore said Mr. Bush's tax plan would leave no money for other needs and could require dipping into the Social Security surplus. And the vice president also sought to portray himself as more fiscally responsible than Mr. Bradley, whose health care program Mr. Gore said could prove to be a budget buster.
"It is not compassionate to provide nothing for Social Security and Medicare," Mr. Gore said. "It is not conservative to blow the entire surplus. George Bush and Bill Bradley have forgotten how to live within their means."
Mr. Gore has been open to a limited tax cut for specific purposes like promoting retirement savings and helping the working poor. Mr. Bradley said tax cuts would not be a priority for him unless the economy turned down and needed fiscal stimulus to spark a recovery.
In his emphasis on providing more access to health care and on reducing child poverty, Mr. Bradley is asserting that the nation should use its good fortune to expand the benefits of prosperity to those left behind. Among the Republicans, Mr. Bush is striking the same theme, although he would not explicitly designate as much money to the problems or attack them in the same way.
"The poverty debate seems to have re-emerged as a serious item for discussion," said Van Doorn Ooms, research director for the Committee on Economic Development, a research group.
More than in previous presidential campaigns, the candidates must confront issues related to technology. Mr. Forbes, in the debate on Thursday, said the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, the dominant supplier of the operating software for computers, would be rendered moot by the changes sweeping the industry. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah responded that the company's aggressive efforts to hinder competition justified a legal response.
But so far none of the candidates have talked explicitly about how to foster the most powerful force reshaping the economy: the ways in which technology is allowing businesses to become more efficient and improve productivity. Economists say a resurgence in productivity growth over the last five years is the single most important factor in explaining the nation's prosperity.
"We ought to be talking more about two themes -- continuing the great rise in productivity and investing more and more effectively in our people so the circle of prosperity is widened in the future," said Robert B. Reich, a former labor secretary in the Clinton administration who now supports Mr. Bradley.
"These are not Republican or Democratic themes, but they are at the center of the real economy," Mr. Reich said. "Hopefully the candidates will talk more about them. Everything else pales by comparison."

HEADLINE: Some Perched in Ivory Tower Gain Rosier View of Suburbs

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
Everyone loves to hate the suburbs.
Sociologists say they are deadening, a prison for women and a desert for children. Environmentalists call them empires of excess that eat open space and worship the automobile. Novelists and filmmakers assume that behind every picket fence lurks misery, isolation and alcoholism. 
 Everyone loves to hate the suburbs except for the people who live there, people who, sometime in the last few years, became a majority of all Americans, or 138,231,000 people, according to the Census Bureau.
And now those suburbanites are beginning to hear a faint but growing chorus of support from the very camp that has so long disdained the thought of life on a subdivision lot.
In a handful of new books and studies, academic revisionists are reporting that suburbia, far from crushing lives, has had a liberating effect on residents, particularly many women. They have found that the sense of community can be as strong on a suburban block as it is in a small town. And they record how homeownership produced a significant increase in the standards of living and personal wealth for generations of former urban renters.
"The suburbs are starting to get some respect in academia because people want to know what the science is behind these claims that suburbs are cold and friendless places that don't work ecologically," said Jack Nasar, a professor of city and regional planning at Ohio State University, who has conducted studies comparing the sense of community in suburbs and in small towns.
Prof. Robert Thompson, who teaches American popular culture at Syracuse University, said, "There is a sense among some academics now that the suburbs have developed their own culture and that it's time to move past the cliches that were formed after World War II.
"Colleges are moving to suburban campuses, there is art and employment and crime and museums and both the good and the bad of the cities in the suburbs" as they have become a much more diverse environment, he said.
Sometimes, the revisionists had to overcome the old prejudice themselves.
"I went to Levittown expecting to find that people who lived in cookie cutter houses lived cookie cutter lives," said Barbara Kelly, the rare books curator at Hofstra University and a historian whose book, "Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown," was published by the State University of New York Press in 1993.
"I went to find women who were full of angst and children who were stunted and men who were emasculated," Dr. Kelly went on, "and instead I found people who were extremely grateful to be where they were, who took their homes and expanded them as they moved into the middle class, and along the way their lives expanded with them."
Next month, Basic Books is scheduled to publish "Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened," by Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, professors of American studies at the State University of New York's Old Westbury campus, on Long Island. They, too, had to adjust their analytical compass.
"I was snobbish toward the suburbs," Professor Baxandall said. "I expected people here to be bored and unhappy. I thought they would miss the cosmopolitan life of the city. I thought the kids would be in a hurry to move to the city."
Once they started interviewing, the two professors found a different story. "Instead of being placid, conformist, keeping-up-with-the-Joneses, we found that suburbanites were dealing with important civil rights issues and that there were important struggles for women's rights going on," Professor Ewan said. "In Levittown, the people who built the institutions of the community were not your tired, bored housewife."
This is hardly the mainstream academic take on the suburbs.
Influential critiques like Kenneth T. Jackson's "Crabgrass Frontier," James Howard Kunstler's "The Geography of Nowhere," Robert Fishman's "Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of Suburbia" and Donna Gaines's "Teenage Wasteland" are part of a literature of disdain for suburban life so ingrained in the culture that it has become a kind of accepted wisdom.
After all, Hollywood hasn't made the suburbs look healthy since "Leave It to Beaver" was on television. Now Todd Solondz, a New Jerseyan whose production company is called Suburban Films, makes movies like "Welcome to the Dollhouse," about alienated children and vacuous adults, and "Happiness," about alienated children and one vacuous adult who is also a child rapist. Ang Lee's "Ice Storm," set in New Canaan, Conn., said that no grown-up tells the truth in suburbia. In "American Beauty," this year's acclaimed suburban-life-is-hell movie, the only normal, well-adjusted people are gay. Or dead.
Yet some academicians and planners are insisting that the suburbs are far more layered and complex than they have been portrayed. In fact, the white-bread, Ozzie and Harriet suburbs did not last past about 1965, said James W. Hughes, dean of the school of planning and public policy at Rutgers University.
"From '65 on, we really had the urbanization of the suburbs, to the point where the suburbs today are really cities in horizontal form," Dr. Hughes said. "You don't have the density of the city, but all the economic functions that were once in cities are now in suburbs. There are hospitals, universities, cultural facilities and a wide variety of housing choices and therefore a multiplicity of household types -- not just one-family, but single-person households and specialty retirement communities and divorced households."
And there are jobs. According to Dr. Hughes, virtually all of the jobs created in New Jersey during the current economic expansion have been in the suburbs. Among other things, those jobs created a new life for suburban women.
"The early idea of the suburbs had been to isolate women and children from the evil world of work and the city," said Dr. Fishman, a professor of history at Rutgers University's Camden campus. "Now the explosion of office jobs in suburbia has been the way married and middle-class women get back into the work force."
It was precisely the lives of suburban women that most interested Professors Baxandall and Ewen in their research for "Picture Windows" on Long Island.
They found Barbara Ware of Levittown and Patricia Sullivan of Roosevelt, two middle-class stay-at-home moms who met at a 1970's job fair organized by the National Organization for Women, started a weather-stripping business and now run a job-training project called Jobs for Women.
"There is a view that nothing ever happens in the suburbs, that women, especially, are stuck in a situation that never changes," Professor Ewen said in an interview. "And yet Barbara Ware and Patricia Sullivan experienced a major change in their lives, and now are changing the lives of other women."
Herbert L. Gans, the Columbia University sociologist who became the father of suburbanology with his sympathetic 1967 study, "The Levittowners," said disdain for the suburbs among the elite in the arts and academia was tinged with snobbism.
"This attitude started with the urban upper middle class who said, 'Look at those dumb ones who have moved out to the suburbs where they are conformists and being homogenous and being unfaithful to each other,' " Mr. Gans said. "But if you look at it, the attack was always against the middle class," he went on. "The upper middle class has been living in the suburbs since the 1880's, when the railroad communities started outside of Philadelphia and Westchester and on the North Shore of Long Island, and nobody wrote ticky-tacky songs about them."
Dr. Kelly of Hofstra University, writing about homeowners of Levittown, makes a similar point: "I think one of the things the critics of the suburbs overlook is that the alternative for these people was not Garden City or the Main Line outside Philadelphia. The alternative was the Brooklyn tenements or two-family houses in Queens," she said. "These people were renters before World War II, and after the war they were homeowners, so you should not compare them to the upper middle class and say, 'Gee, their lives are really empty!' You have to compare them to what their lives would have been, and as far as I could see, they were happier after they moved to the suburbs."
The new defenders of the suburbs concede that there are environmental problems with suburban development, that the spread of housing eats up land and energy and contributes to air and water pollution. Their interest, however, is in the people and their lives.
"There are these other problems," Professor Nasar said, "but the question of whether the suburbs suit the people who live there is settled, and the answer is yes."
Professor Nasar's study compared the views of residents of the prosperous and traditional village of Westerville, Ohio, which lies about 15 miles from downtown Columbus, with those of people who lived in the new, low-density suburbs outside Westerville.
"We created an 11-point instrument to compare responses," he said, "and what we found was that the traditional high-density, mixed-use settlement had only slightly less auto usage and did not have a higher sense of community than in conventional low-density suburbs."
Professor Jackson, the author of "Crabgrass Frontier" and a Columbia University historian, argued that the sense of community that suburban revisionists are reporting could be a fragile one.
"I do think the sense of community these people are finding is probably there, but I think it's age-skewed," he said. "When people have children, they have a much greater sense of community because the schools foster it. But once the kids have left, you have people moving out and going to Florida because the community bonds were not strong enough to hold them."
Still, even Professor Jackson finds himself a part-time suburbanite. He thinks of his apartment at 86th Street and Columbus Avenue as his main home, but he also has a house in suburban Chappaqua, N.Y., where his wife teaches school.
Professor Baxandall concedes she and Professor Ewen began their research completely out of touch with suburban life. The two expected to find a particular animus toward the suburbs among their college students, since it has been axiomatic for years that the suburbs cause youthful alienation.
"We did not find that the kids thought of it as a wasteland," Professor Baxandall went on. "They enjoyed themselves, they drove around, they went to clubs, they hung out together. A lot of them talked about boredom, but so do city kids."
Suburbanites might be amused at the ignorance of academicians and city residents so out of touch with the way most Americans live. But Professor Ewen said a change in the conventional wisdom can come slowly.
"I can't say there are too many of us yet," she said. "But there are people who are beginning to think of the suburbs as a place, as opposed to no place."

HEADLINE: Hollywood on Hudson (Both Sides Now);
New Jersey's Film Industry Grows With New York's, Not at Its Expense

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
It would be tempting to view New Jersey's recent overtures toward the film and television industry as just another skirmish in its long rivalry with New York City.
After all, the two neighbors have clashed over garbage hauling and airports in recent years, and threatened to steal each other's sports teams. They've bid against each other for stock exchanges, investment firms and countless other major employers. Their fight over Ellis Island went to the United States Supreme Court. 
 And at first glance, New Jersey's recent efforts to attract more film and television business could easily be interpreted as another volley in the border war. Starting this month, the state will begin granting tax breaks to production crews shooting on location, incentives intended to match those offered by the city. A newly opened sound stage in North Bergen is being used to shoot the series "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," a show set in Manhattan. And after the actor Robert De Niro and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films lost their bid to open a film studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, they toured a site in Harrison last month.
But officials on both sides of the Hudson say the script is different this time, with a far more dramatic twist: interstate cooperation.
The region's talent pool of production crews and performing artists has become so inextricably linked that a project filmed on one side of the border is almost certain to employ people from the other. And New York has been enjoying such a boom in film projects that on several recent occasions, New Jersey film recruiters said, officials there have actually referred projects to New Jersey, because there was no suitable space available in the city.
In a growing number of projects, filming actually takes place in both states. The hit HBO television series "The Sopranos," about a Mafia family that lives outside Newark, shoots both on the streets of New Jersey and a sound stage in Queens.
With a large number of Los Angeles-based filming projects now heading north to Canada -- where the exchange rates, labor agreements and tax incentives can generate huge savings -- film commissioners in New York and New Jersey have been united by a common enemy.
"This is one of those areas where our gains aren't necessarily New York's losses," said Steven Gorelick, associate director of the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Development Commission. "We want people to come to New York. And once they do, we want them to know that it's as affordable to shoot anything else they need in New Jersey as it is in California."
Even the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, never shy about defending its territory, agrees that the growth of the New Jersey film business might actually benefit the city.
"With New Jersey following New York's lead, it will boost the economic benefits for the whole region," said Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.
The collegiality, however grudging, is born of sheer pragmatism.
New York City and New Jersey have both seen such steep increases in the number of productions, and the millions of dollars they add to the economy, that they can afford to cooperate.
Since 1994, the number of films shot in New York City has doubled, to 221 last year, and the estimated benefit to the city economy swelled to a record $2.57 billion in 1998. Although preliminary reports from the Screen Actors Guild suggest that the number of feature films may have dipped during 1999, there are still 14 television shows being shot in the city, 8 of them new, and the employment picture remains encouraging.
Statistics from the New York State Department of Labor indicate that the television and film production industry is now the fastest growing segment of the state's job market, said Patricia Swinney Kaufman, deputy director of the state's film office.
In New Jersey, where Thomas Edison invented the motion picture camera and the world's first movie studio was opened in West Orange in the 1890's, a similar, although far smaller, resurgence has also been under way over the past two decades. Since the state founded its film commission in 1978, the number of films being made there has grown from almost nothing to last year's record total of 605 projects, including 86 feature films, and an estimated $58.1 million economic impact.
During the past few years, New Jersey has been home to shoots featuring enough big name stars to fill a thousand gossip columns: from Denzel Washington, Woody Allen and Kevin Kline to Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. This week, Nicolas Cage was on location in Teaneck for a film project called "Family Man." And Woody Allen crossed the Hudson to film some scenes for his current movie, "Sweet and Lowdown."
Some state legislators have grown so emboldened by New Jersey's success that they openly talk of poaching business from New York City -- the way the city attracted the first studios from New Jersey in the late 1890's and Hollywood lured them to the West Coast by 1915.
State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., who sponsored the bill granting new tax breaks, said it would be naive for New York not to expect its neighbors to try to cash in on the film bonanza.
"It's a fact of life in today's economy," he said. "So we try to fight fair, but fight hard. We owe it to the citizens of this state to try to get every business we can."
Even when New Jersey does snatch up a project that interests New York, there can often be a spillover effect. "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," for instance, shoots its interior scenes in New Jersey, but its exteriors in Manhattan.
Many industry experts say those kinds of bilateral arrangements illustrate how the two states stand to gain by working together. There are so many scripts written specifically for New York City, and so many landmark locations like Times Square or Greenwich Village that simply cannot be duplicated elsewhere, that they end up in Manhattan by default.
So, when it comes to production companies that need an urban setting, New Jersey film recruiters no longer concentrate on trying to out-New York the city.
Instead, they market the state as Manhattan's back lot: a place that offers the scenic diversity of suburbs, beach fronts, farms, the resorts of Atlantic City, even industrial moonscapes, all within a few hours of Manhattan.
To film-location managers and production crews, such regional thinking is just common sense.
"When producers are looking for a location, they don't pay attention to boundaries," said Bill Bowling, a location manager. "You're not rooting for the Yankees or the Mets or the Cubs. You care about three things: you think about the right look, the financial advantages and logistical concerns like hotels and a labor pool nearby."
Of course, those priorities might also pose a threat to the East Coast film industry one day. In Los Angeles, many sound stages are now standing empty because 20 percent of the made-for-television film business has been lured to Canada during the past several years. The New York region hasn't suffered from that development because it has always relied more on feature films and television series than TV movies. But New York won't necessarily be immune from such raids in the future, say people who follow the industry, and it is easy to envision a downturn in business rekindling hostilities across the river.
"If for some reason a slump occurs, it could get very bad in this region," said Richard Koszarski, an English professor at Rutgers who is writing a history of the East Coast film industry. "The facilities that did exist would circle the wagons, making it difficult for any new ones to grow. If the new ones were disproportionately in New Jersey, New Jersey would be hurt."
For now, New Jersey officials are savoring the film boom as a chance to fuel the economy and elevate the state's oft-maligned image. Rather than simply mimic New York's success -- "Live From Bayonne, it's Saturday Night!" doesn't have quite the right ring, anyway -- state officials are hopeful that New Jersey can carve out its own niche.
Although plans for a New Jersey film festival fell through earlier this year, state officials hope that a spate of independent films and the runaway success of "The Sopranos" might create a market for films with an identifiable New Jersey look -- part middle-America, part post-industrial, part suburbia.
"It all helps to solidify the brand image of the state," Senator Kyrillos said.
Michael Uslan, a producer and a member of the New Jersey Film Commission, said he was negotiating with a cable station to start a New Jersey Film Network, featuring only those films shot or set in New Jersey, or starring Jersey-born actors.
"You know the day may come, with 500 cable channels on the way, where you see it go the next step, a network featuring only films shot in New Jersey," he said. "Think of it: all Jersey, all the time."

HEADLINE: Impasse on Trade Delivers A Stinging Blow to Clinton

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 4

 BODY:
President Clinton's effort to shape an ambitious agenda to liberalize trade and broaden the mandate of the World Trade Organization collapsed here Friday night, after a rebellion by developing countries and deadlock among America's biggest trading partners forced the administration to all but abandon one of its major foreign policy goals for the end of Mr. Clinton's presidency.
The collapse of the talks ended a tumultuous week of riots on the streets of Seattle, the arrest of more than 600 protesters, and bitter infighting among 135 nations. They could not agree even on whether to discuss workers' rights and the environment in trade negotiations that were supposed to be started here. In the end, weary ministers headed for the airport without even issuing a final communique. 
 The failure is a sharp setback, and perhaps a fatal blow, to President Clinton's hopes of setting in motion a new round of trade liberalization in his final year in office. Coming on the heels of the Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the collapse of trade talks also marks his second major foreign policy defeat since the summer.
Mr. Clinton's aides conceded that the failure revealed that questions of trade, labor rights and the environment had become deeply politicized around the world -- a world in which economic accords are the equivalent of the arms control treaties of the 1970's and 80's.
"There was an intractability on these issues that developed over many months that we hoped would melt away under the pressure of deadline," Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's chief economic adviser, said at the airport. "There comes a time in any negotiation where you have to say, 'It's just not going to work.' "
Mr. Clinton himself issued a statement today saying he was still hopeful. "I remain optimistic that we can use the coming months to narrow our differences and launch a successful new round of global trade talks," he said. "I am determined to move forward on the path of free trade and economic growth while ensuring a human face is put on the global economy."
Other members of his administration, however, said this week's talks had turned into a "fiasco" and a "circus," with the tensions heightened by the scenes of tear gas and protests by the tens of thousands of demonstrators who descended on Seattle for the week to press an array of causes -- all of them aimed at halting or slowing the post-cold-war march toward freer trade.
As the streets erupted and a small, violent group of protesters wreaked extensive damage on downtown Seattle, the talks quickly dissolved into an airing of grievances about American power, arguments about the results of past trade accords and questions about whether the trade organization's mission of liberalizing trade had come at too high a price for poor nations and millions of workers.
Mr. Clinton's advisers worried that the agenda emerging from the talks would so outrage American labor unions that they would denounce both the administration and Vice President Al Gore, who needs the unions' energetic support in his bid for the presidential nomination. Some feared that this agenda could further jeopardize chances of winning Congressional approval for China's entry into the trade organization, which was negotiated in Beijing just two and a half weeks ago.
"The only thing worse than no agreement," one official said, "was the agreement it looked like we might get."
Exulting protest groups immediately claimed victory for disrupting the negotiations.
"Ding Dong the Round is Dead," one new flier from a consumer group read.
"When you take something as secretive and rotten as the W.T.O. and put it in sunshine, it does not last for long," said Lori Wallach of Public Citizen, an American consumer organization that was active in the Seattle protests. "We have succeeded in turning back the invasion of the W.T.O. into domestic policy decisions."
Also among those who celebrated the failure was John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, who had warned the Clinton administration that no deal was better than a bad deal -- one that failed to set up a study group within the trade organization to make recommendations on labor rights.
Mr. Sweeney said there was one success this week: the protests put globalization on the nation's public and political agenda. "This week's heightened scrutiny of negotiations punctured the veil of secrecy and insensitivity in which the W.T.O. has shrouded itself and made it impossible for trade negotiators to paper over differences," Mr. Sweeney said.
"The breakdown reflects the first step in a serious coming-to-terms with pivotal issues: accountability, democratic procedures, workers' and human rights, and the environment."
At a news conference, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative and the chairwoman of the talks, said that it would have been fruitless to continue the negotiations. "We could have stayed all night, maybe for five more days, it wouldn't have mattered," said the normally unflappable Ms. Barshefsky.
"Governments were not ready to take the leap," she said.
The decision to abandon the talks came after a flurry of last-minute phone calls from Mr. Clinton to other world leaders, including Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and the president of the European Union, Romano Prodi. But that effort to break the deadlock failed. And by 8 p.m. here Friday, Mr. Clinton, Ms. Barshefsky, Mr. Sperling and the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, decided that "the patient could not be resuscitated," according to one senior administration official.
The failure of the Seattle talks is the most notable setback for the trade group, which had expanded its reach since replacing a much weaker international trade body, called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1995.
It also is the latest in a string of trade-related disappointments for Mr. Clinton. After winning Congressional backing for the North American Free Trade Agreement and then for the formation of the W.T.O. in his first term, Mr. Clinton has repeatedly failed to garner support for his trade initiatives. He has sought and failed to extend Nafta to Latin American countries. Congress has also denied him expedited fast track consideration of new trade accords.
Frustrated at home, the Clinton administration had hoped to expand the mandate of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization and to push into new territory, like the environment and labor rights.
The trade group will now take up negotiations on some narrow aspects of agriculture and services as part of its regular duties.
The failure of the talks will disappoint many American companies. Agricultural companies had counted on tariff reductions and an end to trade-distorting subsidies to give a big lift to exports. Electronic commerce companies had high hopes that the trade group would extend a moratorium on taxation of Internet transactions well into the future. Either of those areas could be negotiated separately, outside of a huge trading round, but the prospect of progress is uncertain.
Ms. Barshefsky and trade organization officials said the talks broke down because the agenda grew too unwieldy and the time too tight to reach consensus on key issues before a midnight deadline.
Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, whose police force was roundly criticized for mishandling protests early in the week, insisted that the delegates leave the Washington Convention and Trade Center, their negotiating venue, by midnight to make way for other parties that had rented the space beginning today.
Throughout the day Friday, trade ministers hammered out compromise draft texts on a number of sensitive points and were expected to produce a watered-down framework for new negotiations that would allow almost everyone to claim victory, while falling far short of the Clinton administration's goals.
By evening, however, disagreements on agriculture, trade and investment rules and labor rights proved overwhelming, people who participated in the talks said. The United States, the European Union and Japan faced off over the elimination of subsidies for farmers and the use of laws to prevent below-cost dumping of goods in foreign markets.
"We would make progress, and then the Europeans or the Japanese would come back and start right where we began hours before," said one participant. "You had to conclude that the outcome they wanted was the outcome we got: a collapse."
A Clinton administration push toward making labor rights a core part of trade talks divided developed countries from less developed countries, who view the issue as code for protectionism by wealthy nations.
The talks also buckled under pressure from poorer nations -- long junior partners at such forums -- which used the meeting to demand equal say in all aspects of the trade organization's work, delegates said.
The trade group, unlike some other world bodies like the International Monetary Fund, operates by consensus, with all countries accorded equal votes. Wealthy nations, especially the United States, have long set the pace and the tone of trade negotiations.
"This is the first signal that things are not as they were in the past," said Ibou Ndiaye, the trade minister of Senegal. "We are stronger now."
Delegates from developing countries said that they made clear to Ms. Barshefsky and Mike Moore, the trade organization's director general, that they were unhappy with the way negotiations were being handled.
Under Ms. Barshefsky's stewardship, large committees convened early in the week gave way to smaller, closed sessions with a select group of negotiators.
As at least six small groups were cloistered Friday afternoon, the scores of delegates left out of the process began complaining. A number of countries, including a vocal group of Caribbean nations, threatened to walk out, several people who followed events said.
Ms. Barshefsky said she and Mr. Moore eventually concluded that even if closeted negotiators were successful, nations that had not participated might fail to ratify the final agreement.
"The W.T.O. has outgrown the processes that were appropriate for an earlier time," Ms. Barshefsky said. "There are clearly issues of transparency that effect perceptions of the W.T.O. by member economies themselves."
Youssef Boutros-Ghali, Egypt's chief trade representative and a key opponent of several American initiatives at the trade talks, said the failure of the round amounted to a "catharsis for the organization."
"We needed a decision to stop this process until we can figure out how to balance transparency and efficiency," he said.
Dan Seligman, an official with the Sierra Club who helped organize the Seattle protests, said he believed that the W.T.O. was staggering under its own weight.
"The creation of the W.T.O. was an act of pure hubris -- to promote trade by micromanaging policies of every government on earth," he said. "It was only a matter of time before that over-ambitious agenda reached a point at which it could go no further."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Cuba Flights Advance; Castro Opponents March in Havana

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Communications between Cuba and the United States took another step forward today with the arrival of the first direct charter flight from New York to Havana in almost four decades.
The four-hour flight, a Grupo Taca Airbus A-320 chartered by Marazul Tours of Weehawken, N.J., carried 138 passengers from Kennedy International Airport to Jose Marti International Airport, landing at about 1:30 a.m. Havana time. 
 Marazul's owner, Francisco Aruca, told reporters that the flight, which will now be weekly, symbolized "a slow path toward flexibility" in Cuban-American relations.
Washington has kept an economic embargo on Havana since soon after Fidel Castro's revolution in 1959.
The start of New York-Havana flights, together with other routes like Miami-Havana that resumed last year, comes as part of modifications to the sanctions announced by President Clinton in early 1998.
The flight brought an emotional reunion for some separated families.
"The fatherland is the fatherland, and I feel happy to return," a Cuban-American from New Jersey, Maria Prieto, said as she tearfully hugged brothers and cousins she had only known through photographs. It was her first visit in 28 years.
The passengers included Cuban relatives, academics, journalists and participants in the Havana film festival -- all of whom fall into special categories of people allowed to use the direct flights under United States regulations.
In another development today, about 30 opponents of the Castro government staged a peaceful and highly unusual protest march through a Havana suburb to demand freedom for political prisoners.
The demonstrators, all members of Cuba's small dissident groups, gathered after morning Mass on the steps of a Roman Catholic church in Parraga before marching about six blocks to another church.
Unlike other recent opposition gatherings, there was no chanting of slogans or waving of banners. Instead, the marchers carried out the protest mainly in silence, apart from quietly intoning a religious hymn.
"This man has maintained a dictatorship here for 40 years," one demonstrator, Iovany Aguilar Canejo, said of President Castro. "He has to go. It's enough for one man to go, no one else."
Although technically illegal under Cuba's penal code, which outlaws opposition groups and unauthorized gatherings, government officials monitoring the event did not intervene.
Nor was there any confrontation between the dissidents and pro-Castro sympathizers, as occurred the last time dissidents sought to organize a march, on Nov. 10 in Havana.
The dissidents, however, said that at least a dozen opposition members intending to take part in today's march had been temporarily detained or ordered to stay in their homes by Cuba's state security. Officials could not confirm that.
The dissidents said the specific reasons for the march were to call for the freedom of political prisoners in Cuba and denounce human rights abuses by the Castro government. Opposition groups say there are about 400 political prisoners.
Havana denies the existence of political prisoners, saying all inmates are in jail for legitimate reasons, including so-called counter-revolutionary crimes stipulated in the penal code.
Cuba routinely denounces all dissidents as mercenaries and traitors serving both the American government and anti-Castro Cuban exile groups in Florida.

HEADLINE: THE ROAD TO SYDNEY: OLYMPIC PROFILE -- BASKETBALL;
Returning for a Last Hurrah

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
Back before her university retired her basketball jersey and Cairo, Ga., her hardscrabble hometown, renamed the dusty street where she grew up in her honor, Theresa Edwards took her cues from another can-do athlete from Cairo, Jackie Robinson, and determined that there was no obstacle too daunting to detour her from playing the game she loved. Nor from making a respectable living at it. 
 Two decades and four Olympic medals (three golds and a bronze) down the road, Edwards is still trying to stick to her credo, but it hasn't been simple.
"The only thing I'm in control of is my play, and believe me that's not a particularly good feeling for a woman to have at age 35 or 36," Edwards said at the Hartford Civic Center early in the current tour of Team USA, before she and the rest of next year's Olympians walloped a select assortment of Women's National Basketball Association pros. "When I read in the papers where some football player has made more money from his signing bonus than I'll make in my lifetime, well, you better get numb to it or it's going to feel like a knife through your heart."
On its current Olympic prep tour, Team USA is 15-1, losing only to Pat Summitt's powerful University of Tennessee squad, 65-64, after significant victories over national teams from Australia, Poland and Brazil, the perennial medal threats. Last Sunday, it defeated Purdue, the defending national collegiate champion, by 74-50, and the tour resumes tonight in Lubbock, Tex., against Texas Tech.
At 35, after eight bitter months of unemployment occasioned by the demise of the American Basketball League, Edwards, known as Mother T by her teammates and the most decorated Olympian in United States basketball history, decided to dodge the obstacles, and imminent retirement, one last time. Since she was added to the team on Sept. 2, the 5-foot-11-inch guard has cut out her favorite brands of food, fried and fast, to pare back to 155 pounds, the only sacrifice this latest return to competitive basketball has demanded of her.
"But after this, I've got to get a life, got to get a real job," said Edwards, who dreams of being host of a women's sports talk show while despairing of her lack of demonstrated expertise anyplace but on the basketball boards, where she holds the United States Olympic records for most games (24), assists (116), and steals (56) and is second in points with 216.
On the current tour she has played in all 16 games, starting 3 but mostly backing up Dawn Staley, and is averaging 4.8 points a game.
"Whatever else I do, I have to accept it's going to be like starting over from scratch," Edwards said. "I can't just walk into the Fox studio and tell them to give me a show."
Edwards's 1997 stint as a player-coach for the A.B.L.'s Atlanta Glory soured her on coaching because "I'm just so much of a perfectionist that I'd get on the players' nerves."
"But I can't keep thinking I'm going to play forever," Edwards said. "That becomes a lot of pressure, which I'm already feeling the beginning stages of, and which I've got to block out now, at least until we go down there to Australia and bring home that gold medal."
Already the only United States basketball player, male or female, to perform in four Olympics, Edwards, who will be 36 by the time the 2000 Games are staged in Sydney, Australia, next September, has signed on for a fifth unpaid tour of duty. When Edwards, then a college sophomore, was named as a sub for the 1984 team, she became the youngest player to appear on a United States Olympic basketball team.
Now, as in 1996, she's the oldest, a distinction she has learned to forget "except when I wake up in the middle of the night feeling the aches and pains." Or when, during a heated practice, she's trying to outfox youngsters like Chamique Holdsclaw, the player she's pegged as the star for the new millennium and to whom she's prepared to bequeath her moniker as the Michael Jordan of women's ball. "I'll say, 'Oh, I'm hurting,' and 'Wham, I'm past you!' " Edwards said. "Sometimes you can use your age against the young ones."
According to Nell Fortner, coach of the national team and the 2000 Olympic squad, Edwards was added to the squad for myriad reasons: her international experience, her mentoring abilities, her poise under pressure, her team ethos, and the ferocious competitive streak that has been the talk of every coach who has worked with her.
"With Theresa, age is absolutely irrelevant," Fortner said. "She just keeps raising her own bar. The general public might not know Theresa Edwards, but any good or great player in this game knows and respects her and would love the chance to play alongside her; having her on the team brings a certain kind of confidence to the players and to the coaches. She's playing for the love of the game, not for money, and in that respect, she and the other older girls on this team are probably the last of the Mohicans."
Age isn't the only thing that separates Edwards from the rest of the pack.
Because of her estrangement from the league that helped put her A.B.L. franchise out of business last December, Edwards is the only player on the team who isn't supplementing her Olympic volunteerism in the W.N.B.A.
"The odds are going to be stacked against us because of the W.N.B.A. season; that's a big four-month gap where we're not going to be together," Edwards said of the May-to-August hiatus her teammates are contractually committed to. "But we've got players who refuse to lose on this team," Edwards said of a roster that includes Staley, Lisa Leslie, Yolanda Griffith and Holdsclaw, "which is something you can't buy."
Edwards was on the verge of departing for Turkey, where she had been offered a six-figure salary to play professionally, when the Sydney Olympics became an option. "I think that if I'd gotten on that plane to Turkey," Edwards said, "I would have been making a statement that I was done here in this country when it came to making any kind of a future living connected to basketball."
Making her money in Turkey, Edwards figured, would also make her anonymous in the United States; the Olympics had the potential to do just the opposite. She spurned the W.N.B.A.'s $65,000 contract offer this past spring because it was half of what she'd earned in the A.B.L. and because it was dangled in front of her with a take-it-or-leave-it message she found offensive. But Edwards didn't think twice when she was summoned from basketball limbo in September by Fortner.
"After eight months of not playing, I felt lost," Edwards said. "So it was exciting to feel like I was part of something again."
Edwards's first basketball dreams had nothing to do with Olympic or professional glory; they were humbler. She saw athletics as a way to put herself through college and avoid the monotony of the work Cairo supplied her relatives and neighbors. "You stuffed pickles in jars for Roddenbery or you made automobile parts," said Edwards, who cried her way through her first day of work in the pickle factory and complained her way through the second -- and this was just a summer job.
"I'm just not cut out for this," she told the worker beside her, who happened to be her mother. "I promise you I'll graduate from college."
Underprivileged and under-equipped, a sneaker-less Edwards honed her game in her backyard, pumping shot after shot toward a series of makeshift hoops so rusty that their handling would have required a tetanus shot: first a garbage can, then a spokeless rim from a bike tire, and finally a netless basketball hoop nailed to a tree. She convinced her mother, Mildred, a high-school dropout who raised Edwards and her four younger brothers alone, that basketball could be a passport to a university education.
At the University of Georgia, she made two trips to the Final Four, and also earned a degree, the only member of her family to do so. But when not even an Olympic gold medal could bring her employment playing basketball in her own country, Edwards became a reluctant expatriate. For nine years, with breaks for the Olympics, she played for pay in Italy, Japan, Spain and France.
It was an alienating existence, but a lucrative one: her near-$200,000 annual salary with a Mitsubishi-sponsored team in Nagoya, Japan, from 1989-93 granted her financial independence, making it possible to buy her mother a new house and car. When the United States assembled its powerhouse squad for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Edwards was certain the time was right for a professional league at home.
"We knew we were going to win a gold medal, and we also knew that as soon as that medal was hung around our necks, it was over for us," Edwards said. "It was back to struggling for contracts overseas."
Instead, she and six teammates from the 1996 team helped start the A.B.L.
While Edwards doesn't dispute the N.B.A.'s right to market the W.N.B.A. in the wake of the A.B.L., she still takes issue with its timing.
"They did not exist when women's basketball was crying out for a league in 1996," she said. "At first, with us in the A.B.L., it was a cause. Then they came in with the big dollars and it was about money: they had the better, bigger package, and could solicit the better, bigger sponsors. We were supposed to coexist; in reality, we were competing, and we couldn't keep up. But I don't feel like my work with the A.B.L. was in vain: at least we still have it, women's pro ball, in this country."
Still, Edwards, even with a record fifth Olympic performance and potential fourth gold medal, doesn't figure to be part of the W.N.B.A. family after Sydney. "I'm at peace with myself; I've never regretted turning them down," she said. "After the Olympics, I'll be knocking on the door of something new. And if we can win gold again, that would be one great retirement party."

HEADLINE: The Shipwreck in Seattle

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 4

 BODY:
In the end, there were no victors in the globalization battle of Seattle. Everyone just went home angry.
As the negotiations to rewrite the rules of world trade for a new millennium collapsed in bitterness and discord this week, President Clinton's economic team belatedly realized the magnitude of their miscalculation about how the Seattle talks would turn out. 
 They boarded planes to Washington this morning fuming at nearly everyone: at developing countries like India and Brazil and Egypt that refused even to discuss workers' rights as part of the negotiations; at old allies in Europe and Japan that dug in their heels on long-running trade disputes over agriculture and steel; at Seattle's police for, in their view, wildly mishandling the chaos on the streets.
Ministers from developing nations were equally angry -- at the United States. Once again, they said, Washington had tried to use its enormous economic power to benefit Amazon.com and Boeing and the United Steelworkers, at the expense of weaker nations.
And while environmental activists and labor rights groups briefly exulted that their "Stop the W.T.O." marches had helped do exactly that, they are likely to be angry again, too. The ferocity of the arguments here -- both in the street and in the conference rooms -- made it abundantly clear that it would be a long time before the trade group would be empowered to impose trade sanctions against countries that allow children to work in factories, that do not protect sea turtles from fishing nets, or that clear-cut virgin forests.
Perhaps the angriest of all were Seattle's merchants and businesses, who had spent $9 million to draw the meeting of 135 nations and will spend far more recovering from the resulting rioting and lost sales. In the end the city's mayor told the White House that if it really wanted to help Seattle, it would close down the conference and get out of town.
All that anger raised an obvious question: why was everyone here to begin with?
The administration chose a spectacularly bad moment to pick this particular fight. With the exception of agriculture, few American industries have a clear agenda for trade talks now, and many no longer believe that these long, endless "rounds" of negotiations are useful anymore. They involve too many countries, rich and poor, with radically different interests. In an age of e-mail, they move like an aging cargo ship. The co-chairman of the Seattle host committee for the talks, Bill Gates, barely even showed up -- and his office is only 12 miles away.
Big industrial nations, particularly Japan and those in Europe, suffer from market-opening fatigue; they have had about as much as their political systems can take.
"There was no consensus about the need for further liberalization," said Ira Shapiro, the former general counsel of the United States trade representative's office, who joined the hundreds of lawyers, corporate executives and legislators working the fringes of the negotiations. "The only thing that unified most of the people here was a sense of grievance that they were being treated unfairly by the global trading system."
But it went ahead, in part because Mr. Clinton was convinced that he had one free-trade victory left. He has never been in accord with labor unions or his own party on trade, and he hoped to convince labor leaders and environmentalists that they could gradually change the priorities of the global economy.
The new global economy is a reality, he argued, so rather than fight it they would be wise to try to make environmental standards and workers' rights part of every future trade agreement. But after many disappointments, they doubted his sincerity and saw ploys to rekindle support for Vice President Al Gore.
Mr. Clinton also believed he could persuade weaker nations that they could cut pollution and raise working standards without wiping out their low-cost competitive advantage.
"I do not believe the United States has the right to ask India or Pakistan or China or any other country to give up economic growth," Mr. Clinton said here on Wednesday. "But we do have a right to say we will help you finance a different path to growth" while putting environment and labor issues "at the core of our trade concerns."
He won over almost no one. Many nations suspected a plot to use higher labor and environmental standards to keep out their products, or at least to raise the costs of production in developing countries.
And the noisy protests only hardened such views. As a result, Seattle will be remembered not for the new ground broken, but for the windows shattered. It will be the place where protesters, marching down Seattle's streets at a time of unmatched prosperity for America, argued that free trade benefits the world's largest corporations but does little for the poorest nations, the most exploited workers and the environment.
What did the protesters want? Many were not sure. Their signs called for elimination of the trade organization. But the environmental and labor groups actually wanted a stronger institution, one that could enforce rulings that China was illegally barring unions or India was dumping too many pollutants into its rivers. Violators could face economic sanctions.
And that suggestion, uttered by President Clinton himself in a moment of candor his aides regretted, provoked smaller and poorer nations into open rebellion.
They envisioned an ever-more-powerful, American-dominated trade organization that would begin dictating how much they paid their workers, or what kind of fuels they could burn, or what kind of magazines and films they had to let into the country. And after all, they said, which country brings the most trade complaints before the court of the World Trade Organization? The United States, of course. "There's a sense you want to rig the system," a Japanese diplomat here said.
Some of Mr. Clinton's advisers had warned him that he was asking for more than most countries would accept. Mr. Clinton's former international economic adviser, Daniel Tarullo, published an article last month arguing for "a modest trade agenda" at Seattle, and said that a formal "round" of negotiations "should probably not be held." They get too broad, too complex, too political.
Questions of labor rights and safety go to the core of any country's political system, Mr. Tarullo said. "The real danger," he warned, is that the global trading system is becoming "identified with restricting the authority of governments to protect health, workers, environment and consumers." Or, he might have added, requiring them to impose such regulations.
Those issues sank the Seattle talks. "They are much more politically charged now than they were a week ago." Mr. Tarullo said. And Mr. Clinton, 14 months from the end of his presidency, may have seen the passing of his last chance to make the mixture of foreign policy and foreign trade one of the bright spots of his presidential legacy.

HEADLINE: A New York Minute

 BODY:
As we contemplated what people a thousand years from now might want to know about us, a question naturally arose: what's missing from our picture of the world a thousand years ago? One answer was obvious: a sense of the experience of everyday life -- the sights, sounds and sensations that time washes away almost instantly. For the Times Capsule, we set out to document the texture of life today, at least in a single place at a single moment. And so, on Sept. 9, 1999, at 9:09 a.m., a moment chosen strictly for its symmetry, more than a hundred writers, photographers, artists, sound recordists, filmmakers and students fanned out across the five boroughs to document a single minute -- the same minute -- in the life of New York. They came back with a mosaic of 60 ordinary seconds that will, we hope, last a millennium.

Elisabeth Bumiller, a reporter for The Times, covers Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The mayor's daily 8 a.m. staff meeting, in City Hall's Committee of the Whole Room, first used by Mayor DeWitt Clinton in 1812, is running late, the definition of any mayoral meeting of any century. The morning light coming in through the windows of the Federal-style room illuminates aides seated around a gleaming mahogany table, watching Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listen to his commissioner of the administration for Children's Services, Nicholas Scoppetta.
Scoppetta briefs Giuliani about a rally the mayor will attend for directors of the city's foster-care agencies. When Scoppetta mentions a judge who is expected to be there, the mayor, perhaps aware that his New York minute is not yet riveting, or maybe that he is not yet the central character, makes a move.
"Do I get my money for jury service?" he breaks in, referring to his service as a juror days earlier in a personal-injury case.
Scoppetta, absorbed in his presentation, at first takes no notice. "And he," Scoppetta continues, "he will bring--"
"A check?" offers the mayor, to laughter.
"A check," says Scoppetta jovially, catching on, just before the minute is over.
 
M - Chang-rae Lee Le Monde gourmet Deli, 38 West 48th Street
Chang-rae Lee is the author, most recently, of "A Gesture Life," a novel.
Seung-lae Lee, the proprietor, my cousin, presides over his short-order cooks cracking eggs onto the griddle, two by two. "Pretty busy this morning," he says. And so it is. In this get-to-work rush, the customers line the length of the front counter, each waiting for their breakfast sandwich or bagel to be wrapped in foil and passed over the gleaming glass case. They stand, watching the action, with an uncommon New York patience, for they know it'll be just another minute. Behind the counter, the people-machine is running in high gear, the orders taken and called out, the responses barked back, the talk flying forth in Spanglish and English and Koreanese. Lee's wife is directing it all, shouting, "Yo, amigo," and "Yes, ma'am," and "Coffee, coffee, ha-rha-buh-gee grandpa in Korean ?" her addresses wholly indiscriminate and sweet. Somehow, everyone understands. The two cashier girls ring it up, making change in their heads, their hands moving at the light-speed of a dollar being spent in Manhattan. This is not virtual commerce. Lee knows this, and takes a few overflow orders himself, relaying them to the griddle men, who shout it out, starting the business all over again. "Not bad today," Lee says, surveying his buzzing empire. "It's working."
 
B - Edwidge Danticat Utica Avenue and Avenue D, East Flatbush
Edwidge Danticat is the author of "Breath, Eyes, Memory" and, most recently, "The Farming of Bones."
Gray overcast minute in East Flatbush, a mostly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood. Landmark: Taste the Tropics Ice Cream, its parrot-green awning half covered with a swirling rainbow, linking three palmettos to a giant ice-cream cone. Car horns blare as "dollar cab" drivers race to get to the B46 bus stop to scoop up passengers before the bus arrives. For an even dollar each, the elderly caramel-skinned woman in a nursing uniform and the young boy in crisp navy pants, white long-sleeved shirt and a navy Catholic school tie will ride down Utica Avenue in a sleek leather-interior Lincoln Town Car and reach their destinations much faster. The Lincoln darts in and picks them up just in time, before the bus arrives.
The co-owner of a new custom-upholstery shop, Austin wishes he could be somewhere else. "In bed, maybe?" Or perhaps on one of those trips advertised on yellow cardboard in the window of Astral Travel, across from Taste the Tropics. For $388, one can journey to Trinidad, Grenada or Haiti; a trip to Senegal, on this day of nines, is fittingly priced at $999.
 
M - Susan Minot West Ninth Street
Susan Minot is the author of "Monkeys" and, most recently, "Evening."
In the lobby, a fan is going on the battered desk. No doorman. A sign: "They are working on the Elevator. Is out of order." I step outside. Down the street is the building that served as a model (built in a Hollywood studio) for "Rear Window," Hitchcock's ode to voyeurism. No one this morning looks at one another. A stocky woman in a suit bustles toward the subway, rooting around for something in her bag; an Indian couple walks dreamily arm in arm; a woman with hair still wet holds her chin high. A man in a blue shirt tends his dog. The clock on the brick tower of the library, which used to be a courthouse, says 9:09. Walking toward me with a brisk pace is the shrink I used to see some years ago, someone who has peered in the window of many people's dramas and imbroglios and minutiae, mine included. She walks quickly by, not meeting my eye.

James Traub is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.
Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United Nations, left an elevator with his bodyguard and entered a television studio where he was scheduled to tape two messages -- one to "the world business community," the other to employees of Unesco, a U.N. agency. Annan, who had been preoccupied for weeks with the conflict in East Timor, sat down before a mirror to be made up. He was as still as a mannequin, and he wore the muted uniform of the institution man: navy suit, white shirt, red and blue tie. Annan's white hair and goatee made his large, sleepy eyes look impossibly black. When an aide stuck his head through the curtain and said sorrowfully, "There is a problem with the teleprompter, sir," Annan remained expressionless for a moment and then said softly: "I'll do it another time. Now I can go talk to East Timor."
 
B - Nicholas Dawidoff Yankee Stadium
Nicholas Dawidoff is the author of "The Catcher Was a Spy," a biography of Moe Berg, and "In the Country of Country."
Thomas Fyfe headed for the batter's box at Yankee Stadium. He carried a rake. Fyfe works as a groundskeeper at the most famous baseball field in America, and at 9:09 a.m. he stood alone on the vast green lawn surrounded by 57,746 empty seats, tamping and prodding the muddy clay around home plate. Pausing for a moment, Fyfe looked out across the dew-soaked outfield and noticed things only a groundskeeper sees.
In right field, a sea-gull feather lay on a tired stretch of sod that Fyfe refers to as "O'Neill's spot" -- a patch of grass the outfielder Paul O'Neill wears down with his vigorous pacing between pitches. An open gate in left-center revealed two tomatoes heavy on the vine in the bullpen garden. In shallow-left, near the stands, were two ballpoint pens, misplaced, Fyfe thought, by fans hoping to receive an autograph. "Now's the best time in the world," he said. "There's nobody here. You just come out and work."
 
M - Cathleen Schine 76th and West End Avenue
Cathleen Schine is the author, most recently, of "The Evolution of Jane."
In "The Pursuit of the Millennium," the historian Norman Cohn illustrates the five ways in which medieval millennialists identified salvation.
1. It will be collective.
We're here, together, waiting for the same thing. . . .
2. It will be realized on this earth.
Grinding din of workmen digging up street, heaviness of humidity. . . .
3. It is imminent.
Man on cell phone, hand held out with casual certainty. . . . Two women, both in black suits, competitors, eye each other, ready to pounce. . . .
4. It will be total -- utterly transforming life.
An undeniable truth in heavy rain. Or when it's freezing and you're not properly dressed. Or when you're late. Like increasingly frantic father with son's backpack. Mother, with squirming daughter, waving wildly. . . .
5. Finally, it will be miraculous.
Yes. Only one of blind mystical faith like the man with the cell phone, hand still out, can really expect one now. The others peer irritably into the distance. Lights atop yellow cabs unlighted -- inauspicious.
But then. . . . A golden gypsy slows, sparkles beside the believer, blinks its headlights. . . . Just one. . . . The left. . . . It's a sign!
It's a taxi.
 
M - Eleanor Randolph Astor Place
Eleanor Randolph is a member of the editorial board of The Times.
Jerry DeLakas stands alone in his compact green newsstand, surrounded by a panorama of urgent headlines. "Virus Scare Grows" shouts Page 1 of The Daily News -- mosquitoes have caused an outbreak of "encephalitis," three deaths in a city of seven million people. Newsday features a postman with bug spray in his mailbag. The stand is oddly quiet. DeLakas smokes, a hazard made worse by his habit of storing his burning cigarette in the middle of a stack of magazines while he makes a sale. Suddenly a man in overalls rushes up, pays for a copy of the Spanish daily El Diario and then begins running back to the street. "My truck stop there," he points to the reason for his urgency. "No make me get ticket," he calls over his shoulder. With 10 seconds left in the minute, a lean man darts into the newsstand, grabs The New York Times, The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal and leaves a small wad of bills. Engrossed in his cell phone, he waves off the change, a far bigger deal clearly hanging in the balance. Only once does he slow down -- to explain to me that he cannot stop.
 
A sampling of the books returned to the Brooklyn Public Library in Grand Army Plaza: E.B. White, "Charlotte's Web"; James Herbert, "Portent"; David Eddings, "Sorceress of Darshiva: Book Four of the Malloreon"; Amanda Quick, "Reckless"; Wanda Ga'g, "Millions of Cats."
 
M - Alex Witchel Grand Central Terminal
Alex Witchel reports on style for The Times.
Her flowered skirt sways above her ankles, like curtains in a breeze. She makes her way intently around the circular beacon that is the Information Booth in Grand Central Terminal, oblivious to the streams of men charging off the escalators, wielding briefcases big and battered. She walks first past the red schedules, the green, then the blue, selecting one of each -- Westport, Greenwich, Tuckahoe -- as if she were choosing fruit.
She passes through the line of harried questioners ("Can you tell me how to go to Metuchen, N.J.?") and drifts past the man who sets his coffee cup on the shelf holding the schedules, knocking some to the floor, where they lie, ignored.
Her journey complete, she files her stack carefully in her black shoulder bag. Knowing now how to get to every New York suburb at every hour of the day, she turns her back and heads toward the subway.
 
B - Charles Siebert Brooklyn Bridge
Charles Siebert is the author of the forthcoming "Angus," a memoir of a dying dog.
At the top of the Brooklyn anchorage ramp, a well-heeled woman stops to wrestle a homeless man over the trash can he has just spilled onto the promenade, thrashes him with her briefcase, picks up scattered newspapers and puts them back in the container as he canes his way toward the next one.
Nearly 10 minutes gone of the official workday, these are the late crossers. No eased faces in the mounting heat, all grimace and climb, traffic so dense you worry for its destination, start counting the city's vertical panes against the passing eyes and windshields here, some incalculable yet daily resolved equation between the onslaught and the eventual settle. The sun slides into view. From unseen roadway scaffoldings below, jackhammers and lug wrench whines, the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of flight being tended to.

Except for the distant drone of a lawn mower and the higher-pitched whapping sound of an edge trimmer somewhere out of sight, all is stillness on this grassy hilltop in New York's "Garden City of the Dead."
In the shadow of an imposing bronze statue of Minerva, Charles Higgins, the inventor of India ink, slumbers in a heavy, banklike mausoleum. Some yards behind him, the remains of the musician Leonard Bernstein lie under a simple marker set flush into the ground. Five small stones have been placed on it.
Half a million people are buried in this cemetery, and five more are lowered into it every day. They tell me that 135 groundskeepers maintain these 478 lush acres, but all I know is not a single living soul came into view during the minute I stood watch.
 
Esmeralda Santiago Southbound tollbooth plaza, Henry Hudson Bridge
Esmeralda Santiago is the author of "When I Was Puerto Rican" and, most recently, "Almost a Woman."
A Dodge Intrepid cuts in front of a Lexus. The Lexus driver curses and gives the finger to the Intrepid, which then weaves in front of an Eclipse. An Explorer sidles up to a Beetle, hovers next to it until its driver notices, then signals right. A Navigator balks between the Cash Only and E-ZPass lanes, blocking everyone behind. A Pathfinder noses the Navigator, which stops dead in its tracks. A yellow cab takes advantage of the Navigator's hesitation and guns in front of it, followed by a Caravan. An Expedition tries to make the same move, but the Navigator lurches forward, heading, finally, triumphantly, for the E-ZPass.

B - Harvey Shapiro Brooklyn Promenade
Harvey Shapiro is the author, most recently, of "Selected Poems."
There they are
the water-hugging giants of Manhattan
breathing the dun-colored air of morning.
Silent, mysterious
seen through a white scrim of fog.
 
Directly beneath me, commuter traffic
of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
Across that, on the Brooklyn docks
one lone forklift tractor, loaded with steel rods,
jockeying back and forth
before the Strober Bros. Building Supply Depot.
Across the water, dimly descried,
nested in the green arches of Battery,
a perky yellow Staten Island Ferry.
 
But the buildings pulsing in their various
shades of white
and now, as the fog thins slowly,
a pale dusty blue, out of Giotto,
seems to descend behind them.
 
These mighty presences at the end of
Manhattan Island,
fronting the East River that is not a river
but a tidal strait carrying
the North Atlantic to our very doorstep.
 
These monuments that dominate our day
as if they had been fixed there forever
though they are in flux as the waters are in flux.
 
They stand before us
like tribal gods meting out success and unsuccess,
all that we have to lift our eyes to.
 
M - Pete Hamill Broadway and Canal Street
Pete Hamill, former editor of The Daily News, is the author, most recently, of an illustrated biography of Diego Rivera.
At 9:09, the street light changes and trucks roar into life along Canal, crossing Broadway, heading east to the Manhattan Bridge, west to the Holland Tunnel: gru, gru, grug, gu-grug, groooaaaaar. Pedestrians rush across Broadway: two Chinese girls in high heels speaking English; a tan woman with a dragon tattooed on her bare back, sipping coffee as she walks; a fat guy in a Ralph Lauren shirt hurrying across on dainty feet right behind four students with backpacks and baggy jeans. All easing past one another, avoiding collisions, hurrying. A young Latina woman, copper-haired in the morning sun, wearing a tailored tan suit and carrying a briefcase, strides through the jumbled crowd, cutting a path. A large woman in a blue dress pauses to light a cigarette, her face desperate and sweaty, while others move around her. A tiny gray-haired Chinese woman in slacks and blouse, carrying a heavy shopping bag, hurries along, as the light turns to DONT WALK and a Bell Atlantic truck makes an abrupt turn out of Canal, heading directly at her. She freezes in the truck's path. The driver stops, gives her a small wave; she nods and waves back and hurries on, into her American morning.

A high-ceilinged room decorated with the reassuring signs of serious money: English hunting scenes by Fores on walls faced with brown velvet, fresh flowers (Casablanca lilies and curly willow) against a background of old botany (the engravings by Redoute), the pattern of the breakfast china matched to the chintz on the center banquette, the coffee priced at $5, the poached eggs on smoked salmon at $22.50. The 28 tables accommodate a tasteful selection of fine guests, as reassuring as the decor in their dress and appearance: custom-made shirts, German accents, warm suntans lately arrived from Cape Cod and California, a small but important collection of gold jewelry. The two men rising from the table near the door -- Robert Rubin, recently resigned as the secretary of the Treasury, and Richard Holbrooke, newly confirmed as the ambassador to the United Nations -- gather their papers and close their briefcases. They nod to people in remote corners of the room, and as they walk out into the lobby, the matre d'htel bows to them with a grateful smile, acknowledging their fitness to be seen in the company of horses by Fores, watches from Breguet, the lily by Redoute.

Frank McCourt is the author, most recently, of "'Tis."
It is the first day of the academic year for the High School for Health Professions and Human Services. This is where I used to teach, from 1969 to 1987, back when Stuyvesant High School was in this building.
Students crowd the sidewalks between First and Second Avenues. They sit on the steps of the old brownstones opposite their school. They also lean against cars, triggering alarms, which they then imitate. They laugh till security guards or other adults from the school ask them to please stay off the cars. The students are polite, but when the adults go back into the building, they relax against the cars again.
Along the street, there are reunions, cries and hugs. Hi, Joey. Hi, Miranda. Wow, you lost weight. Love your hair.
The student population seems to be largely African-American, with smaller groups of Hispanics and Asians and an even smaller group of whites. When I taught here, the population was mostly Jewish, though as the years went on it became increasingly Asian. The school bell rings, and the boxes, bags and bottles containing foods and drinks must be disposed of. Adults from the school ask the students to please pick up their garbage and put it in the can, but there is litter and the school year has begun.
 
Zero births and deaths reported in New York City. 7,420,166 estimated population.

Four hefty Italian-American moms sit around the picnic benches, drinking iced espressos while their kids dash around. A father, middle-aged like me (Oh, the sticky solicitous doting of graybeard dads!), tenderly picks up his boy to take him to the bathroom in the dignified stone park house. Another father lifts his tan-frocked daughter up to grab the parallel bars, then says, "Play with something else," and heads for a bench. He's teaching her "independence," meanwhile grabbing a few private moments. She skulks over the standard-issue climbing structure, probably thinking, Why do adults insist on pretending it's fun to play by yourself?
This park is the glue that holds our (suddenly trendy) neighborhood together, the one public space that equalizes newcomers and old-timers, haves and have-nots. In their corner, black nannies with white babies discuss in island accents the chances of finding other employment. Across, a woman trains her son to take toddler steps, while absent-mindedly picking lint from her yellow blouse. A huge-bellied man snoozes on a bench, his shopping cart filled with collected bottles.

Location: Small, well-appointed office, decorated with sprawling vines and South American artifacts, in an apartment building. Two men face each other in leather armchairs. On an ottoman between them sits a tape recorder.
Patient: Last night, I had all sorts of performance-anxiety dreams.
Analyst: Such as?
Patient: Well, I dreamt I was in some sort of stage production and I couldn't remember any of my lines.
Analyst: Yes?
Patient: And the woman I was doing the scene with, she couldn't remember any of her lines, either. Through the open window comes the squeal of truck brakes. To be honest, I think it's about my doubts and anxieties about being in therapy.
Analyst: Let's stay with the dream for a moment. Where does the dream take place?
Patient: I can't remember.
Analyst: And the woman -- who was she? The piercing cry of a car alarm is heard.
Patient: I can't remember.
Analyst: Well, what did she look like?
Patient: I can't remember.
Analyst: Well, was she someone you were romantically involved with? A jackhammer starts up. Analyst and patient raise their voices.
Patient: No, she was someone I'd been paired with artificially.
Analyst: And why do you think this is about therapy?
Patient: Well, talk about an artificial situation!

Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine.
"It's hideous out there," warned the radio. "Hazy, hot and humid" was the forecast, and by 9:09 it was already all of that. But hideous? Not where I was.
Where I was was on the terrace of Belvedere Castle, the rough midpoint and actual high point of Central Park, and the precise spot where New York City's weather is measured by an ensemble of meteorological instruments. At 9:09, the official readings were as follows: temperature, 24 C; dew point, 22 C; relative humidity, 87 percent; visibility, 1 1/2 miles in mist; barometric pressure, 29.87.

 BODY:
AMERICAN BUILDING: The Environmental Forces That Shape It. By James Marston Fitch with William Bobenhausen. (Oxford, $40.) "As completely as fish in water, people are submerged in their own environment," James Marston Fitch writes. "But, unlike fish, people act upon their environment as well as being acted upon by it." How we do that -- through our natural and artificial responses to light, heat, cold and sound, to say nothing of space, time and gravity -- is the subject of this revised version of a classic work first published by Fitch in 1947 and now thoroughly updated (with the help of the architect William Bobenhausen) to reflect the immense technological changes since then. Their masterly and surprisingly accessible investigation of the functional aspects of architecture addresses issues that few nonprofessionals consider, though the world would be greatly improved if they did.
The 90-year-old Fitch, doyen of the historic-preservation movement in America, is also an ardent champion of modernism, but he can be frank in his assessments of its physical shortcomings and failures. With a refreshing lack of ideological bias and awe-inspiring erudition, he and his co-author roam across a vast terrain, from the effects of lighting on worker productivity to global warming, from the thermal properties of the igloo to the ergonomics of bathroom fixtures. Their proposed solutions to many architectural and planning problems display so much common sense as to seem obvious, and yet the wisdom they bring to their encyclopedic topic is anything but commonplace. This book ought to be mandatory reading for every architecture student, as well as for any citizen concerned with raising the quality of the built environment. 
 POMPEII: Public and Private Life. By Paul Zanker. Translated by Deborah Lucas Schneider. (Harvard, $22.95.) The thousands of Pompeians smothered under the volcanic ash of Vesuvius on Aug. 24 in A.D. 79 survive in the modern imagination. Eerily preserved, their remains and those of their fashionable resort town -- one of the Hamptons of ancient Rome -- provide our clearest picture of urban life 2,000 years ago, illuminated by the mundane details that give Pompeii an immediacy (and profound humanity) exceeding that of other archaeological sites.
Paul Zanker, the director of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome and a professor of classical archaeology at the University of Munich, has written what is destined to become a classic study. Quietly authoritative, Zanker's brief yet endlessly suggestive overview of Pompeii and its buildings puts architecture, as it ought to be, squarely in the context of the social and spiritual attitudes that produce it.
As the austere values of the Roman republic were superseded by the exotic Hellenistic tastes of the expanding empire, houses of the well-to-do were transformed into sanctuaries for recreating the golden age of Greece, as well as private stages for Dionysiac pleasures once considered corruptly unpatriotic. Pompeii's inward-turning retreats replicated Greek architecture, wall paintings and sculptures, sometimes with gardens as miniature landscapes that gave the illusion of travel without the inconvenience.
As Zanker writes of one such Pompeian dream house: "Perspectives actually intended for wider views are cunningly inverted -- architectural elements borrowed from villas in the country or by the seaside are crammed together into a Walt Disney world. . . . The owner, eager to imitate the lavish world of villas he so clearly admired, preferred quan-
tity over quality." Readers will find several such parallels between life today and the competitively materialistic, luxury-worshiping and nostalgia-fixated inhabitants of not-so-distant Pompeii.
GERMAN CASTLES AND PALACES. Edited by Klaus Merten. Photography by Paolo Marton. (Vendome, $75.) Less familiar now than their counterparts in Britain, France and Italy, the buildings of German princes and nobles were nonetheless every bit as splendid as could have been wished during the centuries when impressive size and ornamental excess were outward signs of political might. Though there are several famous landmarks in this sumptuous collection -- including the Tiepolo-frescoed Baroque residence of the prince-bishops of Wrzburg, Frederick the Great of Prussia's Rococo bijou of Sanssouci, and Ludwig II of Bavaria's operatic, neomedieval castle of Neuschwanstein -- many of the 53 works chosen by Klaus Merten, the chief curator of palaces and gardens for the state of Baden-Wrttemberg, come as a revelation.
Among the most delightful is Favorite, the summer palace of the dukes of Wrttemberg, in Ludwigsburg. Its vigorous, warmly colored stucco exterior, built around 1720, contrasts with the cool elegance of the neo-Classical interiors, redone at the turn of the 19th century. By the 1820's, when the greatest German architect, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, remodeled and decorated the romantic hideaway of Charlottenhof on the grounds of Sanssouci for the Prussian crown prince and princess, the remarkable transition from authoritarian display to familial gemtlichkeit was complete.
JOHN SOANE: An Accidental Romantic. By Gillian Darley. (Yale University, $45.) JOHN SOANE: Architect. Edited by Margaret Richardson and Mary Anne Stevens. (Royal Academy of Art/Yale University, $75.) Sir John Soane died the year Queen Victoria ascended the British throne, but more than historical happenstance made him a pivotal figure between ancient tradition and nascent modernism. Soane, the brilliant, ambitious son of a bricklayer, immersed himself in the classical tradition, but was so sure of his talents that he played with the grand manner in ways none of his contemporaries dared. He slashed fearlessly through walls, floors and ceilings to create dynamic interiors that soar, plunge and even seem to hover in midair, none more so than those of his own London residence, which he worked on from 1792 to 1834. That intricate, obsessive remodeling of a plain Georgian row house into a private museum is a touchstone to architects mesmerized by Soane's powerful manipulations of space and scale; they are intensified by the plethora of art objects and architectural fragments with which the compulsive collector fended off his horror vacui.
This compellingly readable biography by the British architectural historian Gillian Darley brings Soane, the working-class knight, to life as a mass of contradictions: a paranoid with real enemies, a once-devoted father who became estranged from his sons and a roaring eccentric who rose to the pinnacle of his strait-laced profession. Probing deeply into the architect's now largely destroyed body of work, Darley revisits many long-forgotten structures, including the imaginative outbuildings of country houses that survived through benign bucolic neglect. In an intriguing postscript, the author notes her subject's enduring influence in Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's iconic red telephone booths of 1924, the shallow pendentive dome of which was clearly inspired by Soane's family tomb.
"John Soane: Architect," the ravishingly illustrated catalog of the superb exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Art in London this fall, vividly conveys the elusive luminosity and spatial daring of his buildings. In their rule-breaking audacity they remain accurate reflections of his singular vision and angular personality.
E. W. GODWIN: Aesthetic Movement Architect and Designer. Edited by Susan Weber Soros. (Bard Graduate Center/Yale University, $75.) Now known only to decorative arts specialists, the 19th-century British architect and critic Edward William Godwin is best remembered for his modern-looking, clean-lined ebonized furniture. But Godwin was renowned in his own time as a leader of the aesthetic movement, involving a group of well-heeled rebels who wanted to free the arts from Victorian moralizing and to foster a sensuous "art for art's sake." Enraptured by the rich visual culture of Japan, which only recently had been revealed to the West, he showed his fellow aesthetes James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde (for whom he built and decorated houses in London) how to live the exquisitely rarefied life they philosophized about.
Inspired by styles from the Egyptian to the Chinese to the Gothic, Godwin designed everything from ceramics and wallpaper to costumes and theatrical scenery. He typified his period's fascination with the gesamtkunstwerk in his fully coordinated environments wherein no detail was left to chance.
Far from being a paragon of preciousness, Godwin was outrageous and contentious, carrying on an affair with the celebrated actress Ellen Terry (by whom he fathered two children, including the theatrical designer Edward Gordon Craig) and sparring with collaborators. Reform-minded but self-indulgent, he never shared the philosophical interests and political activism of his protean design rival, William Morris, and soon after Godwin died at 53 in 1886 his work slipped into oblivion.
This superlative catalog, now the essential publication on the subject, was edited by Susan Weber Soros, founder and director of New York's Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, where the Godwin exhibition she curated is on view through Feb. 27. In an excellent series of essays by Soros and nine other experts, a cumulative portrait of the multifaceted architect emerges that is strongly outlined and finely detailed.
SHINGLE STYLES: Innovation and Tradition in American Architecture, 1874 to 1982. Photography by Bret Morgan. Text by Leland M. Roth. (Norfleet/
Abrams, $49.50.) One of the bright spots on the American scene after the Civil War was the rise of the shingle style, an architectural mode that drew on the aesthetic movement as well as American colonial traditions. In contrast to the vulgar showplaces of the era's new rich, the shingle style -- named for its favored cladding material by the architectural historian Vincent Scully -- demonstrated how grand houses could be free of ostentation but full of dignity, establishing a standard for plutocratic restraint that persists in old-money circles to this day.
The multigabled, porch-wrapped mansions that were popular in resorts like Tuxedo Park, N.Y., Newport, R.I., and the East End of Long Island soon became the model for smaller domestic schemes throughout the country, a logical adaptation because the shingle style took many of its cues from modest sources. This handsome survey, selected by Leland M. Roth, an architectural historian at the University of Oregon, and illustrated with the moody color photographs of Bret Morgan, is a worthy celebration of a distinctively American way of building.
Though it was a mistake for Roth to include lesser shingle style revival work of recent decades (like an awkward postmodern pastiche by Robert A. M. Stern), in the book one can look back with unadulterated pleasure on many glorious examples of the real thing.
GAUDO: The Man and His Work. Text by Joan Bergos. Photographs by Marc Llimargas. (Bulfinch, $75.) BARCELONA ART NOUVEAU. Text by Lluis Permanyer. Photography by Melba Levick. (Rizzoli, $55.) Fueled by a booming textile-manufacturing economy, turn-of-the-century Barcelona was further fortunate in having adventurous architecture patrons who prompted a torrent of creativity. Modernisme, the Catalan variant of Art Nouveau, was a farrago of Moorish, Gothic and Classical details so strongly seasoned with Arts and Crafts elements that an entirely new style emerged, which its proudly nationalistic supporters saw as a fitting expression of Catalonia's cultural independence.
Though the sensuously molded and bizarrely detailed structures of Antonio Gaudi are well known, the Catalan photographer Marc Llimargas's eye for revelatory detail is extraordinary. The vibrant color images he took for "Gaudi: The Man and His Work" (translated from a 1947 book by Joan Bergos, a younger collaborator of the master) make it seem as though one is seeing those buildings for the first time.
In "Barcelona Art Nouveau," Lluis Permanyer, a native of the city, and the American photographer Melba Levick do equal justice to the work of Gaudi's less-acclaimed but gifted contemporaries, especially Lluis Domenech, Josep Puig and Josep Vilaseca. Domenech's Palau de la Musica Catalana of 1905-08 is the city's architectural masterpiece. No other concert hall approaches its over-the-top opulence and decorative superabundance. The ceiling of the auditorium is aglitter with fan vaults of mosaic peacock feathers, studded with ceramic roses in full bloom and culminating in a spectacular stained-glass dome that recalls an immense, inverted Tiffany lampshade. As Permanyer writes, "It is the most modernist building in the world."
IRVING GILL AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF REFORM: A Study in Modernist Architectural Culture. By Thomas S. Hines. (Monacelli, $75.) Trained in Chicago by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, Irving Gill found early 20th-century Southern California to be fertile ground for his rigorously unornamented architecture and progressive movement politics. Gill was captivated by the pared-down forms of Indian adobes and Spanish colonial missions, as well as the white-walled, cubic North African Arabic buildings that also inspired his like-minded European contemporaries Adolf Loos and Le Corbusier. Gill sought to sweep away retrograde historicism and supplant it with a pure, energizing architecture he believed would promote everything from better hygiene to more equitable social standards.
Gill, who was a Quaker, declared, "We must dare to be simple, and get back to the source of all architectural strength -- the straight line, the arch, the cube and the circle." That he did in a pathbreaking series of public buildings, private houses and multi-unit dwellings, culminating in his arcaded La Jolla Woman's Club of 1912-14 and the minimalist Dodge house of 1914-16 in West Hollywood. Favoring inventive new methods like slab-tilt construction -- in which concrete was poured into rectangular molds on the ground and then hoisted 90 degrees to make walls -- Gill was as innovative in practice as he was in spirit. Most touching are the dozen low-cost but highly dignified adobe-style concrete cottages he completed in 1933, three years before his death, for the Rancho Barona Indian Reservation in Lakeside, Calif., bringing full circle his homage to the architecture of the inhabitants' ancestors.
Alas, two-thirds of Gill's 300 buildings have been torn down, the majority of the remainder altered beyond recognition, and his archives were put out with the trash, making this first-ever monograph a heroic effort. Scrupulously researched and engagingly written by Thomas S. Hines, a professor of history and architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, this long-hoped-for volume fills a shocking lapse in architectural literature.
CARLO SCARPA ARCHITECT: Intervening With History. By Nicholas Olsberg, George Ranalli, Jean-Francois Bedard, Sergio Polano, Alba di Lieto and Mildred Friedman. Photographs by Guido Guidi. (Canadian Center for Architecture/Monacelli, paper, $45.) Although the Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa (1906-78) is unknown to the general public, he has long been a cult figure among professionals. They revere Scarpa's fanatic attention to detail in his small but emotionally engaging structures, which display a rare ability to focus on the intimate and the cosmic with equal intensity. Though he built very little, and most of that consisted of remodelings of existing structures, his principled stance against rampant commercialism and internationalization have special pertinence today.
Scarpa fits neatly into no niche of the modern movement save his own. Immersed in the architecture of his birthplace and the surrounding Veneto region, he knew better than to ape it. "I have always had . . . an immense desire to belong to tradition," he said, "but without having capitals or columns." Instead, he honored the past through contemporary forms made from local materials and constructed with age-old techniques. His regionally rooted but universally resonant designs -- above all three Italian museums and several memorable tombs -- feel so authentic because he cared not a whit about style and everything about the enduring verities of architecture.
This publication of the exemplary Scarpa exhibition held at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal earlier this year makes the architect's often cryptic schemes more intelligible to a general audience than ever before. The thoughtful essays, particularly those by the show's guest curator, Mildred Friedman, and its designer, the American architect George Ranalli, explain Scarpa's continuing hold on the architectural mind. Guido Guidi's subtle color photographs are among the most affecting architectural images in recent memory, capturing the spirit of place that was all-important to the master, as well as evoking his poignant sense of the passage of time.
VENTURI, SCOTT BROWN & ASSOCIATES: Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998. By Stanislaus von Moos. (Monacelli, cloth, $65; paper, $45.) Like their contemporary, Andy Warhol, the self-described Pop architects Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown have always been more appreciated in Europe than in America. It is easy to understand why. The deceptively superficial appearance of some work by this Philadelphia-based husband-and-wife team, as well as their nonjudgmental embrace of commercial imagery, has led certain critics to dismiss them as capitulating to the venal impulses of a celebrity-mad, consumer-driven society. Their genius for taking the givens of popular culture and transforming them into high art is more apparent to those at a safe remove from a setting where such wry (but also affectionate) appropriations hit a bit too close to home.
Among Venturi's and Scott Brown's most perceptive commentators is the Swiss architectural historian Stanislaus von Moos, a professor at the University of Zurich. This second volume in von Moos's survey of their complete works reconfirms him as a level-headed and insightful appraiser of their wildly varied output. Their schemes can be by turns appropriately majestic (like their Sainsbury Wing of 1986-91 at the National Gallery in London, which displays Renaissance paintings with immense nobility) or provocatively gaudy (the Hotel Mielparque Resort Complex of 1992-97 in Nikko, Japan, part ukiyo-e (floating-world) print, part comic book, part "Madama Butterfly" stage set). But these architects are auteurs of their medium, and every project of theirs is worthy of serious consideration.
For all their stylistic swings, Venturi and Scott Brown have developed a brisk business in campus architecture. At Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, among other schools, they have taken the Victorian collegiate style and abstracted it into an adaptable vocabulary of lively patterned brick jolted with the odd, unexpected detail, all the while responding to traditional settings much more effectively, and subversively, than the big names of modernism ever did.
GEHRY TALKS: Architecture + Process. Edited by Mildred Friedman. (Rizzoli, $65.) Because he almost never writes, Frank Gehry has been taken to task by his theory-oriented colleagues, who think that hypothesizing about architecture is more important than making it. Since the completion of Gehry's universally praised Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain two years ago, the audience of those who want to know why he designs and how he builds such idiosyncratic structures has grown exponentially.
To answer the clamor for a first-person account of his work, Gehry agreed to discuss his architecture with his old friend Mildred Friedman, the former design curator of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, who organized that museum's landmark 1986 retrospective of his work. Friedman has taped and edited a long series of conversations with the architect about his output since her show. This is the best explication yet of his creative method; it is exceptional for its comprehensiveness, clarity and extreme candor.
Friedman covers the decisive shift in Gehry's career from small-scale projects designed by conventional means to larger schemes of amazing complexity made possible by his firm's use of Catia, a computer program devised for plotting the irregular forms used in the aerospace industry. That software was the breakthrough that enabled him to retain the spontaneity of his initial sketches in the final design at Bilbao. "This is the first time I've gotten it," he says of that newfound freedom. "And once you taste blood, you're not going to give up."

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Even in Transition, A Seamless Sound

BYLINE: By SARAH BRYAN MILLER; Sarah Bryan Miller is the classical-music critic of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

 BODY:
A MUSICAL organization goes through constant minor transitions: changes in personnel, changes in repertory. Chanticleer, the 20-year-old male vocal ensemble based in San Francisco, has weathered its share of those. But now it faces a greater change, with a new general director and new performing ambitions.
"Chanticleer is definitely at a crossroads," said Lynn Luckow, the chairman of its board. "The question is, how do you build on past successes to ensure future significance?" 
 The 12-voice chorus, named for the rooster in Chaucer's "Nun's Priest's Tale" whose singing was "swich a joye," will perform three concerts of Christmas music in New York this week: one on Monday at Grace Church in Greenwich Village and two on Tuesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These are among the hundred or so concerts Chanticleer gives each year, 80 of them on tour in the United States and around the world. Chanticleer, which claims to be the nation's only full-time independent classical vocal group, was founded in 1978 by Louis Botto, a tenor who served as artistic director until his death in 1997. Its male sopranos and altos, singing in well-developed falsetto, join the tenors and baritones in an unusually seamless blend.
When Philip Wilder, an alto, joined Chanticleer 10 years ago, only eight members sang full time. "The swing people sat at home and waited for a chance," said Mr. Wilder, who doubles as artistic administrator. "In 1991, they made the financial commitment to have 12. That was a major shift in the way they did things. The repertoire changed, and so did the blend. In 1994, we signed with the Teldec label, which gave us worldwide publicity and added new opportunities and new challenges. There are growing pains for any music ensemble that gets this kind of acclaim. It's both a curse and a blessing."
Joseph Jennings, the music director since 1984, agreed. "When we went full time, a lot of our people had real jobs and couldn't just run off and join the circus," he said. "But it was the right thing to do. The whole idea was to attract career singers, as opposed to those who viewed singing as an avocation."
Chanticleer rehearses five hours a day, five days a week, when in San Francisco, a regimen that together with its collaborative artistic process makes for unusual security in its music-making. It performs without a conductor, and Mr. Jennings does not always travel with it.
"Most of our concert programs are done 50 times," he said. "The music actually comes to sing itself."
If there is any constant, it may be the Chanticleer sound. "It's a clear sound but one that has lots of color to it," Mr. Jennings said. "We choose singers who are flexible vocally and stylistically, and incorporate all the voices into the total fabric. We try to be as authentic as we can to each style, but we color that authenticity with our 20th-century American existence."
Mr. Botto's death was a great loss to the group. "Louis was so much more than a founder or a boss," Mr. Wilder said. "He was a dear friend. He ran it with the passion of a parent. We're moving in a more professional direction now, but it was a hard transition."
The transition should soon be complete. Christine Bullen, an administrator with a strong background in vocal music, is taking on the newly created position of president and general director. Ms. Bullen, who was director of the San Francisco Opera Center from 1982 to 1993, where her responsibilities included a touring company, is returning from a stint as director of the opera training center at the Paris National Opera.
"In Chanticleer's first phase, they developed themselves and their market," Ms. Bullen said. "Now the need is for administration, and to figure out what their new directions are for the new millennium. It's time to address some institutional issues about the group and its future, about the line between classical and nonclassical music, which is blurring, and the line between profit and nonprofit."
Chanticleer has moved beyond its original early-music focus to incorporate gospel and popular songs, and it regularly commissions new works. "The Renaissance and Baroque were their original statement and will continue to be their statement," Ms. Bullen said. "Chanticleer is very radiogenic. That its recordings are so well received is important going into the new century. But the group is still dedicated to live performance, to looking into the eyes of its audience."
Hilde Limondjian, the general manager for concerts and lectures at the Met Museum, welcomes that dedication. She first hired Chanticleer in 1991 and has brought it back every year since.
"They've sung everything for us, from early music to contemporary to Christmas carols, and they've built a wonderful following," she said. "For all the seriousness of their presentation, there's a lightness in their presentation, a joy and sparkle, which communicates to the audience."
The mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade, who performs with Chanticleer from time to time, called them "just extraordinary." "They offer inventive programs and inventive combinations of sound," she added, "and they are so much fun to work with and to hear."
Chanticleer spends about half its time on the road. Tours are usually kept under two weeks, except overseas, where such a limitation would make neither economic nor scheduling sense.
"Yes, it's hard work, but to be immersed in music to this degree, to touch as many lives we touch, really is a privilege," Mr. Jennings said. "Some people go through their whole lives wondering what they should be doing. We're lucky to know our calling."

Woolworth in New Jersey: A Love-Hate Relationship

BYLINE: By HELEN PIKE 

DATELINE: RUMSON

 BODY:
Atlantic City's lifeguards bought tanning lotion there. Menlo Park shoppers flocked to the chain's first art show. Customers in Elizabeth bought sheet music after pianists performed requests.
Every day, patrons in Newark lined up in front of the store on Broad Street -- its largest in the state -- to wait for a seat at the popular lunch counter. 
 Frank W. Woolworth knew in the 1880's what is now taken as fact: New Jersey's cities represented the potential for enormous retail success. His first store in the state opened in Trenton in 1885, just third in the nascent chain after Utica, N.Y., and Lancaster, Pa.
Indeed, New Jersey residents spent enough nickels and dimes to rank the state behind New York City and Chicago. By 1890, Woolworth's net worth was estimated at $100,000.
"Not bad for only having 100 stores in the country," commented Karen Plunkett-Powell of Rumson, who wrote the recently published "Remembering Woolworth's: A Nostalgic History of the World's Most Famous Five-and-Dime" (St. Martin's Press, $27.95). At that time, the Trenton store led the country in sales.
By the time Mr. Woolworth died in 1919, there were 1,081 stores nationwide, 38 of which were in New Jersey.
Initially, all Woolworth looked for was a heavily trafficked sidewalk on a city street near the train depot. The rest of his high-volume, low-margin strategy lay with inventory affordable to the working poor, many of them immigrants who had left an economically depressed Europe. By 1913, with the state's industrialized cities swelling, New Jersey sales constituted a significant portion of the $13.5 million in cash Woolworth paid to build his landmark Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Plunkett-Powell said.
Simply put, Woolworth was netting one penny for every five-cent item bought at the five and dime. The coins kept pouring in because Woolworth had changed the way people shopped. He was the first merchandiser to use open, self-service displays so customers could readily examine what they wanted to buy.
And Woolworth's was the first chain to offer glass Christmas tree ornaments and the first to have in-store dining -- separate tables plus a counter.
Woolworth's competitors followed him street by street around the country, usually opening about a year later. For example, in Asbury Park, Woolworth and and J. J. Newberry were side-by-side on Cookman Avenue. His other competitors included McCrory, Kress and Kresge.
"He had a burning desire to succeed and nothing else mattered," Ms. Plunkett-Powell said of the man, who also was a tireless promoter. One year, the largest Woolworth's in Elizabeth and Newark had piano players to play on demand.
"Frank was the first retailer to do this," she said. "While other big department stores had pianists play background music as customers shopped, Frank hired them expressly to sell sheet music."
The store in Menlo Park was the first in the chain to put on an art show. "Not Elvis painted on velvet," said Ms. Plunkett-Powell, "but fine art.."
And Woolworth's was the first American chain to offer men a training program so they could work their way up from stock boy to the executive suite. But Woolworth also made his managers sign contracts stipulating they would never gamble in the stock market, though they could by buy shares of stock in F. W. Woolworth Company.
Not surprisingly, many employees considered their boss a busybody. Because of the New Jersey stores' proximity to the Manhattan headquarters, Woolworth personally kept managers on their toes by arriving in a disguise and trying to shoplift.
He also wanted highbrow retail at lowbrow prices, so his bargain stores carried products with such names as Fifth Avenue stationery, Evening in Paris perfume and Palm Beach lotion.
But those names did not unlock the door to the high society to which he desperately aspired. During the Gilded Age, he bought his way into the Deal Golf Club, said Ms. Plunkett-Powell. Other charter members included President McKinley, George M. Pullman and William Randolph Hearst.
But like their summer neighbors -- Isador Straus, who owned Macy's, and Frank Hartford of A&P -- they didn't accept the merchant who sold "Cheap John" goods, and Woolworth eventually moved his family to a mansion in Glen Cove, N.Y., on the North Shore of Long Island.
Frank Winfield Woolworth was born in 1852 on the family's meager potato farm in Rodman, N.Y., about 11 miles from Watertown, where he got his first job as a stock boy in a general store. He died in 1919 at Winfield House, his mansion in Glen Cove. He and his wife, Jennie, had three daughters who were raised to enjoy all that the nickels and dimes could buy. But neither the daughters nor their children took an active interest in the daily business of the company.
The so-called heirs to the Woolworth empire were his executives, including Hubert T. Parsons, his eventual successor, whom he treated as the son he never had. Mr. Parsons built the country's only small-scale reproduction of Versailles, in West Long Branch. Today it is the administrative building for Monmouth University.
In 1960, when the company was approaching its corporate peak with $1.35 billion in sales worldwide, there were 300 stores in New Jersey. The 287 in North Jersey generated $30 million, and the Newark stores alone $5.94 million.
The Woolworth Company's decline was a slow 20-year process that began when consumers' buying habits started to change because of the appearance of shopping malls. It reflected the change from downtowns and trolleys to automobiles and enclosed shopping arcades.
The second shift was from within the company as it diversified its divisions, beginning with the acquisition of Kinney Shoes. The Venator Group, the more upscale athletic gear unit that today owns Foot Locker and Champs, began outperforming the five-and-dime division.
It wasn't until the Woolworth doors started closing in the summer of 1997 -- when there were only 34 stores left in the state -- that Ms. Plunkett-Powell began receiving phone calls from lifelong employees.
In addition to executives giving out her phone number, Ms. Plunkett-Powell received calls, letters and e-mail responding to an ad she ran in Writer's Digest and a request she posted on the message board of the Woolworth/Venator stock page on the Internet's stock board.
"They needed to talk, to reminisce, to have someone listen to their stories," she said.
She was struck by the similarity of experiences no matter what city and state: marriages between store managers and sales clerks; the smell of grilled cheese sandwiches and the banana split giveaways; flirtatious GI's who swarmed the candy counters on V.E. and V.J. days; of teenagers who crammed the ubiquitous photo booths.
Company trivia is sprinkled throughout "Remembering Woolworth's" such as the 250 million pounds of gum sold in 1950 or the 1929 back-to-school season, when 4,000 miles of pencils and 300 miles of pen points were sold. The book also has 57 personal recollections from around the world.
"I promised my mother I would imitate the lives of the saints if she would buy me a blue parakeet," said Clare Wharton of Parsippany of the pet she chose over the menagerie of miniature turtles, hamsters, goldfish and baby chicks at the Fair Lawn store, where they shopped in the 1950's. By the time Ms. Wharton's mother finished her errands in the sewing department, she had given in to her daughter's pleadings.
"Six dollars could sure buy a lot of happiness," Ms. Wharton recalled.
As for Ms. Plunkett-Powell, a native of Jersey City, where there were four Woolworth stores, news that the Venator Group would close the variety stores to concentrate on athletic goods "touched me personally."
Ms. Plunkett-Powell, who wrote "The Nancy Drew Scrapbook: 60 Years of America's Favorite Teenage Sleuth" (St. Martins's Press, 1993), remembers buying her first Nancy Drew mystery at her neighborhood Woolworth, the hub for nearly all social activity.
"Where else could you go to meet friends?" she asked. "Or buy pantyhose in a pinch when you were on your way to meet a boy?"

Community College Enrollment Reaches an All-Time High

BYLINE: By KAREN DEMASTERS 

 BODY:
Full-time enrollment in New Jersey's 19 community colleges reached an all-time high this year after falling slightly in 1998. Part-time enrollment remained nearly steady from last year, though drastically down from the early 1990's.
Full-time enrollment, mostly by students acquiring two-year associate's degrees, reached 55,425, a 3.3 percent increase over last year's enrollment of 53,600, according to the New Jersey Council of County Colleges. The 1999 enrollment topped the previous high of 54,600, reached in 1993. 
 Tuition freezes at most of the colleges account in part for the increase, said Lawrence Nespoli, council president.
Enrollment of part-time students held steady for 1998 and 1999 at almost 67,500, according to the survey. However, that number is a dramatic decline from the 85,000 part-time students in 1993, according to another study, conducted by the state Commission on Higher Education and expected to be released later this month, said Judy Savage, a spokeswoman for the commission.
A strong economy and high employment usually mean a decline in part-time enrollment, Ms. Savage said. KAREN DeMASTERS

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Murray Hill;
A Quiet Enclave Close to Midtown

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
THE Murray Hill neighborhood, an urban enclave just south of Grand Central Terminal and the Midtown office district, is known for its 19th-century brownstones, clean streets and trees -- 505 of them according to community activists. But, say real estate professionals, it is also notably undervalued.
"I've been working here for 30 years and have been waiting for prices to take off," lamented Nicholas B. Fiore, president of Brixton, Camberwell & Poole Ltd., a real estate firm that specializes in Murray Hill. "People view it as old fashioned, without the trendy bars and the action of hotter areas, such as Chelsea. So beautiful brownstones here can go for 30 percent less than similar ones in neighborhoods that I don't think are as good." 
 But the president of the 1,200-member Murray Hill Neighborhood Association has a different outlook.
"We like it quiet," said Diane G. Bartow. "We are a stable population that has remained in the area for a long time."
The main shopping street is Third Avenue, a low-key area with one supermarket, several dry cleaners, greengrocers and reasonably priced restaurants. Among the better-known eating establishments in the area are Hudson Place (American and Chinese), Nicola Paone (northern Italian), El Rio Grande (Tex-Mex), and Sarge's Deli, all in the Third Avenue corridor.
Community Board 6, which includes Murray Hill, defines the area as from 34th to 40th and from the East River to Madison Avenue.
Housing is divided between four-story, 19th-century town houses -- mostly brownstones and limestones -- on the streets, and high-rise apartment buildings, mainly on the avenues. Town houses go for between $1.5 million and $3 million, according to Mr. Fiore, with a rule of thumb being about $350 per square foot of living space. Rents in town houses range from about $1,300 per month for a studio walkup to about $2,800 for some two-bedroom units.
Co-op apartments in high-rise buildings start at about $120,000 for some small studios and go up to $450,000 or more for two-bedroom units in luxury buildings. Condos are mainly in the luxury high-rise buildings and start at about $250,000 and exceed $550,000 for some two-bedroom units.
Among the more luxurious buildings, according to Mr. Fiore, is the elegant Griffon, a 15-story prewar building at 77 Park Avenue, at 39th Street.
OF the newer luxury buildings, the largest is the 57-story, 863-unit Corinthian on First Avenue and 38th Street, where amenities include a health club with a running track and pool. Peter Katz of Madison International Real Estate, who specializes in high-rise apartments in Murray Hill, says that prices in the Corinthian start at $350,000 for some one-bedroom apartments and can go as high as $800,000 for some two-bedroom units on high floors.
The two things that residents of Murray Hill hate most, according to a survey conducted by the neighborhood association, are noise and traffic, both a which are present in abundance. The Queens Midtown Tunnel exits onto East 35th Street, funneling traffic through the neighborhood's narrow streets, just past the brownstone owned by Stephen A. Weingrad, a lawyer who is former president of the association.
"The good part is that the tunnel and our proximity to Midtown makes us convenient to everything," Mr. Weingrad explained. "The bad part is that this also makes everyone else drive through our neighborhood."
The primary school serving Murray Hill is the 820-pupil P.S. 116 at 210 East 33rd Street, which covers grades 1 to 5 and has a highly rated gifted and talented program. Enrollment has grown by 12 percent since 1996, reflecting Ms. Bartow's contention that more young families are moving into the neighborhood.
On standardized tests, P.S. 116 students consistently outperform city averages. For instance, on third grade reading tests, 95.1 percent of P.S. 116 students demonstrated they could read at grade level, compared with a city average of 65 percent; on fourth grade science tests, 98.4 percent of the students performed at state grade levels, compared with 89.3 percent of city students.
 Murray Hill takes its name from Robert Murray, a Quaker merchant who moved from Pennsylvania to New York in 1753 and built a farmhouse at what is now the corner of 37th Street and Park Avenue. Grand Central Terminal was built on what was the Murray cornfield.
Murray's wife, Mary, is said to have played a key role in the Revolutionary War. When Gen. William Howe crossed the East River from Long Island in 1776, pursuing Washington's troops and attacking New York City, Mrs. Murray and her daughters invited General Howe and his officers to tea.
They accepted and were detained long enough to allow Washington and his troops to escape. The Daughters of the American Revolution has put a plaque honoring Mary Murray at 130 East 37th Street at Lexington Avenue, the site of the Murray Mansion, which burned down in 1835.
The descendants of Robert and Mary Murray also played a key role in the preservation of the residential character of the neighborhood. In 1847, they drew up the Murray Hill Restrictive Agreement, which still applies to some of the older deeds. Those deeds contain clauses banning the use of the properties for slaughterhouses, glue factories or circuses.
LED by the neighborhood association, residents jealously guard the character of their enclave. Among the association's successes was thwarting a 1960's attempt by the city to improve traffic flow to and from the Midtown Tunnel at the expense of the neighborhood, according to Mr. Weingrad, the former association president.
"The city wanted to widen 35th and 36th Streets coming out of the tunnel," he explained "So they decided to condemn all of the stoops of the brownstones for several blocks and pay the owners to create new, street-level entrances. We fought it and they dropped the plan."
There is a small historic district in the neighborhood, covering Sniffen Court, a dead-end alley of 10 two-story houses on 36th Street between Third and Lexington Avenues. The houses were originally built by John Sniffen in the 1850's as stables for Murray Hill residents. They were converted into town houses in the 1920's.
The association has urged the Landmarks Preservation Commission to have most of Murray Hill declared a historic district, which would make it practically impossible for developers to buy up brownstones, knock them down and build larger structures. There are 13 designated historic buildings in the area, not including the first home of Franklin D. and Eleanor Roosevelt, a 14-foot-wide brownstone at 125 East 36th Street.
"There are 109 buildings in the area concerned and we have the support of 54 property owners so far," said Ronald Kahn, an architect who lives in Murray Hill and is spearheading the historic district effort.
BESIDES the historic district, the main issue that the neighborhood association is now concerned with is the proposed sale of four acres of Consolidated Edison industrial sites along the river.
"If they sell to residential developers who build 90-story apartment house towers," said Mr. Kahn, "they could double the population of the neighborhood."
The neighborhood association has joined with community groups from several other neighborhoods in the East Midtown Coalition for Sensible Development to monitor developments at the site, according to Ms. Bartow.
"We want to be able to react prior to any developer getting approvals, rather than after the fact, when it might be too late," she explained.
Among the important resources in the neighborhood are the New York City Science, Industry and Business Library on 34th Street at Madison Avenue, and Stern College, the women's branch of Yeshiva University, at Lexington and 35th Street. And its most outstanding historical site, by far, is the marble and limestone Italian-style Pierpont Morgan Library, which J. Pierpont Morgan completed next to his mansion in 1906.
The library, at 29 East 36th Street, includes Morgan's structure, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, and an annex, built in 1928 by his son, J. P. Morgan Jr.
The library houses an extensive collection of books and manuscripts, including three of the 47 remaining Gutenberg Bibles. It is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday, noon to 6 p.m. Admission is free, but there is a requested contribution of $7 for adults and $5 for children and the elderly.
Through Jan. 9, 2000, the Morgan Library is running an exhibition called "The Great Experiment: George Washington and the American Republic." It traces Washington's evolution from loyal British subject to revolutionary leader and first president of the United States.

MORGAN'S MIGHT: On Nov. 2, 1907, the country was two weeks into an economic panic. There was a run on the banks, several of which had failed, and the New York Stock Exchange was in turmoil. The Trust Company of America, one of the largest trusts in the world, was in danger of collapsing and sparking a depression. J. Pierpont Morgan gathered 50 of the nation's leading bankers in his library in Murray Hill. He insisted that they come up with $25 million in loans and guarantees to save the Trust Company of America. Bankers who tried to leave found the doors locked. At 4:15 a.m., Morgan presented the bankers with his plan, under which each was obligated to fund a portion of the bailout package. The first of the bankers was led to the table and given a pen. He signed the agreement and the others followed suit, averting the crisis.

HEADLINE: Nouveaux Riches Learn the Rules

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
SINCE 1984, when he bought Oheka Castle, Gary Melius has met many wealthy Long Islanders who live in grand homes on the legendary Gold Coast.
The Cold Spring Hills castle, completed in 1919, was once the home of the financier Otto Hermann Kahn. With 126 rooms, a dining room that seats 200 and a full domestic staff, the castle was the site of frequent and extravagant parties. 
 Mr. Melius, a prominent developer and businessman who lives in Carle Place and restored the estate for private parties, knows a growing number of Long Islanders with "new money" who live on the Gold Coast but are unfamiliar with the rules that dominated the era.
"We live in big houses but we don't know how to manage a domestic staff and we don't throw lavish parties," Mr. Melius said. "We're not from the Gold Coast era and don't know the lifestyle from that time."
Just after the turn of the century, during a time of great prosperity, families with names like Vanderbilt, Whitney, Phipps, Kahn and Guggenheim built opulent homes in which to hold grand parties. Situated along the North Shore from Great Neck to Huntington, their mansions were run by staffs of butlers, grooms, gatekeepers and chambermaids, and their social interactions were dominated by codes of etiquette.
As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in "The Great Gatsby," the Gold Coast era was "a time that would never come again."
With money not from oil or copper but from Wall Street, the Internet and a booming economy, more families are moving to the Gold Coast -- some into original mansions that have been renovated, and others into newer grand homes. Yet despite their wealth and yearning for the elegant living of the past, etiquette experts say, these families often do not know how a proper table should be set, how to hold a proper dinner party or how to manage a domestic staff.
"For people with new money," said Christopher Allen of East Hampton, a former butler and an etiquette consultant, "there is often a gap between their new social status and their knowledge of etiquette. They have so much money, but nothing to back it up. Unlike those with old money, these people didn't go to charm school or learn how to dance properly, and don't know how to behave. They send their children to private school, but manners are not taught. I have no doubt that many will have to ask someone to teach their children how to eat properly."
Clifford Greenhouse, co-owner of the Pavillion Agency, a domestic agency in New York City that serves many clients on the Gold Coast, agreed.
"People with new money are hungry for acceptance into society," he said, "but have no experience and are lost as to how to achieve it. To run a 20,000-square-foot house they need a domestic staff, but don't know the rules of how to treat that staff or how to get the most out of them."
Teaching wealthy homeowners how to manage a domestic staff has become a growing part of the business at his agency, said Mr. Greenhouse, adding that over the last four years, the butler business has doubled.
"Homes often start with one key staff member who plays the most important role in managing the house," he said. "Depending on a family's lifestyle, it may be a chef or a butler who becomes the house manager, and then he educates the family on proper etiquette."
Home entertaining has become more fashionable in recent years, said Mr. Allen, requiring wealthy homeowners to increase their domestic staffs and learn how to use the appropriate utensil at dinner.
The return to home entertaining comes largely in response to the depersonalization of today's technology-driven society, said Carol Abramson, a personal etiquette coach in Muttontown.
"So many people who years ago gave away their good china now want to host dinner parties," she said, "and are going out to buy a new set."
A growing interest in learning the art of etiquette drew about 80 people to a lecture at Old Westbury Gardens on a recent Sunday afternoon.
Mr. Allen, the lecturer, told the group, "Manners have become so relaxed that people often don't know the right way to behave." He demonstrated the proper way to set a table and shared his own rules of etiquette.
"The oyster fork is the only fork that goes on the right side of the plate," he said, "placed in the bowl of the soup spoon. But more than three pieces of cutlery on either side of the plate is ostentatious."
When asked whether to place a napkin to the left or right of the dinner plate, he answered, "Personally, I like to put it in the glass."
There were questions about proper table manners, including which fork to use for salad or dessert, how to position the spoon when finished with soup, whether to wait for the host to be served before beginning to eat, and whether it is acceptable to eat certain foods with the hands.
"If it's on the bone," Mr. Allen reassured his audience, "like chicken or lamb chops, you can pick it up."
Ginny Parker, who traveled to the lecture from her Northport home, admitted: "I'm very concerned about the death of etiquette, especially among the younger generation who haven't learned the rules from their parents. There's no time today for families to spend together and they often don't eat together anymore."
This situation prompted Margaret DelVecchio of Baldwin to start etiquette classes for children ages 8 to 17. Two programs, Etiquette for Today and Dining Skills for Today, have been growing steadily over the last few years, she said.
"Those who grow up with a lack of proper etiquette become adults who lack manners," Ms. DelVecchio said. "Kids may not want to come to etiquette classes, but their parents are realizing a need for their children to learn these important skills."
Knowing the rules of etiquette makes people more relaxed, Mr. Allen said.
"The bottom line is that good manners make us feel comfortable with ourselves in social situations," he said. "Truly well-mannered individuals will make others feel comfortable as well, and will never make anyone feel below them."

HEADLINE: County's Health Chief to Retire

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AFTER steering the county through a series of health crises -- including an increase in tuberculosis cases in 1997 and 1998, a rubella epidemic in 1998 and an outbreak of West Nile-like encephalitis virus this summer -- Dr. Harold N. Adel, the county's health commissioner, has announced his retirement, effective Jan. 31.
Citing the lure of his grandchildren, his cello and his hiking boots, Dr. Adel, 69, said his decision to step down was "one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made." 
 He continued, "My work in public health has been extraordinarily gratifying, especially during the last few months, dealing with encephalitis issues and developing strategies to bring the mosquito population under control."
Dr. Adel joined the County Health Department in 1990 as its deputy commissioner and was appointed commissioner three years ago by Andrew P. O'Rourke, who was then the county executive.
The commissioner said he had planned to retire several months ago but stayed on the job because of the encephalitis problem. The West Nile-like virus, which is spread to humans by mosquitoes, killed at least one Westchester resident this year and infected eight others in the county.
A total of 6 people in the New York City area died, and 55 others suffered from symptoms of the virus.
In fighting the outbreak, Dr. Adel developed Operation Mosquito Sting, a surveillance program to control infected insects next spring without resorting to the broad-based aerial spraying that was used this fall.
In a recent interview, Dr. Adel said the initial effort to identify the West Nile virus and control it foreshadowed a serious health concern that will most likely further occupy health officials. As the global economy expands, he said, diseases are traveling more easily from their native habitats. That mobility, he said, is requiring health officials to identify foreign viruses quickly to develop effective strategies against them.
West Nile virus, according to health experts, was most likely brought to the United States by an infected bird from Africa aboard a ship. Unsuspecting officials at first confused the disease with St. Louis encephalitis and took weeks to identify the actual virus.
Also during his tenure as commissioner, Dr. Adel started a program to prevent lead poisoning in children. It was financed by grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the State Department of Health. The program is now recognized nationally as a model for identifying lead-poisoned children and removing lead hazards from the environment.
In addition, Dr. Adel developed the Community Partnership for a Healthy Westchester, a public-private initiative that resulted in the establishment of a Child Health Task Force, which makes sure that every child has health insurance.
He was also responsible for starting an Environmental Health Task Force to teach the public, develop programs and recommend legislation to minimize the use of pesticides by county residents, businesses and government.
In large part during the last three years, the commissioner has focused on the economic and social causes of ill health (unemployment and sub-standard housing, for example) -- which he called, "the disgraceful disparity between the health of minorities and the rest of the county."
Now, even though he is formally stepping down from his duties as health commissioner, Dr. Adel will continue to work on some of the same issues. Besides teaching internal medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, he plans to continue part-time with the county to oversee programs to deter cigarette smoking, for which County Executive Andrew J. Spano has allotted $2.5 million.
Before joining the County Health Department, Dr. Adel, a Larchmont resident for 37 years, was a professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College. He received his medical degree in 1954 from New York University and his master's degree in public health from Columbia University in 1981, and he served as a fellow in hospital administration at Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., from 1986 to 1987. He earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1950.
He is currently professor of medicine emeritus at at Albert Einstein College, adjunct professor of medicine at New York Medical College and distinguished lecturer at the Graduate School of Health Sciences of New York Medical College. He also serves as a member of the Health and Public Policy Committee of the New York State Chapter of the American College of Physicians/ American Society of Internal Medicine, and he is a member of the governor's advisory council on lead poisoning prevention, the Westchester Community College medical advisory board and the executive steering committee of the health care management program at Pace University in White Plains.
When he is not occupied with public health concerns, Dr. Adel said that he will, among other things, reunite with a lost love: his cello, which his daughter Lori bought him 28 years ago. He also plans to spend more time with his four grandchildren and to hike more.
The county executive has asked Dr. Adel to coordinate the search for his successor. Until a successor is appointed, Dr. Jean Hudson, the deputy commissioner for community health services, will serve as acting commissioner.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property;
Bites and Bytes at an Old Cookie Factory

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
WITH the production lines that baked the first Oreo cookies long gone, the owners of the blocklong former Nabisco plant between 15th and 16th Streets have cooked up a new recipe for profits that has put food on the ground floor and is now folding in tenants such as Oxygen Media, Major League Baseball Productions and New York 1 News on the upper floors.
When the celebrity chefs of the Food Network wield their whisks early next year, they will do so in a glassed-in street-level kitchen and studio that is to be installed on the 10th Avenue end of the building. The location is a natural for the cable television channel because it will be in the same building that houses Chelsea Market, an arcade of almost two dozen food stores selling products ranging from meat and fish to wine and baked goods. The landlord intends to wire the first floor so the channel can broadcast directly from the large wholesale food preparation operations that underpin the modest retail stores. 
 "If we are talking about fish or meat or produce, we can walk a camera down the hall and film there," said Eric Ober, president of the Food Network.
The network will have 8,000 square feet of what was once a loading dock on the first floor for the test kitchen and studio, with an additional 18,000 square feet in the basement for production and technical operations.
Mr. Ober said he hopes the ground floor kitchen and studio, which will be enclosed in glass on two sides, will communicate the energy of New York to viewers the way the broadcast networks have been using views of city street scenes to perk up their morning news and chat shows.
Although best known as a place where cooks can get supplies, the building, which occupies the block between Ninth and 10th Avenues, is rapidly becoming a media center as well. Oxygen Media, a cable and Web venture oriented to women, is already in residence, with New York 1 News, a local news and Internet service provider, and Major League Baseball's recording studios preparing to move in.
The media companies are taking advantage of the unusually large spaces available in the old factory building. Nabisco operated a large bakery in the complex of 17 interconnected buildings for decades before leaving the city in 1958. The first Oreo cookie was made here in 1912 by Nabisco's predecessor, the National Biscuit Company.
The market is largely the creation of Irwin Cohen, a lawyer turned developer who had previously specialized in industrial properties, mostly in Long Island City. Many real estate executives credit him with helping revive the neighborhood by attracting people from other parts of the city who wanted to purchase the freshest of foods directly from wholesalers.
"The building is a community and he is the mayor of Chelsea," said Stuart Romanoff, an executive director of Cushman & Wakefield who represented New York 1 News in its lease of 55,000 square feet in the top floor of one sector of the building. "He develops a relationship with his tenants and tries to please them."
"There is a warm atmosphere there; it's like a village," said Jeffrey Polikoff, the director of operations at New York 1 News, which will commence operations there in spring 2001. "I've already met most of the tenants in the building." Mr. Polikoff said that Mr. Cohen was welcomed by tenants as he toured the building, which is not always the case. "Usually, you run away from your landlord," he said.
"Irwin is a real visionary," said Barry Gosin, the chief executive of Newmark and Company, which represented Major League Baseball in its decision to lease 25,000 square feet on the fifth and sixth floors on the north side of the building. "Today the area has real energy that has been fueled largely by new media."
THAT foresight is paying off financially. Brokers report that annual rents in the Chelsea Market building have risen from the teens to the mid-$30's a square foot range for the most recently concluded deals.
Five years ago a lot of vision was needed. When Mr. Cohen purchased the building, whose official address is 75 Ninth Avenue, in 1995, the neighborhood was considered distant and unpleasant and the structure itself in bad condition. Mr. Cohen bought the property with a group of European investors who have since been replaced by American real estate investment firms including Angelo, Gordon & Company, Belvedere Capital and Scoggin Capital Management.
Although it fills the entire block and appears to be one structure, it is actually a combination of 17 buildings built at various times between the 1890's and the mid-1930's.
"Nabisco started on Ninth Avenue and built its way to 10th Avenue and leaped across it before going away," said Jeff J. Vandeberg, the architect of Chelsea Market.
As a result, the first floor was a rabbit warren of small spaces with floors of uneven heights. Some parts of the building are solid concrete, while others are steel covered with concrete and still others are largely built out of massive cedar columns and planks. Elevators are scattered throughout the building, rather than gathered in a single core as in modern designs.
"The heating system was obsolete, it was short of electricity, the plumbing was poor, the roofs were below poor, the elevators were barely operating and the basement was filled with 60 to 70 years worth of garbage," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Cohen said he originally thought of trying to attract the city's flower market to the building, but when that did not work out he decided to emphasize food. "The idea was to take advantage of the ethnic diversity of New York," he said.
To make the first-floor space accessible, he arranged to raise and lower floors until everything was on one level and, where necessary, broke through walls. There is ample evidence of this on the main first-floor corridor, which runs through two ragged-edged brick arches that were solid walls before the renovation.
Although it looks unfinished, Mr. Vandeberg said the effect was intentional and that the structure is completely stable. "It's a parabolic opening," he said. "I drew the outline on the wall and guys with jackhammers followed it." Other interior walls blocking the corridor were removed completely.
The basis for the central corridor, Mr. Cohen said, was an old railroad track that ran into the building from docks on the Hudson River bringing in flour and other supplies for the former bakery. Shoppers who look up at the peaked ceiling may notice the vent windows intended to draw out the smoke and sparks emitted by the coal-burning locomotives.
By drawing shoppers into the interior of the building, Mr. Cohen was able to preserve the outer wall for the loading docks needed by the wholesale businesses instead of converting them to retail spaces, as would be done in many renovations. Mr. Vandeberg said that the avenue-to-avenue corridor was part of the design from the first, but that many details of the conversion were decided on as work proceeded, rather than being rigidly designed in advance.
The corridor -- which Mr. Cohen maintains is the longest interior walkway in a single building in the city -- is decorated in a style that can only be described as eclectic. Slabs of stone are on display with remnants of the holes drilled in preparation for blasting clearly visible, and cast-iron body parts -- ears, noses, feet -- protrude from the bare brick walls.
The centerpiece of it all is near the midpoint of the corridor and can be heard before it can be seen. It is Mr. Cohen's idea for an urban waterfall: water gushing from a large pipe into a pit well below the corridor's surface. Mr. Cohen said that most people find the sound of falling water soothing and that it eliminates any temptation to pipe canned music into the space.
(An exception to the no-music rule is made around this time of year for school choral groups singing holiday songs.)
Mr. Cohen said the old factory building was well suited to wholesale food operations because of the large number of loading docks and space to sort and process raw materials. But he said the operators of wholesale businesses were leery at the thought of dealing directly with the public at retail.
"Every one of them said to me, 'We don't sell to the public, we don't know how,' " Mr. Cohen said. "I told them, 'Neither do I. We'll learn together.' " He said one of the advantages of combining the wholesale and retail businesses is that the people who prepare the food are right next to those who sell it. "Every tenant in this building produces what they sell," he said.
THE wholesaler-retailers in the building include Amy's Breads, Frank's Butcher Shop, Sarabeth's, The Lobster Place and Ruthy's Cheesecake and Rugelach.
Before opening the food concourse in 1997, Mr. Cohen mounted powerful lights on the outside of the building with the objective of driving prostitutes and other undesirable hangers-on to more shadowy parts of the city. After the ground floor was established, he continued moving out most industrial tenants, such as printers, and preparing the spaces for new types of occupants.
One tenant that takes advantage of the large, rounded windows on a top floor of the building is a photography studio called The Space. David Rose, one of the partners in the business, said that when they first moved in, some clients were somewhat uneasy about coming to the area. But, he said, "That was five years ago. Now there are other studios in the area. It's a hub."
Mr. Cohen said that the aesthetics of The Space's space was wasted in the Nabisco era, when that area of the building was used as a laundry.
Oxygen Media has taken 64,000 square feet on the top floors of the building, where the 55-foot-high, column-free space on the uppermost floor once housed huge ovens. The company has installed a mezzanine level around the periphery of the top floor that is reached by an open stairway in the middle of the space. Much of the space not devoted to studios is furnished with open work stations.
The company was looking for space in a nontraditional part of the city from the start, said Theodore Rotante, a vice president of Julien J. Studley, which represented Oxygen Media. He said Mr. Cohen was eager to attract a media company to replace the garment manufacturer that occupied part of the space.
Nevertheless, he said, it took almost a year to put the deal together as Oxygen officials struggled to be confident that the factory building would work for a media company. "It was exciting and intimidating," he said. Once Oxygen had demonstrated that the location was suitable, other media companies began to make inquiries.
"Major League Baseball, New York 1 and Food Network all came after Oxygen," he said.
Some tenants have taken unusual design approaches to fitting out their space, despite the constraints imposed by an old building. When the elevator door opens to the offices of Nick & Paul, a brand-development agency, there is no receptionist to greet visitors.
Instead, they are faced with a curving corridor made of sloping sheets of translucent plastic. Those who follow it -- and it narrows as it goes -- finally find themselves in a larger but still curved space with something that looks like a reception desk.
Paul Bennett, one of the founders of the company, said that the shape of the offices was intended to express its philosophy and encourage unconventional thinking. "We don't want boxed, rigid thinking," he said. "If you look at the space from above, you would see that the design is two overlapping circles, which is symbolic of what we do."
He said the design also helped create a community within the company by not isolating anyone from the center of operations. "We have this huge elliptical courtyard," he said, "and the corridor is designed to lead people into the middle."
Major League Baseball Productions is the programming and production arm of the game and it is planning to occupy 25,000 square feet in the building. Currently the unit produces commemorative videos and a television program, Baseball Max, which is seen on the Fox sports network.
But bigger things are in the offing, said Stephen Hellmuth, the general manager. "The place is designed for a 24 hour a day baseball channel, which is clearly in our future," he said. "We have a huge fan base, each team plays 162 games a year and with news about trades and other things we will have plenty of content for a round-the-clock channel."
The old factory, with floors capable of supporting 200 pounds per square foot, was more attractive than modern office buildings with much less weight-bearing capacity because it permitted the installation of all the equipment needed to keep the station in business regardless of power failures or other interruptions.
"Irwin let me set my space up my way," Mr. Hellmuth said. "I have my own generator and my own air-conditioning and we command a lot of access to the roof for satellite dishes."
The sturdy structure also allows the station to keep a large portion of baseball's historical films and videos on hand for use in current productions. Of the 200,000 video cassettes and 100,000 reels of film in its archives, Mr. Hellmuth said, about 80,000 tape cassettes and 20,000 reels of film will be stored in the studio for easy access.
ALL the media tenants said that the high ceilings in the building would allow them to place lighting and cameras in the best positions for good pictures. "We do everything in our newsroom, and the angle of the lighting is important," said Mr. Polikoff of New York 1. "We don't want our people working in a cave."
Mr. Hellmuth said the presence of the food market downstairs was a factor in the decision to locate in the building, particularly in view of the plans to move to 24-hour operations. "It's going to be a wonderful place for creative people to be able to get something to eat no matter what time it is, and meet other creative people," he said.
Although the retail stores are currently not open around the clock, Mr. Polikoff said he expects that the vendors will find a way to meet the demand as more 24-hour tenants move into the building. "They are here 24 hours for their other operations and I think they will work things out," he said. "As it is, if you want fruit baskets in the morning or bagels, they get it done."
He said that with the food companies on site, finding meals late in the day becomes an elevator ride, rather than a long walk to an all-night eatery. "In other buildings, it can take a long walk to find food," Mr. Polikoff said. "This really is a little village."
Although the building is now almost completely leased, Mr. Cohen admits that not all his ideas have worked out as planned. One of his innovations was to install tanks of water over the elevator lobby on the Ninth Avenue side of the building stocked with various types of aquatic animals for people to watch as they waited for the elevator cars to arrive.
The original eels, salamanders, frogs and crayfish have been replaced with more prosaic tropical fish. "The other ones ate each other," he said.

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR;
When a 'Hit' Is a Grand Slam

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
WHEN Paul Sagan left his job as president of the ailing new-media division of Time Warner three years ago, he described the frustration of trying to measure online success. "You have 'hits,' which don't really mean anything," he said. "So you were always grabbing at clouds."
With his new venture, a start-up called Akamai Technolgies Inc., Mr. Sagan has not had trouble finding signs of accomplishment, or the value of hits. When Akamai (pronounced AH-kuh-my) went public Oct. 29, it raised more than $1.3 billion, and the one-day surge -- 458 percent -- was among the largest ever for a new offering. For $533,100, Mr. Sagan received nearly three million shares, now worth $617 million. 
 As president and chief operating officer, Mr. Sagan hasn't had to run a gantlet of skeptics, as when he founded the New York 1 cable news service and championed interactive television at Time Warner. From his office near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he doesn't mind the lack of opposition. "Sometimes," he said, "we can jump over a step."
Mr. Sagan, 40, said he saw "the real thing" in Akamai, an Internet delivery service that acts like a traffic cop, using its servers to reroute Internet traffic to head off congestion. It has more than 100 clients, including Yahoo, Disney's Go Network, J. Crew and Infoseek.
While Mr. Sagan cannot read the company's programming code ("Fortran was the last language I really programmed in"), his feel for technology is better than one might expect from his background. In eighth grade, he took photographs for the suburban newspapers his father owned outside Chicago, eventually working as a reporter. A summer job at CBS in Los Angeles led to a full-time job as a field producer at the Chicago affiliate while he studied journalism at Northwestern University.
Between school years, he worked summers at WCBS-TV in New York. Peter Landis, then a writer there, said Mr. Sagan stood out as the only desk assistant to wear a coat and tie. "Initially some people thought -- myself included -- that here was this somewhat snotty kid who was coming into the newsroom and thought he was going to take over," said Mr. Landis, now news director at New York 1. "Of course, a few years later, he took over."
By the age of 27, Mr. Sagan had become the youngest news director ever at a CBS affiliate, and kept this grueling post for four years.
Some take Mr. Sagan's self-assurance as arrogance, Mr. Landis said, but most quickly come to respect him. Mr. Landis said he admired his energy and quick wit enough to follow him in 1991 to start New York 1 for Time Warner. Mr. Sagan saw New York 1 as a challenge. "They told us we'd fail," he said. "Within a year we were one of the highest-rated networks, period, in New York City."
Walter Isaacson, then head of new media at Time Warner, recruited Mr. Sagan in 1993 to join the team that created Road Runner, an Internet access service, and Pathfinder, an umbrella Web site for Time Warner publications -- and one of the most elaborate sites of the time. Pathfinder, derided by analysts as a "money pit," has since shut down.
But even when Time Inc.'s chief executive, Don Logan, said that Pathfinder gave new definition to the term "black hole," Mr. Sagan kept his sense of humor. "Nothing ever jangles him," Mr. Isaacson said. If he found a way to save money, "he'd say, 'Let's plug this part of the black hole.' "
Mr. Sagan became president and editor of Time New Media in 1995 but left after a year. Some industry analysts said the departure had more to do with company friction than with his proclaimed desire to spend time with his family.
Mr. Sagan disagreed. "I didn't have a horrible disease, I didn't get fired, I didn't help somebody embezzle," he said. He explained that he had wanted to slow down and take his three young children to live abroad -- a "secret fantasy" that he and his wife, Ann Burks Sagan, who once worked in corporate finance, had developed during his hectic days as a news director.
"I was tethered to the TV," he said, adding that the family television had three screens so he could watch the local newscasts simultaneously. "My children thought everyone should have three TV's," he said. "And I thought it was just a horrible, horrible thing."
So he whisked them out of Montclair, N.J., first to Colorado and then to Geneva, where he did consulting for the World Economic Forum -- and a lot of skiing.
When he returned to the United States last year, he wanted to help build a new media company rather than join, or rejoin, an older one. "The big media companies -- and I don't mean just Time Warner, but I think you can say this about all of them -- they've generally lagged behind the start-ups," Mr. Sagan said.
He settled in Boston and heard about Akamai, a venture developed by Tom Leighton, an M.I.T. math professor, and Daniel Lewin, a graduate student. They had spent four years working on algorithms that would unclog the backup at popular Web sites.
He signed on in October 1998. During his year in the job, he had found investors, expanded the staff from 30 to more than 350 and networked (the old-fashioned way) to find clients. "He's great at getting things done, at deciding, 'O.K., let's build an office, let's hire people, let's design a new network,' " Mr. Isaacson said. "Things that most of us think of as difficult, Paul does the way other people throw dinner parties."
Akamai, which has yet to turn a profit, is one of the first companies to offer a cure for the common "hot spot," the shutdown that can result when a site gets a surge of visitors. That fate could have befallen the sites for "The Blair Witch Project" and the Net Aid concert this year, had they not chosen to "Akamaize."
A company confident enough to have its own verb? It seems just what he was looking for.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
In Greenwich, More Is Just Too Much

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY

DATELINE: GREENWICH, CONN.

 BODY:
IT is not clear precisely what made the residents of Crown Lane believe that Steven and Alexandra Cohen had crossed the line. Perhaps it was the backyard ice-skating rink that turns into a basketball court in spring. Or maybe it was the two putting greens with sand traps, connected by a fairway. Then again, it might have been the swimming pool enclosed in a one-and-a-half-story glass-walled room, the crowning ornament on what eventually will be their 32,000-square-foot home.
There's no question that the Cohens are planning a Xanadu on Crown Lane. 
 And why not? They have multiplied and prospered, with six children and one hedge fund that Mr. Cohen, 43, has made fabulously successful. "The economy's been good, the stock market's been good," he said. "We're not building monuments to ourselves. We're building facilities to enjoy with our kids and their friends."
Last year, the Cohens paid $14.8 million for a stately house on 14 acres in what Greenwich calls its back country. Renovations have begun as they plan a new wing for the pool and basketball court (this one indoors) and the massage, exercise and media rooms, as well as formal gardens, a golf course and an ice rink on the rest of the property. There's already a tennis court.
It's a sport utility mansion -- large, pricey, robust. But it became a "there goes the neighborhood" allegory for the 90's.
Neighbors have concrete concerns. The lights from the pool at night. Storm water runoff from the newly landscaped property. And the disruption, including 283 dump truck trips to bring in dirt.
But the deeper reaction seems to be, in a word: yuck! "Do you absolutely need to have your own hockey rink, two-hole golf course and this athletic facility?" said a neighbor, Andrew LeSueur. Or, as Susan Hut told the Planning Board: "I feel that it's not a home. It's a showplace. It could be in the Bronx Botanical Garden."
Greenwich, it should be pointed out, is not a community of Airstream trailers where people sit outside on cinder blocks whiling away the hours by taking aim with their BB guns at upturned Buicks.
Greenwich is Monaco on the Merritt. The Cohens' house is in a neighborhood where the minimum allowable lot is four acres, and in a town where the produce store has valet parking and where there are more cars (64,000) than people (60,000).
This issue of taking excess to excess is a tussle between the haves and the have-mores, between the truly wealthy and the suddenly, fabulously wealthy. It is curious that it is being raised here, and now. After all, aren't the late 1990's supposed to be our spin on the autobahn, a joy ride with no limits? We long ago passed the exit for excess.
But Greenwich projects an air of excessively modest excess. Diane W. Fox, the town planner, said that in a recent survey residents listed the expanding size of homes as their chief concern -- this, in a town of grand manses. "In this town," Ms. Fox said, "the idea of not showing wealth is really the tune. People dress down here. The sloppier the dress, the wealthier."
Restraint may be fading. House trends here resemble those in many wealthy suburbs: bigger homes on smaller lots; big houses demolished to make way for bigger ones; lots that were subdivided in leaner times being reassembled into estates. Now, Ms. Fox said, residents "want people to be aware of what their asset is."
The Crown Lane Affair has, of course, been understated. Letters were written to the Planning Board and some residents spoke at the meeting where the plans were discussed. Then there were the whispers.
One woman was worrying to a reporter that the noise from the Cohens' basketball court would disturb the quiet of her swimming pool when her husband arrived and became aghast at his wife's going public. But the husband need not worry about angering his new neighbors.
"I don't hold a grudge," Mr. Cohen said by telephone from his trading floor in Stamford. "It's just a house."
He doesn't sweat the small stuff. He made his fortune trading rapidly. Some investments rise, others fall. He keeps moving. Excusing himself from the phone for a moment, he could be heard telling a trader, "I'll buy 500 at five and an eighth."

The Our Towns column on Dec. 5 described neighbors' resistance in Greenwich, Conn., to a homeowner's plan to add a new wing, an ice rink and a golf course to a $14.8 million house on a 14-acre lot. The column commented that Greenwich "is not a community of Airstream trailers where people sit outside on cinder blocks whiling away the hours by taking aim with their BB guns at upturned Buicks."
The reference to Airstream, though jocular, was unwarranted. The brand is a luxury recreational trailer often referred to as a land yacht. It should not have been associated with shabby surroundings.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES;
Ivy League or Briar Patch?

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: PRINCETON

 BODY:
When Janice Harayda came to Princeton this summer to be the editor-in-chief of the Princeton Alumni Weekly, there was little she did not effuse about.
"I find Princeton a very romantic place and I want to capture something of the romance as well as the intellectual stimulation," she told a reporter for The Daily Princetonian, the student newspaper. "This is the most exciting job I have ever had. Here there is always something new. I could see being challenged by this job just about forever." 
 But forever lasted only a matter of weeks. Ms. Harayda, the first non-Princeton graduate to head the coveted Alumni Weekly in its 100-year existence, left her job late last month under an Ivy-laden cloud. Whether she was asked to find employment elsewhere or left voluntarily was a bit of messy issue that those close to the affair preferred not to air publicly -- mostly because that was part of an agreement between the former editor and the board that controls the magazine.
And while conflicts at magazines are not unusual, the one at the Princeton Alumni Weekly, affectionately known as "PAW" to Princetonians, leads to at least a little insight about what life may be like in the quiet cauldron that is an Ivy League institution.
"The Alumni Weekly has a long history as an independent publication, back to Jesse Lynch Williams, who was the editor early in this century and was an important literary figure around here," said Edward Tenner, a contributing editor to the Harvard alumni magazine and a researcher in Princeton's geophysics department. Mr. Tenner (Princeton '69) got his writing start as the "On the Campus" writer for PAW when he was an undergraduate, as did such later luminaries as Landon Y. Jones (Princeton '66), who became editor of People magazine, and was one of 12 members of the alumni board who oversaw Ms. Harayda's hiring and hasty departure.
"Alumni magazines are among the few widely circulating journals left that let writers talk about ideas for their own sake," said Mr. Tenner, whose latest book is "Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences" (Alfred A. Knopf, $13). "So they are an underrated part of the nation's intellectual resources."
The board of trustees of Princeton Alumni Publications Inc., which oversees the PAW, chose Ms. Harayda to edit the magazine after the editor for the last 10 years, J. I. Merritt (Princeton '66), decided to take early retirement from the university.
According to news articles that appeared when she was chosen, Ms. Harayda had impressed the board with her ideas to jazz up the design of the magazine and make its content more accessible to younger alumni and women. The 40-ish Ms. Harayda had been an editor and writer at Glamour and Boston magazines and, for 11 years, the book editor at the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Her first novel, "The Accidental Bride," (St. Martin's Press, $23) was published this summer to decent reviews.
But what she was not was a Princeton alumna -- having graduated the non-Ivy University of New Hampshire -- or even someone who had been in the Princeton milieu. (Ms. Harayda's managing editor, who is now the interim editor of the PAW, Lolly OBrien, is also not a Princeton alumna, but she has worked at the magazine since 1987.)
Under the low-keyed Mr. Merritt, the magazine staff, usually from five to seven editors and business staff members, had been stable. But soon after Ms. Harayda rolled up to Nassau Street in July and took over the publication, three staff members left though they have declined, at least publicly, to say why.
Though it has kept its "Weekly" name, the magazine has actually come out only 17 times a year since the 1970's. Still, that is far more frequently than most alumni publications, which even at large universities tend to appear monthly, or sometimes quarterly.
"Certainly the independence of the Weekly is different if not unique," said Mr. Merritt, who is now a freelance writer living in Princeton. "That has given it a certain tone. It's not a house organ. It's independent without being confrontational, not The Washington Post covering the White House, more like a small-town paper covering its town, where everyone knows everyone else. I think you sense that reading letters to the editor in particular. They publish letters attacking the university administration, and then long sentimental notes as well."
Ms. Harayda's four issues seemed to focus on celebrities, with stories concentrating on the consumer advocate Ralph Nader (Princeton '55), Bill Bradley, the former senator New Jersey and current Democratic presidential aspirant (Princeton '65) and the new editor of Harper's Bazaar, Katherine Betts (Princeton '86).
There had been no public indication that anything was wrong at the PAW until Peter G. Brown (Princeton '70), chairman of the alumni publications board and editor-in-chief of "The Sciences," the popular magazine of the New York Academy of Sciences, issued a statement two weeks ago that read in part, "Janice Harayda is no longer serving as editor of the Princeton Alumni Weekly because of differences between her and the board regarding the management of the magazine."
Mr. Brown added, "A search for a new editor has already begun."
Since then, Ms. Harayda, who still lives in the Princeton area, has not answered telephone calls, and Mr. Brown said by telephone that neither he nor anyone on the board or at the magazine could comment further.
Little in the magazine's latest issue of Nov. 17 indicates any hubbub -- not unusual in the Ivy way, as muted as a heather crew neck. It has the profile of Ms. Betts, as well as a lamentation over the young rawness of the Princeton basketball team, a discussion about whether the university should drop the grade A-plus and a commentary on how corruption in Russia has affected Princeton visitors there.
"The Weekly is a bit of a different animal than you would find at other colleges,' said Justin Harmon (Princeton '78), a Princeton spokesman, who also declined to speak about the change in editors. "It is an article of faith that Princeton alums want to read it and want it to appear frequently. It's the type of community that likes to keep in touch."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 5 about the departure of the editor of The Princeton Alumni Weekly, Janice Harayda, referred erroneously to her availability for comment. The reporter was unable to obtain Ms. Harayda's phone number through the university, the publication's office or directory assistance; Ms. Harayda did not receive messages or decline to respond.
The article also misstated the number of staff members who left after Ms. Harayda's arrival; it was two, not three.
The article also misstated the number of assignments by the new editor. Two articles that appeared during her tenure, on Ralph Nader and Bill Bradley, had been assigned by her predecessor.

HEADLINE: Affordable Housing For the Homeless

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Joyce Purnick's Dec. 2 Metro Matters column shows how difficult it can be to get a segment of the homeless population to accept services. Yet we should not lose sight of the fact that thousands of people do use the services of outreach teams, drop-in centers and shelters throughout New York City each year and that many do move on to permanent housing. 
 The gains made are only as modest as the resources provided.
For every person housed, there is someone being released from prison or a hospital or being evicted from housing who has no place to live. The real debate is why we aren't creating sufficient affordable housing and stable communities so that families, the unemployed and the mentally ill do not have to reach the streets to get the housing and help they need.

HEADLINE: Soccer Moms vs. Standardized Tests

BYLINE: By Charles J. Sykes; Charles J. Sykes is the author of "Dumbing Down Our Kids."

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
After decades of endless gold stars, happy faces and inflated grades, American parents apparently were not ready for a reality check about how much our schools are really teaching our children.
Across the country, new, higher academic standards that states adopted in a spirit of educational reform are being dumbed down, and supposedly rigorous graduation tests are being diluted or dropped, as evidence mounts that too many students will fall short of the higher expectations. 
 It is not surprising that more rigorous state standards have come under fire from the usual opposition coalition of civil rights groups, progressive educators and teacher unions. What is striking though, is the opposition from soccer moms.
In Wisconsin, where legislators backed off plans to require a high school graduation test, most of the opposition to the exam came not from troubled urban schools, but from affluent suburbs. A group calling itself Advocates for Education and based in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, insisted, "High-stakes testing will be detrimental to education and unfair to children." Suburban critics in many parts of the state fretted about the pressure that tests would place on children. After suburban parents lobbied parent-teacher organizations, the State Legislature voted to scrap the graduation test before a single student had taken it.
In New York and Massachusetts, officials yielded to pressure to set absurdly low passing grades for their new tests, while in Virginia and Arizona, state boards of education are already backing away from tests that proved to be too tough for even the so-called better schools. In Virginia, only 7 percent of schools met new achievement standards, and in Arizona, 9 out of 10 sophomores failed a new math test.
For much of this century, the educational establishment has behaved as if it were addicted to bad ideas, indulging its own wishful and romantic thinking even in the face of mounting evidence of failure. The new tests were supposed to counteract the trendy experimentation, watered-down curriculums and questionable teaching methods by introducing both accountability and consequences for failure.
But for decades, the schools had been allowed to obscure the fact that many children were not mastering basic subjects. The constant positive reinforcement of unrealistic grading and easy tests was meant not only for the children, whose self-esteem remained strong in the face of shaky math and reading abilities, but for their parents, as well.
For many of these parents, the new tests were a very rude shock. Accustomed to thinking of educational difficulties as somebody else's problem, they and their school districts suddenly faced the possibility of failure.
As reformers have belatedly discovered, they badly underestimated the extent to which parents as well as teachers and bureaucrats had a vested interest in believing that whatever else might be wrong with American education, their own children were above average. Support for high standards came with an unspoken caveat: they were quite all right when they were applied to someone else's school and someone else's child.
So instead of sounding an alarm about the need to change the way we teach our children, one state after another is fudging the test. And a remarkable number of parents have gone along with the move to ratchet down the standards, expectations and consequences.
Reforming the schools sounded like a good idea until it hit home.

HEADLINE: Vienna Memo;
A Rightist Leader Stirs Tepid Dissent, and Assent

BYLINE: By ALISON SMALE 

DATELINE: VIENNA

 BODY:
The scene was a classic late-autumn afternoon in one of Europe's most unchanging capitals -- women wearing hats at round marble tables, aging men in green loden coats bidding each other stiff hellos, a waitress of iron formality serving coffee and cakes.
But even the undying rituals of a once-imperial city could not mask the unease rippling through Vienna about the seemingly unstoppable rise of Jorg Haider, the right-wing populist who captured the No. 2 spot in October's national election. 
 His showing has paralyzed national politics while the two parties that have dominated Austria since World War II try to figure out their future, and it has galvanized what Mr. Haider's opponents view as worryingly weak resistance.
"This is one of the most unpolitical countries in Europe," railed Harald Posch, a theater director. Mr. Haider is popular, he said, "because he has the only party which really still operates with faith, with a belief -- the others have lost their identity because they are just running things, managing affairs."
"Haider opens his mouth and says, 'No,' and to unpolitical people it feels good, as if finally somebody is against all this," he said.
"All this" is code for the cozy decades in which the two dominant parties simply divided the spoils of power in a system that parceled out control of everything from schools to banks along party lines.
It is a system that helped heal the deep political wounds of prewar politics that had facilitated the rise of Hitler. But it is a system that is increasingly unsustainable under the pressures of a modern economy.
Austrians may blame globalization in the abstract; in life, they often take out their frustration on the hundreds of thousands of foreigners living among them who were allowed entry during past decades to do the menial jobs few Austrians want.
Mr. Haider's party did well in Vienna with a simple slogan, "Stop the Uberfremdung," an appeal against "overforeignization" that, to a German speaker, carries connotations of Goebbels, as indeed do other aspects of Mr. Haider's speeches. Mr. Haider now disowns the slogan and says it was dreamed up by the Vienna branch of his Freedom Party.
Foreign furor over Mr. Haider's ascent has often focused on his statements in praise of Nazi labor policies and the steadfastness of former members of the Waffen SS. Since the election, Mr. Haider has set out to dispel suggestions of neo-Nazism, embarking on a kind of good-will tour to various Western European countries and to the United States, where he competed in the New York City marathon and told Austrian journalists about reconciliatory meetings with American Jewish groups.
In November, he summoned his Vienna faithful to the old imperial palace, the Hofburg, to deliver what he framed as an apology to anybody he might have unintentionally offended by his remarks. He has, he insisted, "not even a trace of sympathy for racist and totalitarian goals," and he pledged, using the local color-code shorthand for Nazism: "I will unequivocally explain my relationship to the dark past. And I won't tolerate any brown shadows."
On the same day, the speaker of Austria's Parliament, Heinz Fischer, promised that the legislature would pass a resolution against xenophobia. That evening, some 25,000 people rallied in Vienna against racism.
The rally drew Mr. Haider's scorn and sharply divided even his opponents over its size and its aims.
Doron Rabinovici, a writer and a rally organizer, pledged at the gathering that anti-Haider forces would not wait next time until after an election to come out against racism. He demanded a law against discrimination because "no one can be certain of their future in Austria so long as someone is exposed to persecution because of their origins." The rally was "the beginning of a political movement against people who whip up fear, the first of many manifestations of courage," he said.
At the Hofburg gathering, Mr. Haider inveighed against what he called frustrated left-wingers; an "organized witchhunt from abroad," and "this leftist, pseudo-intellectual nonsense about hating foreigners." To those who marched under the banner "Haider -- shame for Austria," his retort was, "It is certainly not a shame to feel responsible above all for one's own people."
Such language worries some Viennese. Ariel Muzicant, the leader of the small Jewish community that has re-formed since World War II, has said that anti-Semitic attacks are on the rise.
Neither the Social Democrats nor the conservative People's Party, which have governed together since 1986 and have dominated Austria since 1945, seem to have a clear idea how to counter Mr. Haider, or how to break the political stalemate.
Neither party seems keen to renew its political marriage with the other, yet neither can envision a minority government. And despite the conservatives' flirtation with the idea of governing with Mr. Haider, neither seems to want him close to power.
Peter Marboe, the People's Party politician in charge of the subsidies Vienna lavishes on its culture -- a favorite target of Mr. Haider's devotees -- noted that Austria is not alone in Europe in facing the problem of integrating immigrants. In America, he noted, immigrants were often much further away from their homelands, and came to a society founded by immigrants. Europe, by contrast, has yet to integrate.
Since Austria's former multiethnic empire disintegrated in World War I, Austrians have largely seemed to feel more at ease unter sich, among themselves, an attitude at odds both with their cold war generosity to waves of refugees from Communist Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland and now with the country's membership, since 1996, in the European Union, and tentative moves, first given voice almost a decade ago by Mr. Haider, toward NATO.
The lingering suspicion of foreigners is tangible. A French reporter, fluent in German but with a French accent, was recently looking for an apartment. Answering numerous newspaper ads by telephone, she was frequently told "it's already taken" before she could even ask a question.
Finally finding a friendly woman with an available apartment, the reporter hurried to see it. She was met by a Viennese man who asked what she did. Upon hearing that she was a foreign journalist, he said: "Ah, so you are the people who are writing the wrong things about Haider."

HEADLINE: Bangkok Opens Skytrain, but Will It Ease Car Traffic?

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Dec. 5

 BODY:
It's clean, it's fast, it's punctual and it offers a breathtaking view of some of the world's most spectacular traffic jams.
It is the long-delayed Skytrain, a 16-mile, $1.7 billion elevated rail system that opened for business today, snaking swiftly above a city -- like so many others in Asia -- that is strangling on its own traffic. 
 Called "the train that floats in the air" in Thai, it is just a small start in the city's 180-mile mass transit master plan. Nobody knows yet how many people will abandon their cars to ride it.
But the privately financed rail system is Bangkok's most ambitious attempt so far to confront the near-gridlock that is sometimes described as its defining landmark -- its Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building.
The English-language newspaper The Nation welcomed the Skytrain in glowing terms today, but glancing down at the traffic in this city of 10 million, it added, "The horror resides below."
It is not only the traffic that moves slowly here. The Skytrain was first proposed in 1970, and construction began five years ago. If additional lines, a new subway and a separate elevated road-and-rail route are also completed, planners say, traffic could start moving freely again sometime deep into the next century.
But even Skytrain's developers sound a note of caution.
"If it leaves a vacuum on the road, then someone jumps in a car and fills it," Howard Brooke, senior vice president at the Bangkok Mass Transit System, said two years ago.
That is a hard fact of life throughout the cities of Asia, as it is in other nations. Traffic jams have become one of the most debilitating and intractable side effects of urbanization and economic growth. "Most of the mega-cities in Asia are approaching gridlock for increasing portions of the day, with no real prospects of relief in sight," said Michael P. Walsh, an automotive traffic consultant based in Arlington, Va.
A recent improvement in the situation only underscores the problem. When Southeast Asia's economies crashed in 1997, city streets became less clogged as commuters lost their jobs, truck traffic shrank and banks repossessed whole fleets of cars.
Now, with tentative signs of recovery here in Thailand, the flow of traffic is expected to thicken again.
As in many other countries, a personal car is seen by a newly emerging middle class as something of a human right. When officials tried to restrict new car ownership here three years ago, the public outcry forced them to back off. "This infringes on the rights and freedom of the individual," Laddawan Nuamchapoh, 26, an office worker, told a local newspaper.
In cities like Manila, Jakarta, Shanghai and Bombay, car ownership is one of the first signs of emerging prosperity. Even in the economically laggard capitals of Hanoi, Phnom Penh and Yangon -- in Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar, the former Burma -- embryonic traffic jams hint at future gridlock.
The toll is heavy on these cities' quality of life, on health and on economic efficiency.
In Bangkok, urban planners estimate that the average resident spends the equivalent of 44 days a year in traffic jams, that 20 percent of fuel is consumed by vehicles that are standing still and that $2 billion to $3 billion a year is drained from the economy in lost hours at work.
Children often rise long before dawn for their slow commute to school, and teachers complain that the youngsters are sleepy when they get there. They are often sick as well with respiratory ailments that people here attribute to air pollution.
The traffic also seems to be frightening off foreign visitors. The Tourism Authority of Thailand recently reported that the average stay in Bangkok had been cut in half, to just one or two days.
"Many people now say that they go out only when it is really necessary, almost making them prisoners in their own immediate neighborhoods if not their own homes," said a Hong Kong-based consulting firm, Asian Market Intelligence, reporting on a survey earlier this year.
Residents of Bangkok have the region's longest average round trip to work, it found, at 82 minutes.
Their best solution, it said, is to make each car "a comfortable little home on wheels." Indeed, it is common for commuters to set up elaborate offices in their cars and to create family time by commuting together. To deal with emergencies, hospitals have prepared motorcycle ambulances to weave through traffic, taxi drivers and police officers have been given courses in midwifery and gas stations advertise colorful portable plastic urinals.
Throughout it all, Thais seem to remain remarkably cool in traffic, sitting and staring ahead for long, empty minutes. There is little road rage; people rarely honk their horns.
"I think that there is no point to shouting or pushing on your horn," said Adhiti Pinyowattayakorn, who works in a jewelry shop, "because even if you do, you are still sitting in traffic."
Bangkok, once a city of canals, has been fighting traffic jams almost since it built its first road in 1860. In the last 30 years, it has paved over most of its waterways. New toll roads and overpasses have saved the city from absolute paralysis.
Still, with about three million vehicles on the road every day, and with roads covering only 8.5 percent of its area -- compared with about 20 percent in some Western cities -- officials here estimate that the average speed of traffic at peak times is only nine miles an hour. On key arteries, for hours at a time, cars move more slowly than the pedestrians who walk past them.
So the next steps are only logical: up into the sky and, perhaps in another three years or so, down underground with the city's first subway line.
Today, on its inaugural day, the Skytrain was clogged with passengers. But when the workweek resumes, Bangkok will begin to face the crucial question: will people ever give up their cars for the train?
"If passengers cannot reach their destination faster and have to pay higher fares, then they will soon turn away from it," said Thirachon Manomaiphibul, deputy governor of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration.
For now, the Skytrain runs along just one forked line -- with 24 three-story-high stations -- without connections to other transport and without its own parking lots.
"So what should I do?" said Apichart Pholomai, a secretary who says she will continue to drive to work. "I'll have to take a taxi to the Sathorn station, then ride to Asoke station, then take another taxi to my office. That's the problem for a lot of people."
Another question involves the price of a ride. The fare has been set considerably higher than the most expensive bus ride, which is 12 baht, or about 35 cents. The Skytrain will cost from 15 baht to 40 baht, depending on the length of the ride.
This suggests not only that the Skytrain has huge cost overruns to address, but also that it is aiming directly at people with cars rather than trying to tempt less affluent travelers to switch from buses.
"Because of the high price, it just might work," said a young government official. "You'll get a different class of people, and class is what it's all about. If you take a bus you're like everybody else, you're just part of the masses. But if the Skytrain is too expensive for the masses, well, let's see."

HEADLINE: Number of Foster Children in City At Lowest Level Since the 1980's

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
Following steady and sometimes sharp declines over the last several years, the number of children in foster care in New York City has fallen below what it was a decade ago, when the worst of the crack epidemic helped send the foster care population soaring.
The city's foster care population has declined by nearly 30 percent since 1991, from a record high of 49,100 to 35,200 this fall, according to the Administration for Children's Services. The reductions have helped ease the strain on a system swollen not only by the children whose families were torn apart by crack, but also by changes in local policy on child welfare. 
 City officials, while acknowledging that foster care populations can be influenced by a wide range of forces, say the recent, striking reductions have largely been driven by three factors: youngsters who flooded the system in the late 1980's and early 1990's are turning 18 and leaving the rolls; adoptions have increased by nearly two-thirds over the last six years, and children are not remaining in the foster care system as long.
The city officials say it is impossible to predict whether the decline will continue. But contrary to widespread fear, they have not yet seen the foster care population grow significantly in the aftermath of welfare reform. They and others are quick to say it is extremely hard to quantify how many children are entering the system for what specific reasons, and equally difficult to say how welfare reform or other policy shifts are going to play out over many years -- for instance, the mayor's latest threat, to take custody of the children of homeless parents who refuse to work for their shelter.
Child welfare experts, as well as advocates who monitor the city's foster care system, say the decline in the total population is to be expected after the aberrant spikes starting around 1987, when the crack crisis began to drive many thousands of children from their homes.
They note, too, that the official count of children in foster care was inflated a decade ago in part because of a change in city policy to include children who were informally cared for by relatives as a part of the official foster care system.
And while the advocates applaud the latest declines, they insist it is too early to tell whether they signal long-term improvements in the system.
In truth, making sense of trends in foster care is confounding even to veteran students of the subject. As with the ups and downs of crime rates, it is difficult to discern exactly who or what deserves credit for the ebb and flow of the foster care population and how much of it can be attributed to demographic vagaries.
For their part, city officials, who are eager to publicize the latest drops, acknowledge that the system is shrinking in part because some youngsters are "aging out." But they also attribute the declines to a bigger budget and a more efficient agency.
The Administration for Children's Services budget has peaked to over $2 billion a year under Nicholas Scoppetta, who became commissioner in 1996 after the widely publicized beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo. More staff members have been hired, and the average caseload for a child protective worker has been cut by half in the last three years, Mr. Scoppetta said. Moreover, he noted in an interview last week, a record 11,000 children have been adopted in the last three years alone.
"That is a really dramatic drop in numbers," Mr. Scoppetta said of the decline. "The record-setting number of adoptions is one thing we can point to."
Much of New York City's decline came at a time when the foster care population nationwide was climbing -- to 546,000 in 1999 from 406,000 in 1990.
But the city's experience, said an agency spokesman, Michael Kharfen, may represent a harbinger of national trends. In the last year, he said, there has been "a slight decline" in the number of children coming into foster care nationwide. The drop has been starkest in New York and Illinois, which, after California, have the largest numbers of foster children. Adoptions are on the rise nationally, as well.
Those who monitor the city's foster care system are reluctant to draw sweeping conclusions about the latest trends. Still, even some of the system's most ardent critics, like Marcia Robinson Lowry, a lawyer who has sued the city on behalf of foster children for more than two decades, say there are grounds for "cautious optimism."
"There's no question that there's been more attention paid to the system in the last few years," said Ms. Lowry, executive director of Children's Rights, a national advocacy group. But she added, "I think it's too soon to judge what really is going on."
The one thing that is known now, said Fred Wulczyn, a research fellow with the Chapin Hall Center for Families at the University of Chicago, is that the foster care system has roughly reached the balance that it had before crack cocaine helped fuel its explosive growth.
"The system was stretched," said Mr. Wulczyn, who studies New York City's foster care system. "It's finally getting back to its stride on the admissions and discharges side."
That shift comes at a crucial time for city officials. Under a recent settlement of a federal class-action lawsuit, the child welfare agency is under scrutiny by an outside panel of experts. Early next year, that panel is expected to release its evaluation of how well the agency has overhauled its long-troubled foster care system.
Moreover, like other cities, New York is under considerable pressure to speed up adoptions. The Federal Adoption and Safe Families Act, which went into effect this year, requires the city to seek adoptions for all children who have spent 15 of the most recent 22 months in foster care. (The children adopted last year in the city had been in foster care for an average of 6.8 years.)
The foster care population has undergone dramatic shifts in the last two decades. The numbers had been declining steadily through the early 1980's, reaching a low of around 16,200 in 1984. Child welfare officials began to notice children of crack-addicted parents as early as 1985, when the numbers began to nudge upward. "It really hit high gear in 1987," Mr. Wulczyn said, pointing to the influx of newborns that came into the system starting that year.
The numbers spiked sharply in 1988 and 1989; the population grew by 10,000 children each of those years. It reached a peak of 49,100 in 1991.
At the same time, a wave of children who were being cared for by relatives officially came into the system under a change in the law. In the last couple of years, many of those children have turned 18 and ventured out on their own. In general, more children are leaving the system now than in years past: 12,700 were discharged in fiscal year 1999, compared with 11,600 in 1994.
Moreover, a larger share of children leaving the system is being adopted rather than returned home. Last year, around 30 percent of the youngsters leaving foster care were adopted, while 52 percent were returned to their birth parents or relatives. By comparison, in 1994, 21 percent of the children who left the system were adopted and 60 percent returned to birth parents or relatives.
Adoptions climbed steadily in the mid-1990's. In fiscal year 1997, a record 4,009 children were adopted, compared with 2,300 in 1994. Over the last two years, adoptions have hovered around 3,800.
When Mr. Scoppetta took over a reorganized child welfare agency in 1996 under the shadow of Elisa Izquierdo's death, many feared that the city would indiscriminately pull children from their homes to avoid similar tragic embarrassments. Indeed, the first few years of Mr. Scoppetta's tenure were characterized by aggressive enforcement. The number of children who came into foster care soared. It went from around 8,000 children in fiscal year 1995 to 10,000 in 1996 -- his first year in office -- to 12,000 in 1998.
But in the last year, the number fell significantly. Admissions to the system dropped to 10,200 at the end of fiscal year 1999.
Finally, part of the decline in the overall foster care population seems also to be driven by shorter stays in the system. The median length of stay for youngsters who came into foster care in 1995 -- the most recent year for which the agency has available figures -- was 1.76 years, down from 2.82 years for children who came into the system in 1990.
If unpredictable outside forces like crack addiction fueled the anomalous growth of a decade ago, it is all but impossible to divine what the next decade holds. Already, dire predictions have been made about how the new federally mandated time limits on welfare benefits will flood the foster care system. That does not seem to have happened yet. Then again, it is not yet possible to measure the full impact of welfare reform -- particularly because today's robust economy can cushion the blow.
"It's still too early to tell whether welfare reform will increase or decrease the number of kids in care," said David Tobis, director of the Center for the Study of Family Policy at Hunter College. "The big factor is what happens to the economy."
Moreover, no one is either pleased or satisfied that, despite the recent reductions, more than 35,000 children remain in foster care because of worries about their well-being. It is, everyone agrees, an enormous and unhealthy number.

The Clinton Round

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE; Bob Herbert is on vacation.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the opening minute in the global trade arena he wanted to call "the Clinton Round," President Clinton took a huge swing and kayoed himself.
But cheer up: even as he permitted U.S. policy to be determined by organized anarchists joined by organized labor in the street battle of Seattle, the U.S. president ultimately scored a kind of negative victory. 
 Flat on his back, dumped on by dumping nations and object of catcalls of the undeveloped world, a frustrated Clinton did not abandon our interests. In aligning himself with street people and bowing to A.F.L.-C.I.O. pressure, Clinton became a trade realist: he allowed the talks to collapse and made Seattle his Reykjavik.
A trade realist is a multilateralist who has been mugged by the underdeveloped world and had his pockets picked by subsidized European farmers. That's Clinton after the World Trade Organization fiasco in Seattle. His "legacy" is his willingness to take the embarrassing count without giving up our most cherished principles.
Forget the outdated rhetoric about "free trade vs. protectionism" or "rules vs. walls" or "globalization vs. nationalism." That simplistic spin belongs to previous eras.
Here's today's debate: Do information-age democracies use their economic muscle to bring others up to their standards of human rights? Or do the world's poor nations, allied with dictatorial giants, regional cartels and multinationals, use their political majorities in international organizations to vitiate our leverage of trade?
The W.T.O. is a kind of U.N. General Assembly, with the U.S. having only one voice in the cacophony. Our power to encourage democratic capitalism worldwide is now constrained by our statist competitors. That was Clinton's doing five years ago as part of his obeisance to multilateralism.
But a strange bedfellowship is denying the Lilliputians the bonds to tie down Gulliver. As is disdainfully pointed out, this includes protectionist labor leaders; Naderite consumer gadflies; environmentalists ranging from reasonable greens to anti-worker ecological nuts, and a lunatic fringe of anarchists and hatemongers.
A few other groups, however, give more meaning to this odd amalgam. Human rights advocates who believe that American markets should not support the product of slave labor or child labor are being heard. And so are people who feel threatened by the growing power of global cartels that thrive on the antidemocratic secrecy of the W.T.O. -- while these merchandising monoliths invade the privacy of individuals everywhere.
Using e-mail and the Internet, this "strangebedfellows.com" has globalized the resistance to mindless globalization. In Seattle, it organized effectively to stop the handover of America's power to demand human rights and labor standards from nations dependent on our rich market.
In the midst of the melee last week, President Clinton made what his panicked aides told reporters was a terrible blunder: he dared suggest that the W.T.O. should someday apply sanctions to economies that abuse child labor. This roused the ire of third-world exploiters and contributed to the breakdown of the talks.
Mr. Clinton's staff, lusting after an agreement, was wrong to badmouth its boss. That was Clinton's finest hour. I don't care if he was polishing the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s apple to help Al Gore, or was pushed by women's groups, or felt he had to strain to empathize with the militants in the streets. Whatever his motive, our president blurted out a hint worthy of an elected American president and civilized human being -- and not a faceless multilateral bureaucrat.
I am not a global warmnik, union agitator, or stocking-masked anarchist; indeed, laissez-fairies have always been dancing in my garden. But by jingo, I believe the United States should be a light unto nations by virtue of our example of enlightened free enterprise. That means not lowering our health and labor standards to let investors everywhere make a buck, but applying those standards to others who want to make a buck with us.
International trade that does not use its leverage to encourage personal freedom does not deserve the name of "free trade." We accept the burden of importing many of the world's problems; our trading partners should note that America's most rewarding export is individual liberty.

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Forbes Works to Win the Skeptics

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H., Dec. 4

 BODY:
Listening to Steve Forbes at a pancake breakfast here this morning, Richard Card heard a lot that he liked, including Mr. Forbes's proposal for a single-rate flat tax and his straight talk on issues like China and health care.
But there was one nagging problem. "I'm concerned about how he can accomplish it," said Mr. Card, a 68-year-old retired cabinet maker. "He's never had to interact with Congress to solve a problem. You can have all the lofty goals in the world, but what good are they if you can't carry them out?" 
 For Mr. Forbes, convincing undecided Republicans that he can translate his experience as a wealthy publisher into the skills of governance may be the stiffest test he faces in igniting a stagnant campaign and closing the gap with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona, his two main rivals for his party's presidential nomination, before New Hampshire holds the nation's first primary on Feb. 1.
Mr. Forbes is trying to gain traction from a combative performance in last Thursday's debate among the six Republican candidates and from a new advertising campaign that criticizes Mr. Bush for considering raising the age of eligibility for Social Security benefits.
Winning the endorsement of The Union Leader of Manchester, the state's largest newspaper and leading conservative voice, has also bolstered Mr. Forbes's claim that he is the main conservative alternative in the primary, running against the Washington establishment.
"It's not a novice that's here," Mr. Forbes told Mr. Card after finishing his 25-minute stump speech. He went on to tick off his business and civic experience, as well as his stint overseeing Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty under President Ronald Reagan. "I'm an outsider. I think you can take the plunge."
In a meandering bus tour this weekend across southern New Hampshire, Mr. Forbes carried his outsider's message to 75 people at a town meeting in Milford and 100 people at this morning's breakfast. The crowds were enthusiastic but small in comparison to the 1,500 Mr. McCain drew at a similar event on Friday. The audiences were a mix of curious fence-sitters and committed Forbes supporters who had been part of his failed 1996 campaign.
If nothing else, the Forbes campaign is hard to miss when its two chartered buses, Victory Express 1 and 2, roll into quaint New England villages, blaring Sousa marches when they arrive and Willie Nelson's "On the Road Again" when they leave. On the stump, Mr. Forbes condemns "the huge disconnect between the political culture of Washington and the nation," pledges to restore integrity to the Justice Department and lambastes Vice President Al Gore, the administration's point man on Russia, for allowing "the good name of the United States to become associated with gangster elements in the Kremlin."
Mr. Forbes draws his themes from the Declaration of Independence and its promise of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." He opposes abortion. He favors patients' freedom to choose their own doctors and to have individual medical savings accounts. He supports diverting most of the Social Security payroll tax into private investment accounts for younger working Americans. He takes occasional jabs at the Clinton administration in his speeches, but largely avoids mention of Mr. Bush.
But he is only warming up for the main act: his frontal assault on the country's tax system. In addition to proposing a 17 percent flat tax, Mr. Forbes wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and scrap the tax code. Indeed, heads shook in astonishment this weekend when he noted that the Gettysburg Address has fewer than 300 words and the Bible has 783,000 words, but the tax code has more than 7.5 million.
"Other politicians say they'll hold the line on taxes," Mr. Forbes said. "But that's political talk for 'We won't raise taxes until we need more money.' "
This is rhetorical red meat for many conservatives in the crowd who dispute public opinion polls showing less interest in tax cuts in today's booming economy.
But Forbes supporters say their candidate has broadened his ideas beyond his signature issue. "He has a message that has matured," said Richard Ptak, an information technology consultant in Amherst, N.H. "Four years ago, he had a hard time presenting where he wanted to go. Now he's putting substance behind the words."
The Forbes organization here, which was skeletal in 1996, has also grown modestly. Fifteen full-time staff aides marshal a grass-roots network of volunteers from state headquarters in Manchester.
Nonetheless, there are glitches. On Friday, the campaign changed locations for a meet-and-greet event in Amherst with Mr. Forbes, but forgot to tell anyone at the original stop, the Village Green Market, where two dozen supporters and several reporters were waiting.
After frantic phone calls from a top aide, the Forbes entourage arrived at the store, an hour late. Bounding off the bus, Mr. Forbes shook hands, picked up some plain doughnuts and a copy of The Union Leader trumpeting his endorsement, and shoved a $5 bill in a charity box.
"I believe he can win, and I believe he stands for the silent majority," said Jackie Beckmann, a Republican state committeewoman from Massachusetts who drove 95 miles from New Bedford with her husband, Bob, to meet Mr. Forbes at the market.
Narrowing the race, let alone winning it here, may hinge on massaging Mr. Forbes's image more than his message. Even The Union Leader's endorsement acknowledged that he was not charismatic and might look like a "geek" to some people.
Mr. Forbes is less awkward-looking in smaller groups than he is in televised debates and interviews. And when he shed his dark suit, starched white shirt and yellow tie on Saturday morning for chinos, an olive-green checked shirt and docksiders, he almost looked like a regular guy rather than someone worth $440 million.
"He came across as strained on TV with those facial expressions," said Robert Chamberlain, a 70-year-old retired Air Force colonel who came here this morning to help decide between Mr. Forbes and Mr. McCain. "Now that I've seen him, I understand that those facial expressions are just him. I was impressed by his ability to answer questions in depth. I think he can handle the job."

HEADLINE: The Collapse in Seattle

 BODY:
Many trade experts warned that a new round of global trade talks was premature. The world, they said, needed more time to absorb the trade-opening measures that were adopted five years ago. A week of protests at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and, more important, the embarrassing refusal of the W.T.O. to endorse President Clinton's trade-liberalization program proved that the warnings were prescient. But the failed talks augur no general calamity.
Trade will continue to be governed by rules that have served the trading community well for over 50 years. Globalization proved an easy target for an alliance of convenience between well-intentioned and more malicious protesters, yet the need for it to continue as the main vehicle of international economic progress still stands. 
 But to say that the march toward open trade will continue does not argue for minimizing the damage of last week's events. The failure in Seattle will keep needless barriers in place at least a few years longer. Also lost was the chance to make reforms that would have addressed critics, prevented future backlashes like the "battle in Seattle" and built confidence in the W.T.O.
Perhaps the most important of the three main reforms pushed by Mr. Clinton was a call to have the W.T.O. open up its judicial panels to public scrutiny and, where feasible, to wider participation. The organization's secretive ways breed distrust and conspiracy fears among governments and advocacy groups.
On the important issue of labor rights, President Clinton pushed the W.T.O. to create a discussion group to look at sweatshop conditions and child labor. But he encouraged a two-edged revolt when he told an interviewer he envisioned eventual sanctions on countries that violate basic rights. On the policy level, his candor left ministers from third-world countries fearing that the proposal would be used to prevent them from exporting their way out of poverty. On a grittier level, they suspected that the American president, who must lead on a global basis, was catering to American unions and the domestic election needs of his vice president. The goal of fair work conditions, however, need not die. The administration can urge other groups, like the International Labor Organization, to pursue the issue with or without the W.T.O.'s participation.
Nor need the collapse of trade talks halt progress on environmental issues. The W.T.O.'s charter embraces, in theory, the need to protect the environment. The Seattle protesters gave notice to the organization to strike a more sensitive balance between trade and environment in its rule-making.
It is unclear, to say the least, if Mr. Clinton has time to reclaim a leadership role on trade. Yet the underdeveloped nations that refused to endorse his recommendations in a final communique will lose the most from closed agricultural markets, anti-dumping laws and prohibitive pharmaceutical prices -- all problems that can only be addressed in talks like the round blocked in Seattle.
The World Trade Organization is not the Hydra-headed monster portrayed by its severest critics. But after Seattle, it is all the more important for this administration or its successor to help enhance the W.T.O.'s legitimacy through reforms on secrecy, labor rights and the environment. That is what the demonstrators demanded. That is what people around the globe deserve.

HEADLINE: After Riots, Seattle Is Chagrined Yet Cheerful

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 5

 BODY:
At the beginning of the week that was to showcase Seattle to the world as a friend to free trade and free expression alike, the city's Public Development Authority promised yet more good news for local merchants.
"PDA + WTO = Business as Usual -- Maybe Better!" proclaimed a bright yellow flier distributed to businesses as the World Trade Organization got under way here, adding: "Thousands of potential customers with time on their hands and money in their pockets will descend upon the Downtown area." 
 Ted Coffman, a butcher in the Pike Place Market, tore his flier down this weekend and threw it across the counter in a surprisingly cheerful burst of disgust. "One good thing I'll say for the week is, it certainly was exciting," Mr. Coffman said.
"As for business, that was down by 80 percent," he said. "Tuesday, we closed down with all the protests. Wednesday, the market got gassed, so we closed again. Thursday, some cops came running in and said, 'You better close, now!' One said it was something to do with President Clinton, another said it was more protesters. I still don't know what it was. I just want things to get back to normal."
The trade talks here may have ended, with negotiations in collapse and many Seattleites still astonished by the irony of riots and tear gas in a place where pedestrians normally exhibit scrupulous respect for the jaywalking laws. But for Seattle, the self-scrutiny is just beginning, as the city seeks to determine how what had been billed as a respectful "Seattle-style conversation" on trade issues turned into a civic fiasco.
The City Council has scheduled a public hearing on Wednesday, and is starting an investigation into why the police seemed unprepared to respond properly to either the thousands of protesters who gathered peacefully or the small number who went on a rampage.
Characteristically, though, in a city that has something of a sense of humor about itself, many people were looking on the bright side. As downtown streets were reclaimed this weekend by Christmas shoppers, lured by extras like free parking and free Starbucks coffee, many Seattle residents took pains to note one bottom-line fact: at least nobody got killed.
Others said there was no reason to fret over whether the city's golden image had been tarnished. "I mean, everybody's already freaked out that there are too many people moving here," said Chip Thom, a 29-year-old mechanic who was doing a brisk business selling "I survived WTO protest" T-shirts to the holiday crowd. "So this might encourage them to stay away. In that sense, it could be a good thing."
Still others said that in time, as the televised images of helmet-clad police, clouds of tear gas and boarded-up stores faded, the word Seattle might become synonymous, in a good way, with the moment when world engaged in a serious debate over the meaning of globalization and its effects on ordinary people.
"I wouldn't say it began here, but it will definitely be seen as the place where the conversation got serious," said Charlie Sheldon, a port worker who -- sheer coincidence, he said -- just completed a novel called "The Boomerang Heist," in which a hijacked ship sails into town just as a trade conference attended by the president and 17 other heads of state gets under way in the year 2000.
It is highly unlikely now that any such world conference will take place in Seattle anytime soon.
"It'll be a long time before we invite another big convention to the city while I'm mayor," the city's top elected official, Paul Schell, told a radio show over the weekend. Mr. Schell has borne the brunt of criticism from both merchants angry over the vandalism and citizens enraged over police actions. And he has wasted little time in beginning the process of restoring good will to the city and, of course, toward himself.
"Let's heal the city," Mr. Schell, who is up for re-election in 2001, said on Saturday as he reopened a holiday carousel for children that had been sealed off by yellow crime-scene police tape earlier in the week. "I understand everybody's angry and offended. I feel offended myself by the things that happened here."
Many people voiced regret that delegates, journalists and even the demonstrators from around the world had not exactly experienced the city at its best.
"I do feel bad that everybody who came here couldn't get to see what Seattle is really like," Mary Mermod, a retired Veterans Affairs worker from west Seattle, said as she sat outside a Seattle's Best Coffee kiosk. "The shops, the restaurants, the waterfront, the ferry rides, the museums," she said. "It sounds like a lot of people just got stuck in their hotel rooms."
Many others said that while they regretted the vandalism, the overall effect of the protests was positive.
"We lost a lot of business this week," said John Balogh, manager of a juice stand at the City Centre shopping plaza. "But from a personal point of view, if this whole thing motivated people to think about what's really going on, what globalization is doing to us, then it's a good thing. I really believe that."
The fallout from the week will be explored for a long time to come.
"Seattle has a reputation for reasonableness and collaboration, and that's contradicted by what happened here," said Matthew P. Stadler, a Seattle native, novelist and literary editor of Nest magazine.
The City Council's hearings will be open to residents, protesters, business owners and anyone else.
At least two civil-rights groups are calling for investigations into police conduct, and the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. has been harshly critical of an incident last week in which officers stopped a black City Council member, Richard McIver, on his way to a W.T.O. reception. Even though he showed identification, Mr. McIver said, he was taken from his car, had his hands wrenched behind his back and was nearly arrested.
The American Civil Liberties Union has also asked for an independent panel to review the events of the week, including the city's imposition of what the group says was an unconstitutional no-protest zone in a 30-block area of downtown.
Still, things are calming down. The police and protesters reached a deal on Saturday, under which nearly all remaining protesters of the more than 600 arrested will be released from jail on their own recognizance.
Mr. Thom, the T-shirt vendor, predicted that the effect of the week's events would be short-lived. "When the Seahawks make the playoffs," he said, speaking of the local National Football League team that despite a loss tonight to the Raiders is now leading its division, "everybody will forget about the W.T.O."
But others said the week's legacy should be longer-lasting, even if it does not alter the city's character.
"Seattle's still Seattle, it's still a hub of high technology, and this isn't going to change that," said 22-year-old Jamaal Ali, who is studying computer programming at a vocational institute here. "But I hope that people don't just try to forget about all that happened this week. I hope, for a lot of different reasons, it really makes everybody think."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Vindication At Last For Collins

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 5

 BODY:
It has been a whirlwind year for Kerry Collins, one he began unemployed and apparently unwanted, since no National Football League team was threatening to end his status as a free agent.
He soon entered a rehabilitation center in an effort to curb his drinking. By February, he had signed with the Giants, an acquisition branded by many as foolhardy. 
 Then he did not play for months, the highest-paid offensive player on the team standing on the sideline in a baseball cap.
Late this afternoon, Collins stood in the Giants' locker room after he had thrown three touchdown passes, brilliantly leading the Giants to a 41-28 rout of the Jets at Giants Stadium.
"These are the type of games," Collins said, "that you ultimately see at the end of the rainbow."
Across the room, wide receiver Amani Toomer, who had caught the three touchdown passes, was marveling at Collins's play.
"He's just a great quarterback," Toomer said. "I can't say enough about him. On the first touchdown, if he throws it three inches to the left, it's a 7-yard gain."
Instead, Collins, by design, fired a crisp pass to Toomer's right shoulder, allowing him to grab the ball and twist away from Jets cornerback Aaron Glenn at the same time -- a move that allowed Toomer to run 61 yards for the score.
"On the last touchdown," Toomer continued, "he told me, 'This might be a jump ball; go get it.' But it was a really well-thrown pass. I caught it and ran for the end zone."
That play was an 80-yard score, with Collins lofting the football 40 yards in the air on a line -- a perfect spiral that hit Toomer right in stride and right in the hands. Toomer also caught a 9-yard touchdown pass from Collins, a well-timed fade pattern in the back corner of the end zone.
"Kerry just played a tremendous game," Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. "He made some spectacular throws."
Collins was named the Giants' starter last week, and though he played effectively at times in that game, he also contributed four turnovers in a crucial loss to Arizona. Today, Collins had no interceptions and, behind steady play from the offensive line, was not sacked.
With the rookie running back Joe Montgomery rushing for 111 yards and the quarterbacks coach, Sean Payton, calling the plays instead of Fassel, the Giants displayed an efficiency missing since the first two games of this year's preseason.
"Sean Payton is a cocky guy who takes risks," Giants running back Tiki Barber said. "I thought we'd be running the clock out with a 17-point lead, and he's throwing bombs. We need that."
It also suits Collins's disposition, since he likes to attack. Today, Collins was decisive in the pocket and saw the field extremely well, repeatedly throwing to second and third receivers in his pass progressions.
"Quick decisions make it hard for the defense to adjust to you," said Collins, whose 341 passing yards were the most by a Giants quarterback since 1993. "Today, the Jets were weaving when they should have been bobbing and bobbing when they should have been weaving."
It was an extraordinary performance, especially considering the Giants' ineptitude on offense for most of the season. None of their 11 drives began in Jets territory, but the Giants punted only three times.
When Collins came off the field for the final time, Fassel approached him with his right hand out.
"He shook my hand and said he was proud of me," Collins said. "I told him I was thankful for the opportunity."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;
Sharper Growth Seen In Spending on Ads

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
Advertising spending will grow more robustly than had been anticipated, according to the head of a leading media services agency, as a result of the spending burst by the dot-coms in traditional media and renewed confidence in the economy.
"We know every boom must end, but the outlook is still good," said John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media Worldwide in London, a joint venture of the Cordiant Communications Group and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C. Mr. Perriss is to discuss his forecasts this morning at the opening session of the annual Paine Webber Media Conference in New York. 
 The acceleration in ad spending is being fueled by the recovery of economies in Asian nations, Mr. Perriss said in remarks prepared for the conference, and the strength of Western economic conditions, which "are ideal for advertising growth." He singled out what he predicted would be an "exceptional" climate in the United States in 2000.
Other forecasters who time their reports to coincide with the media conference are also issuing predictions. "The third millennium will come in with a bang for media companies," according to the Myers Group in New York, publisher of The Myers Report media newsletter, which predicted that at the beginning of the 21st century, the interactive media would be "at the same stage as the assembly line at the beginning of the 20th century."

HEADLINE: Rite Aid Names a New Management Team

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Rite Aid Corporation, the troubled drug store chain, has chosen a new top management team, the company said yesterday. The new chief executive wasted no time in saying he would try to sell fewer assets than had been expected.
Robert G. Miller, 55, who will take over today as chairman and chief executive, said Rite Aid would continue to try to sell PCS Health Systems, a company that administers pharmacy benefits. But he said he would halt efforts to sell some of the 1,000 West Coast drug stores owned by Rite Aid. "We think the best approach is to fill the stores up with merchandise, clean them up and take care of the customers," Mr. Miller said in a telephone interview. 
 Mr. Miller conceded that the recent history of Rite Aid did not look good, but he said the company had "a powerful brand name and excellent store locations" and could prosper.
Mr. Miller was vice chairman and chief operating officer of the Kroger Company, a food and drug retailer, until he resigned Friday. He joined Kroger in May, when Fred Meyer Inc., the retailer he had run for eight years, was acquired by Kroger.
The rest of the new management team that Rite Aid hired yesterday had been with Mr. Miller at Fred Meyer.
The others are Mary F. Sammons, 53, who will be president and chief operating officer; David R. Jessick, 46, who will be chief administrative officer, and John T. Standley, who will be chief financial officer.
In addition, Deloitte & Touche was named as the new auditor for Rite Aid, with the duty of auditing the restatement of the company's profits for the past three fiscal years, as well as auditing the results from the current fiscal year, which ends next February.
The auditing firm said it would not be able to complete its work until Rite Aid implemented whatever changes are recommended by Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, a New York and Washington law firm that is being retained to investigate the company's accounting. Mr. Miller said he hoped the audits could be completed by early summer.
Rite Aid has been beset by one problem after another. The top officers of the company were forced out in October amid an accounting scandal that led KPMG to resign as the company's auditing firm, saying it had no confidence in the company's management. Rite Aid was indicted in Florida on charges of overcharging customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company.
But an immediate financial crisis was averted when Leonard Green & Partners, a private equity firm, invested $300 million in the company and Mr. Green joined the board as acting chairman. Lenders agreed to renew financing commitments, albeit at increased costs.
Mr. Miller said Mr. Jessick, the new administrative officer, had spent last week going over Rite Aid's books and operations. Mr. Jessick also knows the West Coast operations, having been chief financial officer of Thrifty Payless, the chain that Rite Aid acquired in 1996, before he joined Fred Meyer.
Mr. Green will remain on the board, but be replaced by Mr. Miller as chairman. Timothy J. Noonan, the former president of Rite Aid and interim chief executive, will remain with the company for a transition period.
Rite Aid grew rapidly under the leadership of Martin Grass, the son of the company's founder, who was chief executive from early 1995 until he was forced out in October. Under his leadership, the company became a Wall Street darling, with the stock price more than quadrupling to a high of $51.125 in January.
But with the company saying in October that it expected to restate profits at levels far lower than first reported, and with the company's bond rating cut from investment grade to medium-quality junk, the stock price has crumbled. It closed at $8.25 on Friday.
KPMG, which resigned as auditor on Nov. 11, had warned the company's audit committee in June that the company's accounting procedures were sloppy and needed to be reformed.
But a major dispute remains between KPMG and the board, one that the investigation will no doubt address. KPMG says it told the June 30 meeting of the audit committee that it was no longer willing to rely on the statements made by Frank Bergonzi, then the company's chief financial officer. The company says that members of the audit committee deny that KPMG officials said any such thing. Mr. Bergonzi, who had announced on June 14 that he planned to retire in the fall, was replaced on July 14.

Vegetarian Dinosaurs
It may not do much for their reputations, but new research shows that some dinosaurs may have had something in common with chickens. 
 Researchers from the United States, China, Mongolia and Japan, examining the fossilized remains of 12 relatively small dinosaurs from China, have discovered masses of mineral grains inside their rib cages. The grains, the researchers write in the journal Nature, may be the remnants of gizzards, which the creatures may have used to grind up plant matter much as poultry and other plant-eating birds do today.
The dinosaurs, which date to the Upper Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago, resemble ostriches, with long legs, small heads and toothless beaks. While they have some birdlike features, they are considered nonavian; they are called ornithomimids, or bird mimickers, and belong to the large group of two-legged dinosaurs known as theropods (the most famous member of which is T. rex).
Just what ornithomimids ate has long been a subject of debate. The presence of a gizzard and lack of teeth both point to this variety, at least, as eating plants, not meat.
 
Good News on a Pollutant
Acid rain brought on by sulfur emissions from industrial smokestacks has been a cause of much concern in the Northeast. But a new analysis of sulfur emissions worldwide shows that the United States, along with parts of Europe and Russia, has generally stabilized its emissions over the last two decades. A growing problem, however, exists in China, which now leads the world in the amount of sulfur put into the atmosphere.
The study, by a professor at Washington University in St. Louis and published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, analyzed oil and coal consumption and metal-smelting activity, all contributors to sulfur emissions, from 1850 to 1990. The results show emissions in the United States declining since the 1970's, when new pollution laws took effect and many factories and power plants were forced to switch from burning high-sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal, oil or gas. Industries in the former Soviet Union and some European countries have also switched to natural gas from coal.
But in China, which has abundant supplies of high-sulfur coal feeding a rapidly growing industrial economy, sulfur emissions have increased markedly. In 1990, China emitted 22 million metric tons of sulfur, compared with 15 million by the United States and Canada.
Along with the increase in emissions has come an increase in complaints about acid rain from China's Asian neighbors, similar to the complaints of Northeastern states about sulfur pollution from the Midwest.
 
Genetically Altered Soil
Genetically engineered corn has become very popular among American farmers. About 20 percent of last year's crop was of the modified variety, which exudes a toxin in the leaves and pollen that kills caterpillars and other pests that attack the plant above ground. But what, if anything, happens in the soil?
Researchers at New York University have discovered that the toxin, known as Bt because the genes that produce it come from a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, is exuded from the roots of the corn plant, too. In fact, the researchers found, about the same amount of Bt toxin enters the soil through the roots as is introduced from pollen that comes off during tasseling and from the residue of stalks and leaves left behind after harvesting.
The researchers, writing in Nature, note that the toxin apparently binds with soil and thus persists for long periods -- at least 234 days, the longest period studied. As to whether the presence of all that pesticide in the soil is good or bad, the scientists were noncommittal, saying further research is needed to show whether it helps control harmful pest populations or wipes out beneficial insects.

HEADLINE: Whose Prosperity?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While economists say a resurgence in productivity growth is "the single most important factor in explaining the nation's prosperity" (news article,Dec. 5), I hope the presidential candidates aren't that narrow-sighted. Our prosperity also results from the globalization of the business world and of the entrepreneurial business people in the United States who have taken advantage of this reality. 
 Our own prosperity will keep expanding only to the degree that we create a stable, open, global economy. It's the global economy, stupid! might be the best campaign slogan for 2000.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The news about industry growth is all good for 1999; forecasts for 2000 call for more of the same.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
HOW upbeat are the two leading forecasters of advertising spending about the prospects for the marketing and media industries in 2000?
At a conference yesterday, they almost warbled a medley of "Blue Skies" and "Cockeyed Optimist" in outlining their predictions for strong, sustained growth next year. 
 O.K., maybe that was an exaggeration. But unusually rosy glows permeated the presentations of Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, and John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media in London, at the opening session of the 27th annual PaineWebber Media Conference. The conference, at the McGraw-Hill Building in midtown Manhattan, continues through Friday.
The fluctuations of ad spending are closely watched because they often prove to be important indicators of the strength of the overall economy, especially offering clues about consumers' intent to spend. There had been some concerns that the economic turmoil in late 1998 in Asia and Latin America would seriously slow the growth in ad spending, but Madison Avenue has emerged virtually unscathed.
"Financial people were running around wondering if the world would end in 1999," Mr. Coen said. "But 1999 turned out better than we thought possible."
One reason, said Christopher Dixon, a managing director at PaineWebber who introduced the presentations, is "the extraordinary growth of dot-com advertising."
"Who would have thought that 10 or more companies that didn't exist two years ago would be willing to spend up to $3 million on a spot on the Super Bowl?" he asked with a trace of surprise in his voice. His reference was to the record sums being spent to advertise during ABC's coverage next month of Super Bowl XXXIV.
"A year ago, our forecast was more conservative," Mr. Perriss said. "I'm delighted to say we've been proved wrong."
"The global economy has been extraordinarily strong," he added, "and we expect three years of very steady growth" in ad spending from 2000 through 2002.
Mr. Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $233 billion to advertise in the United States next year, an increase of 8.3 percent from the $215.2 billion that he now forecasts for 1999 after revising upward some previous estimates. Both he and Mr. Perriss make their predictions twice a year and then revise them based on updated data.
The 1999 figure from Mr. Coen represents a 6.8 percent increase from the $201.6 billion spent in 1998. That gain is the smallest in percentage terms since 5.2 percent in 1993, reflecting to some degree the worries early this year about the tumult in overseas markets.
The 8.3 percent increase for 2000 would be the largest in percentage terms since 1994, when American ad spending rose 8.7 percent. And it would also set a record for ad spending as a percentage of gross domestic product at 2.48 percent, compared with 2.37 percent in 1998 and 2.4 percent in 1999.
"Usually when advertising has reached about 2.3 percent of G.D.P., it then grows less rapidly than G.D.P.," Leland A. Westerfield, senior analyst for broadcasting and publishing at PaineWebber, said in an interview after the presentations. "The numbers today could signal a breakout from historic norms."
Mr. Westerfield suggested two trends are powering "this increased level of consumer brand competition." One is "broadband coming into the home, cable modems, which will be a driving force of new advertising" in the interactive realm. The other is "deregulation in Washington, which is enabling increased competition in telecommunications, drugs, health care, financial services, utilities."
When Mr. Coen initially predicted ad spending for 2000 at a presentation in June, he estimated it would total $230 billion. The rise reflects the fact that "we see strong, heavy spending by national marketers" next year, he said, in part because of the millennium and the Summer Olympics, and also because of spending for political ads and the first paid ads to promote participation in the federal census.
Increased budgets are likely for traditional advertisers, Mr. Coen said, in categories like automobiles, computers, drugs, mutual funds and telecommunications as well as for dot-coms. And the gains are likely to be registered in traditional media like national cable and broadcast television networks, he added, as well as in the new media.
Speaking of new media, for the first time Mr. Coen broke out spending for online advertising as a separate category, which he estimated at $1 billion in 1998, $1.8 billion in 1999 and $3.2 billion in 2000.
Overseas in 2000, Mr. Coen forecasts ad spending of $231.4 billion, up 7 percent from a revised figure of $216.3 billion for 1999. That, too, represents an increase from his initial prediction in June, when he estimated ad spending overseas next year at $224 billion. The 1999 figure represents a 5.3 percent rise from $205.4 billion in 1998.
The change in Mr. Coen's international figures for 2000, he said, reflected strengthening economies in countries like Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Taiwan.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for 2000, then, is $464.4 billion, which would represent an increase of 7.6 percent from a revised worldwide total of $431.5 billion for 1999. The 1999 figure is a gain of 6 percent from the $407 billion spent in 1998. The rise in 2000, if it occurs, would be the largest since 1995, when world ad spending rose 11.5 percent.
Though Mr. Perriss uses a different methodology than Mr. Coen, tracking only major media, he was similarly effusive.
"The world looks pretty rosy going forward," Mr. Perriss said. "There don't seem to be any clouds of any consequence on the horizon." Two reasons he listed involved the American economy, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's ad spending. One was this country's "consumer boom" and the other was the "incredible" growth of dot-com ad spending in the United States, where he tracked campaigns from "over 800 brands" through the first half of 1999.
Other reasons for Mr. Perriss's optimism were the nascent trend of "dot-coms becoming a European phenomenon in ad spending" and improvements in Asian economies, except for Japan.
Mr. Perriss predicted worldwide ad spending of $319.1 billion for 2000, which would represent an increase of 6.5 percent from his revised estimate of $299.7 billion for 1999. The 1999 figure is an increase of 4.9 percent from $285.6 billion in 1998.
Mr. Perriss also offered forecasts beyond 2000: $338.8 billion in 2001, an increase of 6.2 percent from his expected total for 2000, and $359.2 billion in 2002, a gain of 6 percent from his predicted total for 2001.
Universal McCann is the media services division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. That agency is a unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. Zenith is a joint venture of the Cordiant Communications Group and Saatchi & Saatchi P.L.C.

HEADLINE: Visiting U.S., British Cabinet Minister Urges Investment in Ulster

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Britain's senior minister for Northern Ireland called on the Clinton Administration today to work with American businesses to step up investment in Northern Ireland to support the peace agreement by ending "the very real poverty and deprivation" there.
"It would be nice to see an early dividend from the peace that has been created," said Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, after meeting at the White House with administration officials to brief them on the accord that has brought home rule in Northern Ireland. 
 Even as he was promoting investment to cement the peace, Mr. Mandelson acknowledged that, without continued cooperation between pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans, the negotiations that have ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland could be set back "to square one."
"The parties now realize that they need each other," he told reporters. "This is the essence of the accommodation that has been struck."
But, he said, "we still have to go the final mile."
Last week, London transferred local government authority for Northern Ireland to a new power-sharing assembly drawn from the Protestant and Catholic parties. Last weekend, the outlawed Irish Republican Army sent an emissary to meet with an international disarmament committee to discuss the turnover of its weapons, which is required under the peace settlement.
Mr. Mandelson said that as a result of the peace effort, Northern Ireland had undergone a "transformation" that should have obvious appeal to American business executives.
"It's a completely different place -- no road checks, no roadblocks, people going about their day's business, their normal lives, as anywhere else in the United Kingdom," he said, adding that he wanted "to bring home to the American business community the huge return from their investment in Northern Ireland, if they were to commit to that."
The United States is already the largest single foreign investor in Northern Ireland. According to British government figures, American companies have invested about $1.9 billion there in the last five years.
Last year, two-thirds of all first-time investment in Northern Ireland was made by American companies, including several electronics firms seeking to take advantage of its well educated, relatively low-cost work force. American companies employ about 10 percent of the nearly 140,000 people who work in manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland.
"We have good people, good skills," Mr. Mandelson said. A close political ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Mandelson was appointed to the Northern Ireland post in October.
The mood of the talks today between the British delegation led by Mr. Mandelson and Clinton administration officials was that of a mutual admiration society.
Mr. Mandelson repeatedly praised President Clinton and former Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, who oversaw the negotiations that led to home rule in Northern Ireland, for their peace efforts.
He said that Mr. Clinton had made use of the "the persuasive skills for which he is famous" in the peace negotiations and that "he has not spared any effort, any ounce of energy."

HEADLINE: The Deceptions of Swiss Banks

 BODY:
Switzerland's reputation and especially that of its banks has been battered in recent years as new evidence revealed surprisingly close cooperation between Swiss institutions and those of neighboring Nazi Germany and in particular called new attention to disgracefully shabby Swiss treatment of Nazism's Jewish victims.
Yesterday's long-awaited report on the Swiss banking industry's handling of Nazi-era Jewish accounts added little fresh damage, finding no conclusive evidence that Swiss banks had systematically conspired to conceal or loot those accounts. But the report, by an international panel headed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, found that Swiss banks had somehow managed to lose track of a shockingly large number of these accounts over the intervening decades and that many banks had cruelly and deceptively turned away family members trying to recover lost assets. The Volcker panel was able to trace some 54,000 of these missing accounts, far more than the Swiss have previously acknowledged. 
 To ward off court suits and pressure from every level of the American government, Swiss banks last year agreed to a $1.25 billion settlement that resolved claims arising from these and other Nazi-era financial abuses. That total will not be affected by the new Volcker findings. But the report substantially reinforces the evidence supporting that settlement.
The Swiss bank settlement, the first in which a major European industry agreed to repay victims of Hitler-era economic crimes, set an important precedent that surviving Nazi victims are now rightly trying to follow up in other areas, most notably in talks with German industry about compensation for their use of slave and forced labor.
The German government, to its credit, has tried to nudge these negotiations toward a successful conclusion. But Switzerland's government has thus far been defensive and even resentful about acknowledging its responsibilities. That lack of leadership may have contributed to the growing anti-Semitic tone in Swiss politics in recent months. With the release of the Volcker report, and another report due later this week on Switzerland's treatment of refugees fleeing Nazism, Swiss leaders have a fresh chance to acknowledge the less attractive features of their country's wartime record and embrace efforts to compensate the victims.

HEADLINE: Clinton Remark on Child Labor Irks Brazil

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Labor Minister Francisco Dornelles was furious. "Has the United States resolved all its racial problems?" he asked. "No. But the country criticizes us without considering its own issues."
The source of the Brazilian official's anger was a little phrase uttered by President Clinton at the abortive World Trade Organization talks in Seattle. The President said he wanted to end child labor, giving children a way "out of the soccer ball industry in Pakistan, out of the shoe industry in Brazil, the fireworks industry in Guatemala." 
 The phrase backfired like much else at Seattle, where ministers failed to agree on a new round of talks to liberalize trade. In general Mr. Clinton meant to encourage developing countries to keep up their efforts to do away with child labor.
But as the world's ninth-largest economy, Brazil does not take kindly to being lumped with Guatemala. And as a developing nation grappling with the turmoil caused by the forces of globalization, Brazil tends to grow testy when it feels that its problems are misrepresented by an all-powerful United States busy handing out lessons.
Brazil had much to gain from success in Seattle. Agreement on agricultural trade alone could have brought an addition $11 billion in annual export revenue. The opening of trade in the farm and textile sectors of the developed world remains a critical issue for countries from Brazil to India.
But the perceived insult came to dominate Brazil's perception of the Seattle fiasco, a measure of the growing unease in developing countries over a global system that tends to apply the same economic recipe to nations at vastly different stages of economic development.
"Clinton made a big error," said Edmar Bacha, a banker and leading Brazilian economist. "By addressing Brazilian child labor, he wanted to ease the worries of unions and other interest groups over an invasion of cheap, labor-intensive goods. In an American election year, that is good politics. But to Brazilians it looks like a cheap political shot."
Sensitivity here is particularly acute because the last decade of economic liberalization has been so tumultuous.
The country as a whole has secured huge benefits from opening to the world, including a privatized phone system that works, access to imported goods, more efficient industries and a booming Internet business.
But the price in a country of 165 million people always marked by a glaring abyss between rich and poor has been onerous. In the Sao Paulo area alone, unemployment has doubled in recent years to nearly 20 percent as businesses have closed, moved or merged in the face of global competition.
Brazil has been battered by what some critics here call "motel capitalism," characterized by money that is always on the move. Although it has recovered from the financial crisis of two years ago, the country still has growth that is too sluggish for a swelling population, and interest rates that are too high for all but the wealthy, who can prosper by depositing their cash.
High unemployment in the developed world does not often mean desperation, since social insurance acts as a buffer. But in developing nations, high unemployment may push the very children of whom Mr. Clinton spoke into the streets to shore up a family's income.
"We have at least 3,500 children living in the streets today," said Celso Pitta, the mayor of Sao Paulo. "We are trying in various ways to help, but economic conditions are against us. And the easiest, cheapest business for these kids is drugs," often crack.
Violence has also soared in Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial capital. More than 4,000 people have been murdered here this year, many of them adolescents killed in shootouts over territory in the drug trade.
"You only have to look at the fortresses of the bourgeoisie surrounded by growing walls of barbed wire," said Raimundo Bonfim, a social worker, "and the city's spreading slums, where drugs are a means to survive, to see that what is needed is a mass movement to change the global economic model."
While those who govern developing countries regard Mr. Clinton's sentiments about worker rights and child labor as worthy, they are not convinced that the United States understands the problems.
They wonder whether granting those rights might not destroy the competitive advantage they need for development and whether the West is prepared to provide the billions of dollars needed to eradicate the poverty that lies behind child labor.
The Brazilian shoe industry, an important exporter to the United States, today described President Clinton's remark as a lamentable mistake. Nestor de Paula, the president of one of the main associations of shoe manufacturers, said, "Our opposition to child labor in the shoe industry is widely known."
In fact, the industry -- buffeted by globalization and the loss of thousands of jobs -- has made huge progress in recent years toward eliminating child labor. In Franca, the main production center in the state of Sao Paulo, child labor has been eliminated, and it is fast disappearing elsewhere, United Nations studies show.
The bulk of the more than 700,000 children aged 7 to 14 at work in Brazil are now employed in the coal industry in rural areas and in various informal jobs in the underground or criminal economy of big cities.
"If Mr. Clinton had been well informed, he would have condemned the use of children in the coal business and the criminals who exploit children," commented Klaus Kleber in Gazeta Mercantil, Brazil's leading business paper. "But it so happens that Brazil does not export coal to the United States, or street children."
That sentiment reflects the widespread view in Brazil and in countries like India that behind the pious sentiments of the United States lie down-to-earth political and economic considerations.
"When the United States no longer knows how to protect its industry, it turns to social issues," said Francisco Renan Proenca, the president of the industrial federation of Rio Grande de Sul, a state where the shoe industry is large. Mr. Dornelles, the labor minister, said, "The United States is open in its language but closed in practice."
Such suspicions feed the growing conviction that behind the seemingly neutral terms of "globalization" and "free trade" lies a calibrated calculation by Washington of its own interest.
Brazilians have responded by trying to attack what they see as inconsistencies in American trade policy, including barriers to Brazilian orange juice and sugar. But the unease seems broader. "Most Brazilians favor globalization," Mr. Bacha said, "but not at the price of subordination."

HEADLINE: Pataki Aide Is Selected To Lead SUNY

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
Struggling with a large deficit, the State University of New York, the nation's largest university, is on the verge of choosing Gov. George E. Pataki's budget director as the next chancellor of the 64-campus system.
The selection of the budget director, Robert L. King, announced yesterday by a search committee headed by the chairman of SUNY's trustees, strengthens Mr. Pataki's influence at the university. Since he took office, several former officials and allies have taken jobs there. 
 Thomas F. Egan, SUNY's chairman and head of the search committee, said he thought that Mr. King had the skills to work with the campuses and to advance SUNY "to the front ranks of American public higher education."
But some critics have questioned whether the appointment of leaders linked to the governor has politicized the university. They say they fear that Mr. Pataki's intention is to install administrators who will stress budget-cutting and efficiency, rather than academic quality, and raise tuition while reducing the share of the budget carried by taxpayers. Students at the four-year colleges now pay $3,400 a year.
The search committee voted unanimously yesterday to recommend Mr. King to the full board of trustees, which is expected to approve the appointment when it meets next Tuesday.
Mr. King will replace John W. Ryan, an experienced educator and longtime president of Indiana University, who started as interim chancellor in 1996 and became permanent chancellor the next year. He will remain a consultant and chancellor emeritus.
The selection comes at a time when the university, which has 370,000 students and 27,000 faculty members, is facing a $77 million deficit in its $1.65 billion annual budget, caused by the impact of the managed care era on teaching hospitals affiliated with SUNY campuses.
The State University is a sprawling archipelago of campuses in virtually every corner of the state. It includes four research universities -- in Binghamton, Stony Brook, Albany and Buffalo -- as well as four-year colleges, community colleges and specialized agricultural and technical colleges.
But to the frustration of its own officials, none of the campuses have the reputation of the great flagship campuses in state systems like those in California, Texas and Michigan.
Mr. King, 52, has little experience in higher education other than his work as a trustee for the Monroe County Community College Foundation. But he is well versed in politics, finance and administration, having served as a state assemblyman, the county executive of Monroe County and, most recently, as state budget director.
Randy Daniels, a trustee who served on the search committee, said Mr. King's extensive knowledge of the state and its budgetary and political environment were significant factors in his choice.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said yesterday that Mr. King had "played an important role in the changes Governor Pataki has brought about in this state over the last five years."
In an interview yesterday, Mr. King, who describes himself as a strict conservative politically and fiscally, said he thought his friendship with the governor would be an asset for SUNY.
"If anyone can persuade the governor about the rightness of something for the university, it is me," he said.
Asked whether that relationship might give the governor a greater chance to shape SUNY policy, rather than the other way around, Mr. King answered, "Whatever it is I've been asked to do or chosen to do, I've done with the guideposts of the best interests of the people I'm serving."
He added, "The last thing that he would want or that I would want at the end of the day is for someone to say, 'These are the guys who ruined the university.' "
Mr. King will be SUNY's first chancellor appointed from outside academia, at a time when universities and higher education systems in states like Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Ohio have increasingly looked outside their own ranks for top administrators to bring managerial skills and a sense of accountability.
A graduate of Trinity College in Hartford, with a law degree from Vanderbilt University, Mr. King worked as a prosecutor in California and in Monroe County, N.Y., before being elected to the New York State Assembly, where he became friendly with Mr. Pataki. He has also worked in business and run his own law practice.
In 1995, the governor appointed him director of the new Office of Regulatory Reform, with a mandate to do away with rules stifling business. In February 1998, Mr. Pataki named him budget director.
Mr. King said that he had not yet discussed salary, but as chancellor, he will be paid far more than the $147,490 a year he receives now. SUNY's board recently voted to pay their new chancellor $275,000 to $350,000.
George M. C. Fisher, chairman and chief executive of Eastman Kodak in Rochester, who worked with Mr. King when Mr. King was county executive, called his nomination as chancellor "a stroke of genius," saying he would benefit not only the university, but also companies like his.
"He'll look on companies as customers and say, 'How can I better serve you?' and I like that," Mr. Fisher said.
Mr. King said that one of his priorities would be to build the relationship between the university and industry as a way to improve the state's economy. He said he also wanted to manage the system more efficiently and to build its reputation so that it would be the first choice of the top-performing students in the state.
As county executive, he said, he borrowed managers from local companies, including Kodak, to help him develop training programs for all 5,000 county employees.
As an example of increased efficiency, he said the county's welfare fraud investigation unit pared its investigation time to six weeks, from two years. At the same time, he said, it became more effective: the district attorney, who had prosecuted only 30 percent of the cases the unit recommended, began to prosecute 90 percent of them.
On tuition, Mr. King said he would not try to dissuade the trustees from their pledge to hold tuition steady next year. But he said he favored a system that might link tuition to some kind of inflation index, so students would know what to expect.
Mr. King's candidacy moved very quickly. He said he rebuffed a feeler during the summer, before the state budget was approved. But when he was approached after it passed, he jumped at the opportunity.
"I have always thought that when my time in government came to an end that I'd be interested in securing a job as a college president," he said.
SUNY's search committee first interviewed him during Thanksgiving week, and SUNY's chairman and the governor's staff actively pressed for his candidacy.
Besides Mr. Egan and Mr. Daniels, the committee included two other trustees, Paul Perez and Pamela Jacobs, as well as Shirley Strum Kenny, president of SUNY Stony Brook; Joseph Flynn, the president of the university senate; and Fadeyibi Adeboye, a student from Hudson Valley Community College.

A Bad Quarter in Japan Shows Recovery Is Fragile

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Japan's tentative recovery from its worst recession since World War II suffered a setback last quarter as economic growth fell at an unexpectedly steep rate, hurt by sharply declining spending on public works projects, the Economic Planning Agency reported today.
The agency said that the gross domestic product declined 1 percent in the July-through-September period. Although economists said the data did not suggest that Japan might slip back into recession after two quarters of expansion, it still illustrated the country's dependence on public-spending projects to stimulate growth. 
 The data also re-established the two-steps-forward, one-step-back pattern that has characterized Japan's economic activity. All measures of domestic demand -- which account for more than half of the country's economic growth and which the government has been trying so hard to stimulate -- turned negative in the quarter. Consumer spending slipped 0.3 percent, corporate capital expenditures fell 2.1 percent and housing investment, previously strengthened by tax incentives, fell 3.2 percent.
But by far the biggest factor in the economy's retreat was a plunge in public spending, which fell 8.5 percent as the government exhausted its last supplemental budget. Hiroyuki Inoue, senior economist at the Japan Center for Economic Research, said, "Although we have seen some recovery and expect a moderate recovery going forward, we cannot forget the fact that it was pushed ahead by special economic policies such as enormous public spending, historically low interest rates and massive credit guarantees for small and mid-sized businesses."
Exports were the only major area of growth, increasing 4.7 percent, a trend that may not last because of the strength of the yen, which has made Japanese products more expensive overseas. The yen has risen to nearly four-year highs against the dollar, settling in New York today at 103.03 to the dollar.
"The saving grace in the quarter was a substantial rise in the trade surplus," said Richard Katz, senior editor of The Oriental Economist, a newsletter. "Without that rise, G.D.P. would have fallen 1.3 percent."
Japan's Parliament is expected to approve another supplemental budget this month, which could inject $61 billion into the economy, but the effects of that spending will not be noticeable until some time next spring or early summer. Most economists expect the economy to flounder until then, though some think the government's forecast of six-tenths of 1 percent growth for this year will be achieved.
Officials had taken pains to dampen expectations. The Japanese central bank, in particular, has been reluctant to describe the growth of the first two quarters of 1999 as a recovery. And Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, warned economists and investors that a prediction of 1.4 percent Japanese growth made last month by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of affluent industrial nations, was overly optimistic.
"Consumption is down and will probably stay depressed," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter here. "There's weakness in the public works component, and exports are likely to become flat-to-negative because of the stronger yen. This is not the environment for strong G.D.P. growth."
Nonetheless, the stock market here seemed to shrug off the bad news, with the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues continuing to rise, up three-quarters of a percent to 18,507.20. Other indexes rose more sharply.
The figures released today were in some ways difficult to interpret because of revisions to the previous two quarters' statistics. The Economic Planning Agency increased its figures for growth in the April-June quarter to 1 percent from one-tenth of a percent, which aroused some skepticism among economists. "Some of the upward revision in the second quarter looks questionable to me," Mr. Feldman said. He noted that the figures for public investment had sharply reversed, going from a 4 percent drop in the initial announcement to a 2.8 percent gain in the revised data, an unusually sharp adjustment. Other economists noted that capital expenditures for the fiscal year from April 1, 1998, through March 31, 1999, had been revised upward by 6.5 percentage points.
"The numbers are bound to cause confusion because of all the revisions we've had," said Brian Rose of Warburg Dillon Read here. "As an economist, one of the basic things you'd like to know is the size of capital expenditures, and that's just changed, which means forecasts and models have to change, too."
Mr. Rose noted that the latest quarterly data still showed that the economy grew by nine-tenths of a percent compared with the quarter a year earlier. "The economy won't be great," he said, "but the supplemental budget will kick in early next fiscal year and that should keep the economy going next year. But if you were relying on the economy to go into a strong recovery, you should be worried."

HEADLINE: Taking an Early Exit in Atlanta;
Awash in Troubles, Coca-Cola Chief Quits Unexpectedly

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
After a grueling year of falling profits, scuttled acquisitions and the biggest product recall in company history, Coca-Cola's top executive said yesterday that he would step down in April.
The outgoing executive, M. Douglas Ivester, 52, said only that he wanted to "move on to the next stage of my life." But his decision to retire so young after barely two years as chairman and chief executive, a job in which he clearly took delight, stunned shareholders and the business world. 
 Douglas N. Daft, a senior vice president who oversees operations in Asia and the Middle East, was named president and chief operating officer immediately and will assume the top role next year, Coca-Cola said.
Mr. Ivester presided over one of the worst patches in the company's performance since World War II, and that might have exhausted him or led the board to believe it was time to look for someone else.
His rocky path was a marked contrast to the smooth machine that was Coke under Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman who oversaw a soaring stock price and global sales growth for 16 years until his death in 1997 from cancer. Mr. Ivester, a onetime accountant who designed Coca-Cola's interlocking system with its bottlers, took over from him shortly after the Asian financial crisis erupted.
Since then, the company has been buffeted by disappointing sales and a raft of other problems, including a racial-discrimination lawsuit, government challenges to its acquisition plans and a product contamination scare in Europe this summer, all of which have caused it to slip from its perch as one of the most admired companies.
Though board members had publicly restated their confidence in Mr. Ivester's leadership, he had been increasingly criticized by some investors and company insiders as arrogant and insensitive, most notably in failing to quickly relieve consumer concerns in Europe. In addition, his refusal to name a No. 2 was a sore point with Wall Street. Mr. Ivester was fond of jetting around the world to visit with Coke employees and with customers, but seemed to lack the diplomatic skills to deal effectively with European regulators and others whose agendas were at odds with his own.
In a time of soaring share prices, executives with poor stock performance can find themselves under extraordinary pressure from impatient investors who will take their money elsewhere. Over time, concerns about Mr. Ivester's management style and slowing sales in the United States and abroad had knocked billions of dollars off his company's value. Coke's share price, which exceeded $88 in mid-1998, plunged to $48 in October before rebounding.
Mr. Ivester's resignation, which followed a special board meeting on Sunday, punished the company's stock once more. One stock analyst, Andrew J. Conway of Morgan Stanley, downgraded Coke for the first time in five years. "It's the equivalent of a major earthquake in Atlanta," he said. The stock closed at $64, down $4.3125. That price represents an 11 percent increase in Mr. Ivester's tenure, compared with a 50 percent rise in the broad market.
"Coke used to be all about consistency from an investor perspective, in terms of earnings results and volume results," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. "We've had nothing but inconsistency the last couple of years, and this just adds to that."
Adding to the confusion yesterday was the release of Coca-Cola's volume numbers for the fourth quarter. The company estimated that sales were ahead of those for the third quarter, suggesting that the tide is turning in Coke's favor. That led many to wonder why Mr. Ivester would make his decision now.
"Doug has informed the board of his desire to retire as chairman and chief executive officer in April, a decision the board has reluctantly accepted," the company said in a statement attributed to James B. Williams, a board member who is also a major shareholder.
A Coca-Cola spokesman, Rob Baskin, reiterated that it was Mr. Ivester's decision. "He decided at the end of last week that it was time for fresh leadership at the Coca-Cola Company," Mr. Baskin said. "He had some conversations with a few board members, they called a special meeting, and they reluctantly accepted his notice of retirement."
Among the board's 12 members are Warren E. Buffett, the value investor who leads Berkshire Hathaway; Herbert A. Allen, chairman of Allen & Company; former U.N. ambassador Donald F. McHenry; and James D. Robinson III, former chairman of American Express. Efforts to reach several board members were unsuccessful yesterday.
"Within the board, there has been underlying unhappiness with the sequence of negative events," said Emanuel Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It's been one after another after another. No single one would necessarily be a determinant, but it's the sum total that probably resulted in this."
Stock analysts scrambled to hold conference calls with their clients yesterday, but came up short on details. "The explanation for his departure at this point in time for the reasons I've been offered seems incomplete," said Marc Cohen, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs. "It strikes me as odd timing, if indeed the business has been repaired and is heading in a positive direction."
Mr. Ivester publicly delighted in the challenges of running Coca-Cola, where he was known to put in long hours, seven days a week, with few interests outside the office. "Even on a bad day, it's still the best job in the world," he told a group of analysts and money managers in July.
Bottlers also seemed perplexed. "I don't understand any of it," said J. Bruce Llewellyn, the chief executive of Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Philadelphia, who said he learned of the announcement while watching television. "I've known Doug Ivester for a long, long time, and I thought he was very good and very knowledgeable about this business. It's his troops and his plan that are in place for the globalization of Coke."
But it is completely out of character for a Coke executive to step down early.
In October, Coke hinted that a succession issue was rising. In a sweeping management change, it gave additional power to three executives, including Mr. Daft, setting up an apparent race for the top spot. A 30-year veteran of Coke, Mr. Daft was passed over for the top spot after Mr. Goizueta's death.
Mr. Ivester, who the company said chose Mr. Daft as his successor, may be leaving after weathering some of the worst problems abroad. Economic crises in Russia, Japan, parts of Latin America and Europe have curbed volume growth over the last 15 months, with currency changes eroding earnings as well. Coca-Cola derives about 75 percent of its profits abroad.
Efforts to expand the company abroad through acquisitions stumbled over regulatory issues. A $1.8 billion purchase of the Cadbury Schweppes brands in most of the world had to be scaled back to exclude much of Europe, after objections from the European Commission, and a two-year effort to buy the Orangina brand from Pernod Ricard S.A. collapsed last month after the French government blocked it.
In June, Coca-Cola had its biggest product recall ever after hundreds of Belgians said they became ill with nausea and other symptoms after drinking Coca-Cola and Fanta, another Coke brand. The incidents prompted a 10-day ban on Coca-Cola products in Belgium, the shutdown of two bottling plants in Belgium and France, and an estimated $200 million in costs to Coca-Cola in Belgium and beyond, as fears spread across the region. Its bottler in Belgium, Coca-Cola Enterprises, took a $103 million charge to earnings from the recall, in which 17 million cases of Coke were destroyed.
Coca-Cola spent heavily on damage control, giving away Cokes to individuals and stores. Mr. Ivester appeared in a television commercial, apologizing to the Belgian people. Still, the company was widely criticized for responding slowly to the crisis; those apologies came a week after the first reports of symptoms. Four schoolchildren said last week that they had still not fully recovered.
Coke is also contending with a racial-discrimination lawsuit filed by four employees who say they were denied pay increases and other promotions because of their race. And the management shuffle in October reassigned the highest-ranking black executive, Carl H. Ware, who resigned days later as senior vice president. His departure was a source of concern for some in Atlanta's civil rights community.
Most of Coke's 29,000 employees were sent an e-mail yesterday telling them of Mr. Ivester's decision. Mr. Baskin said Mr. Ivester has no health problems that influenced his decision. Mr. Goizueta died at age 65, a few months after being diagnosed with lung cancer.
Now the focus shifts to Mr. Daft, who will have a chance to influence a planned reintroduction of Coca-Cola Classic early next year and a strategic change at the company to raise prices even if it means slowing case sales.
In an interview in Atlanta last year, Mr. Daft described the driving force behind Coke's sales abroad. "We all see Coke as being way past a soft drink," he said. "It can represent a way of life to people. It can represent a change. You drink a Coke and it makes you able to cope with an environment that isn't all that fun."

HEADLINE: Bradley Says Ruling Out A Tax Hike Is Dishonest

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Saying it would be irresponsible and dishonest for any presidential candidate to take a "no new taxes" pledge, former Senator Bill Bradley refused today to rule out raising taxes to pay for his plan to make health insurance available to almost every American.
But Mr. Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he did not think a tax increase would be necessary to pay for the $65-billion-a-year proposal because of the nation's robust economy and a projected $1 trillion surplus, which he says is large enough to finance the plan over the coming decade. 
 Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bradley's lone rival for the Democratic nomination, has been steadily attacking Mr. Bradley's health-care plan as too expensive, and last weekend he criticized Mr. Bradley for leaving open the option of paying for the plan by raising taxes.
"He's being dishonest in saying that I want to raise taxes," Mr. Bradley said today. "I haven't proposed raising new taxes. I'm not proposing raising taxes."
But, he added, "nobody can predict the future of a trillion dollar economy."
Mr. Bradley also dared Mr. Gore to take a pledge of no new taxes, suggesting that it would be disingenuous if he did. To bolster his point, Mr. Bradley noted that then-Gov. Bill Clinton effectively attacked President George Bush for his 1988 promise of "read my lips: no new taxes." Mr. Bush later supported raising taxes to close a budget deficit.
"When Bill Clinton ran in 1992," Mr. Bradley continued, "he said it would be irresponsible to take a no new taxes pledge. I am not taking the no new taxes pledge, and neither is the vice president. So we have the same position.
"My view is, you be honest with the American people. If you think you cannot predict the future, then it would be irresponsible to say, no new taxes. But he thinks if you utter the word, somehow or other it's bad politics. I think people respect honesty and think that's the difference. And I truly thing that people are really tired of politicians who only tell them part of the truth."
Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said today, "Vice President Gore has ruled out raising taxes to pay for his programs barring some drastic change in the economy."
That was a "far cry from what Bradley says," Mr. Lehane said, asserting that Mr. Bradley seemed willing to raise taxes even if the economy was not in recession.
Mr. Bradley denied that today and said that Mr. Gore was making a mistake in being willing to raise taxes to finance programs during an economic downturn. Recessions are the best time to cut tax rates, he said.
"You don't raise taxes in bad economic times," Mr. Bradley said. "That's when you cut taxes. Raising taxes in dire economic times makes the economy worse. That's when you put money in people's pockets."
Mr. Bradley tried to turn Mr. Gore's latest attack on its head, saying the vice president was resorting to the "ultimate conventional approach to politics" by being negative.
"That's the old politics," he said. "If you don't have confidence in your own positive vision, you attack somebody else. And you try to do that as often as you can. That's what the name of the game is. I think people are fed up with it. They've been fed up with it for a while."
Mr. Gore began his latest attack in reaction to remarks Mr. Bradley made to The Washington Post last week about his health care plan. In that interview, Mr. Bradley was asked if he would consider raising taxes to pay for the plan. Mr. Bradley said it would depend on the health of the economy. And he said he would consider it only after other options had been reviewed, including closing tax loopholes and reducing federal subsidies for certain industries.
Mr. Gore seized on that opening in an interview with The Post on Saturday. "I'm talking about tax cuts," he said, "Senator Bradley is talking about tax increases."
Today, the Gore campaign accused Mr. Bradley of making contradictory and confusing statements about taxes and the economy.
"Senator Bill Bradley's zigs and zags over the past few weeks raise questions about his steadiness as a possible steward of the American economy," Mr. Lehane said.
The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim Nicholson, had also leaped into the fray. Anyone who refused to rule out tax increases was likely to increase taxes, Mr. Nicholson said.
Told of that remark, Mr. Bradley said today, "Tell him to ask George Bush," the former president.
After pausing, he turned the remark toward Mr. Bush's son the Republican presidential candidate: "Tell him ask George W. Bush to take a no new taxes pledge."

HEADLINE: PROSPERITY'S LOSERS: A special report.;
Homeless Defy Cities' Drives to Move Them

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6

 BODY:
When the police car pulled up, the dozen of them were sitting in a tired heap with 15 shopping carts and two dogs along a landscaping wall outside the Trinity Plaza Apartments on Market Street.
Not an hour earlier, two officers had chased them all from a park across the street, at the tourist-filled United Nations Plaza. Not 10 minutes earlier, one of them, Caesar Cruz, a resident of the alleys for three years, had said he felt like crumpled paper in the wind, tossed from here to there all day long. 
 Now, an officer was saying someone had complained about them. Mr. Cruz, holding two $76 summonses for "camping in public" (sleeping in a doorway), worried about getting another. So he nodded again and again when the officer said he would like for Mr. Cruz to "move along."
No one uttered a word in protest. Everyone scattered.
But it is not always that easy to make people who live on the streets disappear. In San Francisco, homeless people haunt the city: cocooned in doorways, pushing overloaded shopping carts, standing on corners announcing their troubles on cardboard signs ("Veteran, homeless and hungry").
And San Francisco is far from alone. At the richest time in the nation's history, housing that the poor can afford is at an all-time low, fueling an increase in homelessness, according to the United States Conference of Mayors. And with complaints about beggars and bag ladies and mumbling, stumbling vagrants growing as well, cities are fighting to move homeless people out of public spaces as never before.
In Sacramento, officials give homeless people one-way bus tickets out of town. In Santa Ana, Calif., it is illegal to sit in the Civic Center with belongings that occupy more than three cubic feet. In Atlanta, a person who asks for money more than twice from a passer-by who ignores the request can be arrested. In Seattle, those caught sleeping in parks can be banned from them.
For many cities, the model is New York, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's quality-of-life initiative swept Midtown Manhattan of panhandlers and squeegee men in the mid-1990's. Thousands of homeless people were ticketed or often arrested for offenses like sleeping in parks or obstructing sidewalks.
(While Mr. Giuliani recently announced that homeless people will have to work for a shelter bed, New York is the only city that guarantees any homeless person shelter on demand, and it has the nation's most extensive services for the homeless.)
Ordinances intended for people on the streets have become popular in the last 10 years, and even more so in the last 5, as the booming economy has brought real estate developers, tourists and well-to-do home buyers back to downtowns. The scramble for space has made once overlooked neighborhoods, the kind where single-room-occupancy hotels thrived and the very poor lived unnoticed, hot properties. The catch is they must be scrubbed clean.
Downtown revitalization or business improvement plans often include park curfews and ordinances popularly known as quality-of-life laws that make sleeping, lying, and sometimes, sitting and standing in public, offenses punishable by jail.
Of 49 cities surveyed last year by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, 73 percent were enacting or enforcing such ordinances, up from 26 percent in 1994.
City officials talk about "tough love" approaches to forcing homeless people to seek help, and of the growing impatience for what some, echoing President Ronald Reagan, call "the homeless by choice."
"There are those who fail to realize that we have to pay a price if we want to improve the quality of life," said the Rev. Amos Brown, a San Francisco supervisor. He has proposed a city ordinance that would ban standing on a corner or street median for more than five minutes to discourage panhandling. Loiterers would face a $250 fine and up to six months in jail.
"We need to decide, are we going to be a society where there's a sense of order," Mr. Brown said, "or do we want a disorderly society where anything goes?"
 
The Change
From Society Ill To Personal Problem
Whether fueled by highly publicized attacks by mentally disturbed people described as homeless, or exhausted by the seemingly intractability of the problem, the current policies and positions toward the homeless are a stark change from barely a decade ago.
In 1986, six million people formed a 4,000-mile line coast to coast to raise money to fight hunger and homelessness. These days, solving homelessness has faded from the public consciousness. Poverty, despite President Clinton's two forays this year to down-and-out communities, barely rates the news.
"Homelessness has gone from being a societal problem to being a messed-up individual's problem," said Paul Boden, board member of the National Coalition for the Homeless and director of the San Francisco Coalition on Homelessness. "There is an attitude that with unemployment at record lows, with the stock market at record highs, if you're poor, it's your own damn fault."
Officials in communities enforcing quality-of-life laws say they are doing all they can to house and to provide medical and mental health services for the truly needy, despite increasing competition for state and federal money.
But advocates for the poor say many communities are spending more energy and resources on plans to police and prosecute the down and out as quality-of-life offenders than on tackling the causes of homelessness.
"It's not rocket science to figure out that people become homeless because of the lack of affordable housing and support services for those who are mentally ill or addicted," said Mary Ann Gleason, director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. "Yet it's true that in many communities across the country, cities are responding in not very helpful ways to the growing need for affordable housing and accessible health care.
"We continue to discharge people from prisons and hospitals into shelters. We continue to put people who need help with substance abuse on long waiting lists. And now, putting people in jail for doing in public what other people have the privilege to do in private seems to be the way to go."
 
The Sweep
Using the Law And Persuasion
California's capital, Sacramento, began cracking down on street people about four years ago, pushed by business people trying to improve the city's image. The Downtown Sacramento Partnership, which represents about 550 businesses, employs about 20 people it calls city guides to patrol 65 blocks. The patrols, concentrating on tourist areas and shopping zones, call the police when they find someone sleeping on the street or panhandling.
"To make this a destination and encourage continued revitalization, we need to continue to make it clear that downtown is not going to be a place where panhandling and other negative activity is tolerated," said Michael Ault, the partnership's executive director.
Sacramento has become "tired of the constancy" of homelessness, said Heather Fargo, a councilwoman, who said the city was spending $14 million on homeless programs this year, up from $1.6 million 10 years ago.
In a move many other communities have made, Sacramento, after weeks of coaxing scores of people from an encampment along a river parkway, began offering them bus tickets out of town. City officials said they sent away only those who had a relative or friend who had agreed to take them in.
Nearby communities have found even more creative ways to police their streets. In Roseville, a suburb about 25 miles east of Sacramento, the police go undercover to catch panhandlers in the act. Homeless people say they are often escorted out of town.
Marysville, an old gold rush town of 12,500 residents about 40 miles north of Sacramento, has painted 10 parking meters red, removed the timers and called them homeless meters. Signs on the machines say: "Donation here will help the homeless. Please do not give cash to panhandlers."
The city has also banned shopping carts from city streets and rummaging through trash, or "dumpster diving," except with permission of the property owner.
Mark Siemens, the Marysville city administrator and chief of police, said the city began cracking down on panhandling five years ago, after "a huge backlash from the business population in town."
About 40 to 50 transients and street people would haunt a two-square-mile area, Mr. Siemens said. Many came by freight train, he said, drawn by the city's rescue mission and other services for the homeless.
Now, he said, "When they realize, 'Gee whiz, it just doesn't do any good to stand on a corner and beg for money,' they find someplace else to go. If there's no good fishing in the lake, you find another lake."
In San Francisco, police sweeps and crackdowns on homeless people have become so well known that in October, the National Coalition for the Homeless chose the city as the site to open a national campaign for civil rights for the homeless. This year, the police here issued more than 20,000 citations for violations of ordinances like trespassing, camping, carrying an open container and violating park curfews, compared with 17,500 in 1998 and 15,700 in 1997.
Because the citations do not appear to be making a dent in the homeless population, the city's Board of Supervisors recently approved $250,000 for the city attorney to set up a special unit dedicated to prosecuting those offenses.
Many people seem to approve. In random interviews with three dozen people in San Francisco, many had qualified sympathy for the homeless but most were also harshly critical of people they felt were unwilling to change their situation. Only a fourth of those interviewed named high housing costs as a cause of homelessness; a third blamed laziness or addictions.
"I don't really sympathize," said Leia Sutton, a waitress. "I feel they are already taken such good care of with financial aid and food stamps. They get free food. And I think it's making a lot of them not get off their butts and survive for themselves."
Aaron James, a parking control officer in San Francisco, blamed housing costs.
"Yuppies from Silicon Valley are coming in and sending the prices soaring," Mr. James said. "Studios are going for $1,200 a month."
But Nabil Salem, 30, who owns the McCallister Market and Deli, in the Tenderloin district where many homeless people live, sees a lack of personal responsibility in the people he brushes from his doorway.
"It's a very big problem for retailers," Mr. Salem said. "Every morning I come in to open up the store. And they're sleeping in the doorway. Or they have left boxes, where they've slept. Or food. They urinate or sometimes defecate. And it smells. I get so mad. It happens all the time. Every morning. It takes me two hours to clean it up sometimes. Why should I have to put up with that?"
In October, the city announced a plan to confiscate shopping carts as stolen property from the hundreds of people who use them to carry their belongings. The plan was canceled when the public protested the idea as cruel.
Still, in recent interviews with dozens of homeless people, most reported having their possessions thrown away by teams hired by supermarkets to retrieve the shopping carts, or by the police, who seize the carts as abandoned property, even as the homeless person stands by.
"They just took my stuff and dumped it in a Dumpster, and I had all my papers in there," said Tyrone Saunders, 35, who has been homeless for four years. "I have AIDS, so I had to go fishing through the garbage to get my stuff back. I don't ask nobody for nothing. I clean floors at the corner store for my money. And everyone still sees me as dirt."
In recent weeks, the police have also started arresting volunteers for handing out food to homeless people (without having a permit to do so) at United Nations Plaza. (The catch: the city will not grant them a permit.)
"I have never seen anything so mean-spirited," said Sister Bernie Galvin, director of Religious Witness With Homeless People, an interfaith advocacy group, who was one of those arrested and held in jail for 24 hours.
George Smith, the director of the Mayor's Office on Homelessness, and a former homeless drug user, acknowledged that the police crackdowns had done little to help matters. He said the city was in the process of increasing teams of outreach workers to offer street people help.
"We have people moving through the system successfully all the time," Mr. Smith said. But, he said, "San Francisco can't be expected to solve a national problem."
 
The Shelters
Rising Opposition To Growing Need
In many cities, officials insist that the people wandering the streets night and day come from elsewhere. They say the homeless are drawn to a place by its weather or welfare allowance or reputation for tolerance.
In fact, studies of homeless people have suggested that most of them once had homes in the communities where they became homeless. Dennis Culhane, a professor of social welfare policy at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied homelessness, said that based on analyses in New York City and Philadelphia, homeless people were, predictably, the very poor.
They come from the poorest neighborhoods, where people pay the most for their housing relative to income, they crowd together to afford housing costs, and they have the highest unemployment and temporary employment rates. Their neighborhoods have the worst levels of housing abandonment. Professor Culhane said most people living on the street have been evicted from their homes.
No one, it seems, wants homeless people in their backyard. In communities where homeless people are regularly cited for begging or sleeping or trespassing, officials are encountering mounting resistance when they try to open shelters to house those they have swept off the streets.
In Atlanta, where an estimated 22,000 people are homeless, two proposed shelters are stalled by opposition. Earlier this year, a donor bought a building on Peachtree Street, the city's main thoroughfare, for the Metro Atlanta Task Force for the Homeless. The task force proposed converting the building, which housed an arts group, to a shelter that that would also provide counseling for abuse of drugs and alcohol and help in getting jobs and long-term housing.
But the building is in the renovated downtown, where more than 9,000 homeless people were arrested in the 12 months before the 1996 Olympic Games for violating newly enacted quality-of-life laws, and opposition to the shelter was swift and loud.
The city requested that single men be housed in a separate building from women and children in order for the project to proceed. But when the task force then signed a contract to buy a former nightclub in an industrial neighborhood, that, too, met protests, and city officials earlier this month refused to support the shelter.
Although the closest real neighborhood is across a highway, the area is in the process of revitalization, with landlords converting warehouses into loft condominiums.
"If we can't open it here, than where?" said Anita Beaty, co-director of the task force, as she looked around the pocked landscape surrounding the empty building on a recent visit.
Some 85 to 90 women and children have been sleeping in the task force office on recent nights, Ms. Beaty said.
The other day, about two dozen men were lying a stone's throw from the building where the men's shelter would be built. They live under the highway, not on the ground, but tucked under the top of supports that hold an elevated section. In broad daylight, they were shrouded in darkness. Only the glint of eyes and teeth were visible, and several of the men covered their faces when they noticed people noticed them.

HEADLINE: Republican Candidates Gather for Courteous Debate

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Resisting their first opportunity to spar directly with each other on national television, six Republican presidential candidates instead treated each other rather courteously tonight as they touted their stands on foreign policy, taxes, education and campaign finance.
Unlike in a Republican forum last week in New Hampshire, in which Gov. George W. Bush of Texas shared the stage for the first time with his rivals, the contenders were subtler this time in contrasting themselves with Mr. Bush, the front-runner. 
 Mr. Bush drew criticism last week for too often drawing from his stump speech. Tonight, he appeared a bit more at ease but still offered rather rote responses on matters like tax cutting and foreign policy.
Asked what he had learned about foreign policy from a biography of Dean Acheson -- Mr. Bush said last week that he was reading the book -- the governor repeated statements from his standard speech and gave no specifics about Mr. Acheson, the secretary of state from 1949 to 1953.
The lesson, Mr. Bush said, "is that our nation's greatest export to the world has been, is and always will be the incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called America."
Moments later, Senator John McCain of Arizona seized the opportunity to demonstrate his knowledge of foreign affairs and history. He answered a question by saying: "Let me talk about Dean Acheson for a second. When Dean Acheson walked into Harry Truman's office in June of 1950 and said, 'North Korea's attacked South Korea,' Harry Truman didn't take a poll. Harry Truman knew what we had to do."
For about half of the debate at the Orpheum Theater, the competitors were allowed to question one another. But mostly their questions sounded like recitals of their own credentials. The event, which lasted about 75 minutes, was carried live on CNN.
Mr. Bush repeatedly talked about recasting the Republican Party as a compassionate party that cared about everyone, and he underscored his concern for the less fortunate.
Mr. McCain, who has emerged as a potent rival to Mr. Bush in New Hampshire, trumpeted his prescriptions to reform the campaign finance system. Although he was hooked up to the event by satellite from a television studio near Boston, Mr. McCain, as he did last week, seemed particularly comfortable fielding questions.
Steve Forbes, the publisher, sought to establish his conservative credentials and hawk his plans for the economy. Gary L. Bauer, who headed a grass-roots conservative group, played up his crusade against most-favored-nation status for China because of human rights abuses. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah spoke often about his seasoning after years in the Senate. And Alan Keyes, a former State Department official, pressed his conservativism.
When the candidates had the opportunity to ask questions, it was no surprise that the first up, Mr. Bauer, turned his attention to Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bauer asked Mr. Bush why he, like President Clinton, favored more open trade with China, as opposed to a sharper confrontation.
Mr. Bush replied, "If you give people a breath of freedom, a taste of freedom, I think you'll be amazed, Gary, at how soon democracy will come."
Then Mr. Bauer asked, "Is there no atrocity that you can think of that would tell you to put trade on the back burner?"
Mr. Bush, in perhaps his most spirited answer, said: "If we turn our back on China and try to isolate China, things will get worse. Imagine if the Internet took hold in China. Imagine how freedom will spread." The governor used his question, to Mr. Hatch, to boast about how in Texas he had drawn significant support from Hispanic voters.
Mr. Hatch said, "I think Governor Bush deserves a lot of credit." But the senator questioned Mr. Bush's qualification for the Oval Office. He said many people had suggested that Mr. Bush would be a perfect vice president given that Mr. Hatch had more foreign policy experience. "You should have eight years with me," Mr. Hatch said to Mr. Bush. "Boy, you'd make a heck of a president after eight years." The audience erupted in laughter.
At times, the good manners seemed forced. When Mr. Forbes told Mr. Bush he could call him Steve, the governor, who is not known as being particularly fond of the publisher, appeared not to know quite what to say. Later in the evening, Mr. McCain joked that he did not know whether to call the governor "George," "W" or "Bush" or "whatever."
In his question for Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush promoted his proposal for tax incentives for faith-based institutions. Mr. McCain complimented the governor's proposal. But he tried to draw a contrast by suggesting that Mr. Bush relied on rosy, and perhaps unrealistic, projections of surpluses.
"There's a big difference," Mr. McCain said. "I do not envision surpluses forever."
The first round of questions for all six candidates concerned education, and each candidate used his response principally as an opportunity to state his general views on the federal government's role in public education. Those views were nearly identical: all the candidates emphasized clear, finite limits to federal involvement and many advocated at least some experimentation with vouchers.
Both Mr. Bauer and Mr. Keyes rued the flight of prayer and religion from classrooms, with Mr. Bauer citing that as a reason for violence in schools. "I don't think this is a gun problem, as some might suggest," Mr. Bauer said. "I think it's a problem of the heart and soul."
Mr. Keyes agreed, saying, "Since we took prayer out, we seem to have let violence and decline in."
Both Mr. Hatch and Mr. Bush talked up the virtues of vouchers, although Mr. Bush did not use that word. Mr. Bush reiterated his belief that schools that receive federal funds should face consequences if the children in those schools are failing.
"I believe that if the federal government spends money on the poorest of the poor children, we need to ask a simple question," said Mr. Bush. "What are the results? What are the results?"
Mr. McCain was reminded of a statement he had repeatedly made that good teachers should make more than bad senators, whose salaries will raise to $140,000 in January.
"You know that I would never allege that there are any bad senators," Mr. McCain joked. Then, making light of questions that have been raised about his temper, he added: "I win Miss Congeniality every year in the Senate."
In an effort to prevent Mr. Bush's rivals from ganging up, CNN set ground rules that prohibited the candidates from asking all their allocated questions of the same person.
Mr. McCain did not travel to Arizona to share the stage with his competitors because, his campaign said, he had long-scheduled events in New Hampshire and New York today and Tuesday, but CNN agreed to include Mr. McCain by satellite. Despite the civility of the discourse compared with last week's, there were a handful of thinly disguised digs at Mr. Bush. "Instead of running on their name or their wealth," Mr. Keyes said at one point, "let's seem them run on their abilities, as I'm doing."
"Amen," Mr. Hatch said.

NEW YORK LIFE TO ACQUIRE MEXICAN INSURER

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The New York Life Insurance Company, the seventh-largest life insurer in the United States, said yesterday that it would pay $570 million to acquire Mexico's third-largest insurer, Seguros Monterrey Aetna S.A., from Grupo Financiero Bancomer S. A. and Aetna Inc. to expand its business in Mexico. Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest banking group, said it would receive $290 million for its 51 percent stake in the insurance venture. New York Life gains a subsidiary that sells life, health, property and casualty policies in a growing insurance market where insurance premiums proportional to economic output are less than in other Latin American countries. Aetna rose $1.8125, to $59.5625. Seguros Monterrey has 23 percent of Mexico's individual life insurance business.

A Bid to Save a Theater

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Crossroads Theater Company, in New Brunswick, N.J., long acknowledged as one of the nation's most prominent black theaters, announced an endowment drive yesterday in the face of a financial crisis.
The 21-year-old company, which won a Tony Award this year for outstanding regional theater, carries a debt of $1.2 million and canceled six preview performances of its current production, "Play On!," because it could not pay for sets, costumes or actors. 
 Crossroads' co-founder and artistic director, Ricardo Khan, said yesterday that he planned to take a yearlong sabbatical to raise an endowment.
"What might have closed down most organizations has not closed down Crossroads," Mr. Khan said at a news conference. Black politicians and church leaders also pledged to raise money to save the theater, which brought "Ain't Nothin' but the Blues" to Broadway.
Crossroads, which has attracted actors like Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, also appointed its board chairman, Dale Caldwell, as president and chief executive, with a mission of focusing on the company's finances.

HEADLINE: Panel Advises Adding to Life Expectancies

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Social Security Administration is not being optimistic enough about how long Americans will live in the 21st century, and as a result it has underestimated how much their benefits will cost, a federal advisory panel said today.
The Clinton administration underestimated the financial problems of the Social Security program because it understated likely improvements in life expectancy, the panel said. Federal officials already assume that Americans will live longer in the next century. But the expert panel said that the assumptions were too conservative and that life expectancy would probably continue improving in coming decades, just as it had through the 20th century. 
 The 12-member panel said the decline in mortality rates had financial implications: "Longer lives imply more years of Social Security benefits," it said.
The panel reviewed the economic, demographic and other technical assumptions used by the trustees of the Social Security program, including the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services. The panel's report was commissioned and issued by the Social Security Advisory Board, an independent bipartisan body created by Congress and appointed by the president and Congressional leaders. The trustees may incorporate the panel's suggestions in their own annual report. But Social Security tax rates, the formula for computing benefits and the standard retirement age can be altered only by changing federal law.
Life expectancy at birth increased to 76.7 in 1998 from 63.6 years in 1940. The Social Security Administration predicts that it will rise to 79.3 in 2030 and to 81.5 in 2070. The expert panel said these numbers should be higher; it predicted life expectancy would probably reach 81 in 2030 and 85.2 in 2070.
"We think life expectancy will increase more rapidly than the actuaries have estimated in the past," said Richard D. Lee, a professor of demography and economics at the University of California at Berkeley and a panel member.
President Clinton has often described this type of situation as "a high-class problem," because it reflects improvements in the well-being of Americans.
The panel, led by C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute, also said that wages and productivity would rise a little faster than the government has assumed, and also suggested other changes for the trustees' report.
Taking these changes together, the panel concluded that Social Security's long-term financial problems were about 25 percent greater than indicated by the official government estimates. To cover the shortfall by raising taxes, the panel said, annual payroll taxes would have to be increased by 2.6 percentage points above current levels -- not just 2.07 percentage points higher, as would be required under the Clinton administration's assumptions.
For a worker earning $30,000 a year, that means the payroll tax would have to rise by $780 a year, rather than the increase of $621 needed under the assumptions now used by the government.
The panel said that Social Security officials had made the pessimistic and implausible assumption that life expectancy in the United States would continue to lag far behind that of other countries.
For example, it said, Social Security actuaries assume that American women will have to wait until 2033 before they achieve the life expectancy already achieved by French women in 1995 (about 82 years). Likewise, it said, the actuaries assume that American men will have to wait until 2029 before they achieve the life expectancy recorded by Japanese men in 1995 (77 years).
The experience of other countries shows that "U.S. mortality can fall a long way without encountering biomedical limits," the panel said.
Jane L. Ross, deputy commissioner of Social Security, said the panel's recommendations would be "carefully considered" as her agency prepares future annual reports on the program's financial condition.
Stephen C. Goss, deputy chief actuary of Social Security, said: "Everybody agrees that mortality will continue to improve in the future. The point of debate is how fast that improvement will be."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Forum With G.O.P. Candidates

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the forum last night in Phoenix for the Republican presidential candidates, Gary L. Bauer, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Senator John McCain of Arizona, as recorded by The New York Times: 

Mr. Forbes
 
Q. Look back at the past seven years. We have 20 million new jobs, 4.1 percent unemployment, low inflation, more than a tripling of the stock market, yet you have been critical not only as many of your rivals here have been of the incumbent president's economic stewardship, but also of the job performance of the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. What in your view has Mr. Greenspan done wrong? And if you are elected president, who would you nominate to replace him?
 
A. First of all the prosperity that we're enjoying today, those foundations were laid by Ronald Reagan in the early 1980's. Let's not forget that. And it was the Republicans who stopped some of the destructive nonsense of the Clinton-Gore administration that enabled us to enjoy the prosperity we have today.
Concerning the Federal Reserve, as I've said before, Mr. Greenspan did a very good job in the early 1990's. But in the last couple of years he's fallen prey, fallen for this crazy theory, John, that prosperity causes inflation. And so they're trying to slow the economy down by raising interest rates. Why? It's like going to a doctor. The doctor says John you're in great health, so we have to make you sick a little bit. It's a bizarre theory. And it's already wrought havoc in agriculture.
It's going to hurt our economy and in terms of a replacement, there are a number of good people out there, Jack Kemp, the head of the Dallas Reserve Bank as well, the people who understand it. . . .
 
Mr. Bush
 
Q. While we are considering America's place in the world, you volunteered at last week's debate that you were now reading the biography of Dean Acheson. And my question is, what lessons do you take from the successes and the failures of Acheson and George Marshall during that critical period in U.S. history and how would you apply that to a Bush international policy?
 
A. The lessons learned are that the United States must not retreat within our borders, that we must promote the peace. In order to promote the peace, we've got to have strong alliances, alliances in Europe, alliances in the Far East. In order to promote the peace, I believe we ought to be a free-trading nation in a free-trading world, because free trade brings markets and markets bring hope and prosperity.
In order to keep the peace, the United States must be strong militarily. The speech I gave in the Citadel in South Carolina I talked about the need to not only make sure that the morale in today's military is high, but also to make sure that we reconfigure our military.
You see, if we get to redefine how war is fought, we get to redefine how the peace is kept. The lessons of Atchinson and Marshall are, is that our nation's greatest export to the world has been, is and always will be, the incredible freedoms we understand in the great land called America. . . .
 
Mr. McCain
 
Q. Tonight there is both an emotional and a diplomatic trauma playing out about a 5-year-old boy from Cuba who lost his mother as they tried to enter the United States by water. The boy's father back in Cuba says he wants his son back. If you were president of the United States, what would you do?
 
A. I'd say to Mr. Castro, let his father come to the United States and enjoy peace and freedom and be reunited with his son. We don't want his son to grow up under Communist tyranny.
Let me talk about Dean Acheson a second. When Dean Acheson walked into Harry Truman's office in June of 1950 and said, North Korea has attacked South Korea, Harry Truman didn't take a poll. Harry Truman knew what we had to do. If he'd have taken a poll, maybe Americans wouldn't have let us go.
This administration is poll driven and not principle driven. We didn't have to get into Kosovo. Once we stumbled into it, we had to win it. And the fact is that this administration has conducted a feckless photo-op foreign policy for which we will pay a very heavy price in American blood and treasure.
You have to have a concept of what you want the world to look like. Well, our interests and our values lie in how we are going to bring this world into the next century and call it, again, the American century. . . .
 
Candidates' Exchanges
 
MR. BAUER -- Well my first question Judy is for Governor Bush, not surprisingly. Governor I worked for Ronald Reagan for eight years and he never gave the Soviet Union most favored nation status. He always insisted on progress on human rights and national security.
Our new challenge is China. They persecute their people, arrest those who practice their religion, forcible abortions, etc. And yet you've embraced the policy of Clinton and Gore, you want to give them most favored nation status and membership in the World Trade Organization. Why not follow a Reagan policy instead of a Clintonian policy?
 
MR. BUSH -- I appreciate that, but you know how to insult a guy by saying, follow the policies of Clinton-Gore. I don't. They believe in what's called a strategic partnership. I believe in redefining the relationship to one of competitor. But I believe competitors can find common ground. I think it's in our nation's best interests to open up Chinese markets to Arizona farm products, to Iowa farm products, to high-tech manufactured goods.
It's in our best interests to sell to the Chinese. It's also in our best interests to make sure that the entrepreneurial class in China flourishes. I think we make China make an enemy, they'll end up being an enemy. I think if we trade with China, and trade with the entrepreneurial class, and give people a breath of freedom, give them a taste of freedom, I think you'll be amazed, Gary at how soon democracy will come. And so, I also believe, so therefore I believe China ought to be in the World Trade Organization. I also believe that Taiwan ought to be in the World Trade Organization. But let me make this clear to you and to the Chinese.
I will enforce the Taiwan relations law if I'm the president, if the Chinese get aggressive with the Taiwanese we'll help them defend themselves. . . .
 
MR. BUSH -- One of the things that I found in my state, particularly when I focus on education is that when I announced we were going to abolish a social promotion in Texas schools, which is a system that's so, has such low hopes and low expectations that minority parents say thank you, governor, thank you. You have any comments on----
 
MR. HATCH -- Well, I think minority parents owe you. And I think Republicans owe you. You've been a great governor. My only problem with you, Governor, is that you've only had four, going into your fifth year of governorship and a constitutionally weak governorship. And, frankly, I really believe that you need more experience before you become president of the United States.
That's why I'm think of you as a vice-presidential candidate. Because if you had -- just think, just think: Ronald Reagan picked your father because he had foreign policy experience. Somebody suggested the other day they should -- you should pick me because I have foreign policy experience. They've got it all wrong. I should be president and you should have eight years with me and boy, you'll make a heck of a president after eight years, I'll tell you.

For Unusual Tower, It's All About Signs

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The newest addition to the Times Square neighborhood is a 300-foot-tall steel supporting column for the illuminated signs characteristic of the area, with a 550-room hotel added almost as an afterthought.
The shell of the building, at Broadway and 47th Street, has been completed and the hotel is expected to go into operation in May. It was originally planned as the first Planet Hollywood hotel, but the bankruptcy filing by the restaurant company in October stopped that plan, although Planet Hollywood still owns retail condominium space in the building. The developers of the project are negotiating with hotel companies to find an operator. 
 Some temporary signs, including advertisements for Sealy mattresses, Banana Republic and MetroCard, are now attached to the tower. Eventually, they are to be replaced with the animated displays and moving mechanical elements that the industry calls spectaculars.
"I have been thinking of doing a sign tower since 1987," said Robert Gladstone of Madison Equities, one of the principal investors in the project. The tower, he said, will provide additional income from sign rentals while still letting him build the hotel as large as allowed by zoning regulations.
The 340,000-square-foot building, which runs 45 feet along Broadway and 145 feet along 47th Street, consists of four full floors at the base, which is to be used for stores, restaurants and meeting rooms.
The sign tower starts on top of the fourth floor on a platform facing Broadway at about 60 feet above the street and extends upward an additional 240 feet. The tower is an internally braced steel truss that is not connected vertically to the reinforced-concrete hotel.
The guest-room section of the hotel is shaped like an L on two sides of the tower and is to have signs on the roof whose tops are to be almost 500 feet over street level. Because of the layout of the hotel, Mr. Gladstone said, none of the windows of the guest rooms will face directly onto signs. He said there were 12 guest rooms per floor, with 6 facing north and 6 facing south.
The unusual design of the building underscores the economic value of the signs that are required by city regulations in the Times Square area. In 1997, a German investment company, the Jamestown Group, paid $1,000 a square foot for the largely vacant building at 1 Times Square when fully occupied, high-quality office buildings were selling for $300 to $500 a square foot.
That is because the real value of the building is as a base for the signs that are seen by thousands of tourists each day and by millions worldwide on New Year's Eve, when the ball signaling the end of the old year is lowered from the building's roof. The signs on 1 Times Square, which is between 42nd and 43rd Streets, have been reported to generate $7 million in net income annually.
Mr. Gladstone said his tower at 47th Street was specifically designed for the installation and servicing of the largest heaviest spectaculars made. He said the tower was anchored to bedrock 50 feet below the street surface to prevent it from swaying as winds caught the sail-like surfaces of the signs.
Excavating the 14,000 cubic yards of rock from the site was one of the most difficult parts of the project, which is being managed by J. A. Jones-GMO, a construction company. Because of performances at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater on 46th Street, drilling and blasting often had to be halted and the landmarked theater carefully monitored for damage.
The air rights over the theater were added to the hotel site to increase the size of the building.
Inside the sign tower, an elevator system capable of lifting workers and equipment has been permanently installed, and catwalks are being placed every 8 feet vertically so that workers will have a foothold for repairs. In addition, a crane is being installed at the top to lift the signs into place.
The positioning of the tower on the east side of the property means that signs attached to its north face will be visible to anyone traveling south on Broadway, because of the setbacks on the building to the north of 47th Street housing the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter financial services company.
With the tower and building combined, Mr. Gladstone said, the project will be able to support 70,000 to 75,000 square feet of signs, the largest such installation in the Times Square area.

HEADLINE: Where Most See Ramparts, North Korea Imagines a Wall

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 7

 BODY:
A North Korean diplomat used a rare news conference here today to rail against a nonexistent 150-mile-long concrete "wall of division" that the South Koreans supposedly erected 20 years ago across the buffer zone between North and South.
The diplomat, Chu Chang Jun, is North Korea's longtime ambassador to China, one of his country's few allies. He demanded the "immediate dismantling of the cursed reinforced concrete wall that artificially bisects the nation that had lived in harmony generation after generation." 
 In a "never to be pardoned criminal act," the wall was erected across the peninsula 20 years ago this Dec. 29, Mr. Chu said. It is "a huge structure," he said, 16 to 26 feet tall and 33 to 62 feet wide at the base. Far from a defensive rampart, it is a "northward invasion bridgehead," he said.
The wall exists only in North Korean propaganda, according to South Korean and American diplomats and others who have visited the area. But with a hostile North Korea keeping large numbers of troops and tanks near the border, the South Koreans, aided by the United States, have strewn large concrete tank barriers and sentry stations as well as fences and minefields along their side of the tense demilitarized zone.
The bitter Korean War of 1950 to 1953 ended with a truce but no treaty, and the buffer zone that divides the peninsula has been volatile ever since.
At the news conference, Mr. Chu gave an implacable summary of North Korean views on relations with the South and its sponsor, the United States. He spoke beneath large pictures of the late North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, and his son, the current leader, Kim Jong Il.
Mr. Chu's comments seemed out of step with diplomatic developments, making the news conference seem even odder. Reeling from years of economic collapse and famine, North Korea seems to be opening its doors a crack in a quest for more economic aid, diplomats say.
North Korea and Japan are seriously discussing a restoration of diplomatic relations. The United States lifted many trade restrictions after North Korea agreed not to carry out a second test of a long-range missile, and talks on improving ties have proceeded fitfully.
South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, has pursued a "sunshine policy" of broader economic and cultural contacts with North Korea, and the North has recently allowed more exchanges. Mr. Chu said, "the sunshine policy brings confrontation instead of reconciliation," and called it "very dangerous."
Mr. Chu also denied reports -- verified by many journalists and diplomats -- that tens of thousands of North Koreans had crossed the border into China to escape famine and hardship. "There have been no illegal border crossings," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Rise a 3rd Day as Inflation Fears Ease

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond yields fell for the third consecutive day yesterday after government reports showed a rise in productivity and a drop in labor costs, easing concern about inflation.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 17/32 , to 991/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.20 percent from 6.24 percent on Monday. 
 The government raised its estimate of growth in third-quarter productivity to a 4.9 percent annual pace, the fastest in almost seven years, from a prior estimate of 4.2 percent. Productivity measures output for each hour worked.
In another report, the Labor Department said unit labor costs for the third quarter declined 0.2 percent, which brought the year-over-year trend to just 1.5 percent, down from 2.3 percent in the second quarter.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management said: "It soothed the market's inflationary concerns at least for the time being and resulted in a further decline in bond yields. However, this drop in bond yields is not likely to last into the first quarter, as investors' inflationary expectations and desired real rate of return will likely push bond yields back up.
"Indeed," Mr. Fine said, "with the economy continuing to grow very strongly, and with the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, the Fed is likely to remain in a tightening mode until it sees definitive signs that economic growth is slowing to a noninflationary pace. While no move is expected at the Dec. 21 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, to ease the transition through Year 2000 concerns, the central bank appears to be on a direct course to raise short-term rates once again during the first quarter of the year 2000."
The government also auctioned $10 billion of a new 52-week bill. They were awarded at a rate of 5.35 percent, which was a bit better than expected, with the bid-to-cover ratio, or the number of bids compared to the total amount being sold, considered decent at 3.21 to 1.
Treasury prices also received a lift in the afternoon after the Federal Reserve Board entered the market to buy long-dated issues, and Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, did not mention monetary policy in a midmorning speech at the Commerce Department.
While daily high came after Mr. Greenspan's speech, most market participants attributed the gains to a "coupon pass" or the purchase of Treasury securities by the Fed, which bought $915 million worth of securities maturing between Aug. 15, 2022, and Nov. 15, 2027.
With trading activity on the decline heading into the end of the year, traders said the Federal Reserve's purchases were enough to lift prices.
"In this thin market it doesn't take much to push the market either way," said Robert Pugliese, a senior vice president and director of fixed income for the J. W. Genesis Financial Corporation in Boca Raton, Fla.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of one-year bills:

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: In Language You Can Understand;
S.E.C. Edict Revives Push to Keep Documents Simple

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A streamlining process designed to add value for consumers of content by reducing their comprehension experience is currently being efforted by public-sector entities and bleeding-edge corporations.
Huh? 
 Both government agencies and some companies are now trying to use clearer, simpler writing than they did in the past.
Ah-ha!
The plain-language movement is enjoying a resurgence, and this time it could have staying power. Disdaining jargon and celebrating short, conversational sentences with active verbs, the latest effort began two years ago when the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered mutual fund companies to rewrite their prospectuses by Dec. 1, 1999. With the help of consultants, the movement has expanded to other government agencies and to companies like Ford Motor and Charles Schwab.
President Clinton instructed federal agencies last year to rewrite by 2002 all documents that the public sees. The Food and Drug Administration this year mandated that labels on over-the-counter drugs be easier to understand by 2005. The S.E.C. is mulling similar rules for two popular financial products sold by insurance companies.
Behind the push is a recognition that new sources of information -- like the Internet, 24-hour cable television and an explosion in junk mail -- have overwhelmed people. "The volume of information that people get and the speed at which they get it has grown exponentially," said Irene A. Etzkorn, an executive vice president at Siegel & Gale, a New York consulting firm. She oversees the division that rips up and rewrites documents.
"If people can't quickly discern information," she added, "they discard it."
Government officials hope their use of simple language will make Americans more likely to trust what they hear from Washington. Marketers, for their part, see a golden opportunity to rise above the cacophony and convince consumers that they should buy a product. Plain English can also help corporate managers explain their company's strategy to employees and thereby increase workplace efficiency.
At its best, simpler writing bolsters revenue and cuts costs. The Veterans Benefits Administration, for example, said it expected to save about $500,000 a year because, after training employees in its life insurance division how to write more clearly, the response rate on one of its letters shot up to 62 percent, from about 35 percent. One telecommunications company, which Ms. Etzkorn declined to identify, came to Siegel & Gale after its confusing bills caused cellular-phone customers to spend an average of 45 minutes a month talking to a service center, she said.
At its worst, the detractors of plain English say that it can dumb down documents, making them less accurate or less useful to the experts who make up much of their audience.
Of course, the debate over sparse language is not new. Aristotle, Renaissance philosophers, the authors William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White and the investor Warren E. Buffett have all weighed in on the topic. Others, including some in the Carter administration, made pushes to encourage plain English that did not stick.
But today's effort is more sustained, partly because it intersects with several economic trends that favor it. Deregulation can cause onetime monopolies like local phone companies to want to communicate with their customers more clearly. And the Internet forces marketers to think about presenting information in catchy new ways.
In fact, the S.E.C.'s ruling on prospectuses has created a cottage industry of plain-language consultants, like Simplify in New York and Firehouse Communications in Malden, Mass., that are seeking to drum up new business by rewriting annual reports, 401(k) statements and financial-services brochures. Siegel & Gale, which pioneered the business almost three decades ago, has seen its document group double in size since 1996. Some big law firms have also tried to become experts in the area.
When the consultants finish with a report, the differences can be stark. Consider Texaco, whose executives began to think more carefully about how they write after hearing about the S.E.C.'s ruling on mutual funds. Many sections of their 1996 annual report -- the last before their plain-language initiative -- appear as a sea of uninterrupted text, highlighted by bureaucratic words (heretofore) and oil-industry jargon (maturing fields).
Try wading through this one: "Texaco's total cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion for the year 1996 reflected strong operational earnings and a net inflow of $375 million, primarily comprised of a cash dividend from Caltex (related to the sale of Caltex' interest in NPRC), proceeds from advanced payments on long-term natural gas sales agreements and the collection of nonrecurring receivables (primarily insurance recoveries relating to environmental matters), which were partially offset by payments related to litigation and other matters."
If you picked up the report, said Joseph DeNardo, a Texaco accountant and one its authors, "you'd want to throw the book out."
The most recent annual report, by contrast, features narrow columns of text, which are easier to read, and short, explanatory sentences. Many sections start with a definition, rather than a string of revenue numbers: "In our upstream business, we explore for, find, produce and sell crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas." The first sentence of the letter from Peter I. Bijur, the company's chairman, contains 15 words, down from 51 two years ago -- despite the hard times for the oil industry that might have given him reason to obfuscate Texaco's 78 percent decline in net income.
Making such changes is not easy, however. "People think it's like a translation, that you turn big words into small words. That's not it at all," said William M. Lutz, an English professor at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J., and perhaps the most famous plain-language advocate today. He has his own consulting business and earlier this year published "Doublespeak Defined" (HarperCollins, 1999), a dictionary of jargon.
Recently, Professor Lutz joined two Postal Service employees at the agency's headquarters in Washington to make final changes in its annual report. They had sent a rough draft to 40 of the agency's top officials and were now squirreled away in a cubicle the size of a conference room, surrounded by Thanksgiving leftovers and McDonald's wrappers, scribbling away and dodging yet more bureaucratic bullets. Colleagues kept stopping to drop off their own suggestions. One manager debated which preposition to use in one sentence. Their intentions were usually good, said R. Timothy MacDonald, one of the writers, but convoluted language crept in.
"People say, 'You have to be perfect and exact and include every little nuance,' " Mr. MacDonald said. "Finally, you've got this beast." So he and a colleague, alongside Professor Lutz, sifted through every comment, at one point wrangling for 20 minutes over a single sentence. Professor Lutz left at 7 p.m. to take a train to Philadelphia so he could teach a class the next day. Mr. MacDonald stayed at the office until 1:30 a.m.
Nobody will confuse the final product with an E. B. White essay, but the emphasis on simplicity is apparent throughout the report. It uses "we" and "our," rather than "the Service" and "U.S.P.S.'s." The section on transportation is only 27 lines, down from 42 last year, because many of the statistics that had previously appeared in long-winded sentences are now part of a small chart.
Such struggles are common, particularly because the changes often involve blunt criticism. "There was a tremendous objection to this at the beginning," Mr. DeNardo of Texaco said. Almost three years later, though, the practice has become ingrained, and some managers use plain language even in internal memos, he added.
Similar changes have happened at Schwab and at American Century Investments, both of which have simplified many documents besides prospectuses. When employees "saw we could do this with something as complicated as a prospectus, there was a shift in perspective," said Roberta Laughlin, American Century's manager for education and guidance. "It's almost a mantra now."
Plain-language advocates hope they can next persuade phone and cable companies to simplify their materials as they begin competing with one another. Already, AT&T has hired Siegel & Gale to design monthly bills that the company sends separately from local phone companies.
But with a few notable exceptions -- among them the annual report by Texaco and sales and leasing contracts for Ford cars -- plain language is not yet common outside of the government and the financial services industry. Even in finance, said Paula R. David, the director of client marketing at the Boston consulting firm, Funds Distributor Inc., "We had expected the industry to embrace this more than it did."
"The majority decided merely to comply" with the S.E.C. rules rather than rewrite all of their documents, Ms. David said.
The language mavens say that raises a disquieting question, particularly in the ninth year of an economic expansion: If a recession comes, will companies decide that cutting consulting costs is more important than cutting words?

HEADLINE: Productivity Grew Sharply In 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Worker productivity grew at a faster pace in the third quarter than originally estimated and labor costs fell for the first time in more than two years, government figures released today showed.
Productivity -- an index of output per hour worked -- rose at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter, up from initial reports of a 4.2 percent increase, the Labor Department said today. That follows a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter and is the biggest gain in almost seven years. 
 "We're in the midst of a significant productivity surge that's of a long-run nature," Robert Parry, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said today.
The higher revision for productivity follows a higher estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product by the Commerce Department. Last month, the government revised G.D.P. for that quarter to show a 5.5 percent annual rate of increase, previously estimated at 4.8 percent.
Unit labor costs -- a measure of worker compensation tied to shifts in productivity -- fell at a rate of two-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter after rising 4.2 percent in the second, the Labor Department said.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said borrowing by consumers grew at a slower-than-expected $4.2 billion in October as shoppers cut back on credit card purchases for the first time in almost a year.
"People were fine-tuning their debt and getting ready to spend big time during the holidays," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM MoneyWatch in New York.
After languishing at about 1 percent a year in the 1970's and 1980's, productivity growth in all businesses has been more than 2.5 percent in the last three years. Higher productivity helps companies raise profits while containing labor costs, which account for about two-thirds of all business expenses.
Productivity is on track to match last year's 2.8 percent gain, which would be the best two-year showing since 1991 and 1992. It would also be the fourth consecutive year that productivity has grown more than 2 percent; the last time that happened was 1961 to 1966.
Compared with the quarter a year earlier, productivity was 3.1 percent higher. Productivity growth close to 3 percent "will allow real earnings of employees to increase at the fastest rate in a generation, thus helping to support strong consumer and economic growth," said Joseph Liro, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
