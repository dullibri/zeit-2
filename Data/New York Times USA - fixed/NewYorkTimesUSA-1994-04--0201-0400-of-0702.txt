HEADLINE: Cost of Malpractice: A Special Report;
Medical Incompetence: A Whispered Factor in Rising Costs

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, April 5

 BODY:
When John L. Rounsaville Jr., a 44-year-old father of three, checked into a hospital here for routine lower-back surgery, he expected to be released within a day or so and be back at work soon after that. But when he did get out, almost six months later, he was strapped in a wheelchair.
Mr. Rounsaville, who was a rising executive with a Texas military contractor, had suffered catastrophic damage to the brain and the nervous system. He had lost virtually all control of his body, rendering him unemployable and in need of round-the-clock nursing care for the rest of his life. Every day, he had to take as many as 74 pills just to control the seizures. 
 Mr. Rounsaville's operation, at the Fort Worth Osteopathic Medical Center in 1985, was not just the beginning of medical and personal disasters, but legal and financial ones as well. It was nearly five years before a jury concluded, according to the court judgment, that "an incompetent anesthesiologist," Dr. Garry E. Winn, had injected Mr. Rounsaville with 10 to 20 times the recommended dose of a sedative.
After hearing evidence that several of Dr. Winn's colleagues had let him continue to practice even though they knew he had problems -- he had physical disabilities related to a stroke and he admitted drinking a pint to a pint and a half of vodka a day -- the jury further found the hospital and some of its top officials negligent as well.
The jury awarded Mr. Rounsaville and his family $13.6 million.
With the White House and Congress struggling with proposals to overhaul the nation's health care system, Mr. Rounsaville's case illustrates one reason health costs have risen so rapidly. Yet nothing in the Clinton health plan, nor the alternatives, directly addresses the problem of incompetent and negligent doctors.
"Nowhere in the Clinton plan do we see any ongoing monitoring of quality problems," said Andrew Webber, head of the American Medical Peer Review Association. "Clearly, bad medicine increases costs."
 
Ruining Lives, Costing Billions
 Most Americans receive medical care of high quality, perhaps the best in the world. Still, medicine, like every profession, has its share of negligent, even incompetent, practitioners. And as Mr. Rounsaville's case shows, their errors not only can ruin lives; they can be almost uncalculably expensive.
One Harvard University study suggests that tens of thousands of people die every year as a result of medical incompetence; hundreds of thousands of others suffer grievous injury. And though no one has tallied the costs of all this, experts agree that tens of billions of dollars are involved.
The hospital and insurance carriers paid most of the $13.7 million final settlement in the Rounsaville case. In Texas, as in the rest of the nation, those costs are generally passed on through hospital and doctor bills and insurance premiums, increasing health costs for everyone.
Several studies involving thousands of medical records have shown that as many as 99 of every 100 hospital patients generally receive adequate care. But with about 30 million hospital admissions a year, even 1 percent represents 300,000 cases of negligent care, more than 800 every day.
The Harvard study, published in 1991, showed that in one year in New York State, documented negligent care injured more than 27,000 people, killing 7,000 of them.
Each one of these cases can be a personal disaster. As Mr. Rounsaville's lawyer, Darrell L. Keith, said at the trial: "On April 23d, 1985, John's participation in the real, living, breathing, American dream and that of his family turned into a nightmare. And the nightmare continues."
While this case was extreme, it is hardly unique. A review of hundreds of malpractice lawsuits and state disciplinary actions against doctors in Texas over the last five years disclosed many more horror stories.
Among them was a doctor who ran a licensed weight-loss clinic in East Texas and was found to have given his clients weed killer and rat poison, causing severe intestinal injuries. Another doctor admitted to vision problems during a botched stomach operation, but he defended himself by saying good surgery was "just like making love" -- if you know what you're doing, you can can do it in the dark.
 
The Problem
Failures to Report The Incompetent
An incompetent physician can face discipline from several sources. The hospital where the doctor works can revoke his right to practice there, but that seldom happens. The responsibility falls to the hospital medical staff, the doctor's colleagues, and they often do not act, either out of fear of being sued or simply because they do not want to hurt a friend.
Every state also has a medical board charged with ferreting out incompetent doctors and disciplining them or revoking their licenses. But most hospitals seldom share their problems with the medical board. And many boards do not have the power to act or the money to investigate accusations of malpractice.
Nationwide, state medical boards took 2,971 disciplinary actions in 1992, according to figures compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards, a private group. With 623,378 licensed doctors, that means there were 5 such actions for every 1,000 doctors, leading many critics to argue that there is no way that 99.5 percent of the nation's doctors qualify to escape any censure.
In Dr. Winn's case, some doctors had complained about his diminishing mental faculties before Mr. Rounsaville's operation; several had refused to work with him. Still, they made no effort to curtail his operating room privileges, nor did they alert the Texas Board of Medical Examiners.
Mr. Rounsaville's wife, Sandra, recalls that she never had the slightest thought of questioning a doctor's credentials. She had never met Dr. Winn.
"If you're going to have your car repaired, you want to know if someone has messed up cars before," she said. "You can call the Better Business Bureau and find out if there's a complaint lodged against them. With this hospital, I feel I was naive. I just assumed they were the ones who would be the watchdogs over their doctors."
 
The Operation
Routine Surgery Goes Awry
 The operation for Mr. Rounsaville's back problem, a ruptured disc, is not an easy procedure, but it is generally not life-threatening. What happened to Mr. Rounsaville was a result of Dr. Winn's mistake: that is conceded by the hospital administration, the surgeon who performed the operation and Dr. Winn's former anesthesiology partners.
The only person who asserted that Dr. Winn had acted properly was Dr. Winn himself. He gave a deposition in July 1986 while on a day-pass from an alcohol rehabilitation center. He later declined to attend his own trial.
What happened during the operation, according to court records, was that Dr. Winn gave Mr. Rounsaville a massive injection of sufentanil citrate, also known as sufenta, an artificial sedative that is roughly a hundred times more powerful than morphine. There were indications that Dr. Winn may have confused the drug with a less potent cousin, fantynyl, and that he may simply have injected what would have been a proper dose of that drug.
Even that mistake might not have been catastrophic, doctors say, if Dr. Winn had connected Mr. Rounsaville to a ventilating tube. That would have provided a continuous supply of oxygen and controlled his respiration.
But Dr. Winn did not use the tube when the operation began or as it proceeded, when, according to the attending nurse's clinical notes, the patient began to appear "cyanotic" (he was turning blue) and "apneic" (he was not breathing).
The chief surgeon, Dr. Christopher Hull, testified that as soon as these problems became apparent, he asked for directions from Dr. Winn, who said that it they waited a few minutes, Mr. Rounsaville would resume normal breathing. The surgeon quickly overruled him, and Mr. Rounsaville was hooked to a ventilating tube.
 
Dr. Winn's Memory Lapse
 As these critical moments elapsed -- just two or three minutes, said Dr. Winn, but as many as 12, said the nurse's notes -- Mr. Rounsaville apparently suffered irreversible brain damage. He was unconscious as he was wheeled out of the operating room. Later that day he began experiencing severe seizures.
In his deposition, Dr. Winn said he could not recall just how much sufenta he had given Mr. Rounsaville that day. Shown a black check mark on his medical notes that indicated that he had given Mr. Rounsaville two milliliters -- at least 10 times the normal dose -- he shook his head and said, "I have no idea how that, how that little mark got there."
Mrs. Rounsaville says she will never forget Dr. Winn's face as he came out of the operating room. "He looked real bad, real grim," she recalled.
The supervisory officials at the hospital told her that her husband was in bad shape. But, she said, "They were trying to blame it on his reaction to different things." It was not until months later that Mrs. Rounsaville discovered the problem had been Dr. Winn.
 
The Insiders
Who Knows And Who Tells
 "It's so clear what happened," concedes Earl Harcrow, then a lawyer for the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Thomas J. Trese, and now a lawyer for the hospital, which has changed its name to the Osteopathic Medical Center of Texas. "The man got 10 times more of a drug than he should have."
But what became a very complex issue at the trial was whether the hospital and the people who worked with Dr. Winn had reason to believe he might commit such an egregious mistake.
The jury found that many of them should have anticipated such a problem, sending a clear message that the whole episode represented a failure in the peer-review process that most members of the public expect to be standard at a major hospital.
Dr. Winn, a 1964 graduate of the Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine in Kirksville, Mo., was involved in a serious auto accident in 1968 and had two seizures in the hospital. In 1982, he suffered a stroke, which left him with weakness in his right limbs and temporarily unable to speak. He had always been blind in one eye.
After the stroke, he said in his deposition, he "underwent intensive physical therapy and had about a 95 percent recovery." He returned to practice in Fort Worth.
No problems were reported at first. But by the summer of 1984, nearly a full year before the operation that crippled Mr. Rounsaville, some of his colleagues had begun to believe that something was amiss with Dr. Winn, and at least three of them announced that they would no longer work with him.
His two partners in anesthesiology, Gary L. Neisler and Kenneth C. Ponitz, both testified that surgeons had given them no reason to believe that the complaints had stemmed from questions about Dr. Winn's competence.
"The complaints from the surgeons weren't, 'This is what's wrong,' " Dr. Ponitz testified. "They were vague. They almost made it sound like a personality thing."
Still, by December 1984, enough concerns had been raised that the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Trese, sent Dr. Winn to Columbia University Medical Center in New York for a full neurological evaluation.
In his patient notes, the New York neurologist who saw Dr. Winn, Dr. J. P. Mohr, wrote that Dr. Trese "gave me to understand" that Dr. Winn "has been thought to have failing mental powers and has been somewhat inattentive and unreliable as an anesthesiologist to the degree that several surgeons have expressed concern about his professional competence."
At the trial, Dr. Trese adamantly denied that he had made such an explicit statement.
 
Artery Blockage Is Found
 Dr. Winn was found to have a blockage of the carotid artery that could hamper the blood flow to the brain. But the examination was inconclusive, and Dr. Mohr recommended that Dr. Winn return for more tests. When he got back to Fort Worth, however, Dr. Winn told his colleagues that he had been given "a clean bill of health." He continued to practice without restriction.
Less than two months later, Dr. Winn was the anesthesiologist for a severely diabetic 36-year-old woman, identified at the trial only as Jane Doe. She suffered a loss of oxygen and respiratory arrest during the operation and died. Dr. Winn had had problems during the operation, according to trial testimony. At one point, asked by surgeons for a heart rate, he told them he could not give it because he had forgotten to plug in the heart monitor.
There was confusion about just what had gone wrong. Some of Dr. Winn's colleagues argued that the woman was going to die in any event.
The surgeons who operated on Jane Doe told the chairman of the hospital's anesthesiology department that they would never work with Dr. Winn again. And a few days later, both Dr. Ponitz and Dr. Neisler confronted Dr. Winn and demanded that he leave their partnership.
He did so, but as both anesthesiologists acknowledged at the trial, they were concerned about a threat that Dr. Winn had made. They said he had vowed to sue them for slander if they moved to have his medical privileges revoked. Nothing more was done, and on April 23, 1985, when Sandra Rounsaville kissed her husband minutes before he was wheeled into the operating room, she had no idea about Dr. Winn's background.
 
The Future
A Plan to Let The Public Know
 After the operation, the hospital ordered Dr. Winn back to New York for another examination. The tests indicated that the stroke had brought "increasing compromise in cognitive functioning."
Later that spring Dr. Winn underwent surgery on his carotid artery. He was allowed to return to work, though a team of fellow anesthesiologists monitored him in the operating room. They reported significant deficiencies in his skills and poor evaluations of patients. Before long, Dr. Winn resigned.
A few months later he checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center. After his release he applied for and received general practitioner privileges at his old hospital, meaning he could treat hospital patients though he was no longer allowed to work in the operating room.
 
Stroke Ends Doctor's Life
 But he never practiced at the hospital again; he took a job at a medical clinic near the Mexican border. Soon afterward he suffered a stroke and died in 1989.
Through all this, Mr. Rounsaville's case attracted little notice in Fort Worth, though one doctor's trade journal, Medical Economics, succinctly characterized the lesson for doctors: "The perils of taking action against an allegedly incompetent colleague are well known. This case illustrates that the cost of doing nothing can also be very high."
The Clinton health plan does offer one new source of information for patients. The Administration wants the Federal Practitioners Data Bank opened to the public. Created in 1990, it is a list of 32,000 doctors and dentists sued for malpractice or disciplined by state medical boards. Now, the public has no access to the data. Consumer groups support the step, but the American Medical Association bitterly fought the creation of the data base and now argues that it should not be opened to the public.
Today, Mr. Rounsaville spends his days in a bed or in a wheelchair, though he does get out of the house three times a week for physical therapy sessions.
"Sometimes I look at him," Mrs. Rounsaville said, "and it still doesn't make any sense at all to me. This was a perfectly healthy person going in for routine surgery. I felt we had been robbed of what I always dreamed of for our family."

HEADLINE: Commission Urges Curbing Pay in New Jersey Schools

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 8

 BODY:
The hand-picked advisory panel that reported to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman on Thursday was ostensibly concerned with achieving educational parity for New Jersey's poorest school districts. But underlying the panel's recommendations, its members say, was the desire to apply the brakes to ever-rising salaries and benefits in the country's most expensive public-education system.
Even if their recommendations are watered down, the panel members made it clear in their comments that controlling school costs would require fewer teachers, fewer administrators and more bare-knuckled bargaining over wages and benefits from school boards that until now have been more willing to pay than to fight. 
 Dr. Saul Cooperman, the former Education Commissioner who headed the task force, said as much on Thursday. After recommending to the Governor that budget increases for most districts be limited to the inflation rate, and that districts be required to pay most of the $1 billion a year in teacher-retirement benefits now carried by the state, Dr. Cooperman was asked how the local districts would pay for these burdens.
"I remember when I was a teacher, the teacher-pupil ratio was 1 to 35 and we were fighting for 1 to 25," Dr. Cooperman replied. "Now in some places it's one to 15 or one to 17. So maybe class size is going to have to go up three or four pupils, maybe some extra administrators are not going to be there anymore, maybe some things are going to have to be consolidated."
A member of the commission, speaking on condition of anonymity today, put it more bluntly:
"What's been happening in this state is that for a long time, big money has been flowing down, and everybody got what they wanted. You have elementary schools with 400 kids with the same number of teachers that were there when they had 600. You have high schools with 500 kids with the same number of teachers as when there were 1,000 in there. Now the money is running out, New Jersey is still in recession, and the state is not a cash machine anymore."
Some commission members argued forcefully for the panel to recommend still stronger cost-containment measures, including mandatory consolidation of underused schools.
They said Dr. Cooperman restrained the budget-cutting sentiment to keep the recommendations within the panel's mandate, which was to find how to comply with a court order that spending per pupil in poor districts be brought closer to the level of rich ones.
"It is no secret that I favored making some additional recommendations," said Harold J. Raveche, the president of Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken. "We are the highest-spending state per pupil in the U.S., and yet nowhere can I find that we rank anywhere higher than 12th in math exams. We have over 500 school districts and there are economies of scale to be had from combining school districts, for example, but the response was that it really wasn't in our charge."
Even by questioning a decade's worth of steadily increasing personnel costs, the panel provided Governor Whitman with the political cover she needed to carry through her promise to change major aspects of the state school system, several members of the panel said.
"This state devotes a massive amount of its budget to education, the amount is still growing, and there are parts of that spending, like pensions and Social Security, that are potentially out of control," said David Rand, a Morristown lawyer whose law firm specializes in serving school districts.
 
'Wait a Minute, Guys'
 By making local school boards responsible for retirement benefits, which are linked to wages, Mr. Rand said, board negotiators will be less willing to grant excessive wage increases. New Jersey teachers are the highest paid in the country, making an average of $42,500 per year; the national average is $34,900.
"We are paying teachers $65,000 in the north part of the state," Dr. Cooperman said today. "In small districts, elementary principals are making $80,000 or $85,000; high-school principals are making $100,000, and superintendents $125,000. I say, 'Hey, wait a minute, guys: You get tenure, you get great benefits and great working conditions. Maybe $65,000 for 180 days' work is adequate now.' "
The State Supreme Court has ruled that because school districts rely on property tax revenues for most of their funds, children in tax-poor districts are unconstitutionally discriminated against. The previous Governor, Jim Florio, tried to narrow the gap by feeding large amounts of extra state aid to the poor districts while limiting increases in spending by rich ones.
The commission worked by consensus rather than majority vote, which made it possible for Dr. Cooperman to deflect some members' opposition to the proposed cutbacks and to mold a report.
The consensual approach may have been by design on Governor Whitman's part. She noted on Thursday that a second high-level commission, headed by Albert Burstein, a Hackensack lawyer and former State Assemblyman, and studying the same financing issues, had been working for a year, and was supposed to deliver its recommendations last November, a month before the Cooperman panel was formed.
But the Burstein commission, which is operating by majority rule, has failed twice to agree on a program of controlling costs and raising financing for poor districts. It is torn between a faction led by Mr. Burstein, which favors an approach similar to the Cooperman recommendations, and one led by the state teachers' union president, which calls for a doubling of state aid to school districts.

HEADLINE: Feeling Poorer and Spending Less

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 8

 BODY:
The American economy will grow somewhat less rapidly this year and next if stock and bond prices do not recover from their recent plunge, Administration officials and some private economists said today.
They cite higher interest rates, which discourage companies and individuals from borrowing and spending money. Moreover, they cite the so-called wealth effect: many American consumers will likely spend less money if they feel poorer because of the shrinkage of their portfolios. 
 After running various computer simulations of the economy, President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers has concluded that if the stock market falls 10 percent below its peak in early February and stays down, this will gradually knock four-tenths of a percentage point off the nation's expected annual economic output, reducing it by about $26 billion. Growth is now running a little over 3 percent. The stock market is currently trading about 7 percent below its peak.
"There is a wealth effect; it's a relatively small effect but it does require a sustained, that is, long-term reduction in the value of stocks," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers. But the braking effect of a falling stock market and rising interest rates on the economy may be hard to notice, if, as may well be the case, it is offset by the economy's generally growing strength. A survey this week of prominent economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found that their consensus forecast of economic growth this year had actually risen, to 3.7 percent from a 3.6 percent forecast in early March.
Lehman Brothers, the New York investment firm, estimated that the wealth effect from the stock market's recent retreat would reduce economic growth by only two-tenths of a percentage point if the stock market stayed 10 percent below its peak. But when bond market losses and the economy-slowing effects of higher interest rates are included in the calculation, the harm to American economic output grows to five-tenths of a percentage point this year and seven-tenths to eight-tenths of a percentage point next year, said Allen Sinai, Lehman's chief economist.
The key question, Ms. Tyson and other economists said, is not how deeply the stock market has fallen but how long it will stay down. The reason is that consumers appear to be very slow in revising their spending plans in response to financial losses.
Nobody knows how long the stock market will take to recover from last month's selloff. Mr. Sinai said that he expected the market to recover soon because the overall economy remained strong.
But Mr. Sinai added that he expected interest rates to stay up. As a result, Lehman Brothers has just revised downward its projections of economic growth, but not drastically, he said. Mr. Sinai revised his forecast down to 3.4 or 3.5 percent growth this year from a 3.7 percent forecast a month ago, and revised his forecast for next year down to 3 percent from 3.4 percent.
When the stock market crashed in 1987, many doomsayers predicted that the economy would be severely damaged. They were proved wrong, since the economy grew 3.9 percent in 1988, a rate not equaled for any year since then.
That striking miscalculation set off strong criticisms of the wealth effect theory at universities. The effect now is "something that's not emphasized by academic economists but is emphasized by economic forecasters," said Laurence M. Ball, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University.
Forecasters are quick to defend their continued reliance on the wealth effect, saying that it plays a limited role in their computer simulations and helps improve the accuracy of their predictions. They contend that when the Fed lowered interest rates after the 1987 crash, the resulting stimulus to the economy outweighed consumers' losses on stocks.
 
A Dwindling Role
 Yet the wealth effect also plays a dwindling role in forecasters' calculations. Mr. Sinai, who specializes in the effects of financial markets on the real economy, said his model now assumed that consumer spending would drop by only 3 cents for every dollar of decline in the value of financial assets.
Before 1987, the model assumed that for each dollar of losses, consumer spending declined by a nickel. The Council of Economic Advisers' model still assumes that the effect is a nickel for each dollar. But other economic forecasters place less emphasis on the wealth effect.
Christopher Probyn, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, said that for reasons that were not quite clear, the wealth effect may have been slightly more important in the last several years than before 1987.
Mr. Probyn's statistical analysis today showed that each dollar of losses produced a penny drop in consumer spending from 1961 to 1987 but nearly a two-penny drop since 1987.
Some economic policy makers are dubious of such calculations. Susan M. Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor who is one of the Fed's experts on the workings of financial markets, said in an interview last week that she was skeptical of precise estimates showing how many percentage points economic growth might decline after a stock market selloff.
"I wouldn't put the fine point on it of being able to estimate it within a quarter of a point," she said.
But Ms. Phillips did express concern that the fall in financial markets might prompt many households to review their heavy debt burdens and cut back on consumer spending. High household debt and a low savings rate are more of a problem than fluctuations in the financial markets, she said.
Also at issue is whether many investors ever based their personal spending levels on the bond market peak in October, when interest rates fell to historical lows, or the stock market peak two months ago.
Many investors do not seem to include their most recent investment gains in deciding whether to buy a new car or house, making decisions based on their wealth over recent years, said Harvey Rosenblum, a senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. "A lot of people don't think it's permanent" when the market spurts upward, he said.
Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Bush Administration, agreed. "Yes, there is a wealth effect, but most household don't mark their portfolio to market every day," he said. "Most people have more of a gradual adjustment."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Unit Trusts May Appeal To Fretful Bond Buyers

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
FOR municipal bond owners who have turned timid, there's a belt-and-suspenders investment worth considering: fixed portfolios known as unit investment trusts.
When tax-free bond funds dropped 5.3 percent in the first quarter -- a bigger drubbing than any other major fund category -- investors accustomed to a buoyant bond market may have recalled a long-ago lesson. In the words of Marysue Wechsler, a Greenbelt, Md., planner: "Bonds are not meant to be traded as growth vehicles. They're used for income as stocks go up and down." 
 From that premise flows much advice for now-numb bondholders. Shorten bond maturities to preserve principal and to have a crack at higher yields if rates continue to rise. Go to cash for safety; rates on money markets are edging up. And use stocks, not bonds, for growth.
Another suggestion is to "buy and hold" bonds. The investor receives the stated interest periodically, plus the principal upon maturity, and the intervening ups and downs of interest rates do not matter.
But "buy and hold" can be hard to do. By definition, bond mutual funds never mature because their managers are always trading; investors may or may not get their principal back when they cash in. And while investors can hold individual bonds to maturity, they will need about $50,000 to diversify adequately.
Enter the unit trust, with both definite maturities and low minimums.
Long viewed as stodgy investments, unit trusts are fixed bundles of either tax-free bonds, taxable bonds or equities. The tax-free types represent about 80 percent of the $100 billion industry -- a share not likely to drop as investors react to the new, higher tax rates. In April, "we usually see a 25 percent jump in monthly sales," said Ron Toupin, chief manager for unit trusts at John Nuveen & Company in Chicago. "This year, it's about 40 percent." Single-state issues for high-tax states are very popular.
Offered in short, intermediate and long-term maturities, the trusts typically require a $5,000 investment. About 75 percent of all unit trusts are packaged by three firms -- Nuveen, Van Kampen Merritt in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., and a syndicate of brokers led by Merrill Lynch.
The trusts are sold by brokers for federally regulated fees ranging from 2 percent to nearly 5 percent. At Nuveen, a $10,000 investment in a 3-year unit trust carries a 2.5 percent charge, while a $150,000 investment in a 25-year trust goes for 4.5 percent. The bigger the buy, and the shorter the trust's term, the lower the rate. Trusts also carry a small yearly administrative fee, about 0.15 percent.
What do investors get in return? Like funds, unit trusts are professionally assembled portfolios available for low minimums. And they offer diversity. "Our New York portfolio has general obligation bonds, water and sewer bonds, hospital bonds and housing bonds," said Jack Tierney, vice president at Van Kampen Merritt.
But, unlike funds, trusts give the "buy and hold" investor stable dividends and the assured return of principal upon maturity. (Investors can cash in early, but they run market risk and the risk of not finding a buyer in a thin secondary market.)
A sure income "makes the trusts appealing to older people" and enables investors "to match the payouts to regular obligations," like rent or alimony, said Paul Williams, Nuveen's research director.
But safety has its costs. One is the sales charge -- which brokers will often combine with the trust price in one figure. "Some people don't realize they paid a load," said John Markese of the American Association of Individual Investors.
Missed opportunities are another cost. Through active trading, bond-fund managers profited in recent years as interest rates declined and bond prices soared. But trust investors, with a fixed portfolio, missed out. Nor could they reinvest dividends to profit from market conditions.
The people who monitor unmanaged portfolios may be less vigilant about trouble, too. "Many trusts held 'Whoops' bonds" in 1983, Mr. Markese said, referring to the $2.25 billion default of Washington State utility debt. In contrast, many fund managers saw trouble coming and sold. Critics add that inferior bonds, hard to sell alone, often pop up in trusts.
How do unit trusts stack up against mutual funds in costs? To find out, trust investors should amortize the sales charge of the trust over its life, adding in the trust's minimal yearly fee. This number can be compared to the annual expense ratio of a municipal-bond fund, which is 0.86 percent on average, according to Lipper Analytical Services. If a fund has a load, that charge must also be included.
With front-end loads and light yearly fees, trusts get cheaper the longer one holds. For a bit over four years, the average no-load fund is less costly than a trust with a 3 percent load; after that, the trust is cheaper.
Insurance, available on most trusts, will blunt any default dangers, Mr. Tierney said. But the feature costs up to one-quarter point in yield.
As for missed market opportunities, they are inevitable for "buy and hold" investors. But packagers know they will not want to tie up money for long if rates drop and yields climb. Thus, shorter-term trusts are more common, and some trusts stagger maturities, giving investors a chance to reinvest at better yields.

HEADLINE: TAXES;
Business Owners Get Break on Health Plans

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
OWNERS of small businesses who are struggling with rising health care costs just got a good reason to put their spouses on the payroll. The Internal Revenue Service will now permit such couples to pay all their family medical expenses with pretax dollars.
By putting a spouse on the payroll and setting up a medical plan, business owners have been able to reimburse their employed spouses for medical costs with pretax money. But these medical plans applied only to employees, leaving the business owners out in the cold. 
 In March, a consultant who operates as a sole proprietor and employs his spouse asked the I.R.S. if his business could set up a tax-deductible medical plan. In a tax advice memorandum, the I.R.S. responded favorably, saying an owner who employs a spouse can be covered as a family member under the employee medical plan.
The new interpretation "is a real benefit for the closely held small business," said Nadine Gordon Lee, tax partner with the accounting firm of Ernst & Young, in New York.
To take full advantage of the I.R.S.'s new position, the proprietor of a business can create a plan to reimburse employees for health insurance and other medical expenses and then deduct those payments as a business expense. As an employee, the business owner's spouse is reimbursed for family medical expenses by the company. Those payments are not taxable income.
"In the past, we used to recommend incorporating closely held businesses to take advantage of medical plans," Ms. Lee said. "But that's not necessary anymore."
Despite the tax advantage of incorporating, many self-employed people have resisted because of the complexity and the cost of paying corporate taxes. Contract workers, freelancers and other business owners who were not incorporated in 1993 could deduct just 25 percent of their medical insurance premiums.
The incentive to put a spouse on the payroll is now strong. In many businesses, husbands or wives already help out on a volunteer basis. Simply paying them a salary and setting up a medical plan for employees could save a family a few thousand dollars.
Certain restrictions apply to medical payment plans. The spouse must be a bona fide employee, doing work on a regular basis that the company would otherwise pay someone else to do. Answering the telephone occasionally is not enough. But someone who acts as office manager, handling paperwork and telephones and dealing with clients, should qualify.
The medical plan must cover nearly all employees, not just the spouse. A short document should describe who and what is covered, and the plan's terms communicated to employees.
And the spouse's salary must be reasonable. Because most married couples file joint returns, shifting some money from profits on the business owner's Schedule C to the spouse as salary usually makes little difference in taxes owed.
An added benefit of putting a family member on the payroll is that a spouse who earns at least $2,000 may contribute to an individual retirement account. The contribution might even qualify for an immediate tax deduction, depending on total family income.
But payroll taxes should not be overlooked. When your spouse is formally employed, you will owe Social Security and Medicare taxes of 15.3 percent of income up to $60,600, 2.9 percent for income above that amount and unemployment taxes. "Depending on the family's medical costs, it might be worth it," Ms. Lee said.
If the business owner earns much less than $60,600, shifting some money to the spouse as an employee will probably not result in higher taxes for people who file joint returns, Ms. Lee said. If the business owner earns considerably more, the family medical costs would need to be $7,000 to $8,000 to justify putting the spouse on the payroll at, say $20,000, she said.
The I.R.S. issued its opinion in the form of a tax advice memorandum. Although the memo is not as firm as a ruling, you will not incur penalties if the agency changes its mind someday. The agency could then collect only the unpaid taxes and interest.

HEADLINE: Arming Pakistan Doesn't Promote Peace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Disarming the Subcontinent" (editorial, March 29), you seem to contend that resumption of arms sales to Pakistan under certain conditions would actually be a step toward disarming the subcontinent. 
 It is not clear to us how doubling the number of F-16's that Pakistan possesses will help promote disarmament in South Asia. Will not such a step be against every declared United States policy goal in South Asia? Not only with regard to proliferation, but also those aimed at reducing tensions between India and Pakistan, promoting a bilateral dialogue between the two countries, preventing an arms race in the region and strengthening democracy there.
If nonproliferation is the objective, why give Pakistan high-performance aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons? Why say that even if the Pressler amendment is repealed, Pressler standards will apply, and then almost in the same breath seek a one-time lifting of the amendment to facilitate arms supplies?
After having given 40 F-16's to Pakistan as a reward for assurances that it will not go nuclear, why should the United States now give it almost an equal number of F-16's as a reward for having gone nuclear?
What is the rationale for the United States to aggravate India's security concerns in a big way while at the same time pressing India to lower its security guard?
India has taken steps in recent months to engage the United States on nonproliferation issues. Last November we co-sponsored with the United States a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly on two key elements of the Clinton Administration's nonproliferation initiative, namely, a complete test ban and cessation of production of fissile material for weapons purposes.
We have had three rounds of talks with the United States on nonproliferation and security matters, which both sides have found productive. At the last round, last September, it was agreed to move on to broader dialogue, and talks on participants and agenda are continuing. Last January we made two major proposals to Pakistan with a view to building mutual confidence. We have proposed that our agreement not to attack each other's nuclear installations be extended to economic targets and population centers (this refers to your concern that India and Pakistan might strike at each other's cities).
We have also proposed that both sides agree on no first-use or use at any time of nuclear potentials against each other. Then why this proposal now?

HEADLINE: We'd Better Sign On To Law of the Sea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Safire is all wet about the international Law of the Sea (column, March 31). This vast treaty does indeed take the oceans as the common heritage of mankind and sets rules for all countries on offshore territorial limits, rights of naval and maritime passage, protection of the marine environment and safeguarding of fisheries. All of these reflect American interests. While Mr. Safire breezily takes these provisions for granted as "unobjectionable," they were contentious subjects of negotiation. 
 What the United States acknowledged in return was a common interest in the mineral resources beneath the high seas. This is no more alien a notion than American insistence on public rights to minerals on Federal lands or offshore oil. The Law of the Sea does, to be sure, provide a rigid framework for sharing the proceeds from private extraction of mineral wealth, but this is precisely the area where the Clinton Administration has won the assent of developing countries to more workable rules.
It is not surprising that mining companies would prefer to throw the Law of the Sea overboard to maximize their own economic interest. But a President who, at their behest, would ignore the country's broader interests from the environment and the Navy to commercial shipping and fishing would be little more than their shill. Clinton Administration negotiators have struck a good balance.
And just in time. What Mr. Safire ignores is that the Law of the Sea has the 60 ratifications needed and will take effect next fall -- with or without the United States. Americans need Washington to be part of the policy-making as the Law of the Sea is put into effect.

HEADLINE: How Norfolk, Va., Put Workfare to Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Can Workfare Work?" (editorial, March 19) points out that there is nothing easy about transforming welfare into workfare: "A program that appears nearly without cost quickly turns expensive, which is why local governments that start workfare often slip back into simply mailing welfare checks." 
 This has not been the experience of Norfolk, Va. In the last year and a half, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Economic Development put into effect a six-week, 120-hour training program that is matched with Norfolk companies and public organizations ready and willing to hire permanent workers.
This partnership between divergent departments has worked, and the budget has been minimal. Look at these figures: a total cost of $87,842; a success rate of more than 47 percent; a bottom line total of $1,514.52 per job!
"Can Workfare Work?" Here is how one of our jobs program graduates, formerly on welfare, answers that question: "As a welfare mother of five, I've been part of lots of programs, a lot of 'good talk,' but nothing happened, and I'd given up . . . now I'm employed and self supporting . . . and there's no telling where I can go now!"

The Economy
 
The United States economy will grow less rapidly this year and next if stock and bond prices do not recover from their plunge, experts say, in large part because of the so-called wealth effect: many American consumers are likely to spend less money if they feel poorer because their portfolios have been reduced in value. [Page 37.]
 
A Federal Reserve official denied that the Fed's policy makers had limited the leeway of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, in changing interest rates. [46.]
 
 
Markets
 
The yields on Treasury securities turned higher, spurred by profit taking at the end of a week that saw moderate gains in the bond market and a rise in concerns about inflation. The price of the 30-year bond was down 17/32 , to 8728/32 , with a yield of 7.25 percent, up from 7.21 percent on Thursday. [37.]
 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19 points, to 3,674.26, in restrained trading, as equity traders followed the bond market, where there were worries that more hedge funds were overextended and that the Fed would soon raise interest rates. [38.]
 
Lumber prices plunged the daily trading limit, setting a five-month low, amid speculation that housing demand would not be as robust this year as expected. [45.]
 
The dollar had a slight gain against the yen after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan resigned amid unrelenting questions about his personal finances. [45.]

 
International
 
The resignation of Japan's Prime Minister has deprived the Clinton Administration of the agent of change it was counting on to open Japanese markets and has left the White House wondering how it will achieve its trade goals with Tokyo. [A5.]
 
Jurgen Strube has guided BASF through a revamping during the German recession and gained the respect of his peers, many of whom had questioned whether a lawyer, rather than a chemist, could successfully lead the giant chemical company. [37.]
 
Factories in the former Soviet Union are trying to make the crucial transition to independent civilian production by soliciting foreign investment. Failing that, they bolster production by diversifying and bartering. [37.]

Three bidders are vying for Ford's First Nationwide Bank unit. Ford has set a Monday deadline for offers on the subsidiary, which has 181 branches and assets of $16 billion. [39.]
 
MCI Communications named Gerald H. Taylor president of its worldwide communications business, a move that solidifies Mr. Taylor's position as the most important person in the company after its chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr. [39.]
 
Pegasus Technologies is negotiating for space 250 miles from the Air Force base in California at which it wanted to do sophisticated repair work using imaging X-ray technology. [39.]

Taxpayers can file for a payment extension if they owe the I.R.S. money and cannot pay the whole amount by April 15. [35.]
 
Adjustable-rate mortgage funds lack a long track record, but they held their ground in a dismal first quarter, reporting a small gain while other mortgage funds declined. [35.]

CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 1994, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article by The Associated Press in some editions of Business Day on Saturday, about Pegasus Technologies, misstated the family background of the company's chairwoman, E. Anne Eisenhower. She is not a granddaughter of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but is the widow of a nephew of the former President.

HEADLINE: WHAT WORKS;
The Principals Of Success

BYLINE: By Jennifer Steinhauer 

 BODY:
ASK celebrated principals about the secrets of their success and they are likely to use the lexicon of politicians. There is talk of empowerment and pluralism, the importance of visibility and a stress on reaching out "into the community." Of course, their communities are not town halls but lunchrooms.
So when the National Association of Secondary School Principals recently named Ann Blakeney Clark of Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte, N.C., principal of the year, the crucial elements its judges seemed to find in her and in the principals who were finalists were progressive programs that integrate students and parents in campus decisions as well as programs that stress student performance rather than attendance. The organization sponsors the award in conjunction with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. 
 These homey programs and lunchroom strolls do not match the image of principals that burns in the memories of long-ago students summoned to see them: the stern elder statesman at the end of the hall who held a dim view of youthful high jinks and grimaced when approached.
"We have shifted the philosophical focus of this school to one that empowers students," said Miss Clark, who is 35 years old. "All the decisions made now are ones that make life better for students first."
Some changes she has made include the grouping of classrooms along a corridor by grade level and student group, so that teachers who work on various subjects with the same group of children are near one another; the aggressive recruitment of parents to volunteer in schools, and an advisory program in which students spend part of their mornings receiving everything from homework help to counseling.
 
Avoiding Trouble
 All these changes add up to a more effective use of time, Miss Clark said. By grouping classrooms together by grade level rather than by academic subject and by shortening the time between class periods, students have less time to get into trouble, she said.
Parents have been brought in to help in school health clinics, sponsor fund-raising events and help with student recognition programs. "Kids see that if people give you their time, it means they value you," Miss Clark said. This is why she roams hallways in order to see the students face to face.
It may seem like the one-minute manager approach, but Miss Clark's contemporaries agree that this works. "Students crave recognition and the validation of the fact that they are O.K.," said Michael Gilbert Johnson, a finalist from Granger Junior High School in National City, near San Diego.
To give them that recognition, Mr. Johnson has introduced two honor rolls, one for A-average students and the other for those with B averages, which give children an incentive to work hard. He also visits homes, particularly of children having difficulties in or out of school.
"There was a child I was working with whom I visited at home," Mr. Johnson remembered. "I was trying to communicate that school is a place where he can be cared for. I experienced resistance and remember leaving disappointed," he said. But when the Principals' Association came to interview students about Mr. Johnson, that same student talked about how the principal had reached out to him. "It underscored for me that you never know the impact you might have on a child," he said.
These principals also focus on drawing local communities into the schools, working with small businesses or large companies. At Granger Junior High, San Diego State University and a Navy fleet headquarters have volunteered to counsel students.
Grant A. Hosford, another finalist who has been the principal of Spanaway Lake High School in Spanaway, Wash., for five years, thought it was critical to draw in local businesses to help develop curriculum.
 
Business 'Teams'
 He has put together "teams" of business people who tutor and offer career workshops. These teams are brought in for weekly meetings with teachers, students and parents. "We want to let students see how math, sciences and physics are applicable in daily life," Mr. Hosford said.
Principals were chosen as finalists based on their innovative ideas and willingness to take risks when designing programs; occasionally those designs resulted in tangles with school boards.
Tim Westerberg, the principal of Littleton High School in Littleton, Colo., tried converting his school to a performance-based, rather than attendance-based, graduation requirement system. Although Mr. Westerberg said the system worked well, Littleton's Board of Education reversed it.
"My biggest challenge has been to help a fairly diverse group in a pluralistic society to find a shared vision and still protect the diversity," he said.
Miss Clark was recognized by the Principals' Association for her "commitment to helping children from a broad perspective," said Lew Armistead, an association spokesman. She is also active in several youth projects, and founded A Child's Place, a program for homeless children in Charlotte.
Miss Clark said she saw the award as an honor for her entire school. "If I am without my 750 students and 64 staff members," she said, "clearly I am unemployed."

HEADLINE: Going the Self-Help Route

BYLINE: By Tessa Melva 

 BODY:
FOR supporters of public schools, the saying "you get what you pay for" is taking on new meaning. Across the nation, communities impatient with the continuing school financial crisis are digging into their pockets to support sagging school budgets.
Outside an elementary school in California, parent volunteers hawk supermarket gift certificates. At an apple festival in southeastern Kentucky, an eager crowd snaps up $25 chances on a pickup truck. In the New York City suburb of Bronxville, former high school graduates buy $100 personalized bricks for an "Alumni Walk." 
 Behind each of these efforts is a nonprofit community educational foundation formed to raise money for its public schools. While no one is tracking the trend, educators estimate there are between 1,500 and 2,000 mostly independent community foundations in at least 30 states, and the number is growing fast. If it works for Harvard, the reasoning goes, it can work for them.
From its beginnings in California 15 years ago, the community education foundation movement has spread to the recession-plagued Northeast. Nine school districts in New Jersey and 13 in Suffolk County on Long Island are paying between $7,000 and $25,000 for advice from Educational Foundation Consultants, a Williamston, Mich., concern that advises districts on setting up foundations. Kenneth A. Grounds, senior consultant at the company, says, however, that clients typically raise more money in their first year than his firm charges. Residents reluctant to pay higher taxes nonetheless realize that schools need private financing, said Mr. Grounds. "There's a growing realization that public money can't do everything," he said, "particularly if it's something innovative."
 
State Consortiums
 A number of states have education foundation consortiums, including Oklahoma and Florida. In Florida, school districts have initiated some of the state's 45 community foundations with the aid of state legislation that allows schools to contribute personnel and office space to these efforts.
Community foundations have value beyond their ability to raise money, said Susan Sweeney, executive director of the California Consortium of Education Foundations. The 210 members of her consortium, which comprises the vast majority of the state's community foundations, only raised an average of $25,000 each last year, Ms. Sweeney said. "Initially people thought educational foundations would be a Band-Aid operation," she said, "but the effort has gotten large numbers of opinion leaders conversant about public education. Foundations are here to stay."
Community foundations also heighten interest in the school community among residents without children. In Palo Alto, Calif., where 85 percent of the city's population of 60,000 have no school-age children, parents and other residents have contributed $32,000 annually for teacher mini-grants.
"This is as much about community building and increasing public information as it is about money," said Laura S. Selznick, the foundation's co-president. It is also about self-interest; residents tend to support the foundation as a way of keeping real estate values high, according to Ms. Selznick.
Paul Reville, Executive Director of the Alliance for Education in Wooster, Mass., a regional education foundation, noted another aspect of the appeal of community foundations: "People can't be sure where their added tax dollars go, but when you give to a local education fund, you know the money will be spent directly on educational programs."
California's wake-up call came with Proposition 13 in 1978, which took away local control over public education by severely limiting the amount of property tax money communities could spend on their schools. "Communities with good schools had their guts cut out," Ms. Sweeney said.
One of the state's more successful foundations is the Menlo Park-Atherton Education Foundation, which this year expects to exceed its goal of $370,000 to support the four elementary and secondary schools in the district's two communities. Located 40 miles south of San Francisco and adjacent to Stanford University, the district is considered among the best in California.
When state funding reductions threatened to reduce school performance, residents of Menlo Park and Atherton established a foundation, now completing its 11th year. It raises money through solicitations, an auction and the Spell athon, in which parents and grandparents pledge support to elementary school students preparing for a spelling bee.
"The foundation has increased awareness of the way state funds are spent on education," said Mary Pickard, its president. Two years ago a local proposition to impose a special $65 property "parcel" tax assessment passed overwhelmingly, Ms. Pickard said, in part because the foundation had made people more aware of education issues.
Several states, including California, have single statewide foundations that act as magnets to increase corporate support for education. The corporate-sponsored California Educational Initiative Fund, since it began 14 years ago, has awarded $10 million to schools. The eight-year-old Florida Education Foundation raised $300,000 in corporate and foundation grants last year.
In New York's Westchester County, the Bronxville School Foundation has raised $628,000 in two and a half years, much of it from people with no children in public school, who make up a majority of the town's residents. The money also cushioned a four-year, 43 percent cut in state aid in the midst of a continued decline in property tax revenue.
 
Funding Disparity
 Grass-roots foundations often develop in affluent communities unwilling to let their education programs suffer. But in part for that very reason, some worry that the spread of community foundations will increase the disparity between rich and poor districts.
Despite a growing number of school equity lawsuits, there have been no legal challenges to community education foundations. "Community foundations go to the heart of local control," said Paul Minorini, a lawyer with Hogan & Hudson, a Washington firm specializing in education law.
For supporters of education reform, creating foundations that are independent of their school districts is critical. With the help of a $6 million grant from the Ford Foundation 11 years ago, Local Education Funds were set up in 53 low-income and minority school districts to encourage reform. Now spreading to other areas, and coordinated by the Public Education Fund Network in Washington, these professionally staffed foundations rely on corporate and foundation support and local contributions to develop innovative programs the school district will adopt.
The Mary Lyon Fund is a Local Education Fund set up three years ago in nine towns in western Massachusetts. Supported by residents who include Bill Cosby and a retired I.B.M. executive who donated $500,000, the fund sponsors wilderness adventure projects.
Some community education funds are in rural areas. In the Appalachian mountains of southeastern Kentucky, the 1980 census brought shocking news: only 38 percent of the adults living in the 27 counties of the Fifth Congressional District had graduated from high school -- the lowest percentage in the nation.
The district, in one of Kentucky's poorest regions, had the state's lowest property tax base, highest school dropout rate and lowest test scores. A regional study commission concluded that conditions would improve only when schools improved, and when the community got involved.
Seven years ago, the district formed a regional umbrella organization, Forward in the Fifth, to stimulate community education foundations in each county. Since it began, the foundation has raised $700,000 and recruited 2,000 volunteers.
Parents and local businesses raise funds for teacher mini-grants, student field trips, cash awards to schools with good attendance and prizes for students with impressive academic records. And parents' development is not ignored; Forward in the Fifth sponsors workshops to train parents to read aloud and carry that skill into the classroom.
The 1990 census showed that 50 percent of the Fifth District's population are high school graduates, a rate of progress above the national average. "Money helps," said Ginny Eager, executive director of Forward in the Fifth, but she said the greatest difference had been made by communities involved in their schools. The greatest educational gains have come in those counties with the highest number of volunteers, Ms. Eager said, adding, "Having a mother working on educational issues is a big shoulder to lean on."

HEADLINE: Family Vacations: Ten of the Best

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER; MELINDA HENNEBERGER is a reporter on the metropolitan staff of The Times.

 BODY:
SOMETIMES it's the mini-disasters and unplanned detours that make a family vacation memorable, as when young Gary Montgomery fed a bag of cinnamon rolls to Freckles the dog en route to a camping trip in the Texas Hill Country -- with unfortunate results for the bedrolls.
His mother, Bettye Montgomery, 52 years old, an administrative assistant at a Houston accounting firm, laughs about it now. "Our boys learned a valuable lesson that year: You don't feed dogs cinnamon rolls when you're going on a long trip." 
 Gary is 25 now and his older brother, Michael, is 30, but they and their parents, wives, children -- and dogs -- still meet every year for a week of roughing it on the banks of the Frio River, 90 miles northwest of San Antonio. And every summer, the itinerary is about the same -- swim, fish, tube down the river, visit Uncle Mervle, the old stage coach road, and the second- or third-oldest oak tree in the state.
But despite the occasional mishap, Mrs. Montgomery wouldn't trade those trips for the last chimichanga in Texas.
"We've been doing it for 28 years," she said, "and I still love it."
 
The Vacation As Goal
 Shirley Kaiser was a recently divorced mother mowing lawns to get off welfare when she decided that she and her three daughters -- Melissa, 17, Yvette, 12, and Erica, 9 -- deserved a vacation.
"Our whole life had just changed," said Ms. Kaiser, 43, of Portland, Ore. "I had only been sober for a couple of years and was just starting to single-parent my kids. We'd never gone on a family vacation, and I wanted to take my kids to Disneyland. I wanted to give them things."
Mowing, cleaning houses, and later working as an office temporary for a computer company where, five years later, she is now a buyer, she saved for two years before finally taking her family on their first plane trip, to Los Angeles, in 1990.
"It was just so special because it was a challenge, a goal we could work toward together," she said. "It was something that gave the kids confidence I could take care of them and that gave me the courage that we could do anything we set our minds to. We still talk about it."
Because the Kaisers arrived just before Thanksgiving, Disneyland was relatively empty, and they rode the rides again and again. They were "cutting it pretty lean," Ms. Kaiser said, economizing by walking and taking city buses and eating "hot dogs three for $1 and peanut butter and jelly in the motel room." But they still managed to visit Knott's Berry Farm and Sea World, even renting a car for one day to visit Hollywood and Universal Studios.
And after that day on the Los Angeles freeways, she said, "I wouldn't really have wanted to have had a car anyway."
 
On the Road to Home
 Buck Showalter, manager of the New York Yankees, said the best family vacations he could remember were his childhood trips from the Florida Panhandle to his grandparents' house, "when my parents would load up the four children and head up to Virginia, cutting corners and packing food" for meals on the road. Even then, he said, "A lot of our family vacations revolved around the Cape Cod League, or wherever I was playing."
Now his children, Allie, who is 6, and Nathan, 2, get to visit the usual tourist spots throughout the year -- Disneyland when the team is in Anaheim, and the Smithsonian in Washington when they're in nearby Baltimore.
So, he said, the goal is "going home and spending time as a family" in Pace, Fla., for four months of off-season calm.
"When we get home at the end of the year," he said, "our idea of a vacation is to wake up in the morning and have somebody say, 'What do we have to do today?' and the answer is: 'Nothing!' "
 
Real Family Time
 Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the nationally-known Boston pediatrician, says his family vacations are no more free of the usual tensions than those planned by the many parents who look to him for advice.
Most summers, he and his wife, their four children and three grandchildren gather at their home on Cape Cod for the traditional family vacation sports.
"We play tennis, we go sailing, we fight and they beat up on me," he said approvingly. "A lot of feelings get worked out."
Because his wife's two sisters also have houses nearby, Dr. Brazelton said, "It's even more layered, real family time, with all the positives and negatives."
But Dr. Brazelton's favorite vacations were when his children were young; they're now 40, 38, 35, and 29. "It's awfully hard to give them up," he said.
 
A Long, Hot Haul
 By eating in the car and limiting even the necessary pit stops, the Mulroys figured they could make the drive home from Colorado Springs to Memphis in 20 hours.
James Mulroy, a lawyer for Federal Express, had combined business with a vacation last May to the Rocky Mountains, where Colin, Catherine and Elizabeth, now 12, 10, and 5, ran with a herd of wild elk. "I'm not even sure that's safe," said his wife, Nancy Mulroy, a graduate student in special education. But the real excitement was the trip home, she said, since they couldn't leave Colorado before Mr. Mulroy's last Saturday meeting but had to be home for Catherine's piano recital Sunday at 2 P.M.
And when the red light on the dashboard showed their Volvo had overheated, they still couldn't stop. To pull heat off the engine, Mrs. Mulroy said, they kept the heater on, full blast, all the way home.
"It was miserable in a way," said Mrs. Mulroy, "but we kept saying, 'We'll never forget this.' And we made it! It was wild." She added with pride that they arrived home with an hour to spare, bathed, changed, and made the performance.
Catherine's debut "was just fine," Mrs. Mulroy said. "I can't remember what she played, though."
 
Educational Africa
 Ryan, Jeremy and Justin Rice, who are 14, 11 and 9 years old, had already been camping in the Costa Rican rain forest and were "quite well-traveled for their age," said their father, Dr. Jeffrey Rice, an oral surgeon in Du Bois, Pa., who shares custody of the boys with his ex-wife.
Then, last year, they took the camping experience a step further, while on safari to Kenya and Tanzania. "It was just us," he said, "on a basic safari with a guide, a cook and a vehicle." They camped, visited small villages and, because it was the dry season, saw thousands of zebras, wildebeests, rhinos and elephants -- "Animals as far as the eye could see," Dr. Rice said -- and they learned a lot as well.
"It really helps them in school, with geography, anthropology, you name it," Dr. Rice said. This year, he's mulling a return to Africa with the boys, but also considering a trip to the Amazon.
"Trips like that are relatively safe" for children, he said. "It's probably safer than New York."
 
Marathon Drive
 "We couldn't have done a trip like that later on, after Dan became Vice President," said Marilyn Tucker Quayle. But back in 1987, "before the notoriety" and way before the Dan Quayle Center and Museum opened in Huntington, Ind., the Quayles took their three children, Tucker, Ben and Corinne, now ages 19, 17 and 15, on a marathon car trip across the country. They fished and hiked in Rocky Mountain National Park and went horseback riding in Jackson Hole, Wyo. "We did the Best Western with the family all in one room," Mrs. Quayle said, and wound up their two-week vacation in Sun Valley, where her husband finally got in a round of golf. "He had gone 11 days," she said.
More recently, though, Mrs. Quayle said her family had their best vacations on the Colorado River, where they took five-day white-water rafting trips in the Grand Canyon in 1989 and 1990.
Initially, "I wasn't keen on sleeping out and not having facilities," said Mrs. Quayle, a camping convert. But she said rafting was an almost sure bet with older offspring, whose enthusiasm for family adventures can be, well, measured.
"To people with teen-age children, I would definitely recommend it," she said. "Kids that age don't want to have anything to do with their parents."
 
On Board to Baltimore
 Pam Hurst has learned that long car trips can be a bit too challenging for her three sons, Geoffrey, Darren and Khory, who are 11, 6 and 4. The best vacation she and her husband, Mark, a Queens real-estate appraiser, have taken them on, she says, was a train trip to Washington and Baltimore.
They not only loved the train, she said, but more: "I was shocked at how much they loved Baltimore Harbor and the seafood. When you live in New York, you think, 'What's one more aquarium?' But they liked it so much we had to go twice."
Mrs. Hurst, a middle-school Spanish teacher, said her view was that where family vacations are concerned, "You always have to have a plan B." En route to Niagara Falls for one getaway, her husband had an asthma attack and the trip had to be scrubbed.
"They were all ready to see water, so I took them on the Staten Island Ferry," she said. "It's a little closer to home, but we still had a good time."
 
The Older Generation
 A trip to Grandma's house is still the ultimate family vacation for many children, including Andrew and Caroline Giuliani, the young children of New York City's Mayor.
Last year, for the third time, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his family took off the week after Christmas, and spent New Year's with his wife's family near Los Angeles. "The plane trip is always pretty exciting for the children, walking up and down the aisles and getting their wings," said Donna Hanover Giuliani, adding that the Santa Monica pier, with its bumper cars, was always a highlight.
But more than anything, Mrs. Giuliani said, her children love the playhouse behind their great-grandmother's house, as did Mrs. Giuliani and her mother before her.
"They just like being with my Mom and Dad," who baby-sit one night so the Giulianis can have a night out to themselves, maybe at the movies.
Then, on New Year's Eve, the family has dinner with Mrs. Giuliani's closest friend.
"We watch the ball drop in Times Square at 9 o'clock, have lobster" and then watch the ball drop again when the station replays it at midnight, she said, though last year they missed midnight entirely. "With everything going on," she said, "we just wanted to have Champagne and go to bed."
 
Out of Character
 Erica Kane of "All My Children" never gets a vacation with her kids. Of course, one daughter is in jail and the other lives with an ex-husband who's still steamed over the affair she had with his brother.
"She makes plans, but they never work out," says the actress Susan Lucci, who plays Ms. Kane on the ABC soap.
Ms. Lucci, on the other hand, takes annual spring ski vacations in the Austrian Alps, usually staying in either Lech or Ischgl, with her Austrian-born husband, Helmut Huber, and their children, Andreas, 14, and Liza, 19. Her husband and children are "spectacular" skiers, who started before they were school-age, she said proudly. And off the slopes, she said, there is skating, curling, and treats like sweet dumplings stuffed with raspberry jam.
Sometimes, at sunset, the family takes horse-drawn sleigh rides to an old farmhouse that has been converted to an inn, returning in the dark with lanterns to lead the way.
"The physical beauty is tremendous, the food, the hotels are spectacular," she said. That beats Erica Kane's last vacation: she was locked in a vault in Budapest.

Trans-Atlantic Flights To Dublin Now Nonstop

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
FROM 1945 until the late 1950's, 80 percent of trans-Atlantic air traffic went through Shannon Airport in western Ireland, a refueling station for planes that did not have the range to travel nonstop between North America and the European capitals. It was at Shannon, in 1947, that the first duty-free shop opened, giving travelers somewhere to spend their money during the stopover.
The advent of more advanced jets ended the need for the refueling stop -- but it did not mean the end of Shannon. Seeking to protect jobs at the airport and among those people dependent on tourism in western Ireland, the Irish Government decreed that all flights to and from Ireland that did not start or terminate at Shannon -- meaning those to and from Dublin, 120 miles to the east -- would continue to be required to stop there. 
 That anachronism has now come to an end. Last summer, under intense pressure from Aer Lingus, the money-losing national carrier, the Irish Government agreed to end the prohibition on nonstop trans-Atlantic flights to and from Dublin.
The new policy went into effect on March 27, when Aer Lingus began its first nonstop flights between Dublin and New York, with a daily service that will run year-round. Delta Airlines, the Irish carrier's major competitor on the trans-Atlantic route, began a four-times-a-week nonstop service between Atlanta and Dublin on April 6.
"Shannon Airport has a special place in aviation history here, and the region out in the west of Ireland needed the protection," said John Brown, a spokesman for the Irish Tourist Board in Dublin. "But there was a lot of pressure to try and change the situation, from the airlines and from tourism interests on the east coast of Ireland who felt they were losing out."
The change will save at least an hour on the ground at Shannon for passengers in each direction. Aer Lingus said its bookings for the new service have already been extremely strong. Airline executives said the new policy could attract more carriers to routes between Ireland and the United States since they now will be able to appeal to business travelers. Most business travelers to Dublin -- and many tourists as well -- have chosen to fly via London, a route that offers a far greater number of flights and more fare competition without taking any longer than flying to Dublin via Shannon.
Not that the airlines are abandoning Shannon, the gateway to the popular tourist regions of western Ireland. Under the new Irish regulations, they are forced to continue flights to and from Shannon in order to win approval for direct flights in and out of Dublin. Aer Lingus, for example, will continue to offer direct daily service between Shannon and New York as well as flights between Shannon and Boston.
As for Shannon, officials there are confident that the area and its airport can more than hold their own.
Shannon Development, the authority set up in 1959 to safeguard the region's economic interests as Europe-bound jets began flying on past, has used the last 35 years to attract new industry to the area, including many high-technology companies, while carrying out more aggressive marketing campaigns to lure tourists to the area.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
When Is A Roof Not a Roof?

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
TWO COASTS. TWO ROOFS. TWO major civic projects. Riverbank Park in New York and Yerba Buena Gardens in San Francisco have a lot in common. Both were conceived to placate communities that had been saddled with controversial buildings. Both have resulted in public spaces of high architectural caliber. And both could have gone further in developing the concept on which they literally rest: a roof can be the bottom of a building as well as the top.
Riverbank Park has gained notoriety as the smelly park, the one built atop an offshore waste treatment plant in the Hudson River. First proposed in 1969 as compensation for foisting this classic Not-In-My-Back-Yard project on nearby Harlem, the 28-acre park finally opened a year ago, after 24 years of bureaucratic wrangling. Despite the chemical whiffs that periodically assail the nostrils (the city's sanitation engineers say they are working to eliminate them), the place is a popular success. With its pools, gym, outdoor rink and running track, it may be the most lavish sportsplex in town. 
 And the design, by the New York architect Richard Dattner, is as colorful and trim as the latest gym attire. Constrained not only by the park's $129 million budget but also by the roof's limited capacity to support weight, Mr. Dattner has designed a set of airy pavilions, clad in green and orange tile, inset with translucent panels of Shoji-screen refinement. Synthetic turf on the running track picks up these colors in supersaturated, TV-like tones. Athletes playing here could easily imagine themselves in line for big-league product endorsements.
The landscaping, by the New York firm Abel Bainnson Butz, doesn't fight the flatness of the rooftop site with undue displays of pastoral imagery. Instead, the tree-lined terraces and promenades create a lofty platform for enjoying what New York's early-19th-century planners envisioned as the city's major open space: the Hudson River. With views north to the George Washington Bridge and south to the harbor, this is an ideal spot to watch sky and water dissolve into the river's shimmering light.
Except for that stray whiff, and for the sound of rushing water audible from the park's lower terrace, you'd never know you were atop a sewage treatment plant. But this is not entirely the good thing it might seem. The park's designers have succeeded in separating the park from the unwanted plant. Unfortunately, that separation is symptomatic of the pernicious disconnection between the city and the natural resources that sustain it.
There's nothing attractive about bodily waste. That's why we use euphemisms like "effluent" to describe it. But a plant like this is as vital to the city's operation as the subway system. And, like the subway, it is more than a technical facility. It is a cultural artifact, a monumental instrument designed to mediate between the city and the water supply on which it depends. The park could have provided a place for people to see that instrument in action.
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M talking about is "Flow City," a project designed in 1984 by the "sanitation artist" Mierle Laderman Ukeles for the 59th Street Marine Transfer Station. The purpose of this project, which was halted when the money ran out, is to provide a public window on the processing of garbage. It's not a dull spectacle, much less a shameful one. At Riverbank Park, there's a handsome multi-purpose "cultural space," complete with an auditorium for performances. What's missing is a window onto the extraordinary aquatic mechanical ballet taking place just beneath.
True, Harlem residents didn't want to see this plant. And they had the right to insist that it be banished from sight. But Riverside Park raises two issues that transcend this particular case. One is the fobbing off of Nimby projects onto poor neighborhoods. The other is whether such projects should be stigmatized in the first place. New "fair share" laws address the first issue. It will now be harder for rich neighborhoods to exclude such projects from their backyards. Design could address the second issue. It could use public works to enrich public spaces.
Yerba Buena Gardens also had its origins in the late 1960's, when people realized that they didn't have to take "urban renewal" lying down. But here it was the smell of money that drove them to action. In 1969, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of several thousand residents who had been evicted from an area south of Market Street by a plan to build a convention center and hotel complex. The Yerba Buena Gardens and Art Center, which opened in October to deserved acclaim, is the long delayed result.
Built on top of the northern extension of the Moscone Convention Center, the eight-acre, $82 million park and arts complex is conceived as a multi-culti Lincoln Center. The center's theater, designed by James Stewart Polshek, and its art galleries, designed by Fumihiko Maki, this year's winner of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, will showcase local artists and community performing groups in programs that reflect the city's cultural diversity. And it is perhaps apt that the architecture harks back to the International Style, an idiom that still affords a wide expressive range. Clad in granite, glass and aluminum, Mr. Maki's silvery visual arts building is pliant, yielding, while Mr. Polshek's auditorium, housed within a vertical composition of white, gray and charcoal cubes, is flinty, a trifle truculent, only reluctantly conceding the monumental gesture to Mario Botta's San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, now nearing completion across the street. Together, the three buildings are San Francisco's strongest ensemble of modern architecture.
Things go awry in Yerba Buena's five-acre garden, though at first it's hard to say why. What could be wrong with such a generous open space in the heart of the city? And this one is pleasingly landscaped, with curving, tree-bordered walks, a waterfall, and a broad lawn for outdoor concerts. But when the garden is not full of people, the place can seem eerie. Suddenly, as you saunter alone along the pathways, you realize that you could be walking only inches above the heads of thousands of conventioneers. The greenery begins to look like the cosmetic cover-up it is. Why has a place that's supposed to stand for innovation reverted to this purely decorative use of nature? And why treat a convention center like a dirty secret?
For it, too, is a cultural artifact. It is not only an economic engine, it is a distinctive form of urban space, at once integral to the city's vitality yet peculiarly alien to its fabric. Here the transient, homogenized culture of Hiltons and Hyatts touches down for a brief rendezvous with urban diversity. The arts center hasn't ignored the conventioneers. It is counting on them to swell its audience. But it has missed the opportunity to create something artistically significant out of the connection -- to create an environment where convention culture and multiculturalism could visibly intertwine.
One solution would have been to incorporate communications technology into the design of the garden. Instead of the sappy granite mural that borders the lawn, the planners might have planted a "virtual garden," a media arcade, where people could try on head-mounted displays and data gloves, step into the Internet, stroll past digital flowers and fiber-optic fountains, and check out how conventions in the not too distant future will be conducted along the information highway.
Such a feature would have reinforced Yerba Buena's mission to present local talent: San Francisco's "wired" community is the most sophisticated in the nation. A convention center already occupies an intersection between urban space and cyberspace. Yerba Buena Gardens could have turned that crossroads into a world-class civic place.
The California planner Peter Calthorpe once proposed linking community fitness centers to electric generators: people could trim their waistlines and their utility bills at the same time. Though the proposal was facetious, it contained an important idea: there are advantages to linking places that we ordinarily isolate in separate cultural compartments. That's the kind of thinking that needs to be introduced early on in the planning of projects like Riverbank Park and Yerba Buena Gardens. Instead of burying a city's vital organs out of sight, design could visualize a place for them on the cultural landscape. Into sight, into mind.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Light at the End Of the Chunnel?

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANNON ALBRIGHT; JOHN BRANNON ALBRIGHT is an editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
FOR many car-conscious Americans awaiting the opening of the Channel Tunnel, the most disappointing thing to learn is, You won't be able to drive through it. Only trains -- some carrying cars -- will make the 31-mile trip between Calais, France, and Folkestone, England, and exactly when is not certain.
The first train, filled with dignitaries, is scheduled for May 6. The start of regular service is another matter. Testing and late delivery of equipment is causing delays. The tunnel was originally scheduled to open a year ago, in the spring of 1993. Then its opening was postponed to last December. On April 1 Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel, the British and French consortium that will operate the tunnel, announced that full service would not start until September. 
 When the tunnel does begin operating, there will be two types of service: Le Shuttle, carrying freight and vehicles, and Eurostar, carrying passengers. Mr. Morton said Le Shuttle would begin on a limited basis in June. Eurostar, too, will start on a limited basis, but not before July 1, said Bernard Frelat, president and chief executive officer of Rail Europe, which markets European rail passes in the United States. Eurostar is a venture of the railroads of Britain, Belgium and France.
 
Coaches for Cars
Le Shuttle, a subsidiary of Euro tunnel, will have one- and two-level coaches (as high as 18 feet) onto which motorists can drive cars. During the 35-minute ride, driver and passengers will normally sit in the vehicle, but they can get out to walk alongside other vehicles or go to a restroom. The trip, including loading and unloading, should take about an hour. There will be no telephones or food service. Initially Le Shuttle plans to run one train an hour in each direction.
Eurostar will carry passengers only -- in sleek, new trains between London and Paris and London and Brussels. Plans call for 1 to 3 trains of 18 cars with a capacity of 794 passengers in each direction, increasing to 7 on Sept. 1 and 15 on Jan. 1.
"Rail was purposely selected as the sole means of transport through the tunnel because it provides the highest density and is the most reliable, weather-free, traffic-free form of transport," Mr. Frelat said.
When those who do transport their vehicles reach the other side, they will have to cope with passing while the steering wheel is on the "wrong" side and making turns from an unfamiliar position. Aware that the average American would rather conform to prevailing custom than place an added strain on a vacation, at least two car rental companies will allow an exchange of cars at the tunnel. Hertz has signed a 10-year agreement with Le Shuttle to offer the Hertz Affordable Europe Tunnel Program. It will provide a left-hand-drive car for use on the Continent and a right-hand-drive car in Britain combined with round-trip travel on the car-carrying train. The car exchange, dubbed le swap, will take place at a newly constructed Hertz outlet at Le Shuttle's headquarters in Calais. Hertz will also have a depot in Folkestone, for initial rentals, not an exchange. The price will not be announced until Le Shuttle begins, according to a Hertz spokeswoman.
Avis, too, will offer cars in Calais and in Dover, about 10 miles from Folkestone. An Avis spokeswoman said it would be possible, if the renter preferred, to keep the same car -- by notifying Avis ahead of time and arranging for special insurance, called a green card. The cost of the card will depend on the size of the car and the length of the rental period.
Avis officials say, however, that they think most Americans will prefer to take Eurostar, the passenger train, and rent a car at an office in one of the three capital cities or in a city in the countryside. The expected Eurostar train time will be 3 hours between London and Paris, 3 hours and 15 minutes between London and Brussels. Eventually, when high-speed tracks are finished between Brussels and Lille, France, and Folkestone and London, faster speeds will be possible.
As sensible as it sounds to take Eurostar rather than Le Shuttle, Americans planning a trip this summer may find it difficult to get a Eurostar reservation, especially if the start of service is delayed and rolling stock is slow to arrive. So far, about 5,000 Americans and more than 10,000 Europeans have put their names on the waiting list for reservations. Le Shuttle will not require reservations, operating on a first-come-first-loaded basis.
Fares on Le Shuttle (figured at $1.50 to 1) will range from about $195 for a two-day introductory round trip through July 21 (a date set before the latest delays were announced) to $465 for a less restricted round trip in summer. A winter round trip of about $330 has also been announced.
Eurostar has not announced its fares, but they are expected to be competitive with regularly scheduled airlines, which charge about $200 one way between London and Paris in economy class, $240 in business. (Round-trip flights offer discounts, and one-way flights as low as $70 are advertised in London magazines.)
But the cost of getting to the airport must also be considered: a train from London to Heathrow is about $4.50, the trip by taxi about $50, and a train from Charles de Gaulle to Paris is about $6, a taxi $35 to $70. At least 2 hours are required: 40 minutes for the flight, 50 minutes for the London-Heathrow train and 30 minutes for the de Gaulle-Paris train; that does not count time for boarding, deplaning or making connections.
 
Crossing by Water
Here are approximate fares and travel times, exclusive of loading and unloading, for crossing the channel by water, the third alternative:
Ferry between Dover and Calais, $38 a person; with automobile and passengers, $90 to $195 (75 minutes). Hovercraft between Dover and Calais, $38 a person; with automobile and passengers, $84 to $285 (35 minutes). Train from London to Dover, $26 (110 minutes). Train from Calais to Paris, varying from $30 a person in second class on a regular train (3 hours) to $72 a person in first class on a TGV (90 minutes).
For comparison's sake, the approximate cost and total time, one way, between London and Paris, without a car: $200 (3 hours) on Eurostar, $81 to $320 (4 1/2 to 6 hours) by air, $94 to $136 (4 1/2 to 5 3/4 hours) by hovercraft or ferry. With a car, figure $98 to $233 (6 3/4 hours) on Le Shuttle, $84 to $285 (7 1/4 to 7 3/4) on hovercraft or ferry.
Through Rail Europe, the British and French railways offer a variety of packages combining rail passage with car rental. Two packages that may interest channel crossers are the BritFrance Pass and the BritFrance 'n' Drive Pass. For a fixed price, they provide varying days of train and car travel, but none include a ride through the Chunnel, only passage on a channel-crossing hovercraft.
The following phone numbers should prove helpful in planning a Chunnel trip, but bear in mind that precise information is not likely to be available until tunnel service actually starts: Avis, (800) 331-1084; Hertz, (800) 654-3001; Rail Europe, (800) 438-7245; Eurostar reservations through Rail Europe, (800) 942-4866, and through Britrail, (212) 575-2667 or, outside New York City and Long Island, (800) 677-8585; Le Shuttle, (800) 388-3876. A travel agent can help obtain plane, ferry or hovercraft reservations.

HEADLINE: More Buyers Turn to Mortgage Brokers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
THE Greenbergs were in a hurry. They had just sold their house in Chappaqua, N.Y., and had found a new home in nearby North Tarrytown. With interest rates rising and movers virtually knocking at their door, they needed a mortgage quickly.
 Like most borrowers these days, Christine and Mark Greenberg checked newspaper ads and called banks in search of the best rates. The mortgage they chose, however, wasn't obtained through a bank, a savings and loan or even a mortgage banker. Instead, the Greenbergs found their loan through Homerica Inc., a mortgage broker with offices in Harrison, N.Y., and Westport, Conn. 
 "We had to get the ball rolling," Ms. Greenberg said. "Our lawyer told us to find the best rate as fast as possible."
 In recent years, more and more Americans have been using mortgage brokers -- intermediaries who find loans for borrowers and help them with the applications, rather than make the loans themselves. The percentage of home mortgage applications written by brokers has increased from about 20 percent in 1987 to about 50 percent last year, according to the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, a 15-year-old trade organization based in Phoenix.
 "Like in a lot of other areas, with mortgage brokers we have seen the development of a subservice that shops around on behalf of people and hopefully finds the best deal," said Lawrence J. White, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
 "We have had this with travel agents for some time," he added.
 A major reason for the rising popularity of mortgage brokers in recent years has been the increased number of refinancings, which made up about 65 to 75 percent of all mortgage originations in 1993. Borrowers often sought mortgage brokers for refinancings because their original lenders, usually banks and savings and loans, were not offering the best terms.
 Home buyers, however, also look to mortgage brokers to help guide them quickly and efficiently through the maze of complex rates, products and qualifying standards offered by lenders today.
 The biggest benefit of mortgage brokers -- whose fee is almost always paid in large part by the financial institution providing the loan -- is that they can offer borrowers a wider choice in rates and terms than the client might be able to get from their original lender or by searching for a new lender on their own.
 "Good mortgage brokers are really financial advisers," said Margaret S. Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a Manhattan mortgage brokerage.
 Brokers can also be valuable when the borrowers are too busy to shop for a mortgage and fill out the paperwork. They also claim that they can often obtain a loan in two to three weeks, saving a borrower time that they might otherwise spend visiting and possibly being rejected by various lenders.
 "I thought that I should immediately go to a mortgage broker," said Mary S. Burns, a festival producer who recently took out a $100,000 mortgage to buy a one-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "I am extremely busy, and didn't have the time to do anything more than look at the paper and see what the interest rates are."
 Traditional lenders have mixed feelings about the growth of mortgage brokers. "Bankers use mortgage brokers, and the majority are probably legitimate, but you need to be aware of some of the unscrupulous ones," said Patricia Boerger, spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, a trade organization in Washington.
 To be sure, the mortgage brokerage business has cut into the market share of commercial banks and savings and loans, but it also helps attract new business while allowing them to reduce their sales and processing staffs.
 "We are lower-cost producers," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of Homerica, which has 21 employees in its two offices.
 Mortgage brokers should not be confused with mortgage bankers. Mortgage bankers essentially make loans with their own funds or lines of credit and resell them at a profit, like most traditional lenders.
 Sometimes, though, mortgage brokers are also mortgage bankers. Mr. Lublin, a mortgage broker in New York and Connecticut, is also a mortgage banker in Connecticut, but not in New York.
 "The licensing is more stringent," he said, referring to New York's licensing laws for mortgage bankers.
 Though the surge in refinancing has increased the mortgage brokerage business, home buyers are critical for the industry's survival, since the number of refinancings is projected to shrink over the next few years to as low as 25 percent of all mortgage originations. This would pull down the dollar value of mortgages written to about $750 billion to $800 billion this year, from $1.1 trillion last year.
 "A lot of people who were considering refinancing at lower rates won't do so now that rates have gone up, even though they are still at historically low levels," Mr. Lublin said. The decline in refinancings and overall loan volume may put many smaller mortgage brokers out of business. The number of mortgage brokers nationally has more than tripled since 1987, to about 22,000 last year.
"THE steady decline in interest rates helped spur the growth in the mortgage brokerage business as well as mortgage banking in general," Mr. Lublin said. "You will see a consolidation in the industry in the next year or two because of the decrease in loan originations. A lot of the small mom-and-pop businesses will go by the wayside."
Not long ago, the mortgage-brokerage industry had a reputation for deceitfulness. But stricter licensing and more rigorous self-policing have greatly improved the industry's reputation over the last decade.
"We are cleaning out the bad apples," said Clare E. Sykes, a spokeswoman with the New York Department of Banking.
She that about 25 percent of the 200 or so mortgage-related complaints her department received each month concerned mortgage brokers. In the past, she said, the chief complaints against brokers were not scams but failure to disclose how much and how they were being paid.
"The problems are equally with the mortgage brokers and the mortgage bankers," she said. "The problems with them would be things like stalling the closing so interest rates would go up, and fees at the closing that come out of left field, sometimes last-minute changes in the closing that have a tendency to cost the borrower money."
Ms. Scott, a former president of the New York City Mortgage Brokers Association, said that borrowers should still guard against brokers with questionable credentials or who ask for high up-front fees by making sure that they were licensed. Forty-one states including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut license brokers. Individual salespeople in brokerage offices do not have to be licensed.
Prospective borrowers should check the state licensing authority -- usually the Department of Banking -- to see if it has received any complaints about a broker. They should also investigate whether the broker is a member of the local chapter of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.
Ms. Scott suggested that a borrower should also ask the broker how many lenders it represented. Some brokers are associated with only a few lenders, which can limit a borrower's selection. Others work with dozens.
"We are not married to one lender," she said. "And that is what has fueled the growth of the industry."
Ms. Scott added that borrowers should ask for details about fees in advance. Only a loan application fee (about $50), a credit check (about $60) and an appraisal fee (about $275 to $300, more for co-ops) should be required, she said.
Brokers receive a fee, generally 1 percent of the loan amount, customarily paid either when the loan is approved or at the closing date. The fee is generally paid by the lender.
Sometimes the borrower will pay the fee directly to the broker in exchange for a mortgage whose cost has been reduced -- whether by deducting a point or reducing the interest rate -- by an amount equivalent to the payment to the broker.
In either case, the combined cost of the loan and the use of the broker should almost never be more than if the borrower had gone directly to the lender.
"As a general rule, we are equal to or better than going directly to the lender," Mr. Lublin said. "We shop the market for the most competitive lenders and we are often able to find loans that are not readily available in the borrower's area."
The Greenbergs, for example, applied for a "five-one" $215,000 jumbo mortgage offered by a New York State savings and loan that doesn't advertise or have a major presence in the retail mortgage market.
The loan is called a "five-one" because it has a fixed rate -- in this case, 7 percent -- for five years and adjusts annually afterwards with a 2-percentage-point annual cap and a 5-percentage-point cap for the life of the loan.
The Greenbergs chose the "five-one" because they don't expect to be in the home more than five years, which is close to the seven-year average length of a mortgage.
If they had taken out a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, they would have paid 8.5 percent interest.
FOR the loan, the Greenbergs paid $55 for a credit check, $275 for an appraisal and $95 for an application fee. The loan also carried 1 point, in this case $2,150, which went to the broker.
If they had gone directly to the lender, they would still have paid the point.
The broker essentially earns a fee through locating business for the lender and aiding in paperwork, a chore that sometimes in the past has been handled, for a fee, by real estate brokers.
"The bottom line is that a mortgage broker has shopped the market for the most competitive rates and programs available, and the consumer ends up saving a lot of time by going to a mortgage broker," Ms. Scott said.
Mortgage brokers can also be helpful scouting out potential problems with a property being purchased or when a borrower has trouble documenting income or has damaged credit and needs special assistance in finding a loan.
The ability of brokers to contact a number of lending institutions whose policies may be more or less restrictive on various points can help them obtain loans, according to Mr. Lublin.
"We can pre-screen the deal with a number of lenders until someone says they will do the loan," Mr. Lublin said.
Such instances are not limited to borrowers who have been laid off or have fallen behind in credit-card payments. Even those with spotless employment and credit records sometimes need help dancing around strict mortgage lending standards.
MS. BURNS, for instance, owns a small company with an income that varies from year to year. "It is automatically a red flag in that I am not working for a big company," she said.
There can also be underwriting problems with a co-op or with condominium tax abatements that might soon expire and increase common charges.
Brokers are able to find a lender who will make a loan despite such problems.
A bank, on the other hand, often has its own strict lending standards, and if a borrower doesn't meet them the bank doesn't shop around for a loan for which the borrower would qualify.
Ms. Burns, for example, bought an apartment in a co-op building that was only 66 percent owner-occupied, perilously close to the 50 to 60 percent level where lenders often reject mortgages.
Even so, her loan -- a one-year adjustable-rate mortgage with a lifetime cap at 10.95 percent -- was approved. Her monthly payments will be $506.
"I worried that rates aren't going to get any better than they are now, and I don't know if it is a good idea to wait any longer," she said.
Ms. Scott said that brokers also ordered appraisals and title and certificate-of-occupancy reports.
Most important, perhaps, she said, a broker will help negotiate with the lender and, along with the borrower's attorney, attend the closing.
Discussing the intricacies of obtaining various types of mortgage loans, Ms. Scott summed up what she saw as an advantage offered by a broker.
"It's a time-consuming process," she said, "and the borrowers don't know the questions to ask."

HEADLINE: Ravens Team Up With a Renewed Yale Field

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
BABE RUTH played there, as did Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Ron Darling and a first baseman from Greenwich named George Bush. So, too, did the old Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Braves, along with Albie Booth and Larry Kelley, Yale football immortals who also starred in baseball. Indeed, no other ball park in Connecticut is as steeped in history as Yale Field.
But the question now is whether people will flock back to the field to see minor league baseball on what for 67 years has been almost wholly a university preserve -- even at a refurbished baseball shrine that is home to the state's newest professional sports team, the New Haven Ravens of the Double-A Eastern League. 
 Ed Massey, a Ridgefield businessman and Yale alumnus who came up with the idea, thinks they will. So does Charlie Dowd, general manager of the Ravens.
An initial hint may come on Thursday when the team plays its opening home game at 4 o'clock at the field on Derby Avenue (Route 34) in West Haven, across from the Latham Field House, Yale Bowl and the Connecticut Tennis Center. (The Ravens' first game was last Thursday in Binghamton, N.Y., and they will have played three times in Albany before making their home debut.)
The Ravens' entry into the Eastern League will create an in-state rivalry with the New Britain Red Sox, a Boston Red Sox farm team. It was largely for that reason that Joe Buzas, owner of the New Britain franchise, waived his 35-mile territorial rights to enable New Haven to obtain a franchise. The two cities are about 25 miles apart.
It was poor attendance that cost West Haven its franchise in 1982 after 11 years in the Eastern League. So a lot rides on the Ravens, an affiliate of the fledging Colorado Rockies of the National League, as well as Yale Field's charm and strategic site, just across the border from New Haven.
One of the most beautiful ball parks in the country, the stadium, now capable of seating 6,200, finally has lights for night games. Previous West Haven teams, which at different times were affiliated with the New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners and the Oakland Athletics, played in the dilapidated 4,000-seat Quigley Stadium, about two miles, but another world, away. Season attendance at Quigley ranged from a high of 75,000 in 1979 to a low of 23,000 in 1976. But the Ravens already have sold more than 125,000 tickets, according to Mr. Dowd. "I'll be disappointed if our attendance for the year doesn't top 250,000," he added, as about 100 workmen put the finishing touches on the Yale Field renovation.
In recent years minor league baseball, seemingly on the verge of extinction in the 1970's and early 80's, has undergone a revival. Overall attendance surpassed 30 million last year for the first time since 1950; the Eastern League set an attendance record for the fifth year in a row.
Soaring ticket prices at big league games together with high concession prices and parking fees and heavy traffic have helped the minor leagues thrive.
In addition, the Ravens have a valuable asset in Yale Field. For one thing, it is easily accessible, within minutes of Interstates 91 and 95 and the Merritt and Wilbur Cross parkways. For another, it is in a picturesque and quiet area. Third, while the field has been made more functional and comfortable, nothing has been done to detract from its special charm.
"Our objective was to preserve the character and the overall ambience of the park," said Glenn Gregg of Gregg & Wies, the New Haven architectural firm that designed the renovation. "The stadium still has its wonderful sightlines and the roof has its original configuration. And the exterior concrete wall and columns will remain the same."
But there are significant changes to the park where George Bush played first base for Yale in 1947 and 1948, where Ruth, Gehrig and Williams played in exhibition games, and where Booth, Yale's legendary Little Boy Blue, hit a grand slam home run to beat Harvard in a Commencement Day game in the early 1930's.
The interior of the stadium, which was built in 1927, was essentially gutted. New seats have been installed on a new steel and aluminum platform beneath the signature roof, which covers most of the grandstand, an unusual feature for a minor league ball park, let alone a college baseball stadium. Beneath the grandstand, a clubhouse for the home team has been built and restrooms and concession stands added.
 
Picnicking at the Game
 A berm, or small hillside, now stands beyond the right field fence where spectators can picnic while watching games. Building it necessitated moving in the right field fence, to 315 feet from 340 feet from home plate. But Mr. Gregg does not expect that to produce many more home runs. "The prevailing wind is to left field, not to right, so I think it might just equalize things," he said. "Anyway, we'd rather not have cookie-cutter dimensions like a lot of today's modern big league stadiums."
Other changes include a pavilion in the right field corner, where for $10 a head, including admission, members of groups of at least 25 people can eat as many hot dogs or hamburgers as they wish. A new electric scoreboard has been erected in left-center field, but Mr. Gregg is quick to point out that the ball park's landmark 50-foot-high green manual scoreboard in center field will remain and be operated as always, much like the one at Fenway Park in Boston.
Mainly because of the severe winter, the renovation will not be entirely finished by opening day. All the seats, most of them of the aluminum bleacher type, will have been installed, doubtless disappointing longtime Yale fans accustomed to the 5,300 individual wooden seats that had been in place since the first game at Yale Field in 1928.
"One of the reasons we took them out was because they were too narrow," Mr. Dowd said. "Fans obviously were smaller, and, I guess, thinner, when the park was built." Partly as a concession to Yale sentimentalists and partly out of nostalgia, the last row throughout the grandstand consists entirely of the old narrow seats.
Still to be decided is where to display the ball park's most famous seat, actually a double seat built especially for former President William Howard Taft, a Yale alumnus who became a law professor at his alma mater (and, later, Supreme Court justice) after leaving the White House. Taft, a rabid baseball fan who as President began the tradition of throwing out the first ball on opening day, weighed more than 300 pounds.
The Ravens' home opener, against the Reading (Pa.) Phillies, is a sellout at $3 for general admission ($2 for seniors and children under 13), $5 for reserved seats, $7 for box seats and, when available, $12.50 for boxes. Parking fees are $1 to $3.
Mr. Dowd, who was the general manager of a Class A team in Salinas, Calif., before joining the Ravens, thinks the intimacy of a ball park like Yale Field and its prices ($1.50 for a hot dog, about half of what it costs at most big league stadiums) will lure fans from as far away as Westchester County.
"We're offering inexpensive family entertainment in a beautiful setting," said Mr. Dowd, 31, who is a native of Staten Island. "A family of four which goes to a big league game nowadays can spend $125 or more easily. By comparison, at Yale Field for a Ravens game, it will be about $30. And you're much closer to the action."
Mr. Dowd, a former high school and college catcher who played for the Guilford Giants of the Men's Senior Baseball League last summer ("I don't think I'll have the time this year," he said), does not think that an affiliation with a major league team more than 2,000 miles away will handicap the Ravens.
"Minor league baseball nowadays sells itself," he said. "And, besides, I've got the feeling that Connecticut is a state without a specific city sports identity. We might draw a few more if we were a Yankee affiliate, but I don't think it's going to be a big factor."
Still, Mr. Dowd, Mr. Massey and other club officials were not about to name the team the New Haven Rockies. They remembered all too well how the West Haven Eastern League team had to change its name three times because of different major league affiliations. "We felt that with our own distinctive name, we could keep it regardless who we were affiliated with," he said.
That minor league baseball will be played at Yale Field at all surprises many Yale alumni and others in New Haven. In 1981, David Goldstein, then the owner of the West Haven A's, tried to move his team from Quigley Stadium to Yale Field, but Frank Ryan, the Yale athletic director, opposed the plan. (After the next season, the West Haven franchise folded.)
But in recent years Yale officials, including the current athletic director, Harold E. Woodsum, have become receptive to having a professional team play at Yale Field, whose playing surface Ruth once described as the best he had ever seen.
Yale Field was the main selling point that Mr. Massey and his associates, several of whom are also Yale alumni, used in bidding for an Eastern League franchise (which cost them $3 million) along with 13 other cities in 1992. The $3.5 million or so the renovation project cost came in loan from the Baseball Foundation of Connecticut, set up as a liaison between Yale and the Ravens. The loan is guaranteed by the state, Yale and Mr. Massey.
"The loan will be paid by money from the tax on admissions, from private donations and from the rent that Yale gets from the Ravens," said Mitch Truwit, the foundation's executive director. Already, a $500,000 donation toward the renovation project has been made by John White, a former Yale baseball and football player (class of 1942) and a New Haven native.
By contrast, the $18 million Connecticut Tennis Center was built almost entirely with state funds and has been used only for the weeklong Volvo tennis tournament during each of the last three years.
But baseball "is Everyman's sport," said Mayor John DeStefano,who proceeded Mr. Truwit as executive director of the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut and the Baseball Foundation. "And I think it's great for New Haven."
Both Mr. DeStefano and Matthew Nemerson, executive director of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce, said it was difficult to say whether the Ravens would benefit the city economically. "I really don't think that matters," Mr. Nemerson said. "What counts is that the Ravens are going to provide good family entertainment at reasonable prices and also promote New Haven as a safe city with a lot to offer. It's an investment in our future."
For a while, it appeared that the state would get a third Eastern League team when the ownership of the Albany Yankees announced last month that the club would move to Norwich next season. But that decision was put on hold after Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York protested the move and promised state funds to help renovate the team's stadium in Colonie, N.Y., outside Albany.
 
Many Stories, Some Tall
 Like most ball parks, that stadium, Heritage Park, does not compare with Yale Field, which, along with its charm, abounds with legends, some apparently apocryphal. Some old-timers claim that Ruth once hit a tremendous home run over the scoreboard in dead center field. Not true, said 84-year-old Mike Patricelli, who has rarely missed a Yale football or baseball game. In fact, he said, Ruth never hit a home run at Yale Field. "I was at the game when the Yankees played at Yale Field around 1930," Mr. Patricelli said, "and the Babe never hit one out. Neither did Lou Gehrig."
Then there is the legend of how Ted Williams, as a rookie, hit a titanic home run at Yale Field. But newspaper accounts of the day show that during a doubleheader between the Red Sox and Yale on April 16, 1939, Williams not only did not hit a home run, but went hitless in eight times at bat. However, the Red Sox beat the Eli in both games back in an era when there were only 16 major league teams, none further west than St. Louis.
As for Booth's grand slam homer, Mr. Patricelli said, "Albie definititely hit it, with the bases loaded, to beat Harvard."

HEADLINE: Helping Way Stations on New York's Greenway Trail

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
IT'S spring, and an appropriate time for thoughts to turn to the Greenway, the 300-mile system of trails that was supposed to stretch from Westchester to Albany, linking communities on both sides of the Hudson River. Whatever happened to it?
The idea was proposed about 10 years ago. Then in 1991, with the passage of the Greenway Act, the state started to designate a model Greenway community in each of the 10 counties along the proposed trail. 
 The state gives each community a grant of $50,000 to preserve open land along the water and to develop trails. It also helps them write waterfront master plans and provides other technical assistance.
One such community is the City of Troy in Rensselaer County, which parlayed an initial $25,000 grant into a plan that secured a $1.5 million grant from the Federal Government on March 17. The Federal grant will enable the city to build a pedestrian walkway from its downtown to a new viewing platform on the river, among other waterfront improvements.
"I'm not saying that Greenway can take the credit for Troy's plan," said David Sampson, executive director of the Greenway Council, a state agency in the Governor's office. "But they wouldn't have been able to do it without our help."
There are now nine model communities, among them the farming Town of Stuyvesant, population 2,200, in Columbia County. It became a model community last June in the hope that the program would help it gain access to the waterfront, which is separated from the town by the railroad tracks.
Four weeks ago, seven municipalities along the Albany County waterfront agreed to act as one model community to coordinate planning along the river to help bolster tourism and economic development.
In the midst of all this self-interest, how realistic is the ideal of the trail itself, which is what gives Greenway its name?
"All the model communities are making the establishment of a trail a part of their planning," said Mr. Sampson of the Greenway Council. Nevertheless, almost all of the 62 miles of trail already established is on state-owned land and none is in a model community.
The idea for the Greenway is credited to Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of Kingston. A decade ago, when he was a State Assemblyman, Mr. Hinchey said that "there was no overall planning for the Hudson Valley as an ecological entity" and that he "saw that as a threat to one of the country's most beautiful natural resources."
Around that time, a Federal report came out encouraging the establishment of "greenline parks," Mr. Hinchey said.
These are "linear parks connecting communities with a common interest in preserving their waterfront," he said, and "the two ideas just seemed to fit together."
In 1988, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo established the Greenway Council to plan the trail system. After passage of the Greenway Act a target date of 2005 was set for its completion.
"I think the target date is optimistic," said Maggie Vinciquerra, executive director of the Greenway Heritage Conservancy, a state agency created to help communities develop their trail systems. "Since participation is completely voluntary," she said, "a lot of communities will sit back and see how the other guy fares before getting involved."
Selling the idea of a Greenway to Hudson River towns has proved a painstaking process. Several still seem to have no idea what it is, and some are openly hostile to it.
At a meeting last fall of the nonprofit Hudson River Environmental Society, William Capshaw, a trustee of the Village of Dobbs Ferry, in Westchester, chastised Greenway officials for not making their goals clear to communities on the river.
"WHEN the Greenway was first proposed, it seemed the state was going to tell local governments what they could do with their waterfronts," Mr. Capshaw said. "I don't hear a lot of people talking about what the Greenway is doing now. It's great to be spiritual and propose this idea, but how's it really going to work?"
Ultimately, it will involve 10 counties: Albany, Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Orange, Putman, Rensselaer, Rockland, Ulster and Westchester. It will run from the mouth of the Mohawk River to the New Jersey border on the west side and from the Troy Dam to the New York City line on the east side. The trail will link urban, suburban and rural areas and weave in and out of historic, cultural and recreational resources.
The Greenway is currently financed by private donations and a 0.2 percent hotel tax levied in each Greenway county. New York City chose not to participate because of its already high hotel taxes.
Greenway officials are quick to point out that participation is completely voluntary. In fact, the Greenway Council doesn't even like to approach communities without first being invited.
"It's completely up to the individual community," said Mr. Sampson of the Greenway Council. "If it wants to protect its waterfront we're here to help them with that."
The Town of Stuyvesant was initially very resistant to Greenway. "We thought it was going to have eminent domain, purchase properties and control their use," said Tod Grenci, the Town Supervisor. "When the legislation passed, eminent domain was out and home rule was in. That's the only reason we got involved.
Stuyvesant has two at-grade railroad crossings, one on private land. The public crossing is not considered safe for hauling trailered boats to the water.
In a few months, even that may be closed off when the Department of Transportation begins a high-speed demonstration project between Stuyvesant and Schenectady. Trains will be passing through town at speeds between 110 and 125 miles an hour. They now travel at about 90. The state has indicated it might have to close several at-grade crossings along the route that were considered unsafe.
The town asked the Greenway Council to intervene with the Department of Transportation to keep an access road open so that it could usethe 234-acre waterfront parcel known as Nutten Hook, now owned by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. On it are a 19th-century ice house, an antique barn and other historic structures.
"We'd like to build a boat launch and develop a trail there that would take in some of the town's history," said Mr. Grenci. "Something that would be attractive to town residents and visitors."
THOUGH the bureaucracy has been moving at glacial speed, Mr. Grenci said, the Greenway Council did help arrange a meeting with Conrail and the Department of Transportation. "We finally got all parties together in a room to discuss options," Mr. Grenci said. Among the department's possible solutions were installing automatic gates on the public crossing and, ultimately, building an overpass.
The Villages of Ossining and Croton, in Westchester, which work in tandem as one model community, have asked the Department of Transportaion to repair a bridge linking the two communities and include a pedestrian and bike path. "That's exactly how the Greenway is supposed to work," said Mr. Sampson of the Greenway Council.
Ideally, the Greenway will also provide links between towns across the river from each other. Beacon, in Dutchess County, and Newburgh, in Orange, both model communites, have developed a 14-mile trail that crosses the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. They are expected to submit the trail for Greenway designation soon.
"We think the river should be seen as a connector, not a divider," said Clara-Lou Gould, Mayor of Beacon.
"Once communities see the benefits to be derived from the Greenway, we believe they'll want to get involved," said Mr. Sampson. "They'll see there's nothing to be afraid of."
Since most of the land along the Hudson is in private hands, Greenway officials acknowledge they will also have to work out easements or other arrangements with individual owners if the Greenway is to succeed.
Of the 62 miles now established, only 5 are on private land. "We'll continue to demonstrate the benefits of the Greenway to land owners," Mr. Sampson said. "If they want to work with us, fine. If they don't, we'll just go around them."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester;
Amtrak's Reprieve for Downtown New Rochelle

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
NEW ROCHELLE has received a welcome boost from a decision by Amtrak to continue to use the city's downtown train station and invest $92 million in track, platform and station renovations.
The railroad had been considering building a station elsewhere in the city but eventually yielded to community opposition to its abandoning the downtown. 
 The city is still reeling from the rejection last year of its bid to become the new world headquarters of Unicef. It had planned to build four office buildings, 550 units of housing and a retail complex on mostly city-owned property downtown to accommodate the organization.
When the agency decided to remain in Manhattan, downtown revitalization hopes seemed all but dead. Amtrak's departure could have dealt a final blow.
"There was universal opposition to Amtrak's leaving the downtown," said Joseph G. Madonna, the city's Commissioner of Development.
"If Amtrak hadn't stayed it would have been much more difficult to attract other businesses and developers to our central business district. This gives us a lift."
The city-owned train station is the only stop in Westchester on Amtrak's New York-to-Boston run. The tracks there are used by both Amtrak and Metro-North trains, which frequently results in delays and congestion.
Starting in 1998, Amtrak will introduce high-speed service on the line. As a result, it expects the number of trains that stop at New Rochelle to increase to 18, from the present 4, and the passenger volume to double to 160,000 a year, from 80,000. For this reason, said David J. Carol, director of the New York-Boston project, Amtrak believes the present station is inadequate.
Although the station itself is in "pretty good shape," Mr. Carol said, "we need to put in another window for Amtrak customers, and a self-ticketing system."
Moreover, he said, the lobby now has almost no seating. "For inter-city passengers with lugguage," he said, "we need to provide that."
But the greatest problem and biggest expense will involve work on and over the tracks. When Amtrak trains now arrive at New Rochelle, they have to cross three Metro-North tracks to get to the platform. When they leave they have to cross back again.
"This causes all sorts of problems," Mr. Carol said.
To ease this situation, the company plans to construct center-island platforms. Amtrack's trains will stay on their own tracks and pick up passengers from a new platform.
BY far the most expensive part of the project will be building a flyover, or bridge, over the tracks, about a quarter mile south of the station, where Amtrak trains will cross above Metro-North's tracks. "The flyover alone will cost about $65 million," Mr. Carol said. "This will be a $100 million job before it's done."
Amtrak officials maintain that renovating the existing station will cost $20 million more than building a new one. But Representative Nita M. Lowey, who represents New Rochelle and is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, lobbied extensively in favor of Amtrak's remaining where it is.
The project will be financed by the $1.3 billion the Federal Government has earmarked for the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, Mr. Carol said. While final details of the overall project are still being worked out and a construction start date has yet to be set, the project is expected to be completed by 1998.
For its part, Metro-North is also planning some improvements to the station, such as accommodating the disabled by installing an elevator, equipping platforms with tactile strips for the blind and lowering ticket windows for access from wheelchairs, according to a company spokesman, Daniel Brucker. In addition, he said, lighting will be upgraded and signs improved.
In addition, the city and both railroads will soon begin talking about building a parking garage at the station. Metro-North has said it needs 1,000 additional spaces at the station and Amtrak wants 300 for its customers. Exactly who's going to pay for what has yet to be established.
"We all have to sit down and hash this out," said Mr. Carol. "Since the city owns the land, I would hope that they will at least provide the property. It's very unusual to build a project like this with 100 percent Federal funding so we hope that the community and other parties will do their share on the parking facilities."
WHEN Amtrak announced its decision on Feb. 28 to stay at the station, Representative Lowey called it "a victory for New Rochelle." She said that the plan for renovating the station would "satisfy Amtrak's goal of expanded service and greater reliability while strengthening New Rochelle's downtown area."
The city is hoping that Amtrak's commitment to the downtown will be a giant step toward realizing its ultimate goal of becoming a transportation hub in Westchester.
In addition to the trains, there are buses that connect New Rochelle to Long Island as well as to upstate New York communities, such as Monticello and Binghamton. And there is limousine service to New York City's airports. The various transportation activities are now spread out all over the city.
New Rochelle's Department of Development is now seeking Federal funds toestablish an Intermodal Surface Transportation Center to be built around the train station.
"I wasn't aware that we had all this transportation in the city," said William C. Fahey, counsel to the city for the intermodal project. He recently completed a first draft of a grant proposal for Federal funds for construction of a center where all modes of transportation would be consolidated and connected to one another. As envisioned by Mr. Fahey, the center would include a bus station connected to the train station by a walkway. The document is now being circulated for comments.
Financing for such a project, Mr. Fahey said, could be available through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, the Clear Air Quailty Act and the Northeast Corridor Project.
Some of this Federal financing is meant to encourage private investment in such transportation facilites, Mr. Fahey said.
"We're ideally suited for that since the station is located right in the downtown," he said. "It could attract local office development and retail establishments. This is the kind of thing you see in Europe all the time. We're just catching on to it here."

HEADLINE: On Expanding Vernon Resort Area

 BODY:
Like many Sussex Countyans, I was shocked by an incredibly unbalanced front-page article, "Vernon Resort Expansion Plan Meets Criticism," on March 6. In addition to unjustly damaging the image and accomplishments of Gene Mulvihill, chairman of Great American Recreation, and his many Sussex County enterprises, the article has also slandered our area State Senator, several Vernon Township officials, local business people and, in effect, our county itself.
Granted, Mr. Mulvihill has been ambitious and aggressive and at times has cut corners. In my view, however, Mr. Mulvihill was and is primarily "guilty" of two things: first, the creation of nearly 2,000 full- and part-time jobs in a county where two-thirds of the work force must commute out of county to find work. Second, his projects (Great Gorge Spa, Golf Course, Action Park, Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and now the Hamburg Mountain wilderness complex) served to open for public recreation areas that heretofore were inaccessible because of lack of infrastructure or simply because they were off-limits state/private lands. 
 Instead of "plundering" the areas, as a critic quoted in the article suggests, Mr. Mulvihill (after others tried and failed) created a balanced recreational complex that should be a model for those seeking a equitable blend of environmental and economic concerns. But, reading the article, one might conclude that Mr. Mulvihill was akin to a scoundrel in the business of operating nuclear waste incinerators and landfills in the midst of pristine woodlands.
The article reports that critics say Mr. Mulvihill gets his way because he has Vernon Township government "in his pocket." This must come as a shock to Mr. Mulvihill, who constantly must do battle with town officials who, partly in response to overzealous environmentalists and elitists, hold him to a far stricter standard than other developers and entrepreneurs.
The implied conspiracy between Mr. Mulvihill and area officials simply doesn't exist, despite the overlap of names. Fact is, in a small county like Sussex, one of our historic problems is that because of our size, presumed conflicts do appear because the number of individuals willing to become positively involved, in anything, is very limited. Honest.

HEADLINE: Shouldn't Art Support Start at Home?

 BODY:
Your frequent articles on the Westchester Arts Council (the latest, "Art Advocates Troop to Albany to Seek a Piece of the Pie," March 20) and its attempts to seek public funds omit a crucial reality: that the council evidently sees itself as a quasi-public agency with more and more financing from the public rather than the private sector.
Meanwhile, political double-talk is still alive and well in the state of New York. Senator George E. Pataki, who with Change-NY laments the use of public funds for a myriad of agencies that should, in his view, be privatized, apparently sees nothing wrong in using tax money to help pay $100,000 a year to the council's executive director, Janet T. Langsam, who administers an annual budget of about $1.5 million. Consider that her salary is just $20,000 less than that of County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, who administers an annual budget in excess of $1 billion. 
 Not the least tragi-comic aspect of this Gothic situation is that neither Langsam, nor Pataki, nor Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky ("one of the strongest arts proponents in the Westchester delegation") are listed in the council's newsletter among annual contributors of $250 and over. It would appear that they do not part with their own money for the arts while they argue vigorously that we should part with ours, individually and collectively.
In any case, the belief that every dollar contributed to the arts affects the economy positively had its inspiration in the early 1970's when it was discovered that Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts might go bankrupt. The idea worked in New York City and environs. But since that time, symphony orchestras have gone out of business in other American cities, and the cities and their economies have survived.
Given the flaws of the economic argument and the nonrelevance to artistic quality of the council's current suggestions -- that the arts "keep elderly people stimulated and that they are essential in the schools" -- the arts in Westchester may be in serious trouble.
Put another way, if the council is demanding public funding for the arts, then the public should demand better thinking and more intelligent arguments (if it can get them) from the council.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A New Theory of Continental Drift

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
HAVING slavishly followed the American stock and bond markets downward over the previous few weeks, it was only fitting that the European markets bounced back somewhat last week in synch with their counterparts across the Atlantic.
By the close on Friday in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares stood at 3,120.8, up 34.38 for the week. In Paris, the CAC-40 closed at 2,114.77, up 32.83 for the week. The DAX index in Frankfurt rose 70.23 for the week to close at 2,203.34. 
 But as the immediate panic of the last few weeks subsided, it exposed what are perhaps the key questions for investors in European markets:
Can Europe, which is at a different point in the economic cycle from the United States and should still be enjoying the benefits of falling interest rates, uncouple itself from the bearish psychology that took hold on Wall Street when the Federal Reserve began raising rates? And in the meantime, what linkage should investors expect between tighter money in the United States and the performance of stock and bond markets in Europe?
Sushil Wadhwani and Mushtaq Shah, global strategists at Goldman, Sachs International in London, have taken a whack at those questions. In a report issued last week, they examined what has happened in Europe in past cases when the Federal Reserve sought to rein in unsustainable economic growth in the United States and choke off inflation by raising short-term interest rates, as it is doing now.
Between June 1983 and May 1984, they wrote, the Fed pushed short-term rates up by just under one percentage point, causing long-term rates, as measured by bond yields, to rise 2.55 points. But six months later, with the markets convinced that growth and inflation were under control, long-term rates had fallen back by 1.64 points.
Between February and September 1987, the Fed pushed up short-term rates by 0.83 points, causing long-term rates to increase 2.34 points. Six months later, long-term rates had fallen back by 1.09 points.
Drawing a parallel to today's investment psychology, the Goldman, Sachs strategists called those periods "growth scares" in the markets. In the 1983-84 scare, equities in the United States had a total return of -0.3 percent. In Britain in that period, total return on shares was 9.5 percent. In Germany, it was 9.1 percent, and in France, 50.5 percent.
In the 1987 scare, total return on equities in the United States was 15 percent. In Britain, it was 23 percent. In Germany, it was 14.2 percent, and in France, -2.3 percent.
In both cases, stocks generally outperformed bonds, suggesting that the equity markets were able to detach themselves from the psychology of rising interest rates.
The Goldman, Sachs team concluded that European equities were able to "decouple" from the American markets, though more clearly in 1983-84 than in 1987. But they offered some caveats.
"Decoupling from the U.S. bond yield can take time -- equities took time to break free from bonds after the Fed tightenings in 1983 and 1987," they wrote. "Moreover, there is a limit to how much interest rates can rise without equities suffering. In 1987, the rise in rates led to valuations becoming so extended that a stock market crash did follow."
Still, Goldman, Sachs took away from its study a basically bullish view on European equities for the rest of the year. Although long-term rates in the United States could continue rising for part of the year, causing more weakness in stock prices, rates should eventually start falling as economic growth is brought back down to sustainable levels.
In the meantime, Goldman, Sachs said, European stock markets are still relatively undervalued and should be helped by an earnings recovery.
"We believe that the likely persistence of a growth scare makes it somewhat more probable that European equities will experience some near-term weakness," the Goldman team said. "The most likely outcome remains, however, that the underlying fundamentals will eventually reassert themselves, so longer-term-oriented investors may, over the next few months, accumulate equities on weakness. We continue to expect 10 percent to 15 percent appreciation in European equities on a 12-month view."
Many other analysts agree, sometimes citing such other factors as the likelihood of continuing rate cuts in Germany and other big European nations.
But some strategists see continuing questions, if not problems, when it comes to the relationship between Europe and the American markets.
David C. Roche, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley in London, has for some time predicted that the huge flow of funds from American investors into European stocks and bonds was likely to dry up as rates rise in the United States, pulling a critical source of strength out from under the markets.
As a predictor of the behavior of investors in the United States, Mr. Roche said he is keeping a close eye on the flow of money into mutual funds, which has been continuing but at a lower rate than previously.
"U.S. investors have been conditioned to buy on dips," Mr. Roche said in a report last week. "The next few weeks will see if they continue to do so. If they don't, then I think the markets could fall another 15 percent. If they maintain inflows into mutual funds, then this sell-off will be only a correction, and we are closer to the end of it than the beginning."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
When Brokerage Chiefs Bail Out

BYLINE: By Susan Antilla 

 BODY:
IF it's true that it pays to hang on to stocks for the long haul, then why have brokerage-firm big shots been bailing out?
Officers and directors of the nation's brokerage firms have been big sellers of their companies' stock this year. Their reasons are predictable: tax planning or portfolio diversification. Or for retirement, college bills, the new house, the old wife. 
 All sorts of financial demands surface that never seem to when the company is selling at half of book value.
Lee Fensterstock, executive vice president at the Paine Webber Group, unloaded 38,500 shares of Paine Webber at prices between $17.65 and $18.56 in January and February. He needed cash to buy a house, according to a Paine Webber spokesman. And Mr. Fensterstock made a second move in his account in which he moved 20,000 restricted shares into a deferred compensation plan -- first exchanging the shares for cash. Not the sort of move you make when you think a stock has farther to go.
Brokerage firm executives, in fact, have been big sellers since 1991, said Robert Gabele of CDA Invest/Net, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., tracker of buying and selling by the corporate insiders who must, by law, inform the Securities and Exchange Commission about all their trades in their company shares.
While Mr. Gabele notes that the selling by securities executives accelerated in the fall -- in anticipation, perhaps, of the market's recent drop -- he and others say that a longer-term factor seems to be at work.
"These firms have had years of breaking earnings records, and the feeling is that it will be hard to replicate that as we go forward," said Michael Lewis, financial services analyst at Dean Witter. "Especially in a rising interest rate environment, I guess they must see the writing on the wall."
Not a single share owned by a Paine Webber insider was sold in 1990, according to Mr. Gabele's records, when the stock traded between $5.125 and $9.156. In 1991, though, as Paine Webber shares moved to $16.50, insiders began to cash in, selling 96,750 shares bought with options plus 87,000 shares with no ties to options privileges. In 1992, Paine Webber insiders sold 240,625 shares (161,458 related to options), and last year they sold 637,420 shares (31,600 were options-related).
At Merrill Lynch and other publicly traded brokerage houses, selling patterns were similar, Mr. Gabele said. Merrill insiders sold only 310 shares in 1990, but became more aggressive sellers in each year since, selling 480,000 shares through options and open-market purchases last year. (Merrill quibbles with Mr. Gabele's 1993 number, noting that the 80,000 shares sold by its former chairman shouldn't count.)
It's worth keeping a sharp eye on buying and selling by brokerage-industry executives in particular, Mr. Gabele said, because they can provide more information than the average insider at a publicly held company.
"When you look at the insider concept generally you figure all these guys have got to know something about their company," he explained. "But when you look at Wall Street insiders, you can take it farther, because these insiders are in the business of knowing something about the market. The Wall Street insider may be more of a market timer."
That theory is dismissed by many on Wall Street, who make a case that the public filings on insider selling miss part of the story. Senior staffers are increasingly compensated with stock, they argue, and the purchasing that goes on in employee stock plans needn't be reported to the S.E.C. William Montgoris, a lawyer at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that his firm has purchased 100 million of its own shares for employee compensation plans since July 1. In the first three months of this year, though, insiders unloaded more than 300,000 shares -- and that doesn't give a clue as to any activity by lower-ranking Bear, Stearns staffers who don't have to file with the S.E.C.
Mark Thompson, a spokesman at Charles Schwab & Company, said his company has been engaged in similar purchase programs, picking up 700,000 shares in the first quarter of this year because "our shares have been available at particularly attractive prices."
But you have to wonder why those bargain prices didn't catch the eye of the founder, Charles Schwab, who sold 300,000 shares at $27.05 apiece on Feb. 17. Or Lawrence J. Stupski, an officer and company director, who got rid of 40,000 shares in the first quarter. Selling at Schwab has risen from 175,000 shares sold by insiders in 1990 to 350,000 in 1991, 900,000 in 1992 and 889,000 in 1993. Mr. Schwab and his family still own 24.3 percent of the company, down only slightly from 25 percent a year ago, a spokesman noted.
Not every company is watching an executive bailout. At Alex. Brown & Sons, the investment bank in Baltimore, 28 insider purchases in the first quarter outweighed only 12 sales. But even there, enough of the sales were tied to expiring options to make the buying less bullish than it initially appears. For the most part, it looks as if the smart money is cashing in for now -- even at mutual fund purveyors like T. Rowe Price. Carter O. Hoffman, a T. Rowe director, sold 40,000 shares in mid-March. Thomas Broadus Jr. sold 10,000 at $28 apiece in January. And Alvin M. Younger, the company treasurer, got rid of 4,200 shares, too, when T. Rowe shares were trading at $34.50.
But never fear that this was some bad omen for the market. Mr. Hoffman got out as a diversification move related to his retirement planning, a spokesman said. And Mr. Broadus has been "average cost selling," also related to retirement planning. Mr. Younger needed to sell "to meet income tax bills this year due to the rise in the income tax rate that took effect."
They were lucky their personal needs struck when they did. By Friday's close, T. Rowe was 22 percent below where it was when Mr. Younger and Mr. Hoffman sold only a month ago.

HEADLINE: The Men Who Really Run Fortress Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
HAVING spent a part of his youth in the New York City area, including a year at Scarsdale High School, Tatsuya Terazawa is as comfortable with America as he is with Tokyo. But an experience during his years at the Harvard Business School crystallized for him the gulf that separates Japan, the country he now serves as an elite government bureaucrat, and the United States.
Mr. Terazawa's class was studying a failed airline and it was shown a taped interview with the company's president. The president noted with pride that through it all he had never sought Government help. The class, Mr. Terazawa recalled with astonishment, erupted into applause. 
 "There is strong resistance to government intervention in America, I understand that," said Mr. Terazawa, whose employer, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, epitomizes for many here the heavy role the Government still plays in the Japanese economy. "But I was shocked. There are many stakeholders in companies. What happened to all his employees? We have not reached a point where we can make such cold-hearted decisions."
Reflecting on what he views as America's blind devotion to a free-market ideology, Mr. Terazawa added: "It is something quite close to a religion. You cannot argue about it with most people. You believe it or you don't."
President Clinton took office last year promising an aggressive trade policy to open Japan's markets more fully to American companies. The optimism on both sides grew last August when Morihiro Hosokawa, another former southern governor promising reform, became Prime Minister. The two young leaders seemed to share a common goal of taming Japan's huge imbalances.
Yet today, Japan's surplus with the United States is hitting records, talks on measures to remove market barriers collapsed in February and the relationship between the world's two largest economies is at its lowest ebb in years. And on Friday, Mr. Hosokawa announced his surprise resignation, brought down by a financial scandal.
What has gone wrong? Some Japanese officials say the United States has demanded too much. But President Clinton and a growing number of Japanese blame entrenched bureaucrats like Mr. Terazawa, with their subtly nationalistic policies.
Never mind that Mr. Terazawa, 33 years old, is seven rungs down the ladder in MITI's hierarchy, an otherwise anonymous figure in a blue suit toiling long hours in cluttered quarters. American officials have learned the hard way that the way bureaucrats like him view American trade demands may matter as much as, and these days some would argue more than, what the top politicians think. If anything, Mr. Hosokawa's resignation only helped the bureaucrats; they can now operate with even less interference.
 
An Unshakable Confidence
 Mr. Terazawa and three other civil servants interviewed at the country's two most powerful economic ministries -- MITI and the Finance Ministry -- do not fit the stereotype that an American might have of a bureaucrat. They are among an intellectually nimble, hard-working elite of 11,000 sitting atop Japan's million or so national civil servants. They oversee perhaps the most closely regulated economy in the industrialized world.
It is an elite whose defining characteristic is an unshakable confidence in its ability to look after the nation's interests better than the people themselves or the representatives they elected.
"We represent the national interest," stated Masamichi Kono, in the Finance Ministry.
The bureaucrats here influence policy making to an extent unthinkable in the United States.
In Washington, one of the first jobs of any new President is appointing the several hundred officials who will ride herd over the civil service and insure that the White House controls the nation's course. In Japan, by contrast, prime ministers appoint only their cabinet ministers and a few dozen other politicians who work inside the ministries but exercise little power.
In Washington, the President, and members of Congress, can draw from their large staffs, and many other sources of expertise independent of the civil service, to gather information and then lay out policy options. Japanese politicians, however, do not have their own policy making staffs, nor does the Diet, or Parliament.
The politicians are forced to rely on the bureaucrats instead. Even the Prime Minister has virtually no policy making staff of his own.
If American bureaucrats rejected or attempted to subvert the White House's policies, they might be fired or at least transferred. But in Japan, bureaucrats rarely lose their jobs over such issues. For example, they were blamed for watering down and fighting Mr. Hosokawa's call for sweeping economic deregulation; the number of regulations here actually rose by several hundred last year, to 11,402. Yet Mr. Hosokawa made no personnel changes to get the bureaucracy behind his program.
Even when Japanese leaders have exercised their constitutional power and overridden the bureaucracy, the results have often been disappointing. For example, the previous Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, last July pushed through the trade deal with President Clinton known as the "framework agreement." It provided a blueprint for talks on a series of market openings and reductions in Japan's trade surpluses.
But when it came time to implement the deal, the bureaucrats came up with an interpretation far different from the Clinton Administration's on the key question of how progress would be measured. That led to the collapse of the talks in February.
"To put it unkindly, they are being tamed by the bureaucrats," Yukio Suzuki, a professor of economics at Reitaku University, wrote recently of the governing coalition.
The bureaucrats have good reason for their self-confidence. They are usually credited with spearheading Japan's impressive recovery from the ruins of World War II, and then steering Japan through the trauma of the oil shocks. By designing an industrial policy that put producers ahead of consumers, protected the markets here and exercised great control over industry, they turned Japan into an economic superpower.
Today, the philosophical winds have shifted and the bureaucrats pledge fidelity to deregulation and openness. Some markets, from beef and citrus to supercomputers, have been opened somewhat. But the persistence of Japan's surpluses, and the complaints of numerous foreign companies that many barriers remain, are evidence in the minds of the bureaucracy's many critics that underneath the rhetoric much is unchanged.
Politicians here have often thrown up their hands when confronted with the power of the bureaucracy, even in the Diet. "The core problem is that the Diet has lost its basic function of checking the bureaucracy," said Shusei Tanaka, a member of the Diet who had advised Mr. Hosokawa.
Even some former bureaucrats have joined in the criticism. "In present-day Japan, there is the problem of ministries but no government," Naohiro Amaya, an architect of MITI's modern industrial policy, wrote recently. "Bureaucrats in each ministry, intoxicated with ministerial nationalism, are barricading themselves in ministry forts and are clinging to their own territory. Such ministry forts must be destroyed."
But that will not be easy. The bureaucrats are highly sophisticated, and skilled at using arguments about the sanctity of free markets against Washington. Interviews with the four bureaucrats revealed a dynamic adversary that, while it might be altering its rhetoric, is sticking to its own timetable for change.
 
Bred for the Job
 Like many at the highest level of the bureaucracy, Shigeo Kashiwagi, 43, was all but bred for his job. His maternal grandfather was a Finance Ministry bureaucrat and his father was a vice minister of finance before taking his "descent from heaven," as bureaucratic retirements are known, to become a bank chairman. Like Mr. Kashiwagi's father, many bureaucrats go on to politics or to financial institutions.
The great majority at Mr. Kashiwagi's level, although not he himself, have graduated from the nation's best university, Tokyo University. Almost all men, they have passed both a grueling exam and weeks of interviews at the ministry where they want to work. They work well into most evenings and frequently socialize together.
A forceful debater who is a director in the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, Mr. Kashiwagi helps compose Japan's policies for bodies like the Group of Seven industrial nations and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. As an expert on fiscal policy, he is also a key defender against persistent criticisms that the Government is not doing enough to lift its economy out of the two-year-old recession.
The Clinton Administration argues a stronger Japanese economy would draw in more imports and thus reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus. It has advocated big tax cuts and increases in public works spending.
However, the Finance Ministry's bureaucrats have rejected large-scale income tax cuts without countervailing increases in the national sales tax, saying that otherwise the country would be saddled with big budget deficits. Japanese society is aging swiftly, Mr. Kashiwagi explained, leaving it with mounting costs for pensions and health care. It would be reckless to permit the Government's budget deficit to swell.
"We are here to preserve fiscal discipline," he said. "At the same time we have to look after the economy, but we're going to foster its long-term development, not just watch it from quarter to quarter."
He added: "Fiscal policy is made by a sovereign country. It should be a policy we pursue on our own."
 
The One Who Knows
 Masamichi Kono, 38 and the son of a banker, lived for a few years in New York City, attending elementary school at P.S. 24 in the Bronx. Now, as a special officer for planning in the Finance Ministry's Banking Bureau, he exemplifies the power that Japanese bureaucrats sometimes have over the setting of policy.
Mr. Kono has been pivotal in mopping up after one of the great financial debacles of this century, the bursting of Japan's so-called "bubble economy." Japan's banks have been left with tens of billions of dollars in sour real estate loans -- no one but the bureaucrats knows the precise amount, because reliable figures are not disclosed -- and Mr. Kono has helped formulate policies for dealing with the crisis.
In mid-February, a Government package to revive the economy included an initiative for helping the banks write off losses from bad loans to finance companies. But banks were told nothing of it until it was concluded, Mr. Kono said. The bureaucrats completely controlled the process.
Being at the center of this flow of sensitive information has given Mr. Kono another form of influence. Frequently, he said, opposition members of the Diet approach him for briefings about the banking situation to assist in the formulation of questions for the Finance Minister in parliamentary proceedings. And Japanese cabinet ministers, who often are only vaguely familiar with the substance of policy, generally pass questions to the bureaucrats for answering. Mr. Kono helps devise the responses that involve banking issues.
Thus, Mr. Kono said, he sometimes effectively asks and then responds to his own questions in the parliament.
 
Hard to Convince

If there is a phrase that captures Tatsuya Terazawa's basic approach to trade negotiations with the United States, it is "Never again!"
One of his formative experiences at MITI, he said, was the negotiation in 1986 on opening Japan's market for computer chips. Japan ultimately agreed to make what Mr. Terazawa called an informal, good-faith effort to provide a 20 percent market share for foreign semiconductors.
Later, however, the United States applied enormous pressure on Japan to guarantee the 20 percent level as a minimum, threatening sanctions if it was not achieved. The American side claimed that was the understanding from the start.
"I personally heard all the U.S. comments at that time -- 'That's not a guarantee. Don't worry about that figure,' " said Mr. Terazawa, a deputy director in MITI's Americas division who helps chart trade policies toward the United States. "And now look at what they have done. It's ridiculous. Well, we have a very strong institutional memory here."
The experience, Mr. Terazawa said, reinforced his already strong resistance to the idea of Japan's agreeing to set up targets for the import of foreign goods or for reductions in the trade surplus. That, in fact, has been the principal hangup between Japan and the United States in the faltering "framework" talks.
The Japanese say targets violate the principles of a market economy.
Japan, a market economy? Well, yes, Mr. Terazawa admitted, MITI and other ministries intervened heavily and managed the economy in the early postwar years. But, he insisted, those days are gone.
Nevertheless, the old, paternalistic Japanese bureaucrat is never far behind. For instance, one American demand is that burdensome Japanese procedures for certifying imported products be simplified.
Mr. Terazawa's response: "It's easy to say, 'Let's get rid of those certifications.' But we have to think about the livelihood of the people engaged in those activities, the inspectors and other officials. That is the difference with us. We are concerned for those people."
 
Putting On a New Face

To hear Seiji Hagiwara speak is to understand a lot about the vigor with which the new generation of bureaucrats is trying to recast its image.
Mr. Hagiwara, who at 37 is a deputy director in MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau, declares himself totally committed to free-market theory, which he picked up during two years of graduate study at Princeton. A heavy-handed Government role in the economy is passe in his view.
"We are not regulators," he said of the MITI bureaucrats. "We are changers, transformers."
His main focus at the moment is coming up with policies to eliminate one of the most blatant and stubborn reminders of what he refers to as the old MITI: the huge disparities in retail prices between the United States and Japan, where consumers pay among the highest prices in the world, even for Japanese goods.
"In the old days, it was always said that excessive competition was bad," Mr. Hagiwara said. "Now, it is totally the opposite. We need competition to improve our efficiency."
Still, the process will probably be slow and at the bureaucrats' own pace. A Wal-Mart could bring Japanese consumer prices more in line with world levels overnight. Mr. Hagiwara thinks a more appropriate period would be five years.
 
 
 
HOW SHOULD U.S. RESPOND?
 UP to now, much of President Clinton's Japan policy was premised on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa proving more flexible in trade talks than the Government bureaucrats. The hope was that the political leaders would override the bureaucrats.
Now that Mr. Hosokawa has resigned and the political order is in disarray, how should the United States proceed?
Perhaps the first lesson from Mr. Hosokawa's stormy eight months in office was that, for all its trying, the United States could not influence Japan's domestic politics.
First, the Clinton Administration eased up in its demands to avoid undermining Mr. Hosokawa's fragile governing coalition. Once his base was firmed up, the argument went, Mr. Hosokawa would grant concessions.
But Mr. Hosokawa did not benefit from the relaxation of American pressure, nor did he appear to be hurt when American officials got tough recently.
Second, agreements should be as detailed and clear as possible. Earlier agreements were too vague, experts say.
Third, the United States should find important groups that stand to benefit from market openings, and use them to pressure the bureaucracy. C. Fred Bergsten, head of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Mr. Hosokawa demonstrated how popular a politician can become by promising to deliver a share of Japan's enormous prosperity to consumers. Deregulation and market openings, which would probably lower consumer prices, could give the ruling party great popular support, he said.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former trade negotiator, said Government intransigence must be made painful for corporate Japan. The American Government should apply pressure to Japanese companies operating in the United States, by encouraging a strong yen and through aggressive enforcement of antitrust, tax and other laws. The companies would then push the Japanese bureaucracy to come to terms, Mr. Prestowitz said.

THE ECONOMY
 
After a Merely Gray Monday, the Sun Burst Forth on Tuesday
After unpleasant inflation signals a week ago, Wall Street was braced for a black Monday, with the President's economic advisers even piping in over the weekend with soothing words on interest rates. But in a day of yo-yo trading, with the Dow industrials down more than 80 points during the session, Monday was merely gray, as the Dow lost 42. Investors were so relieved not to witness the crash of '94 that the next day the Dow shot up 82, the biggest rally in two years. That done, it settled for small rises the next two days, before slipping back on Friday to end the week 38 ahead -- all the while, of course, acting as a faithful mirror to interest rates. The question now: having had a moderate "correction," then an upward correction to that correction, is the market now correct -- or is there still some tidying up to do after that long bull-market party? Hint: Watch interest rates. 

Can Auto Sales Be Too Strong?
Enough already! That was one reaction last week to the latest data on vehicle sales -- a startling 19.7 percent surge over March 1993. Yes, there can be too much of a good thing: dealers could run out of cars, and too-heady growth could help push a fretting Fed to another dread interest-rate increase. And investors in auto stocks would just as soon have things build slowly, steadily. "The recovery is over," one analyst said. "The boom has started." But we know what can follow a boom.
 
Munis: If You Pay, Don't Play
The S.E.C. made it official last week: There shall be no mutual back-scratching by municipal bond dealers and officials who award bond contracts. This is the issue that haunted Elizabeth Holtzman recently, after a $450,000 loan to her campaign when she was New York City Comptroller. Under new agency rules, firms that give money to state or city politicians privy to bond decisions may not sell that state or city's bonds for two years. Securities firms adopted even tougher voluntary rules last fall, but the S.E.C. must have wanted to put its stamp on it. Arthur Levitt Jr., S.E.C. chairman, said he was spurred to act because the "pay to play" idea seemed all too ethically acceptable to the younger set. The next hurdle: keeping the loopholes sealed tight.
 
A '75 Warning on Implants
Whether tinkering with their allotment or doing post-surgical repair, a million or so American women have had silicone breast implants. But for thousands of them, this trifling with nature went terribly wrong, and many have sued the makers, saying the implants caused nasty immune disorders. Who was to know? Well, last week it appeared that one maker, Dow Corning, may have had a glimmer of the horrors way back in 1975. Patients' lawyers, sifting through dusty papers, say they've found an old Dow study showing that a certain silicone harms the immune systems of mice. A Dow lawyer insists the amounts of dangerous silicone in implants is insignificant, but a lawyer for hundreds of women calls it "the nail in Dow's coffin."
 
A Fed Chorus, Not a Solo
As recent market gyrations make crystal clear, the Federal Reserve's interest-rate moves make big waves. So it's a bit scary to think this power resides in one person. Others at the Fed seem to share that fear, for the central bank's rate adjustments, it appears, have become group decisions, not solo acts by Alan Greenspan. That explains why recent increases were announced right after policy meetings. It's not clear whether there's a loss of faith in Mr. Greenspan, but a public used to pinning blame or credit on him must now look to a fuzzier assemblage.
 
Great Minds, Great Losses
You need not be a genius to lose a few thousand dollars in the markets: just buy the wrong stock, and watch its price dribble away. But most mortals, try as they might, would be hard put to make $600 million vanish overnight. That requires a strategy so complex it puts chess grandmasters to shame. But a hotshot fund manager named David Askin did it recently. Investing in mortgage securities using a strategy said to be "market neutral" -- you rake in the golden crumbs no matter what the fates hurl at you -- he watched the markets slam his funds from neutral to fast reverse, wiping them out. Some creditors were, shall we say, a bit upset, and the lawsuits started, so last week Mr. Askin's three funds ducked into bankruptcy.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Please Don't Eat These Crayons
In an ideal world, children would just draw pictures with crayons, not mash them into the new carpet -- and certainly not eat them. But this being an imperfect world, eat them they do, so they must be free of lead. Last week it turned out that hundreds of thousands of boxes of crayons from China had traces of lead, and they were recalled by the Government. Of course, millions of boxes are sold yearly, so these are needles in a multicolored haystack, but if you want to be safe, make sure your crayons carry this rather cumbersome notation: "Conforms to ASTM D-4236."
 
Uniting to Build Supersonic Jets
For all their fame, and notoriety, a mere 14 Concordes were sold by British Aerospace and Aerospatiale, and the plane was a financial disaster. But with the current fast growth in long-haul routes, aerospace companies worldwide are competing fiercely to build the next supersonic jet. Americans are rushing forward. And last week Europe stepped up its efforts, as the French and British companies said they'd link up with Deutsche Aerospace, their Airbus partner. Like the Concorde, Europe's new plane would cruise at twice the speed of sound, but it would hold 250 passengers, to the Concorde's 100, and could make it to Asia from Europe or America. But there's still that sonic boom.
 
COMPANIES
 
Winning Grumman, at a Price
On its own, Grumman was hurting. But when it sought a buyer, its virtues suddenly shone through, and the skirmish began. When the dust settled, Northrop had outbid Martin Marietta, $2.1 billion ($62 a share) to $1.93 billion ($55). Did Northrop overpay? "Grumman was the right opportunity at $55," said a Martin Marietta spokesman, "but not at $62." But Kent Kresa, Northrop chairman, insisted it was a "fair price" and the deal would pay off. That remains to be seen. What's certain is that many workers (Grumman has 8,900 on Long Island) will be joining the jobless lines.
 
Death at the Top at Disney
In the last decade, Disney has gone through a rebirth worthy of a full-rigged fairy tale. Annual revenues have gone from $1.5 billion to $8.5 billion, but, more notable to posterity's eye -- not to mention the pre-10 set -- it has waved its wondrous wand and revived classic animation. "Beauty and the Beast." "Aladdin." "The Little Mermaid." Enough said. The most visible power behind the wand: Michael Eisner, the chairman. But backstage was an equally visionary president: Frank Wells. Mr. Wells was marked by an adventurous spirit that led him to try to climb the world's highest mountains, and to ride a helicopter to remote skiing spots. Last week, the helicopter crashed, killing Mr. Wells at 62.
 
Putting A.T.& T. on Hold
Not so fast! That was a judge's message to A.T.& T. last week as he blocked its $12.6 billion purchase of McCaw Cellular, a deal that would allow one company to offer both wired and wireless chitchat. Harold Greene, the very judge who presided over the A.T.& T. breakup, said that because of some McCaw properties, the deal violates a rule that bars A.T.& T. from reacquiring old Bell assets. The deal is still expected to go through -- after possible fine tuning and certain delays. But the ruling was also a message to those dazzled by talk of that information interstate: It's just not going to appear overnight.
 
Scrapping a Cable Deal
The take-it-slow message was also audible last week when Southwestern Bell and Cox scrapped a $4.9 billion cable venture. Again, the pairing of technologies seems a natural: phone companies with their dazzlingly fast switching systems, cable companies with the ability to deliver all that programming. But, again, the future can wait. The concern now is tougher new rate regulation. If the money can't flow freely, they figured, better not risk the uncertainty. And with the ditching of the Bell Atlantic-T.C.I. merger in February, there's not as much fear of being overpowered by that mighty rival.
 
At USAir, All Sizes Welcome
It's taking airlines a long time to stop thinking of flight attendants as aisle decorations of the "coffee, tea or me" school. But they're getting there. Last week USAir stopped making attendants fit its weight standards -- 130 pounds, say, for a 5-foot-3 woman. Not that it did so in a spirit of expansiveness. It was settling a Federal lawsuit, and agreed to pay $90,000 -- some to women who weren't hired, some to women who were dismissed. But does anything go now? No: flight attendants must still be able to move comfortably down the aisle and fit through the emergency window. It wouldn't be bad if passengers could too.

HEADLINE: Russia's Version of Sticker Shock: The $50,000 Chevy

BYLINE: Ann Imse is a freelance writer who served as a Moscow correspondent for The Associated Press from 1988 to 1991.
<BL>By ANN IMSE

 BODY:
JUST inside the showroom of the General Motors dealership in downtown Moscow, a businessman from Uzbekistan ran his finger along a Chevrolet Caprice. "This kind of car has long been my dream," he whispered, half to himself.
But such dreams are becoming elusive even for the country's burgeoning entrepreneurial class. 
 Since autumn, rising import duties have pushed the typical retail price of that Caprice to more than $50,000, from $25,000, as the total tax rate on G.M.'s cars in Russia has jumped to 166 percent of the wholesale price, from 25 percent, and a key tax break for individuals was eliminated.
With more than a dozen dealerships in Russia, G.M. seemed to have a solid foothold in this risky but enticing new market in late 1993. Now, the company's beachhead feels like quicksand. "Our sales have slowed to a trickle," Louis Sande, vice president of the GM Overseas Distribution Corporation, said late last month. Indeed, sales are off by half at the G.M. dealerships in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev run by Trinity Motors, said Mark Thimmig, Trinity's general manager.
That sinking feeling is spreading to other American companies, as well as those from other countries, as the Russian Government has stepped up the use of import duties to protect domestic industries from the first wave of competition they have faced.
The tariffs have been levied on a broad range of goods, with varying effect. Some are potential deal killers. A 50 percent duty on airliners, which amounts to roughly $30 million on a Boeing 757, is jeopardizing the Boeing Company's long-term prospects in Russia. And a 23 percent duty on food-processing equipment and seeds is holding up a $30 million processing and distribution project in Vladivostok run by TPC Foods Inc. of Seattle.
Other tariffs are small enough to be swallowed, but not easily. A 15 percent duty imposed last month on most imported food has sparked enough of an outcry from distributors and local officials in Moscow and other cities to force the Government to reconsider the levy. Russia is a country that cannot feed itself and relies on imports for a sizable portion of its food supply in major cities. Any price increase is particularly painful these days because Russians now spend most of their wages, which have fallen to an average of $85 a month, on food.
The increasing reliance on duties is just one more twist in Russia's herky-jerky path to a market economy, a path marked by policies that seem reasonable to bureaucrats but often wind up doing more harm than good. In this case, the bureaucrats were trying to protect jobs, raise tax revenues and push importers into building factories in Russia. Instead, they have alarmed already jumpy investors, infuriated consumers, encouraged domestic inflation and given a boost to smugglers at the expense of tax-paying importers like G.M.
The quagmire has led Russian and American executives to suspect the bureaucrats of an ulterior motive: coveting the power they lost with the end of the state monopoly on trade.
One American sugar trader, John Farley, reached that conclusion from Russia's decision last month to impose a 20 percent tax on sugar imports, even though only half the demand for sugar is being met by domestic refiners. "The Russian Government doesn't care whether the guy on the street gets his sugar," said Mr. Farley, a principal in the Briery/ Farley Company in Los Angeles.
Under pressure from Russian consumers, and from the Clinton Administration in the person of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the tariff schedule reviewed. So far, Mr. Brown has salvaged Boeing's first sale into the Russian market -- of four planes -- with a promise of a one-time exemption from the new tariff on airliners. But Boeing hopes to sell far more for use in Russia.
OFFICIALLY, the tariffs were intended to help stop a free fall in Russian industrial output, which dropped 25 percent from January 1993 to January 1994. Factories have slashed staff and production in response to rising prices, strangling taxes, a prime interest rate of about 200 percent and foreign competition.
Meanwhile, since the collapse of the Soviet Union two years ago, numerous American companies have poured goods into a nation of empty stores. The nature of the trade has been transformed, as huge Government grain purchases have given way to thousands of private deals in food, consumer goods and equipment.
American auto and truck sales to Russia jumped from less than $5 million in 1990 to $171 million in 1993, according to the Commerce Department. And last year, imports of American chocolates leapt to $76 million, from just $3 million in 1992. The numbers are still relatively small, but they represent dramatic openings to a huge new market.
"This is the biggest market that will develop in our lifetime," said James Walker, until recently the first general manager of Trinity Motors and now a consultant to Trinity in Russia. "Russian entrepreneurs are making a profit and they're spending it -- some of them, thankfully, at our place," he said before the higher tariffs took effect.
It was precisely such success by foreign companies that bred jealousy and fear among old-time Russian industrialists, and led to protective tariffs. Their products are often of poor quality, and inflation rates of 2,000 percent in 1992 and 1,000 percent in 1993 drove prices close to or even beyond those of competing imports.
FOR example, Russian chickens are so scrawny that Westerners joke they are slaughtered by starvation. Yet they now retail for about $2 in Moscow, not that much less than Western chickens. Traders soon figured out they could haul chickens from the United States and sell them for about the same price as Russian chickens at a profit, said Richard Schindler, TPC Foods' man in Vladivostok.
In fact, American chicken imports to Russia soared to $80 million in 1993, from $16 million in 1992, according to the National Broiler Council, a trade group based in Washington.
Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer, says its Russian exports have been running at four to five times last year's level and may exceed 250 million pounds this year, without a single staffer in Russia. Virtually all of this business is coming from Russian entrepreneurs calling Tyson in Arkansas, its home base, and paying cash, said Archie Schaffer, a spokesman. It is too early to tell if the new tariffs will significantly cut into sales, he said.
The influx of foreign competition was foreseen by reformers in Mr. Yeltsin's Government, who hoped it would force Russian producers to become efficient and profitable. Instead, directors of factories and collective farms flexed their political muscle and ousted reformers in favor of men who back their pleas for protectionist tariffs and subsidies.
In many ways, however, the higher tariffs are backfiring. Instead of undercutting foreign goods, Russian producers appear to be using the tariff increases to raise their own prices.
"We would rather buy Russian," said a frustrated Yuri Solomatin, chairman of Moscow's GUM department store, where more than half the windows now gleam with foreign products for lack of domestic alternatives. "It is wrong to strangle imports if Russian factories can't supply the market domestically," Mr. Solomatin said. Prices on imported goods at GUM have jumped 30 percent since Jan. 1 because of higher taxes.
The higher tax rates are also failing to increase Government revenues, as they simply inspire more tax avoidance, legal and illegal. For example, taxable sales of G.M. cars at Trinity Motors were strongest when the taxes amounted to only 30 percent in 1992, Mr. Walker said. Once they started rising, customers tried harder to qualify for numerous loopholes. Now that the loopholes are closed, few are buying.
Many of the remaining sales are to tax-exempt diplomats, said Mr. Thimmig, Trinity's current general manager. Even then there are problems. Trinity must pay more than $20,000 in duties when a car is imported and ask for a refund if it is sold to a diplomat, he said. But when the refund is paid in rubles weeks or months later, it is worth far less, because of falling exchange rates.
Many products are simply smuggled past notoriously corrupt border guards. Last year, $10 billion in imports got into the country that way, according to a recent International Monetary Fund study.
Americans also reject the Russian theory that higher tariffs will spur them to invest in local factories without first learning the market through importing. In Russia, that kind of leap is even more difficult to make than in the West, said Tom Fore, chief financial officer of Allen & Associates International Ltd., an investment and trading company in Washington. His company postponed plans for a pharmaceutical factory in Russia when it realized there was no distribution system to buy the plant's output. Instead, the company decided its first step had to be importing medicines and creating its own Russian marketing company to sell them.
At this point, after several years of increasingly prohibitive tax laws, many investors are becoming leery of Russia. Richard Watkins, a Houston oil executive, is so frustrated with Russian bureaucrats that even if he could obtain the exemptions from import and export tariffs that he needs for a refining project, "I wouldn't be confident they would be honored."
As a result, he doubts his company, Taurus Energy International, will risk more money on a plan to buy up petroleum residue from Russia's inefficient refineries, process it in modern European plants and ship the resulting gasoline and other products back to Russia.
Yet Mr. Farley, the sugar trader, remains optimistic about doing business in Russia, and is even sanguine about the sugar tax. "We don't get too worried about it, because we think they'll change it," he said, noting that Russia still runs by whim more than legislation. "Who knows what they'll do next week?"

HEADLINE: Bottom Line;
This Much Is Clear: Taxes Just Aren't What They Seem

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TENS of millions of Americans will file their income tax returns this week dead certain that their taxes are going up.
But as a proportion of the national economy, or of people's total income, or of any other yardstick of what Americans earn and are worth, the amount that Federal, state and local governments collect each year in taxes has hardly changed in 25 years. Taxes amounted to 27.8 percent of gross domestic product in 1991, the last year for which statistics are complete. Since 1969, the figure has never risen above 28.5 percent or fallen below 26.7. 
 How can this be? How can Americans be so sure their taxes are rising when the data show that -- for the country as a whole -- they are not? The answer is that most taxpayers really do owe more each year.
Think of an escalator going up in a building. People get on when they reach adulthood and begin owing taxes. Because of inflation, their incomes tend to go up. So do prices. So even if they are paying the same percentage of earnings in taxes, their income tax bills rise year after year. So does what they pay in sales and property taxes.
 
Older, Wiser, Better Off
 In addition, many people become more affluent as they grow older. The Census Bureau reports that in 1992 the median income for a household in which the adults were age 25 to 34 was $31,434. The median for those a decade older was $40,090. Sometimes, this pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets and they owe, say, 28 percent on part of their income instead of 15 percent on all of it.
Eventually, people step off the escalator and they retire, if they are lucky. But others are always getting on. So the number of people on the escalator does not change much. Neither does what governments collect. But each individual is riding up.
Another reason for the perception of rising taxes is that Republicans discovered that talking about cutting taxes could pay political dividends. Taxes did not really fall during the Reagan-Bush years. Lower income taxes were offset by higher Social Security and Medicare taxes. But that has not stopped an antitax campaign that Republicans hope to ride into the White House and into control of Congress.
They are often egged on by lobbyists. Last week, the National Taxpayers Union held a news conference advertised as a look at "who voted to raise your taxes" last year. The truth is that, for most people, no one in Congress voted to raise their taxes last year, at least not by very much.
Over the opposition of every Republican, Congress did vote in its deficit-reduction legislation to raise taxes by nearly $250 billion over five years. Three quarters of the amount will come from the richest 1 percent of Americans, the 1.2 million with incomes above about $200,000 a year. Much of the rest will come from increasing the income tax that about two million middle- and upper-income retirees pay on their Social Security.
The law did not raise the income taxes of 97 percent of Americans. The only consequential Federal tax increase faced by most people is a 4.3-cents-a-gallon addition to gasoline taxes. But gasoline prices at the pump have been falling, so the higher tax has not been evident. At the state level, 22 states raised taxes by more than 1 percent last year, but only five voted increases of more than 5 percent.
More changes have been made in tax policy in recent years than ever before. Ignoring economists and executives who counseled that the wisest tax code is a stable and predictable one, Congress changed the Federal tax laws in big ways in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1993.
The Federal income tax rate on the wealthiest taxpayers was cut from 70 percent to 50 percent to 28 percent. Then it was raised to 31 percent, and it went up again to 36 percent last year. Tax breaks to encourage business investment and personal savings were widened, then repealed. A surtax on the elderly to pay the cost of catastrophic illnesses was approved in 1987 and retracted the next year. Social Security, Medicare and gasoline taxes went up. Corporate taxes fell.
At the state and local level, tax collections peaked in 1973 and then dropped because of recessions and a tax revolt in California and many other states. This bottomed out in 1982, and taxes have been rising since. The trend may end this year with deep tax cuts in the works in New Jersey and New Mexico and smaller ones elsewhere.
Hundreds of billions of dollars of tax liability has been shuffled among individuals and among companies. The constant changes forced some people to change how they saved and spent, and companies had to keep altering their business practices.
The tax law encouraged investment in commercial real estate in the early 1980's. After a while, the carrot was withdrawn, and the real estate market collapsed. One year savings accounts were tax free; the next year they were not. Deductions for sales taxes and in most cases for medical expenses and casualty losses were scrapped.
At the Federal level, the biggest changes over the last decade and a half have been felt by the very rich and the very poor. The wealthiest 1 percent had their taxes cut by 15 percent from 1977 to 1985. Since then, much of that has been restored. The average Federal income tax increase among these people just because of the 1993 law is about $25,000.
In the 1980's, the taxes owed by the poor went up because of increases in Social Security, Medicare, tobacco and gasoline taxes. That was more than reversed by the 1990 and 1993 tax laws. This year, a family with two children and earnings of less than $12,570 can get a Federal rebate of nearly $2,000. Locally, the biggest recent tax increase has been at the county level -- 69 percent from 1985 to 1991. A main reason: more jails.
The top tax news in the states this year has been in Michigan, which eliminated the portion of the property tax that paid for schools. It was replaced by a higher sales tax and an additional 50-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes.
In Washington, politicians hope to avoid a tax bill this year. But President Clinton has said he still hopes for a tax cut for the middle class, although hardly anyone believes he will propose one. And whatever changes are made in the nation's health care system, they will be paid for in part by a big new Federal tax on cigarettes.
By the end of the 1990's, the Government will face rapidly rising deficits. Many authorities think the solution is a new tax -- say, a national sales tax, or some tax not on what people earn but on what they consume. Then, maybe, taxes really will be higher.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Morihiro Hosokawa;
Profile in Political Descent: Japan's Once-Rising Star

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
JUST eight months ago Morihiro Hosokawa seemed on the verge of smashing the established order that has kept Japan closed to outsiders and engendered world-class corruption. A young, vibrant governor from the hinterlands, he talked in sweeping, direct terms about his "historical mission" to reform the country, and Japan's need to "construct a mature democratic nation." In a country that rewards those who never step out of line, here was a prime minister willing to talk like a revolutionary.
He sounded much like Japan's foreign critics, promising to tame bureaucracy and over-regulation that make some of the world's highest-paid workers feel so poor. He looked the part he played, a descendant of samurais gone to J. Crew, showing up at last November's inaugural summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Seattle wearing a bomber jacket and an aviator's scarf. 
 But even before he was forced to resign on Friday, felled after eight months by a murky financial scandal that ended his cleaner-than-Tokyo image and left many Japanese feeling betrayed, Morihiro Hosokawa had become a lonely man. He grew isolated in his fractious coalition government, eight parties with no ideas in common save their opposition to the Liberal Democratic Party that they ousted after 38 years. He did not trust the bureaucrats around him, nor they him. In the last few months he even cut himself off from the public, mysteriously losing his greatest asset, what Ambassador Walter F. Mondale called a "Kennedy-esqe ability" to rise above the fray and talk about ideals.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Hosokawa agreed to see me to continue a conversation that has been going on sporadically between us for the last five years. We usually wound around to the same question of political culture: Why has such a well-educated, wealthy electorate so frequently let someone else -- the military, the bureaucrats, the businessmen -- run their country? Now, he argued, something had finally begun to change, something that would outlast him.
"The political culture is still quite underdeveloped, poor and immature," he said. "But it is beginning to change in a substantial manner."
Despite the back-stabbing that made his coalition resemble the cast of a late-night samurai movie on Japanese television, Mr. Hosokawa insisted that his greatest accomplishment was opening up the political world to plain view. "More Japanese are suddenly keenly interested in politics," he argued. "There are definitely more and more people coming to the Diet to see it for themselves. Political coverage on television is receiving higher ratings. For the first time, it is easier to see how policies are being decided."
 
Divided Coalition
 But Japan remains far, he said, from the day when elections would be fought over issues rather than a politician's skills at bringing dams and bullet-train lines to his own district. He knew his coalition had done nothing to speed the process: It was so divided, from Socialists to nationalists, that no major issues were ever discussed for fear the alliance would implode. "Another few elections from now, maybe a few years from now -- it will require that much time -- we will have a stable political situation," he said.
Japan's policy ice-age, he argued, was the price for Japan's cold war political structure, in which one-party rule was considered essential to keeping socialism at bay. "Economic issues have been entirely left to the bureaucrats," he said. "But now what is required is that economic discussion become a central part of the political dialogue, the political debate."
The first time I met Morihiro Hosokawa, in 1989, he was in his last days as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, a remote but bustling region on the southern island of Kyushu. I was traveling with my wife, who teaches comparative law to Japanese university students, to the small fishing town of Minamata, made infamous 30 years ago for the mercury poisoning that caused horrible deaths and later birth defects. The Japanese government, reflexively backing industry over its own people, had refused for years to shut down the plant, and Mr. Hosokawa was battling with the bureaucrats in Tokyo for compensation for the survivors.
"We have gotten nowhere," Mr. Hosokawa told us in his office, which looked out on the castle where his family, the region's feudal lords, had ruled for 600 years. "We have politicians who are supposed to be making decisions, not bureaucrats. Instead, it is the other way around. To take care of this country we may have to bring in a Gorbachev," he said, because "right now we can't even tie our own shoes."
It was startlingly frank talk for those days. "He should be prime minister," my wife said as we left his office.
"It will never happen," I told her with great confidence.
He proved me wrong in just four years. Though the public initially dismissed the Japan New Party that he created in 1992, they soon warmed to the critique that Japan's leaders "merely cling like parasites to the centralized bureaucracy in which power is concentrated." He called for a "third opening" to the outside world. But this one had to come from within, not forced by the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry's Black Ships in the 1850's or, a century later, by the dictates of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's occupation force.
 
Defensive
 But as prime minister, Mr. Hosokawa's tone changed. Like any rebel suddenly placed in charge of the institution he had attacked, he slowly adopted an defensive tone, even about the bureaucrats undercutting him.
"I am not one who believes that we have to break the back of the Japanese bureaucracy, or that we have to dynamite Kasumigaseki," he said, referring to the home of Japan's ministries. The bureaucracy, he said, has run Japan since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, and "I think they are one of the strengths of our country." The question, he said, is "how we can make use of that strength. There are people in the bureaucracy who are reform oriented, reform-minded." Finding them, he said, "is the most decisive issue in terms of whether I succeed or not."
He never had the chance. Forced to spend almost all his political capital on passing political reform legislation -- his biggest legacy -- Mr. Hosokawa never really turned to redefining relations with the United States. His much-touted relationship with President Clinton never had a chance to click before it was buried in an avalanche of trade standoffs. Immersed in crises over cellular phones or construction contracts, they never had time, he complained, to find common ground in "ideals, visions and dreams."
"I have not even had time to play golf with him," he said with a wry smile.
In Washington in February, Mr. Hosokawa described himself to Mr. Clinton as "a cliffhanger," a trait he attributed to his samurai roots. When he fell off the cliff last week, victim of the new, clean-politics ethos he had helped bring about, he left a lot of unfinished business. He had run out of time, words and drive to bring about economic reform, administrative reform and -- the biggest loss of all -- to create an atmosphere in which Japan could learn how to argue politics. Perhaps it was far too ambitious an agenda, even for a feudal lord. But he did not even have a moment, he said with some regret on Friday, to set things right in Minamata.

HEADLINE: The World;
Singapore, the Tiger Whose Teeth Are Not Universally Scorned

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
FOR the large American community in Singapore, the laughter about this place has suddenly stopped. There is not much joking these days about Singapore as the city so clean that bubble gum is a controlled substance, so prudish that Cosmopolitan magazine is banned as a threat to common decency, so well planned that a traffic jam is all but unheard of.
Now, the Americans know, Singapore is a nation with laws so tough and unforgiving that an American teen-ager convicted of spray painting cars faces a punishment that human rights organizations consider torture -- a flogging with a rattan cane. Prisoners subjected to a caning usually go into shock from the intense pain and are left with permanent scars. 
 For the Government of Singapore, the case of Michael Fay, an 18-year-old from Dayton, Ohio, is an opportunity to demonstrate again its contempt for the Western concept of individual rights (though he still could win clemency from Singapore's President). The case illustrates how this tiny city-state has become a role model for China, Vietnam and other one-party governments in Asia.
"Authoritarian government and economic success are usually mutually exclusive over the long haul," said a Western diplomat here. "What's frightening about Singapore is that they actually manage to pull them both off." Lacking a tradition of pluralism or the pressure of a powerful dissident movement, Singapore shows no sign of following countries like South Korea and Chile, which only temporarily were able to suppress democracy in the name of economic development.
The 2.8 million people of Singapore live in what is arguably the cleanest, greenest, safest large city on earth. As a result of enlightened economic policies that have created a comfortable Asian haven for multinational companies, Singapore is the richest nation in Asia outside of Japan, with a per capita income of more than $15,000 a year.
And in many ways, the Singaporeans have it far better than the Japanese, who for all their economic might tend to live in rabbit-warren houses and commute hours to work. In Singapore, it is common for taxi drivers to own their spacious apartments.
But Singapore's success has come with what many see as a terrible price -- the loss of free speech, even free thought, and the endless intrusions of a government so obsessed with the daily life of Singaporeans that it is a crime even to fail to flush a public toilet. Chewing gum is outlawed for fear that it will jam the doors of subway trains.
While the ruling People's Action Party is widely admired for turning a squalid, malarial island into one of Asia's economic dragons in only a generation, many Singaporeans live in constant fear of their Government. Opposition-party leaders are subjected to vicious intimidation by the Government, including ruinous libel suits and attacks on their professional licenses.
"There is no unemployment, no real poverty -- isn't it fantastic what the Government has accomplished?" said David Marshall, a former Singaporean chief minister and Ambassador to France and one of the few here brave enough to criticize the Government publicly. "But are we becoming robots?"
 
'A Plastic Heart'
 In a speech last January that was considered shocking for its bluntness, Mr. Marshall, often described as the conscience of the nation, said that the ruling party had a "computer brain and a plastic heart" and ruled the country by fear, not affection.
"There has been a suffocation of all dissent," he warned. "That is a very terrifying thing, my friends, and it is something we ought to wake up to." He was contemptuous of the tightly controlled press, describing Singaporean journalists as "boot lickers."
The Government's response is simple: Compare life in Singapore to life in the developed Western nations, especially the United States, that criticize Singapore. Indeed, Americans are apparently so fed up with the crime in their own neighborhoods that majorities said in polls that they would support sentences like the one imposed on Mr. Fay.
After the State Department protested the sentence as "excessive" -- Mr. Fay is a first-time offender who is reported to suffer from a serious neurological disorder -- the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs released a pointed statement.
"Unlike some other societies which tolerate acts of vandalism, Singapore has its own standards of social order as reflected in our laws," the ministry said. "We are able to keep Singapore orderly and relatively crime free. We do not have a situation where acts of vandalism are commonplace, as in cities like New York, where even police cars are not spared the acts of vandals." Conviction here for armed robbery or drug trafficking carries a mandatory death penalty.
The father of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister, has openly questioned the value of Western concepts of human rights and free speech.
In a speech in the Philippines, an impoverished nation but one with a true democracy, Mr. Lee said that "When you are hungry, when you lack basic services, freedom, human rights and democracy do not add up to much." He once told an interviewer, "I'm not sure human rights are a traditional value, even in Christian societies."
It is remarks like these -- and the undeniable success of his economic policies -- that have made Mr. Lee an honored guest in China, Vietnam and other nations that hope to retain one-party authoritarian rule while opening up their markets.
But diplomats and Asian scholars wonder whether the lessons of a tiny city-state like Singapore are really applicable to much larger neighbors. It is one thing to feed, educate and keep a close eye on slightly fewer than 3 million people living together on a small island. "And it's something very different when you're China and you've got 300 times the population," said a diplomat.
"Many of us think the lessons of Singapore can't translate elsewhere, and for anyone who cherishes individual rights, that's splendid news."

HEADLINE: WESTERN TROOPS ARRIVE IN RWANDA TO AID FOREIGNERS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Convoys of Americans and Europeans and a planeload of French citizens fled the strife-torn capital of Rwanda yesterday as the United States, France and Belgium began a military effort to protect and evacuate 2,850 foreign nationals caught in tribal fighting that has killed thousands in three days of terror.
As the first foreigners were evacuated and the international rescue operation got under way, the fiercest fighting yet was reported in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. New battles broke out to the north, and a force of 4,000 rebels of the minority Tutsi tribe was reported moving on Kigali from two directions. Its leaders said the rebels could arrive as early as today, escalating the fighting between the Tutsi and the majority Hutu tribe even further. 
 Amid spreading anarchy, some reports said tens of thousands of people, most of them Rwandans, had been killed. There were no reports of casualties among the foreign nationals -- about 250 Americans, 1,500 Belgians, 600 French, 300 Germans, 100 Dutch and 100 Britons -- but dangers abounded on all sides.
One convoy of foreigners organized by American officials and another by the Red Cross left Kigali yesterday with escorts of lightly armed Rwandan troops and were believed headed for neighboring Burundi, a 6-hour drive south. They faced roadblocks manned by gunmen vowing to kill Belgians. But no Belgians were believed aboard and there were no reports of any vehicles being halted or of passengers being molested.
Two other convoys were being organized in Kigali by the American Embassy, and United Nations officials said their staff members also were being evacuated overland.
About 300 Americans and Europeans arrived safely in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital, yesterday and early today, a United States Embassy source told The Associated Press. The group, mostly Americans, Belgians and Germans, reported no trouble during the journey.
Earlier yesterday, after a force of 400 French paratroops had seized the Kigali airport, a military transport plane bearing 43 French citizens flew to the Central African Republic. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris said that more flights were planned and that the operation was proceeding as expected.
The United States sent 360 marines and seven aircraft into Burundi and moved them toward the Rwanda border to assist the evacuations. Belgium, a former colonial ruler, dispatched 800 troops and planeloads of equipment from Europe, and the United Nations was considering sending up to 1,500 reinforcements for its 2,500-member peacekeeping force in Rwanda.
Even as the relief contingents moved in, more heavy fighting was reported in Kigali, where the violence between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority has been concentrated. Relief workers said corpses littered the streets.
The Tutsi rebels, known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front, said they had moved large forces within 10 miles of Kigali. It was feared that their advance into the capital would greatly increase the fighting between the rebels and Hutu-supported Government forces, tipping the country into all-out civil war.
 
Attacks at Other Sites
 Rebel forces were also reported to have attacked Government troops in the northern town of Ruhengeri, and were firing mortars from ridges overlooking the Government-held town of Biumba, 30 miles north of Kigali. Gen. Paul Kagame, a leader of the rebel forces, vowed to take Kagali and topple the interim government.
The Tutsis -- the tall Nilotic people also known as the Watusi -- make up 14 percent of Rwanda's population, while Hutus -- a short, stocky Bantu people -- make up 85 percent. They have struggled for political and economic dominance since the nation of 8 million won independence from Belgium in 1962.
The Hutus, which control the central Government, regard Belgium as an enemy not only because it was the former colonial ruler of Rwanda but also because they believe Brussels covertly supports the Tutsi-led rebel group, which has its main office in Belgium. The Tutsis filled many bureaucratic posts under Belgian and German colonial administrations.
Red Cross officials in Kigali said the death toll from the fighting -- including the acting prime minister and other political leaders, aid workers, nuns and priests and United Nations peacekeepers, but mostly Rwandan citizens -- has risen steadily and dramatically since Wednesday, when the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, were killed in the crash of a plane that may have been shot down by a rocket.
 
Corpses Are Everywhere
 "Yesterday, we were talking about thousands of dead," Herve Le Guillouzic, medical coordinator of the International Committee of the Red Cross, told the Reuters news agency. "Today we can start with tens of thousands."
He said the corpses were everywhere -- "in the houses, in the streets, everywhere."
Mark Billot, of the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders, told Belgian BRTN radio that 8,000 people had been killed in Kigali alone, The Associated Press reported. Samantha Bolton, with the same organization in Kenya, quoted relief workers in Kigali as saying the fighting was the heaviest yet.
Relief officials said the Americans and other foreigners trapped in Kigali by the fighting were lying low, waiting for the strife to ease or for a convoy or a flight out.
At the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Security Council held intensive consultations on Rwanda yesterday, but no formal meeting was held and no action was taken.
The current President of the council, Colin Keating of New Zealand, said the future of a force of 2,500 United Nations peacekeepers in Rwanda was unclear. The force -- sent in last year to help carry out an accord ending a three-year civil war between the Government and the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front -- had little chance now to fulfill its mission, Mr. Keaning said.
The United Nations force has been confined to barracks since 10 Belgians were killed early in the fighting trying to protect the Prime Minister, who was also slain.
All foreigners in Kigali were being urged by their governments to get out, but it was unclear whether all would heed the warning or even how long such an evacuation might take. Jean-Bernard Merimee, the French ambassador to the United Nations, said the evacuations could be completed in 48 hours.
 
Warning on Evacuation
 Claude Dusaidi, the Rwanda Patriotic Front representative at the United Nations, said his organization had no objections to the evacuation of foreigners, so long as the foreign military forces were withdrawn as soon as their humanitarian missions were completed. A continued presence beyond that, he said, would be taken as "a hostile act." He said no time limit had been set by the front for the evacuation.
Mr. Dusaidi's statement was echoed in Brussels, where the Patriotic Front, which has vowed to smash an interim government set up during the turmoil of recent days, issued a statement warning the United States, France and Belgium to limit their troop deployments, especially in the time they spend in Rwanda.
Administration officials said plans to deploy American military forces to protect and possibly evacuate Americans in Rwanda were under way.
Two companies of marines and three transport helicopters were dispatched from ships in the Indian Ocean, and four KC-130 tanker aircraft, capable of carrying 40 to 60 people, were sent from bases in the region. Late yesterday the American forces landed in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi.
 
U.S. Troops Sent North
 Officials said the marines were promptly sent north, toward the Rwanda border, to be ready to carry out contingency plans to enter Rwanda if it became necessary to rescue trapped Americans or to come to the aid of American convoys.
But the United States planned to avoid sending the troops into Rwanda if possible, the official said. Instead, the American Ambassador in Kigali, David P. Rawson, was organizing Americans there into convoys that were expected to drive overland, with lightly armed Rwandan escorts.
Details of route and timing were not disclosed for security reasons. But some Americans were said to have been moved out yesterday, while others were expected to follow today.
Belgian radio reports quoting the United States Embassy in Kigali late yesterday said it had organized a convoy of 30 vehicles carrying Americans and Europeans and that it had left the capital. It was not known how many people were in the convoy and there was no word from the Embassy on where it was headed. But a British official said the destination was Burundi, and an official in Washington confirmed late in the day that the convoy had left and that Americans were among the evacuees. It was not clear whether that was the same convoy that the Embassy source in the Burundi capital confirmed as having arrived.
 
Evacuation From Airport
 French and Belgian officials said more of their nationals were to be evacuated by plane from Kigali airport last night and today, if possible. A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said 400 French troops had secured the Kigali airport at dawn yesterday, despite resistance from rebel guerrillas.
The violence that has wracked Rwanda began late Wednesday after an airplane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi, both of the majority Hutu tribe, crashed as it was approaching Kigali airport. They were returning from a peace conference in Tanzania intended to end decades of ethnic strife in their countries.
The Rwandan Government said the plane was shot down by a rocket fired by unknown attackers, and soon afterward the Presidential Guard loyal to Mr. Habyarimana set out to settle scores with Tutsis in Kigali. The fighting quickly turned into wild scenes of anarchy and slaughter.
Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was reported dragged from a United Nations compound and killed.

HEADLINE: UKRAINE TO CLOSE CHERNOBYL PLANT

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
Ukraine's Government has agreed to shut down the remaining nuclear reactors at its power plant in Chernobyl, which was heavily damaged in a catastrophic accident in 1986, the Clinton Administration said today.
After three days of meetings with an American delegation, Ukraine abandoned its insistence that nuclear production must continue at the plant, agreeing instead to a joint effort with the United States to find options like energy conservation and nonnuclear power generation to replace electricity from the plant, which generates about 1,800 megawatts of power. A thousand megawatts is often described as the amount of electricity used by a million typical American homes. 
 The agreement marks the first time that a former Soviet republic has bowed to Western pressures to shut down any of the old Chernobyl-style reactors, which because of their unsafe design have long troubled other nations. Armenia, citing safety reasons, closed reactors of a different design when it became independent in 1991.
There are two reactors still in operation at the Chernobyl complex, along with the one destroyed in 1986 and a fourth that was shut down after a fire in 1991. In addition, there are 11 reactors in Russia and two in Lithuania like the ones at Chernobyl.
It is not clear that Ukraine's agreement, described as a "commitment in principle," is irreversible or would be supported by its Parliament, which has sometimes resisted the Government's plans on matters involving nuclear energy and nuclear arms.
Any energy modernization program would take years and would require financial help from the West, and details of any such aid have not been decided, American officials said.
Ukraine's commitment to shut down Chernobyl "at the earliest possible date" was made on Friday in Kiev by Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov after meetings with an American delegation led by Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White.

 
Nation's Woes Are Many
 Mr. White said today that officials of the Ukrainian nuclear energy ministry talked of taking years to shut down the plant, while the United States said it should be done immediately.
The agreement signed in Kiev on Friday calls for the shutdown to take place as soon as possible, with the Ukrainians agreeing to complete the closing once the country has "reached a balance in the energy system and found resources to take the plant out of operation."
Mr. White, at a news conference in Washington upon his return from Kiev, said that if conservation programs were quickly put in place the shutdown could begin "a lot sooner than the date that a lot of people within the Ukrainian Government have predicted."
He said money for the energy conservation and supply projects would come from the World Bank and the European Redevelopment Bank, but that the amount of money that would be needed is not yet known.
Atomic energy accounts for a third of Ukraine's electricity production, and with the country owing billions of dollars for energy bought from Russia and plagued with debt and energy shortages, its Parliament voted in October to continue nuclear energy production at Chernobyl. That vote reversed an earlier plan to shut the complex down at the end of 1993.
Ukrainian leaders have even considered restarting one of the damaged Chernobyl reactors, according to an American official.
The Administration, which has been intensively courting Ukraine in recent months, sought to put an optimistic light on the agreement over Chernobyl.
"Ukraine's leaders have made a courageous and creative decision," Mr. White said in a statement issued in Washington after his meetings with Mr. Shmarov and other officials. "It represents an important step toward reducing the danger of another nuclear catastrophe and will lead to better use of scarce energy resources."
The Chernobyl-style design, known by the Russian initials R.B.M.K., is notorious for its use of graphite in the reactor core to assist the nuclear reaction. That design is inherently less stable than reactors using water to assist the reaction.
 
A Warning to Russia
 In 1992, the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- told Russia that its R.B.M.K. reactors and another design were fundamentally flawed and should be shut down.
Chernobyl may have become the world's most famous shorthand for nuclear peril, but government safety experts, nuclear workers and Western scientists agree that the nuclear power industry throughout the former Soviet Union is on the verge of disaster.
In Russia this week, hundreds of industry employees gathered in Moscow to protest the increasingly dangerous conditions at the country's eight biggest nuclear plants.
"We are on the brink," said Gennadi Shchapov, director of the Kalininsky plant in central Russia. "I just paid the back wages for January. The workers are in a very bad mood and, God forbid, something might happen."
He spoke on Friday at a Government-sponsored conference, two days after workers picketed the Russian Parliament building to protest conditions.
"Today the plants work in an emergency regime," First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovet said at the meeting on Friday. "It is impossible. It's like a bomb."
Last month, in its first survey as an independent agency, the Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Oversight Committee reported 20,000 safety violations for 1993. Nuclear power supplies 12 percent of the country's electricity but in many of the heavily populated and industrial regions it supplies more than 80 percent.
American energy officials said they believe there is also enormous potential for Ukraine to save energy and money by investing in energy conservation.

HEADLINE: Navy Prepares a Manual About Sexual Harassment

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 9

 BODY:
With its penchant for by-the-book precision, the military has manuals for just about everything -- legal manuals to punish lawbreakers, technical manuals to assemble weapons. Now, the Navy has prepared a new manual on how to recognize, prevent and deal with sexual harassment.
Intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for thousands of Navy commanders worldwide, the manual defines the problem, tells how to handle complaints and holds commanders responsible for eliminating harassment in their ranks, with an implicit threat that promotions could be jeopardized if they do not. The Navy will distribute the manuals fleetwide by early fall. 
 Much of the 64-page handbook, with long attachments and sample cases, is a compendium of orders and memorandums Navy leaders have issued since dozens of women were assaulted at the bawdy weekend of the Tailhook Association convention of naval aviators in Las Vegas, Nev., in 1991.
Using these new orders and regulations, the Navy has dismissed 89 officers and sailors for sexual harassment since 1992. But even the Navy acknowledges that the new regulations have achieved mixed results at best. And outside experts are asking whether these new manuals will just gather dust on bookshelves and desk tops and whether more paper proclamations will change the ingrained attitudes of a male-dominated culture trying to shed a reputation for contempt toward women.
 
New Kind of Problem
 Naval officials are hoping that the mere existence of the manual will be regarded as a sign of new seriousness on the topic. But this handbook is intended to ease a difficult transition for the American military, which has always operated by the book, from the angle of a soldier's salute to the way recruits make their beds. When it comes to sexual harassment, however, the military faces an issue etched in shades of gray that demands subjective judgments and interpretations.
"When I go to the field, a lot of people still don't know what we mean by sexual harassment," said Rear Adm. Paul E. Tobin, Jr., who is head of the Navy's office for what it describes as personal readiness and community support. "We're trying to make sure they know where the line is."
Senior Navy officials say the release of the manual coincides with increased sensitivity training and stricter punishment for offenders to hammer home the service's "zero-tolerance" message. But lawmakers and independent experts say the tolerance has not yet dropped that far in practice.
 
More Action Urged
 "The Navy has taken some positive action but it really needs to look more at enforcing these new rules," said Wilma D. Powell, chairwoman of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, an independent panel that reports to the Secretary of Defense. "You can have all sorts of rules and regulations, but if they're not enforced, it's a waste."
Last month, for example, four women serving in the military told the House Armed Services Committee that the military, rather than disciplining offenders, often punished the women who complained of harassment. One officer, Lieut. Darlene Simmons, a lawyer in the Navy Reserve, said she had been forced to undergo a psychiatric exam after accusing a male superior of sexual harassment.
Even in areas where the Navy is making strides, commanders are adjusting awkwardly. For instance, the first female fighter pilots to serve aboard aircraft carriers are now joining their squadrons and preparing to fly in harm's way like their male colleagues.
"The Navy leadership is going out of its way to be supportive," said one senior female aviator, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In fact, they're so serious about not offending anyone, the women may be getting a little too much of the kid-glove treatment."
Navy officials say the idea for a manual came from officers in Norfolk, Va., who wanted a ready reference book on the Navy's most sensitive social policy. Of the 1,409 calls the Navy's toll-free Sexual Harassment Advice Line has logged since it started in late 1992, slightly more than half have come from men seeking guidance on the new policies.
The manual, entitled "Commander's Handbook -- A Tool Kit for Prevention of Sexual Harassment," details in the unadorned terms of a Government memo the do's and don't's of sexual harassment.
 
Leaders Have Obligation
 The handbook begins with a warning. "Navy leaders are obligated not to ignore or condone sexual harassment in any form, and they must take whatever action is required to insure that a recipient of sexual harassment is not subsequently also the victim of reprisal or retaliation," Adm. Frank B. Kelso 2d, the Chief of Naval Operations, said on a cover page.
And it continues with an attempt at definitions. "Sexual harassment involves the conduct that a reasonable person would find sexual in nature in light of the relevant facts and circumstances," the handbook said. "Behavior does not need to be overtly sexual if it creates an offensive work environment."
The manual's section on prevention uses traffic-light colors to group acceptable and unacceptable forms of behavior. The green zone (Go) is polite compliments and friendly conversation. The yellow zone (Use Caution) includes sexual comments or jokes. And the red zone (Stop!) includes sexual favors in return for a good performance evaluation and assault.
 
Warning About Reprisals
 It describes how to handle complaints and warns against penalizing those who complain. "Reprisal can be overt or subtle: reduction in evaluation marks out of the blue, inequity in duty assignments, increased workload, not recommending personnel for advancement, retention or special programs," the handbook says.
In a sign of how seriously the Navy seems to be treating the issue the handbook even recommends that as a last resort, complainants or commanders write their representatives in Congress for help. In the past any foray outside the chain of command has been seriously frowned on by senior commanders; those who tried often complained that they were punished for doing so.
"The Navy is trying to reinforce good behavior and deal with negative behavior," said Barbara S. Pope, a former assistant Secretary of the Navy who helped investigate the Tailhook scandal. "But they need to deal with offenders in a quick, fair manner. That's the part they're still working on. People don't totally trust the system."

HEADLINE: California Being Enriched by Underground and Illegal Money

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
The state government may be short of money, but Southern California is awash in cash and experts say drug trafficking, instability in Asia and the state's underground economy that involves many illegal immigrants are the likely reasons.
Economists say the cash infusion may have insulated Los Angeles from the worst of the state's four-year recession. But it has also cost the state treasury at least $1.8 billion a year in unreported taxes at a time when the budget deficit has hit $3 billion. 
 Since 1990, the annual cash surplus reported by the Los Angeles branch of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank -- the excess cash the district bank collects from financial institutions compared with what it distributes -- has almost tripled, from $3.4 billion to $9.3 billion in 1993.
Since 1992, the Los Angeles surplus has soared past Miami's to lead the nation's 36 Federal Reserve bank districts.
Private financial institutions keep cash on hand to meet daily banking needs. When they have too much, they send it to the district bank for safekeeping.
"We don't know where all our excess cash is coming from down in Southern California," said Ron Supinski, a spokesman for the reserve bank.
But law enforcement officials say the cash switch from Miami to Los Angeles followed a similar trend in drug trafficking.
Tougher enforcement in Florida and the Caribbean created difficulties for Colombian cocaine transporters in the late 1980's, said Ralph Lockridge of the Los Angeles office of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The traffickers' response, he said, was to open routes through Central America and Mexico into the American Southwest.
"Now a large portion of the drugs -- some say 70 percent -- come through the Southwest," Mr. Lockridge said. "And they have also developed money-laundering systems along the West Coast."
Fed figures show that El Paso and San Antonio are also in the top five showing cash surpluses the past four years.
Nationally, estimates of laundered cash run as high as $100 billion.
In the late 1980's, Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel used Los Angeles jewelry stores to hide drug cash. Now investigators say money exchange houses along the Mexican border are performing a similar task.
Last September, Customs agents near San Diego stopped three Colombian women and found $300,000 stuffed into special girdles.
Analysts agree on other legal and semilegal sources for the cash.
One of the most striking is California's "underground economy," a cash-driven system that does not use checks and credit cards. It includes everything from gambling and prostitution to off-the-books sales of legitimate goods.
A Wells Fargo Bank study estimates California's underground economy at $140 billion a year, or 18 percent of the gross state economy. That figure is probably low, and does not include Northern California's huge marijuana crop, said the study's author, Gary Schlossberg.
"You have to look at the underground economy, especially illegal immigrants and those whose transactions tend to be cash oriented," Mr. Schlossberg said.
California has more than half the nation's illegal immigrants, he said. They usually cannot open bank accounts or get credit, and are often paid off the books in cash.
The state's weak economy also gets some blame.
"When the economy goes south, a lot of legal transactions don't get reported, just to avoid taxes," Mr. Schlossberg said.
Another likely source is money flowing in from Pacific Rim countries.
The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the tension between North and South Korea and increased trade with the United States may be prompting Asians to move their dollars to Los Angeles for investment or safekeeping.

HEADLINE: Japan's Crisis Is Realigning Political Blocs

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 9

 BODY:
The maneuvering to choose a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took shape today not just as a battle for individual power but also as a broad realignment of Japan's four-decade-old party structure.
"The Liberal Democratic Party is disintegrating, and to some extent the same thing is starting to happen to the Socialists," said Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of politics at Tokyo University and a Government adviser. Professor Sasaki added that the Prime Minister "had kept them together until yesterday," when he suddenly announced his decision to resign in the face of financial scandals in which he has been implicated. 
 After his announcement, Mr. Hosokawa said he wanted to reformulate his seven-party coalition Government under a single party-like structure called "kaikaku," or reform, and this led to the political battle.
 
A New Political Order
 The proposal is supported principally by the more conservative members of the coalition, who have been seeking to transform Japan's fractious political order into a two-party system. They are aiming for these parties to be located near the political center, rather than along the left-right axis that characterized Japanese politics during the cold war.
This group tends to favor a more active international role for Japan, strong relations with the United States and measured but real deregulation of some parts of the economy.
A leading contender to become Prime Minister, Tsutomu Hata, who is Foreign Minister, has backed the proposal and immediately sought to identify himself with Mr. Hosokawa's popular -- if only partly successful -- programs.
 
'Reforms in the Truest Sense'
 "I would like someone" to become prime minister, he said, "who, like the current Prime Minister, is determined to carry out reforms. We must implement reforms in the truest sense."
Mr. Hosokawa's announcement has thus acted as a catalyst, forcing the more leftward-leaning members of his own small party and of the largest party in the coalition, the Socialists, to threaten to leave the Government.
They could be replaced, however, with more defectors from what remains of the Liberal Democratic Party. Michio Watanabe, a former Foreign Minister and a conservative faction leader in the Liberal Democratic Party, dropped hints that he might join the new group, along with dozens of other Liberal Democrats. He is also regarded as a contender for the job of prime minister.
 
'Similar Policy Line'
 "The Liberal Democratic Party cannot realize a majority in the parliament," he said. "It's time to form a coalition with those who have a similar policy line."
The strongest opponents of economic deregulation are the parties that have traditionally relied for support on heavily regulated industries, such as agriculture and small retailers. That is where the Liberal Democrats and the Socialists have drawn many of their core supporters.
"Regulation is like air for many people in this country," said a Government official. "Even with all the talk about change, it is what they breath."
Last summer the Liberal Democratic Party lost power after 38 years of one-party rule when a group of mostly younger members demanding economic and electoral system reforms defected and formed the core of Mr. Hosokawa's coalition Government, an awkward combination of centrists and Socialists.
 
Policy on North Korea
 The subsequent party upheaval came to a halt when Mr. Hosokawa took office in August. But it has now resumed in earnest, with potentially important policy questions at stake, like the future of economic deregulation and policy toward North Korea.
Although Japanese politicians generally avoid spelling out policy differences too clearly, some important conflicts within the coalition have been emerging recently.
Since Japan's defeat in World War II there has been a powerful pacifist streak in the country, reaching across the political spectrum. Many people have been resisting the idea of Japan's joining an economic embargo against North Korea.

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, April 9

 BODY:
With China's economy still in overdrive, a new surge in inflation, labor unrest and corruption appears to be rattling the Communist Party leadership.
Chinese and Western officials say that concern in the Politburo about the stability of Communist Party rule may explain the vigorous crackdown this spring on political dissent, including the recent arrests of Wei Jingsheng and Xu Wenli, veterans of the "Democracy Wall" movement of the 1970's. Both had been freed from prison only last year. 
 A number of other dissidents have also been arrested in a clampdown that appears to be linked to the visit of France's Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur.
 
Parallels With 1989
 After two straight years of 13 percent growth in the economy, inflation is running at an annual rate of nearly 26 percent in China's biggest cities. Many analysts see parallels with turbulence five years ago, when rapid consumer price increases and evidence of rampant corruption fed worker and student unrest that mushroomed into huge street demonstrations. The protests virtually paralyzed the capital for six weeks and ended with the military crackdown and killings in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
Signs of deep dissatisfaction have returned, and the Chinese leadership is reacting -- some Western diplomats say it is seriously overreacting -- to the stirrings of protest.
The depth of discontent is hard to measure, but a secret Government report leaked to a Hong Kong newspaper this week tallied more than 6,000 illegal strikes in China in 1993 and more than 200 riots. Many were protests against layoffs and unpaid wages in cash-starved state industries.
"The Chinese Communist Party takes the issue of mass demonstrations and assemblies very seriously and is on the alert against the flames lest they should spread far and wide," the Chengming newspaper quoted the introduction to the report as saying.
The warning could have come from Mao himself, who, as a young revolutionary, understood that rebellion, whatever its cause, is a prairie fire waiting for a match.
Millions of ordinary people have grievances. In February, the price of vegetables was 54 percent higher than a year earlier; the price of staple grains was up 40 percent, and meat prices had increased by a third.
By any measure, incomes have not kept pace.
"Too high a growth rate will lead to inflation, this is a law," said Sun Shangqing, the research director of China's Cabinet, or State Council, in an interview. "It is true both in the United States and in China."
A Western economist said the year-to-year price increases recorded in the first two months of 1994 were greater than any in the previous four years. If the trend continues, overall inflation could accelerate to an annual rate of more than 50 percent by the end of the year.
"They've got to make controlling inflation the most important objective for the next six to nine months," the economist said. "People are already becoming intolerant of it."
Adding to the insecurity are rumors about the deteriorating health of China's 89-year-old paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, whose feeble state in a televised appearance in February startled many Chinese.
"Stability" has become the watchword of Communist rule, even at the cost of slowing the pace of economic liberalization and reform.
 
Anger Over Corruption
 The Public Security Minister, Tao Siju, warned in a speech to security officials on March 31 that if the Government's seven-month-old drive against corruption did not succeed, "we will not be able to discharge the heavy responsibility of safeguarding stability, and we may even endanger stability."
Many citizens are angered by persistent reports of factory managers taking kickbacks from suppliers, bankers accepting bribes in exchange for easy credit terms and local party officials fixing legal cases.
The litany of public complaints seemed to be summed up last month in a speech by Hou Zhenting, a party official from Hunan Province. At an annual meeting of the National People's Congress, he told some of the more than 2,000 delegates that the Communist Party neglected to pay millions of teachers and issued I.O.U.'s to farmers for their grain in a cruel game of "peasant exploitation."
State industries "are in the red and workers' basic pay cannot be guaranteed while, on the other hand, factory directors and managers travel" abroad at Government expense and give lavish banquets for their cronies. "How can the masses be satisfied with this?" Mr. Hou asked.
The answer, evidently, is that they are not. And the leadership that was brimming with self-confidence just two months ago after a second year of heavy foreign investment and extraordinary growth is showing signs of anxiety.
China's Labor Minister, Li Boyong, warned this week that the country faced "unprecedented challenges in deploying all the jobless," who are flooding into cities from the countryside in search of work. The "floating" population of surplus labor now exceeds 100 million, by some estimates.
"A rise in unemployment rather than inflation would pose a greater threat to China," Li Yining, a senior Government economist, warned.
But labor unrest has other roots as well. Industrial accidents more than doubled in 1993, killing or maiming tens of thousands of Chinese workers, Labor Ministry figures show.
The spread of factories financed by foreigners has led to charges of sweatshop conditions and other forms of exploitation. In Guangdong Province, 500,000 child laborers are estimated to be among the eight million transients in the work force.
Few analysts are surprised that people have tried to organize an independent union movement, which would be perceived as an equal if not greater challenge to the Communist leadership than the campaign for democracy and human rights.
To combat inflation, the Government has reimposed price controls on 20 basic commodities, banned all new major construction projects and outlawed wasteful investment in golf courses and racetracks. But the State Statistical Bureau reported last month that new construction projects in 1994 are running 77 percent ahead of last year's record level.
The ban on golf courses was followed by an announcement from the Billy Caspar Golf Management Inc. of Vienna, Va., that it would break ground this spring on an 18-hole golf resort in the city of Qingdao.
There have been some partial successes in reining in the overheated economy. The central bank under Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is restraining the money supply after a spree of easy credit in 1992 and 1993.
Real-estate speculation touched off by the easy-money policy is now beginning to come under control. But the construction boom remains at full throttle, contributing to the 40 percent rise in prices for cement and steel.
Some economists fear that a shift to a go-slow attitude on the economy and reform will imperil a plan to break up China's 11,000 large state-owned industries. Last fall the Communist Party's Central Committee declared that 100 large state enterprises would be picked in 1994 for conversion to Western-style corporations. At the end of the first quarter, the enterprises selected have yet to be announced.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City Seeks to Lure Non-Gamblers

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, April 8

 BODY:
As campaigns for casino gambling gather momentum in neighboring states and elsewhere in New Jersey, Atlantic City is betting that it can reinvent itself as a convention center and seaside tourist attraction.
That is brave talk for a city that has 12 mammoth casino hotels and parking garages but not a single golf course, movie house or even a supermarket. Even the best natural attraction, the ocean beach, shuts down for most of the year for swimming. 
 The chief reason people are willing to travel long distances to get here -- there were 30.2 million visits last year -- is gambling and gambling alone, industry leaders acknowledge.
"Casino operators are running scared right now, there's no question about it," said Peter G. Boynton, president and chief operating officer of Caesars Atlantic City, one of the 12 casino hotels. "There is a tremendous sense of urgency to make Atlantic City work as a tourist destination instead of just a gambling destination."
 
Fewer Visitors
 The number of visitors to the city has been declining since 1988, from 33.1 million to 30.2 million last year. The recession is mainly to blame, but analysts also say that competition from other gambling centers is beginning to take its toll. Further, a breakdown of market research reveals that the 30 million figure actually represents 7 million people who visit Atlantic City an average of 4.5 times a year, spending seven hours here on each trip.
"Day-trippers represent most of Atlantic City's business, and the casinos made so much money from them for so long that they never readied themselves for competition in the region," said State Senator Richard J. Codey, Democrat of Essex County, who helped write the bill that allowed casino gambling in Atlantic City to begin in 1978.
He said the possible introduction in the next few years of forms of casino gambling in Pennsylvania, New York and Florida could deal a serious blow not only to the resort, but also to the $230 million or so the state collects every year from an 8 percent tax on gross gambling revenue to pay for programs for the elderly and the disabled. New York and Connecticut already have casino gambling on Indian reservations.
"Up to this year the threat of competition has not been a priority in Trenton," Senator Codey said. But the proposal last month by the financier Robert E. Brennan to buy the Meadowlands Sports Complex from the state for $1 billion on the condition that casino gambling be permitted there as well as at Garden State Park, the race track his company already owns outside Camden, has brought the issue "to the front burner," he added.
There is rising sentiment in some quarters that if casinos sprout like mushrooms in neighboring states, New Jersey would be forced to expand casino gambling to the densely populated northern New Jersey and Camden areas to compete. A bill recently introduced in New Jersey calls for a state referendum on riverboat gambling if Pennsylvania or New York approve riverboat gambling.
Riverboat casinos are given an increased chance for Philadelphia after the term of Pennsylvania's Governor, Robert P. Casey, a foe of casino gambling, expires this year.
 
Casino Bill in New York
 In New York, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo remains opposed to additional gambling in the state, but the Legislature is warming up to a bill that would allow a vote on a constitutional amendment on casino gambling by November 1995 at the earliest. Opposition was softened by the opening of a casino last year near Rome, N.Y., by the Oneida Indians under a Federal provision that allows gambling on reservations, and the St. Regis Mohawk tribe near the Canadian border is moving toward its own casino.
Mr. Cuomo appeared to concede last week that the political climate was shifting in favor of some form of casino gambling in New York, though he continued to oppose it.
Atlantic City's official response to this rising competition is to point to the building of a $234 million convention center, scheduled for completion in late 1996, and the tentative approval of plans for a $500 million central corridor redevelopment that would include an entertainment complex, shops, restaurants and other attractions to draw tourists.
Whether those projects will change the city's ragged image to draw another three million convention visitors and tourists a year, as architects of the plans claim, is uncertain.
 
Outside the Casinos
 Cathy Burke hopes the city is finally on the right course to expand its allure beyond the bright lights and whimsical architecture of the mammoth casino structures. She and her husband, Dick, own and operate the Irish Pub and Inn on St. James Place, just 100 yards from the boardwalk and, beyond that, the ocean.
The Burkes opened their establishment in 1973, five years before the first casino opened. After gambling was legalized, they discovered how formidable the casinos were in not letting patrons stray far from the excitement of the gambling tables. Free drinks, meals and hotel rooms kept a short leash on visitors lest they stray off a property and end up playing at a casino a block away. Day-trippers on a budget were induced to remain on a casino property with cut-rate "all-you-can-eat" buffets and discount coupons for shows in theaters adjoining the casino floors.
Even the perception that city streets were not safe to walk, a feeling bolstered by vacant lots, crumbling housing, high crime rates and drug abuse, worked to keep patrons and their wallets inside the high-security casinos. As a result restaurants, shops and nominal tourist-related activities more than one or two blocks from the casinos either died from lack of patronage or never got started in a city that is only six blocks wide for most of its 40-block length.
 
'Have to Sell Atlantic City'
 "I'm very pro-casino, but the reality is that they don't bring people to Atlantic City as much as they bring them into the casinos," said Mrs. Burke, whose popular restaurant and bar draws heavily from the 50,000-member casino-hotel work force, the great majority of whom live outside the city of 37,000. "They haven't had to face the reality before that they have to sell Atlantic City as a seaside resort."
Mack Latz, owner of the Knife and Fork, a restaurant that has been in his family since 1927, said the city long ago fumbled a chance to develop as a convention destination because the casinos preferred keeping many of their best hotel rooms free for high rollers to tying them up far in advance for conventioneers.
"After Atlantic City got gambling, Las Vegas recognized it had to change and it became a convention center and a family tourist destination," said Mr. Latz, 77. "If they could do that in the middle of the desert, imagine what could be done here with the boardwalk and the ocean."
 
Private Investors Are Needed
 Nicholas R. Amato, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, says that Atlantic City is already well along the road to rebirth with the corridor project and 500,000 square feet of exhibit space in the new convention hall. So far, however, the project is dependent on financing by the casinos and the state and has not yet received commitments from private investors critical to its success, other than signing up Doubletree Hotels Corporation to operate a new 600-room hotel and a few additional private vendors.
The casinos must pay Mr. Amato's agency about $40 million a year in a special tax on gambling revenue, with the money going largely for cosmetic changes and landscaping along a three-block wide gateway. But beyond that obligation it is unclear how far casinos will be willing to invest in the rest of Atlantic City as their corporate boards dig deep into their pockets to get in on the ground floor of lucrative venues opening up around the nation.
"Gambling is the business they're in," said Thomas Ballezzi, acting director of the Casino Association of New Jersey, a lobbying and promotion arm of the industry. "From that standpoint they take every opportunity to expand, just like Wal-Mart or Kmart would."
But casino operators in Atlantic City will be competing with themselves by opening new ventures in the region, torn between the allure of profitable new markets and protecting their heavily mortgaged properties here.
"It's much cheaper to invest in a riverboat somewhere than rebuild Atlantic City," said Steven P. Perskie, the chairman of the Casino Control Commission, the state casino regulatory board, who recently announced he was stepping down. "But if they do substantially broaden tourist attractions here it is my opinion Atlantic City will flourish against any expansion of riverboat gambling in the region."


GRAPHIC: Dozens of states are considering allowing some form of casino gambling to raise revenues and in anticipation of similar actions by their neighbors. Connecticut and New York already have casinos on Indian reservations, which do not come under state jurisdiction. Legislatures in the following states are focusing on gambling proposals that could eat into Atlantic City's customer base.
Chart: "THE PUSH TOWARD CASINO GAMBLING: Legislatures Consider Gambling Bills

NEW YORK
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo opposes casino gambling, but the Legislature is considering allowing a referendum on the issue. Groups and lawmakers throughout the state have proposed casinos for their areas. The Oneida Indians have a casino in Verona, near Rome, and a second casino is planned by the Mohawk tribe on the St. Regis Indian Reservation. The Legislature recently rejected a proposal for a state-run keno game.
CONNECTICUT
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s opposition has been the biggest roadblock to casino gambling, but he is not running for re-election this year. A bill approved last week by a House committee would allow dog tracks in Plainfield and Bridgeport to build casinos offering table games, but its ultimate fate is uncertain. In addition to the Mashantucket Pequot casino in Ledyard, the Mohegan tribe in Montville also plans a casino.
NEW JERSEY
Expanding casino gambling beyond Atlantic City would require a voter referendum, which would have to be passed by a three-fifths majority in both houses of the Legislature. The powerful Speaker of the Assembly, Chuck Haytaian, opposes further expansion of gambling in the state, and last year the Legislature rejected a referendum on sports betting. The financier Robert E. Brennan has proposed casino gambling at the Meadowlands and at the Garden State race track outside Camden.
PENNSYLVANIA
The State Legislature is considering a measure to permit gambling on Pennsylvania's navigable rivers and lakes, subject to state and county referendums, within two years. But approval of riverboat casinos is far from certain, since Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, has vowed to veto any casino bill he receives before his term ends next January. The bill also faces strong opposition in the Senate. Philadelphia's Mayor, Edward G. Rendell, is a leading advocate of riverboat gambling. (pg. 44)

HEADLINE: Kohl's Challenger Is Coming on Visit to Try to Reassure U.S.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, April 9

 BODY:
Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic challenger to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Germany's elections on Oct. 16, is taking his campaign to the United States in the coming week, hoping to persuade President Clinton and other leaders that he will be as reliable an ally as Mr. Kohl.
"There are some people in Germany who believe that NATO could be replaced by something else," he said before his departure, distancing himself from more radical members of his party who have suggested replacing the alliance with a 52-nation European security conference instead. 
 "There are others, like the Green party, who believe NATO can be disbanded," he said, referring to the environmentalist grouping many German commentators speculate he would have to rely on for support in Parliament if he won.
"I think both views are wrong," Mr. Scharping said. "We want NATO, and we understand it to be more than just a defense alliance. It's also accomplished a great deal politically."
One of its achievements, he believes from his experience as Governor of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where 150,000 American soldiers and their families were stationed at the height of the cold war, is a gradual reconciliation between Germans and Americans.
Mr. Scharping, 46, was elected leader of the Social Democratic Party in June, and has concentrated on restoring the centrist image it had when it last held power, under Chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, more than a decade ago.
Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats say Mr. Scharping will be unable to escape the influence of his left wing, which since Mr. Schmidt was deposed in 1982 advocated accommodation with the Communists in eastern Europe and distanced itself from United States military policies.
Though Mr. Scharping got into trouble last month for botching an explanation of a campaign pledge to impose a 10 percent tax surcharge on higher incomes (above $35,000, not $30,000 as he said), Mr. Kohl said this week that his party would impose a 7.5 percent surcharge on all taxpayers next year for as long as it took to get the formerly Communist eastern sections of the country into decent economic shape.
The Social Democrats lead the Christian Democrats by about five percentage points in public opinion polls, but Mr. Kohl dismissed that as irrelevant six months before the elections. Both contenders insist that they will win in October.
Mr. Scharping, who speaks English, is scheduled to see Mr. Clinton in the White House on Tuesday, and said he wanted to discuss such things as the economic policies both men want to stimulate growth, create jobs and reduce budget deficits.
 
Will Visit New York
 During his talks with other officials and business representatives in New York City, Mr. Scharping also expects to be questioned about his party's opposition to German military participation in United Nations "blue helmet" peacekeeping missions that could involve the risk of combat.
The Social Democrats challenged Mr. Kohl's decision to send 1,500 German soldiers to northern Somalia last year, also arguing that the 1949 German Constitution barred German participation in military enforcement of the naval and air blockades around Bosnia. The German constitutional court is expected to rule on the issue this summer.
He said "I am for German participation in blue-helmet activities" if they are constitutional and Parliament approves. He added: "These soldiers must have the right to defend themselves and to carry out their mission. I am also for Germany's taking part in blockade actions, and if need be in their military enforcement. That describes everything the United Nations has done in recent years and will realistically be able to do in the near future."

HEADLINE: Reassessing a Dream -- A special report.;
Years on Integration Road: New Views of an Old Goal

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
It has been 40 years since Brown v. the Board of Education, when the United States Supreme Court set the stage for all schools to be open to all children, no matter the color of their skin. It has been 30 years since Congress passed a Civil Rights Act that banished barriers to equal access, officially ushering in an era in which blacks and whites were to live and work together.
But for many black Americans, this year of anniversaries is more a time of reflection than celebration. From the young who never knew Jim Crow, to their elders who fought to destroy discrimination, many black Americans are raising questions about what integration has done, and what it can ultimately accomplish. 
 "I think there is a growing feeling in the black community that integration is a tarnished goal," said Dr. Lawrence D. Bobo, a sociology professor and director of the Center for Research on Race, Politics and Society at the University of California at Los Angeles. "It's viewed with greater skepticism by blacks then it was in the past. That doesn't mean it's been repudiated. There's not much evidence of that. But I think the benefits of it are more often questioned and the burdens that come with it are more prominent topics of discussion than they were in the past."
A March 1993 New York Times/CBS News poll found that a majority of both blacks and whites answered yes when asked if "generally speaking," they favored full integration. But recent interviews with blacks who acknowledged that they have benefited from victories of the civil rights movement, elicited a range of views more complex than the straightforward answers to that straightforward question.
Among blacks who have worked, learned and lived in predominantly white settings, one theme occurs over and over again: such interaction has not made many whites accept blacks as equals, and perhaps never will.
"We were integration warriors," said Karen A. Phillips, who helped integrate the white high school in her hometown of Ocilla, Ga. "I chose a college and a major because I didn't know any black people who'd done it before."
"The only problem is, things opened up, but attitudes stayed the same," said Ms. Phillips, 41, and running the Abyssinian Development Corporation, which is building housing for middle- and low-income residents to help redevelop Harlem. "We thought that if they saw we were intelligent and could compete with them, things would even out. It's taken us a long time to figure out giving up your community to go to theirs doesn't mean you're going to be accepted."
 
The Balance Sheet:
The Losses And the Gains
 The last three decades have definitely yielded progress. The percentage of all black families earning incomes of $50,000 or more (as adjusted to 1992 dollars) rose from 10.2 percent in 1970 to 16 percent in 1992, according to statistics from the United States Census Bureau. But meanwhile, whites -- already ahead -- were also making gains; the proportion of white families with comparable earnings rose from 24.5 percent to 35.7 percent in the same period.
The percentage of blacks in professional or managerial jobs rose from 10 percent to 16.8 percent in the same period. And the percentage of blacks 25 to 29 years old who had completed at least four years of college more than doubled, from 6 percent in 1970 to 12.7 percent in 1989.
But as much as some things changed, others have stayed the same. The median household income for blacks compared to whites has budged little in the last 20 years, with black households in 1992 earning 58 percent of the income earned by white households -- the same as in 1972.
A Harvard study last December found that in the 1991-92 school year, 66 percent of the 6.9 million black students in the nation's public schools attended predominantly minority schools -- the highest percentage documented since 1968. (There are no comparable figures for the years before the Brown v. Board of Education decision.) Even on integrated campuses, students often do not interact across racial lines, in the classroom or outside.
Some blacks lament what they believe was lost in the quest to integrate -- black neighborhoods, etched by the confines of segregation, that forged a bond between the poor and the middle-income who lived side by side; incubators for black commerce, and support systems for black families and institutions.
They emphasize they would never give up the hard-won right to choose where, and with whom to live. But they say there is a need for blacks to regain a self-reliance that flourished when it was painfully clear how important it was that blacks be able to count on one another.
 
Remembering Jim Crow
 "I think some of the things we enjoyed when we were living among ourselves need to be recaptured," said Pamela K. Johnson, 33, who believes that integration "dissipated our energies and our economic strength."
Ms. Johnson, an editor at Essence, a black woman's magazine, lives in Harlem, the community in which she was born. "It's a choice," she said. "I could have gone in a lot of different directions. I had the intelligence and education. But I came to Harlem."
The isolation she felt working more than three years at a predominantly white newspaper in Albuquerque, N.M., helped her make her decisions. "I didn't want to use my energies to reset the priorities of that organization," she said. "I felt I wanted my time, my energy to be invested into something that was building my community."
By the time Ms. Johnson was born in New York City, the official segregation known as the Jim Crow system was on its deathbed in the South.
Nellie Hester-Bailey, 47, grew up during its reign, and remembers it well.
She was raised in Tuscaloosa, home of the University of Alabama, where a defiant George C. Wallace once stood in the doorway to prevent black students from enrolling. Mrs. Hester-Bailey carried picket signs and marched in the streets to bring an end to segregation, and said she would never want to see it return.
"It's unreal to think you could create it again," Mrs. Hester-Bailey said. "The horror of segregation, and the deadly racism that it came from, is not something I'd want anyone to go through."
Today Mrs. Hester-Bailey, the widowed mother of two sons, lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in a neighborhood that reflects the multi-colored diversity of New York City. Her 14-year-old son attends Trinity School, a private school on the Upper West Side; her older son is a freshman at Harvard. She has friends of various backgrounds, she said, and her husband was white.
Describing herself as a product of "a system of parallel lives, separate but unequal," she said: "I can say that it did not damage me. I am a bit nostalgic in the sense I survived."
She remembers with some fondness a nurturing all-black universe that helped hone her self-esteem.
"We had our own doctors, our own soda shops," Mrs. Hester-Bailey said. "We didn't have the psychic pressure of feeling uncomfortable, of feeling less than. We didn't have or need a Jesse Jackson on the national level saying 'I am somebody,' because it came from our teachers, our churches, the man who ran the movie theater."
 
Age-Old Debate
Renewed Urgency Amid Change
 The discussion about whether to concentrate on enhancing one's own community or integrating into the mainstream is not a new one. From Marcus Garvey to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the two philosophies have been coexistent constants, arguments for each gaining or losing strength depending on the political and economic climate of the time.
Recently the debate has taken on renewed urgency, driven in part by a changing economy that has eliminated jobs and highlighted the need for entrepreneurship, and in part by a series of decisions by government, courts and voters that many blacks read as signals of a growing national ambivalence, or even hostility, toward the civil rights agenda of the 1960's.
Others enter the debate because of more personal experiences at work, at school, in neighborhoods.
"I think the great optimism we all had after the civil rights movement was diluted, and finally just swallowed up by experience," said Derrick Bell, the author of "Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism."
 
'A Subtle Part of Racism'
 Many blacks talk of having grown weary, saying they have endured years of slights and doubts from some white colleagues and neighbors. Many contend that interaction on purportedly equal terms has not necessarily permeated the wall of race, or led to understanding and friendship.
Marcus L. Alexis 2d, 34, who works in investment management for Bankers Trust in Manhattan, said: "I think the trend is for people to retreat back into their comfort zone. Nobody wants to subject their children or their wives or themselves to an environment where they're not wanted."
Such withdrawal disappoints him, though he says he can understand why people make that decision.
There is, he said, "a subtle part of racism that's very different from what our parents and grandparents experienced."
"The subtle part is unspoken," he said. "It's inflection, it's body language, it's all the nuances people feel that suggest 'you're not welcome here.' And that's what a lot of my friends are feeling when they decide they don't want to participate in conversations and social gatherings with white folks."
But ultimately, Mr. Alexis said he has benefited from the doors opened during the civil rights movement.
"My world is a bigger place now," he said. "It doesn't always welcome me, but it's a bigger place. And I like that, even with all the baggage that comes along with it."
 
Pursuing Choices
As Individuals And in Groups
 Another perspective on integration comes from Dr. Judy A. Miller, 65, the New Jersey director of Cities in Schools, a national dropout prevention program. Thirty years ago she picketed schools in Montclair, N.J., and with her late husband, Don, fought to integrate the neighborhood where they lived and raised their two sons.
"It was what I had to do at that time," she said. "And when I came through it, I realized that integration in many ways really hadn't happened. It happened for me. I lived a very integrated life. But the kids I deal with every day don't. It didn't happen for them and their parents."
A professor emeritus of African-American studies at Seton Hall University, Dr. Miller said she also began to see a chasm between her students and less fortunate blacks. "I hear young people talk about 'them,' their own people," she said. "They don't feel a connection."
Dr. Miller remembers that as a poor child growing up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, she lived next door to a schoolteacher who became her godmother. "Now, those of us who are middle-class are afraid of these young people," she said. "And I find that these are young people the same as I was, hungry for somebody to talk to them and help them."
 
Coming Full Circle
 She continues to live in an integrated neighborhood, but integration is no longer a priority in her life socially or professionally, she said. "I can't integrate the thousands of kids who are in the inner city of Newark," she said. "I just want to make sure they get a good education and know responsible adults who will help them grow up and live."
Ms. Phillips, the head of the Abyssinian Development Corporation, says her life illustrates how the benefits of integration have come full circle.
She graduated from the University of Georgia, where she studied landscape architecture because she knew no blacks who had done either, and she went on to work in what she calls "corporate America."
Because of these experiences, "I'm more fulfilled with what I do now," she said. "It's a fulfillment of what that whole cycle of integration meant. I was able to obtain skills that help me do what I do for my community."
With time has come a recognition that integration all too often meant blacks meeting whites on whites' terms, she said. "The whole pretense of integration was 'white was right,' that it can only be good if it's from that culture," she said. "And now we're getting to accept who we are, and saying 'No, I don't have to go somewhere else to get the better things in life.' "
Brumsic Brandon 3d, 37, helped integrate schools in Westbury, L.I., as a child. When it came time to find a neighborhood in which to raise their 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, he and his wife knew what they wanted: safety, good schools and a middle-class neighborhood that was predominantly black.
"I didn't want them to become pioneers in a community where they would be odd people to their classmates, or their classmates would be ignorant of our people," Mr. Brandon said.
Saying that he wanted his children to have their cultural pride reinforced when they dealt with their neighbors, he added, "I'd like to limit the forces that work against that."
The family settled a year ago in Columbia, Md., a suburban community between Baltimore and Washington.
But even as some blacks are choosing to live and work in places that are not integrated, civil rights groups continue to fight for their right to make the opposite choice.
Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, said: "To overcome institutional racism and sexism, you can't settle on a strategy of retreat and withdrawal and cynicism. If there's nobody pressing against the gates, it's only going to get worse."
For some civil rights organizations, as well as many black individuals, the answer is pursuing dual priorities: integration as well as other strategies aimed at improving the lives of the nation's nearly 32 million blacks, who make up more than 12 percent of the country's population.
Theodore M. Shaw, 39, associate director counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., the nation's oldest civil rights law firm, said: "I'm not willing to say we're not committed to desegregating public schools where we can accomplish that. But we're not simply pursuing the mixing of bodies -- integration for integration's sake. There are other values that we also think are important."
Frank Lomax, acting president of the National Urban League, said, "We cannot give up on a goal of a pluralistic, integrated society, and the civil rights community has to continue to keep that goal in sight."
Despite tremendous advancement for blacks during the last few decades, Mr. Lomax said, there is still much to be done, and black Americans must continue to concentrate on helping themselves, especially their children. "I think we have to identify the resources we have and mobilize them to solve our problems," he said. "You can call it self-help if you want, but it's not new. And we have to accelerate it."

Plenty of Ammunition In Salary Cap Battle

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
After the first negotiating session between labor representatives of the owners and the players last month, Richard Ravitch made a comment that attracted virtually no notice but most likely signaled an important element of the owners' strategy as the talks for a new labor agreement proceed.
Noting that reporters always write about differences among the owners, Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said: "I can't believe that with what is happening in the game that there aren't differences of opinion among players. Guys who were making millions of dollars last year aren't." 
 Translation: With a mushrooming number of veteran players being forced to accept relatively meager salaries if they want to continue playing, these longtime union members can't be pleased with economic developments and would fare significantly better under a salary cap.
Strategy: Emphasize the economic disparity with increasing frequency in an effort to divide and conquer. Drive a wedge between the stars making the big money and the growing segment of veterans facing vastly reduced wages or no jobs at all.
Ravitch has plenty of ammunition to use in his salary cap campaign if he pursues that strategy.
 
Drastic Cuts for Some
 Jack Morris, for example, is pitching for the Cleveland Indians for a base salary of $350,000 after having earned a career-high $5,425,000 last season. Bobby Thigpen has a $200,000 base salary with the Seattle Mariners, a mere pittance compared with his $3,416,667 income last year. Rick Sutcliffe, now with St. Louis, is earning one-tenth the $2.5 million he made last year.
In all, 29 players who earned $1 million or more last season have base salaries below $1 million this season, and other players have seen their salaries fall through the millions but not plummet lower than $1 million.
"It's disappointing, but there's nothing you can do about it," said Jeff Reardon, who only two years after a career-high $2,666,667 has a $250,000 base salary with the Yankees. "It's either take that salary or go home. I made that in 1982. Here it is 1994. On the other hand, you can't make that anywhere else. If you feel you can still play, you'll play for nothing."
Now there's an idea the owners would leap at.
Jay Howell, whose salary has reached $805,000 after peaking at $2,575,000 in 1992, said the clubs' practice of reducing veterans' pay has long existed. "You're just seeing it more now because the salaries are higher," the Texas Rangers' relief pitcher said. "There's a bigger decrease."
Anyway, he added, players who have earned millions in recent times aren't necessarily hanging around in the hopes of making more millions.
 
'Not in It for Money'
 Citing Reardon, Howell said: "He's not in it for money. He's made enough money. He's in it to win a championship."
When Howell's comment was related to Reardon, the veteran reliever said: "That's exactly why I'm here. The veterans want to get a ring. I made my money. Sure, I'd like to make more, but it's no big deal."
Howell noted that salary disparity exists in "all sorts of jobs." "You have to be realistic," he said. "If you're a starter, you're paid like a starter. If you're a second or third-tier player, you're not going to get the money."
As well as Howell and Reardon rationalize the development of the veterans' salary slash, players are not thrilled with it. Not that they can't live nicely on a few hundred thousand, but they feel they deserve more. The owners, on the other hand, probably shouldn't count on that feeling to influence the players' view of a salary cap or the possibility of their acting against the best interests of their union.
"I don't feel that will ever happen," said Chris James, an eight-year veteran who has a $500,000 salary with the Rangers. "We're strong as a unit. I can't see anybody turning against what we're trying to do. It's going to be important for us to stick together.
"That's part of the owners' ploy, to try to split the high-salaried players and the lower-paid players. They want to create a rift. But the players know the situation, what it would mean if a handful of players started griping. The players are unified regardless of what you make."
 
A Most Grateful Big Leaguer
 No one who won a major league job in spring training this year felt what Bill Taylor did when Tony La Russa, the Oakland manager, told him before the last exhibition game that he had made the team.
"He said keep it silent, don't tell anybody because he had to tell other guys they didn't make it," Taylor related. "I understood that. I've been there. But it was hard for me to keep from smiling and glowing. After 14 years, when someone comes up and tells you you made the big league club, how can you not show excitement? But I did a good job."
A relief pitcher who now is 32 years old, Taylor labored for the past 14 seasons in the minor leagues without ever getting a chance to pitch in the majors. He thought he had pitched well enough last spring to earn a seat in the Toronto bullpen, but when the Blue Jays went north he wasn't with them.
"You think you'll be on the team," Taylor said, "but just before the bus is leaving, he tells you you're not going to be on that bus."
This time, though, Taylor made the bus and the team. He also made it into each of the Athletics' first three games, facing nine batters and retiring all of them, including Dave Winfield and Matt Walbeck of Minnesota with the tying run at third base in the 10th inning Friday night. Four of the hitters batted left-handed, creating an early test for the right-handed reliever.
"We have only one left-hander in the bullpen," Taylor explained. "One of the things they're looking for me to do is go out and get left-handers out."
Taylor's new status means a new life style for his wife, Lisa, and their 5-year-old daughter, Logan. The women in the family traveled from their home in Thomasville, Ga., to Minneapolis Friday to join Taylor, and they plan to make other trips as well.
"My family stayed with me through all the frustration," he said. "Whatever we've been through, my wife never told me to quit playing ball. She said, you'll know when it's time; I'll support you as much as I can."
 
Mercker Remains a Realist
 Kent Mercker was talking about his role in the Atlanta Braves' pitching rotation. As the fifth starter in a renowned four-man rotation, he could face pressure to keep up with his four colleagues or he could be ignored because all of the attention is on them.
"It's not realistic for me to win 20 games," Mercker said one day in spring training. "At most, I could get 24 starts. I'm not saying if I had 36 starts, I'd win 20. The pressure is on them. They're expected to win games. I don't think there are great expectations about me."
Oh no? Why wouldn't the expectations be great when a pitcher makes 12 starts in the major leagues and two of them become no-hitters.
In the most recent of his 12 starts, which have been spread over six seasons, Mercker pitched a no-hitter Friday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In his third start, which occurred Sept. 11, 1991, he pitched the first six innings of a three-pitcher no-hitter against the San Diego Padres.
Despite his remarkable record, the 26-year-old right-hander knows his place.
"I know any time there are off days or rainouts, I'll be bypassed," Mercker said. "But I was going nine days between relief appearances so I'm used to the delay. If you're a long man, you don't have much of a job on this team. These guys will go six, seven, eight innings every time. I definitely want to start."
Mercker shouldn't have any problem holding onto that role. Whether or not he can maintain his no-hit pace is another matter.
 
Home-Run Firsts
 Joe Carter and Bill Mazeroski are linked in World Series history because they are the only two players who have ended a World Series with a home run. Mazeroski did it in 1960, Carter last year.
Now Carter and Ray Lankford are linked in an even rarer way. Last Sunday night, when Lankford began the St. Louis Cardinals' game against the Cincinnati Reds with a home run against Jose Rijo, it completed a first in baseball history. It marked the first time home runs have ended a World Series one season and started the opening game of the next season.
What happened in the first game of the 1961 season? Leading off for the Chicago White Sox against the Washington Senators 33 years ago today, Luis Aparicio walked.

The Blues Dwindle Down to a Precious Few Along Atlantic

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

 BODY:
The powerful, rapacious bluefish -- the most important species in the marine recreational fishing industry from Cape Cod to Virginia -- is on the decline all along the Atlantic seaboard.
Those who began angling for bluefish 15 years ago chose a good time to do so. From then until about 1990, the fish were abundant, and many large specimens, 15 pounds and more, were present. In 1979, the total recreational catch along the Atlantic coast was more than 140 million pounds. It dropped to 86 million pounds in 1984, rose to nearly 130 million pounds in 1986 and has been declining ever since, falling to 37 million pounds in 1992. Landing figures for 1993 are not yet available, but there is every reason to believe that the downward trend is continuing. 
 The bluefish is a migratory species that spawns in the open ocean, with the young, or snappers, seeking the sanctuary of sounds, bays and estuaries, including salt ponds, to escape being eaten by other species as well as their own parents.
Over the last 200 years and more, bluefish have gone through cycles of scarcity and plenty, particularly in the northern portion of their range, from Long Island to Maine. Bruce Freeman, a research scientist with the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, says that from about 1750 to 1770, bluefish were so scarce off Long Island that when they returned in good numbers, people didn't know what they were.
In their "Fishes of the Gulf of Maine," a 1953 publication of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder noted that bluefish were plentiful off southern New England in colonial times, but had virtually disappeared about 1764, "not to reappear there until about 1810. From that time on they increased in abundance west and south of Cape Cod, but none was reported north of the Cape until 1837."
By the 1870's, bluefish were swarming throughout the northernmost portion of their range, but in the early 1900's they were once again in short supply, with their numbers increasing again in 1927. This petered out again, and in 1946, according to Bigelow and Schroeder, blues were so scarce that the total catch for the Gulf of Maine and the southern Massachusetts coast was only about 1,200 pounds.
There is no question that bluefish stocks have fluctuated widely over the centuries. Clearly, natural causes play a major role in this, if only because many such fluctuations took place before man's harvesting of the species became significant. Among the natural causes are changes in water temperature. Bluefish favor water between 66 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Depletion of forage species favored by bluefish -- such as menhaden, sea herring and sand eels -- and bad spawning years are also factors. Spawning success was poor in 1986 and 1987, and the lowest on record in 1988.
Before World War II, periodic declines in bluefish stocks had no major economic effect on the coastal states from Massachusetts to Virginia. Since the late 1940's, however, triggered by greater affluence and more leisure time, a saltwater sport fishing industry whose total economic impact is estimated at billions of dollars has evolved along the Atlantic coast. This includes surf fishermen, those who own their own boats and those who go out on charter or party boats.
In the Middle Atlantic Bight -- roughly from Montauk to Virginia -- the bluefish has been the backbone of this industry, even though in some areas at certain times, the summer flounder, or fluke, and the northern weakfish might get more attention. In the past several years, severe restrictions on the sport and commercial harvesting of striped bass has resulted in that species making an astonishing and welcome comeback from a record low, and last year along some areas of the coast, including southern Massachusetts, it was easier to catch a striper than a blue. There is every reason to believe that bluefish will be scarce in New England waters in 1994.
In 1990, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission devised a bluefish management plan for the entire Atlantic coast, from Maine to Florida. In essence, the plan called for a 10-fish-a-day limit for sport fishermen. It also, to simplify somewhat, limits the commercial catch to 20 per cent of the total (recreation plus commercial) landings. Should it appear that the commercial catch for a coming season is going to exceed that percentage, the participating states would impose quotas on their commercial fisheries. Most of the coastal states went along with the plan.

Abandoning Democracy

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Under violent attack throughout Haiti, the struggling but unsubdued peasant organizations, representing 80 percent of the country's population, are making it clear that they are no longer fooled by the ruses and false promises of the Clinton Administration.
"President Clinton's position on Haiti is one that I would not even say is ambiguous," declared Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, leader of the Peasant Movement of Papay, Haiti's oldest and largest nongovernmental organization. "His position is very clear. It's consistent with a policy that does not want the restoration of democracy in Haiti. Nor does it want the restoration of Aristide as President." 
 The Haitian peasantry has been -- and continues to be -- ruthlessly exploited by the Haitian elite and by foreign governments and commercial interests, especially in the U.S. When democracy came to Haiti in the form of free and fair elections in December 1990, the peasants were overjoyed by their seemingly miraculous opportunity to go to the polls and vote for whomever they pleased.
United States officials had hoped that in the presidential balloting the Haitians would elect Marc Bazin, a smooth, well-educated technocrat who could be counted upon to restrain the surging aspirations of the poverty-stricken masses. After all, getting the right to vote is one thing, but making serious economic and social headway at the expense of the business elite -- both foreign and domestic -- is quite something else.
The peasants may be uneducated, but they are not stupid. They had no use for Mr. Bazin. They wanted real change. They wanted the man who had been with them all along and who spoke directly to their needs, who promised to end the violence and corruption of Duvalierism and to fight for land reform, and for an increase in the minimum wage to 50 cents an hour. They wanted the little priest they called, with great affection, "Titid."
When the balloting was through, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide had gotten a remarkable 67 percent of the vote in a field of 11 candidates. Having spoken, the poor people of Haiti exploded in celebration, dancing and singing in the streets, and exclaiming over and over: "Communique! Communique! Titid is President!"
The celebration has long since ended and a hideous wave of repression has once again rolled over Haiti. New paramilitary terror squads, successors to the dreaded Tontons Macoute, roam the cities and the countryside, thieving, raping and killing with impunity. The cruel system of section chiefs, local administrators with life-and-death power over peasants, has been reinstated. It had been abolished by Father Aristide.
Advances made over several years by the Peasant Movement of Papay and other organizations are being systematically destroyed. Citing just one example, Mr. Jean-Baptiste said that tens of thousands of trees planted by peasants to halt disastrous soil erosion were being destroyed by the military as part of its overall assault on the peasantry.
"They said that the trees were Communist," said Mr. Jean-Baptiste.
Grain and other commodities stored by peasants have been looted by the military. There has been widespread destruction of livestock. Working conditions, always poor, have deteriorated. The official minimum wage is 35 cents an hour, but it is common for Haitians to work for as little as 14 cents an hour.
Thousands of peasant leaders have gone into hiding to escape arrest and torture. Many others have been killed.
"It is worse," said Mr. Jean-Baptiste, "than it ever was under Duvalier."
The interests of the vast majority of Haitians, on the one hand, and the alliance of the United States Government and American businesses on the other, are different. And so the Clinton Administration -- in its actions, if not its words -- has abandoned Father Aristide and his followers and sided with the murderous enemies of democracy in Haiti. The Administration's goal is twofold: to maintain the gruesome exploitation of cheap Haitian labor by big American companies, and -- at all costs -- to keep Haitian refugees out of this country.
It is an infamous policy that will be damned in the cold light of history.

Gay Businesses Follow Influx of Gay People

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE 

 BODY:
On May 1, A Different Light will move from the West Village to 151 West 19th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.
That the company, a focal point in gay literary circles, decided to move its flagship store to Chelsea seems to confirm what local residents have observed in recent months: that Chelsea has become a magnet for gay businesses, which were once centered in the West Village. 
 New businesses are moving in, and older ones are migrating. In the past year, citing space, safety and economic considerations, at least a dozen new businesses run by gays or lesbians, or that cater mostly to a gay market, have set up shop in the area from Avenue of the Americas to Ninth Avenue and between 13th and 23d Streets. The attraction has been growing for several years.
"Chelsea has become the gay neighborhood because gays and lesbians feel comfortable here," said Richard Laermer, author of "The Gay and Lesbian Handbook to New York City," due out in bookstores on April 25. "Stores and restaurants are coming in because they want to be among their own and they know their own have money to spend."
Tim Gay, co-chairman of Community Board 4's quality of life committee, said gay people had been moving into Chelsea in growing numbers since the 70's because it is "quiet, congenial, moderately priced and safe." Businesses, he said, are now coming for the same reasons.
Police statistics show that the West Village's gay-bias incidents outnumbering Chelsea's by far.
A Different Light's main reason for moving was space, said Walter Vatter, the marketing director. The old location had 800 square feet; the new one covers 5,000 square feet, with room for browsing, special events and a cafe to open in September. "That kind of affordable space cannot be found in the Village," he said.
It was Chelsea's affluent gay professionals and young couples that appealed to John Blair, co-owner of the new American Fitness on Eighth Avenue at 17th Street. And the gyms and body-conscious people drew Raymond Dragon, a unisex clothier, says Tim Cass, the manager.
Several major gay organizations, like Gay Men's Health Crisis and the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, are based in Chelsea, providing "a strong sense of community," Mr. Gay said
As the gay population has grown, so has the number of local people with AIDS. Michael Kaminer, a spokesman for the APP Community Pharmacy, which opened last month, said it was "designed for people with AIDS and H.I.V."
Even the Gay Games IV has set up its New York headquarters in the Chelsea area. Marlin Collingwood, a spokesman, says the group also expects to open a shop with memorabilia next month -- "on Eighth Avenue, of course." MARVINE HOWE

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Dog Ate It

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
THERE'S the dog that decided to chew up the electric bill. The family that couldn't return its library books because of the children's busy social schedules. And the man who had no choice but to double-park his car. (He had to go to the bathroom.)
In thousands of conversations around the city each day, a battle of wits is waged between those who owe and those who must collect, between those who pitch excuses and those who decide whether they are telling the truth. 
 The people who spend their day sizing up excuses are not a special breed of hard-boiled skeptics, as one might expect. In fact, some have fairly soft hearts, and most have even retained a sense of humor, although they are quick to point out that they weren't born yesterday.
"Sometimes you know they are not telling the truth," says Jackie Antoine, a customer service representative for Con Ed, who spends most of her eight-hour workday listening to excuses. "Some people come in every month and tell you their grandmother died. Or they didn't get the bill, or coffee spilled on the bill. Or their boss wouldn't give them the day off to pay the bill. One gentleman really told me that the dog ate the bill."
Ms. Antoine has spent 13 years listening to such offerings in person from people who can't seem to pay for their gas and electricity. From her desk in a customer-service center at 1555 Third Avenue in Manhattan, where soft rock music is piped in to soothe potentially savage consumers, she listens to constant tales of woe intended to stave off the utility at least for the moment.
She tells of a man who has presented a steady stream of excuses over the last year and a half. "This month he's taking care of his grandmother and has to pay her Con Ed bill," Ms. Antoine said. "The month before he had to send his daughter to California because he was having a custody fight with his wife. Before that he was going through the divorce. I've gotten his entire life story through his excuses for not paying the bill."
In general, Con Ed does not accept explanations, only money. But the company will bend before certain excuses. If a customer can show some dire personal circumstance -- like a death in the family or financial hardship -- the company will try to work out a payment plan or give advice about city agencies or charities that might be helpful, Ms. Antoine said. Con Ed employees have brought in old coats to help clients who were clearly needy, she added, and she frequently asks customers to sing along with her to the music wafting through her office.
"We are allowed to be human beings here," she said. "As a matter of fact, it's encouraged in these economic times."
Library-book borrowers lob all kinds of excuses, a patently unnecessary act in a realm where lateness is punished, regardless of the reason, at the rate of 15 cents a day. "There are people who, when you see them, you think, 'Oh, God, what is it going to be today,' " said Marsha Spyros, the New York Public Library's East Side regional librarian. "We have one reader who has an incredible string of sob stories that involve virtually every member of her family and divorce and drugs and serious illness, although we've never seen any evidence of it."
There are people who claim the weather interfered, trapping them in their apartments, or blame lateness on their children's schedules, or say traveling to Europe prevented them from returning their books. Then there are the people who fall into a separate category, Ms. Spyros said. "They are people who should be buying their books, not borrowing them," she said. "They are the ones who find it hard to be separated from books. They don't renew books, they just keep them."
Being the bad guy is stressful under such circumstances, she said. The worst punishment at her disposal is taking away someone's library privileges. "There is a woman who burst into tears one day because I insisted that she had to pay some of her fines. She said, 'I can either eat or pay my fines.' So there's a very heavy burden of guilt on us."
Judy Hensen also hears her share of excuses as manager of the Department of Transportation's Borough Help Center in Brooklyn. It's the place where people go to pay the city or (most of the time) to plead not guilty after receiving parking tickets, blaming unreasonable laws, enforced by meter maids and their male counterparts. The city's voluminous parking regulations entitle drivers to hearings, where excuses can actually be helpful if presented to judges who preside inside hearing rooms at the center.
The manager's office, however, is often the first stop. "A lot of times, they want us to tell them whether it's a good excuse," Ms. Hensen said, as an angry man with a sheaf of violations stood before her constructing a complicated tale about a wife with cancer, a case of mistaken identity and something about driving to Mexico. "We tell them, 'Tell the judge. Tell the judge.' " When the moon is full, she added, people tend to come in and scream their excuses.
Many of the excuses are predictable: "I didn't see the sign," or "I wasn't driving the car." And others seem to stem from the belief that New Yorkers have a divine right to park -- whether or not there is a legitimate space for the car. "There was no other place to park," a man named Roosevelt was telling one judge on a recent afternoon in one of the help center's 12 hearing rooms. He was trying to wriggle out of a $55 double-parking fine. He failed.
Another defendant, an elderly man in zippered galoshes and a tweed roadster cap, dragged a large black briefcase up to the bench. "I take a lot of medication, which I have with me," he told the judge, Edward Koppell, opening the case to release a cascade of pill bottles and other pharmaceutical products. "One of the pills I take is a diuretic. I had to go to the bathroom, so I parked the car. I left my wife in the car, and she was unable to move it."
The judge, a 15-year veteran, took some sympathy and reduced the fine. The man shuffled away, briefcase in hand and the tiniest smile on his lips.
All judges in the help center (there is one in every borough) are lawyers, and all must have practiced for at least five years before signing up for the parking bench. The experience helps them assess whether a person's excuse, however farfetched, is to be believed.
Many are not. "We had one woman the other day, who was absolutely crazy," Ms. Hensen said. "She said she was driving the car and her 13-year-old daughter was with her. She told the judge she thought her daughter had jumped out of the car, so she pulled over and the cop gave her a ticket for double parking. This was in Canarsie. She told the judge she wasn't double-parked, she was under the car, looking for her daughter." The woman was found guilty, Ms. Hensen said.
And yes, the old dog excuse gets unleashed here, too. "I had a lady whose license plate was mutilated," said Bert Berkow, another judge, "and she claimed her pit bull ate it."

Chart: "DON'T EVEN TRY: A Guide to Bad Excuses"
 Here are excuses that don't work, excuse-takers say.
 
"THE DOG ATE THE . . . " (BILL, TICKET, LIBRARY BOOK, ETC.) Why it won't work: Too many people have exploited it, and even dogs draw the line sometimes.
 
"I DIDN'T SEE THE SIGN." Why it wont work: You're suposed to look for the sign. Although if you can prove that there was no sign, you may win your case.
 
" I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A LAW AGAINST THAT." Why it won't work: Ignorance is no excuse, once you're an adult.
 
"I HAD NO CHOICE." (Frequently cited as a reason for illegally parking a car.) Why it won't work: You did have a choice.
 
"I FORGOT." Why it won't work: The lamest excuse of all.

Tax Free Doesn't Mean Risk Free

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
MILLIONS of mutual fund investors are buying municipal bond funds for the tax-free income, which looks better and better as tax rates keep creeping higher.
But the tax break is not a measure of safety, and the risks in muni bond funds have come sharply into focus in 1994. While muni shares keep throwing off income, they lost 6.2 percent of their value in the first quarter, more than any other type of bond fund. 
 All bond funds suffered from rising interest rates, but munis were especially hard hit. Some think that may have been caused by muni fund managers dumping bonds to prepare for redemptions, which have so far been mild.
While $257 billion was stashed in muni funds in 1993, there were only small net outflows the last two months, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.
The losses have brought home what has always been the question confronting muni investors: "Should you accept a smaller yield and leave your principal intact, or go for a higher yield and accept the risk to your principal?" said Anthony J. Ogorek, an investment adviser in Buffalo.
To illustrate, Mr. Ogorek gives the example of a client with $116,000 worth of muni bond fund shares, in addition to regular munis and equities, who needed the monthly income but was concerned about rising interest rates.
Last year, her muni funds were split between Vanguard Intermediate-Term Municipal Bond Fund ($69,000), which yielded 4.82 percent, and the Vanguard New York Insured Tax-Free Fund ($47,000), which yielded 5.07 percent. The mix produced an annual tax-free income of $5,709, or $476 a month.
That mix worked well in 1993. Because of falling interest rates that created capital appreciation for bondholders, the Intermediate-Term fund returned 11.49 percent, and the New York Insured fund gained 13.01 percent.
But that has changed in 1994, as the Federal Reserve has bumped up short-term interest rates. As a result, Mr. Ogorek's client saw the value of her investments fall. The share price of the Intermediate-Term fund dropped more than 4 percent in the first quarter, to $12.92. The share price of the New York Insured fund lost more than 7 percent, to $10.36.
One solution in this situation is to shorten the maturities of muni bond funds. The longer the time until a bond matures, the more sharply it reacts to interest-rate changes.
The most accurate way to measure this reaction is against a bond's "duration," which takes into account its term, its coupon and other factors that affect its response to rate shifts. The formula is simple: bonds lose the same percentage of value as their duration for every percentage-point rise in rates.
For instance, Vanguard's Long-Term New York Muni Bond Fund has a duration of 7.4 years plus a yield of 5.07 percent. If interest rates rose one percentage point, investors would see the share price fall 7.4 percent, more than offsetting the 5.07 percent yield.
By contrast, Vanguard's Short-Term New York Muni Bond Fund has a duration of only 1.2 years and yields 3.15 percent. Should interest rates rise one percentage point, investors would see the share price fall 1.2 percent, but would still make money because of the 3.15 percent yield.
Because his client was skittish about possibly losing even more money, Mr. Ogorek revised her portfolio on March 17. He kept the Intermediate-Term fund, yielding 4.82 percent with a duration of 5.1 years. But he sold the New York Insured fund, investing $27,000 of the proceeds in Vanguard's Short-Term New York Muni Fund, yielding 3.15 percent, and $20,000 in the Lindner Dividend Fund, an income fund. Lindner owns high-dividend stocks and yields 6.38 percent.
The result: annual income thrown off by the Intermediate-Term fund ($3,326), the Short-Term fund ($851) and the Lindner fund ($1,276) totals $5,453, or $454 a month. This reduces her monthly income by $22, or $46 if taxes on the national muni and Lindner funds are taken into account, assuming a Federal rate of 15 percent plus a New York rate of 5 percent. But restructuring makes the portfolio much less vulnerable to inflation.
The original portfolio would have lost 5.5 percent of its value so far this year as interest rates rose. Had the revised portfolio been in place since January, it would have dropped 3.1 percent in value. The switch so far may have thus cost $552 in lost income ($46 a month multiplied by 12), but it has saved 2.4 percent of the portfolio's principal, amounting to $2,784, Mr. Ogorek figured.
Another alternative, Mr. Ogorek said, would be an all-muni strategy, using Vanguard's Municipal Limited-Term Fund instead of Lindner. However, this option would provide $24 less income monthly than the Lindner option, or a total of $70 a month less than Mr. Ogorek's client would have had if the portifolio had not been revised at all. More important, more principal is lost, $3,712 versus $3,596.
Making such moves today would not put a permanent dent in your income stream if interest rates level off. Once that happens, you can bolster yields by moving money into the longer-term muni funds again and possibly pick up capital gains as interest rates decline, Mr. Ogorek said.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
How a Ruling on Abortion Took On a Life of Its Own

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SUPREME Court Justices can usually time their own departures, as Justice Harry A. Blackmun did with grace and good humor last week. "I know what the numbers are, and it's time," the 85-year-old Justice said in announcing his decision to leave the Court this summer after 24 years.
But Justices have no such control over their legacy, and as Justice Blackmun has long acknowledged, he will always be known by one of the earliest Supreme Court opinions to bear his signature: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to abortion. With passion and pride, he embraced and defended his handiwork as it came under sustained attack from all sides: from abortion opponents, obviously, but also from critics who, while supporting rights as a matter of policy, viewed the opinion as an example of judicial overreaching, weak in its constitutional theory and mired in detail about the stages of pregnancy and other matters best left to legislatures. 
 In the end, Roe v. Wade took on a life of its own, evolving into something so in tune with the ideals of the American mainstream that even conservative Republican Justices, who almost surely would not have joined the original Roe v. Wade majority, would not repudiate it.
Harry Blackmun alone could not have preserved Roe v. Wade. As the decision's margin of support dwindled -- from the original 7-to-2 to 6-to-3 and then to 5-to-4 -- on a Court reshaped by two Presidents who vowed to see the precedent wiped off the books, the likelihood that Roe v. Wade would outlast its author appeared remote. Of the seven members of the majority in 1973, only Justice Blackmun remained by 1991. All the others had been replaced by Republican Presidents. The momentum against the decision seemed unstoppable.
And yet Justice Blackmun is retiring and Roe v. Wade is still the law. More precisely, it is still the law as somewhat redefined at the margins by a trio of Republican Justices whose suprising opinion two years ago in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed what they called the "central principle" and "essential holding" of Roe v. Wade: "the woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability."
While the 1992 decision left unresolved questions, that basic premise appears to be settled. Harry Blackmun will leave the Court with his legacy secure. How, against all the apparent odds, did Roe v. Wade survive?
One answer may be that there are two Roe v. Wades, the one he announced for the Court in 1973 and the one that it became, occupying a special place in the social fabric beyond the expectations of those who received it, with relief, anger or disdain, 21 years ago.
A comment from Justice Blackmun himself at the White House news conference announcing his retirement underscored, almost certainly inadvertently, the full dimension of the opinion's evolution. Asked to explain the decision's continuing importance, he said: "I think it's a step that had to be taken as we go down the road toward the full emancipation of women."
Yet in the 53 pages of the original opinion, there is scarcely a passage that could be distilled into a rallying cry for the emancipation of women. Unwanted motherhood "may force upon the woman a distressful life and future," the opinion stated. "Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care." The "continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved."
The premise of the opinion was that unwanted pregnancy presents women with potential medical and social problems that "the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation" when deciding how to proceed. The point of view, reflecting Justice Blackmun's sympathy for the medical profession developed during a decade as general counsel to the Mayo Clinic, was that of a doctor seeking the ability to exercise informed medical judgment about a patient's problem without government intrusion.
 
The Justice From Mayo
 "Harry Blackmun was speaking as the Justice from Mayo," said David J. Garrow, the historian and author of a new book on the roots of Roe v. Wade, "Liberty & Sexuality" (Macmillan). "What Roe meant has changed over the years and we have to understand that Blackmun's understanding of Roe has changed as well. He began speaking for women and not for doctors."
This sentence -- "The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives" -- is not from Roe v. Wade. It is from the plurality opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey written jointly by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter. Given that the Casey opinion provides the current definition of Roe v. Wade, the sentence marks the place on the American landscape to which the original opinion has migrated. Roe v. Wade survived, perhaps, by transcending itself.
Those who oppose the right to abortion and who regard Roe v. Wade as an exercise in illegitimate judicial power tend to explain its survival in terms of politics.
"The single biggest reason that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land today is the November 1986 Senate election," said Clarke Forsythe, vice president and general counsel of Americans United for Life, a leading advocacy group. In that election, Democrats recaptured the Senate, which they had lost in the Reagan landslide of 1980, and made it possible to defeat the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H. Bork in 1987. Had Judge Bork been on the Court five years later instead of Anthony M. Kennedy, President Reagan's eventual choice for the vacancy, the 5-to-4 vote in the Casey decision would almost surely have been to overturn Roe v. Wade rather than preserve it.
But the defeat of Judge Bork could, at most, have bought only a few years for the pro-choice side had the public disliked Roe v. Wade enough to make its reversal a priority at the polls. Six months after the Casey decision, Bill Clinton was elected President, and barely six months after that, with his choice of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to succeed Justice Byron R. White, the margin of support for the right to abortion grew to 6-to-3.
"In the end, the power of courts is the power of persuasion," said Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor who is now an assistant attorney general. "Their opinions are only successful if they are consistent with the deepest movements in society."
Mr. Dellinger, a strong advocate of abortion rights, continued: "Roe v. Wade is like an old Dick Tracy cartoon -- it's shot full of holes but it's still standing. Blackmun had the instinct for the right result. It was picked apart by law professors, but it turns out that the reasoning of Roe appeared much more thin and brittle at the time than it does now. The more that women came to be seen as full moral agents, with rights against intrusion from the state, the more it has seemed to tap into a deep anti-totalitarian principle that's embedded in our notion of liberty.
"That's where we've come since 1973," he said.

HEADLINE: Efficiency, Not Ego, Gives Edge to a Design Firm

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
AT first, M. Arthur Gensler Jr. ran into a wall with his company's plans to transform a 600,000-square-foot Bank of America data center here into attractive office space four years ago.
The plans were rejected by Dan Costello, head of corporate real estate for the bank in San Francisco, who called them "grandiloquent," and said he wanted a no-frills, quality design. He set the cost at $35 million, or $60 a square foot, for the entire job, including furniture and telecommunications equipment, which he acknowledged was "an extremely tight budget." 
 The task facing Gensler & Associates Architects, the country's biggest interior design firm, was indeed daunting: The bank's 40-year-old, precast concrete building was dark and mundane. But Mr. Gensler's designers found a way. They punched a triangular hole in the center of the seven-story structure and added an atrium to bring in natural light. They saved money on electrical wiring and computer cables, while also breaking up the floor space, by running new lines through a network of four-foot-high walls. And they used recycled or existing furniture and materials wherever possible.
Mr. Gensler's designers "swallowed their egos and brought the project in on budget," Mr. Costello said. "And they gave me what I wanted." Mr. Costello has since given Gensler five more renovation jobs.
At a time when more companies are rethinking the amount of office space they need -- part of a corporate downsizing trend that has hammered the commercial building and real estate markets, along with many architectural and interior design companies -- Gensler has continued to grow.
One reason, industry experts say, is that in a profession dominated by a few superstars and many large egos, Gensler has made its clients' business needs the top priority. And toward that end, Gensler has become a leader in helping companies develop smaller, more efficient space outfitted with the latest office technology, either because the clients are still downsizing or are looking for new quarters as the economy improves.
Gensler's annual billings rose by 6 percent, to $80 million, in 1993, a year in which it opened six new offices in the United States and added 85 employees. The firm has 640 designers, architects and support staff members at 14 offices in the United States and abroad. By contrast, revenues as a whole for the 200 biggest interior design firms in the country have dropped by 10 percent since 1991, to $600 million, while employment has fallen by 19 percent, to about 5,500 people, according to Interior Design magazine.
In the 29 years since Gensler & Associates was founded here, its architects have designed more than 100 buildings, but the firm has gained its renown through interior design, which makes up 70 percent of its business. It has topped Interior Design's list of the biggest firms, measured by fees and volume of work, for 13 of the last 14 years. And in the magazine's annual readers' poll, Gensler has been ranked by its peers as the most respected design firm for all 14 years.
"Most design firms these days are struggling to hold their own," Stanley Abercrombie, chief editor of Interior Design, said. "Gensler's New York office is so busy they had to put drafting tables in what were once conference rooms. They just have a great ability to attract clients."
"A common failing in architecture firms is that they want to build the grand museum and get awards for themselves," he added. "Gensler wants to please the client and figure out what the client needs to run his business."
Still, Mr. Gensler, 58, acknowledged that his firm was feeling the pinch of the industry's changing environment. Profits, while still strong, have been flat for two years. There have been layoffs in some offices where work has slowed, though the number of employees has risen over all. And the firm's bread-and-butter business -- headquarters and new executive office design projects for big companies -- has dwindled.
Mr. Gensler has responded by leveraging his firm's size and talent to forge client relationships in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and other Pacific Rim countries where recessionary woes have not halted large construction projects. He is also building on prior assignments from Disney, Paramount, Columbia Pictures and others to prospect for work in the entertainment field. The firm is working with Sony and Loews Theatre Management on an entertainment complex near Lincoln Center in New York City.
But much of the firm's new business comes from preparing clients for a future in which working from home via computer hookups, known as telecommuting, shared office space and other evolving work arrangements will play much bigger roles.
So, Mr. Gensler has established new services like project management and strategic planning for Taco Bell, McKesson and Bank of America, among others. Gensler, for example, has spent the last year consulting with Taco Bell as the restaurant chain tries to decide whether to build a new headquarters building or renovate its existing one in Irvine, Calif.
"Technology is changing the way people work," Mr. Gensler said. "With electronic mail, the Internet, teleconferencing, people are starting to ask, 'What is a headquarters or office environment?' "
BOTH customers and colleagues say it is Mr. Gensler, the firm's affable, Brooklyn-born chairman, who etched the philosophy that continues to drive the company's success. In a field once characterized by one- or two-person shops that gathered what architects viewed as the scraps of a building project, Mr. Gensler adroitly changed the rules and tapped into what has become a profitable vein in interior design.
A graduate of Cornell University's architecture program, Mr. Gensler is recognized more for his management skills and salesmanship than for hands-on design talent.
"Art is garrulous and friendly, but a very sharp-eyed, clear-headed manager," said Martin Manley, a former consultant for McKinsey and client of Gensler who is an Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Clinton Administration. "He has single-handedly defined the business of interior design in the United States. He brought professionalism and the notion of client service to this business that simply wasn't there before."
Mr. Gensler, a voracious reader, has a penchant for seeing trends and getting ahead of them. "In the design world, he has the clearest sense of where the changes are coming from and what the challenges will be," William G. McMinn, dean of Cornell's College of Architecture, said. "He's kept a broader relationship with the business world than most architects do."
From the outset of his career, in a walkup office above a Greek restaurant here, Mr. Gensler saw the need for a geographically dispersed, client-driven firm that would forgo the ego-driven star system to create strong, functional work space for customers.
Gensler serves more than 7,200 clients, 85 percent of whom come back for repeat business, including 36 of the nation's 100 largest public companies, 8 of the top 10 commercial banks and 13 of the world's 25 largest investment securities firms. Gensler has received nearly 300 awards for its designs, including projects like the headquarters of Goldman, Sachs in London, the corporate interiors of Apple Computer in Cupertino, Calif., and the airport terminals in Las Vegas, Detroit and San Francisco.
Gensler's size and geographic diversity are usually anathema to designers, who tend to crave individualism and build their identities in small shops. "It's no easy thing to maintain common standards and identity across such a large organization, but Art has done that," Mr. Manley said.
YET a culture without stars can be a double-edged sword. Some people with the firm said they believed Gensler had pushed so far away from the star system that it had lost some of its edge in innovative design. Gensler has lost several prospective projects to more design-oriented competition. Mr. Gensler acknowledged that the firm had missed out on some work because customers wanted to be associated with someone with a recognized name.
Gensler's superstar designer, Orlando Diaz-Azcuy, left the firm six years ago to concentrate on residential and furniture design, and Mr. Gensler admitted that his departure had left a void.
"People said, 'I want Orlando,' " Mr. Gensler said. "But the thing that is hard for clients to understand is that projects are now so complicated, no one person can do it all."
One of the first design firms to utilize computer technology, Gensler relies on communications networks and computers to operate as a "one-firm firm," despite having 14 offices. "It was a radical concept to open so many offices, but technology lets us tie the whole firm together," Mr. Gensler said.
Early on, he tapped creative young people like Margo Grant Harris, a designer at a rival firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who signed a one-year contract with Gensler 21 years ago and has never left. She now runs Gensler's New York office, which has 160 employees and is the largest of the firm's offices. Mr. Gensler heard Ed Friedrichs give an impressive design presentation to the board of selectmen in Tiburon, Calif., in 1969 and recruited him at a local bar. Mr. Friedrichs, now a partner, runs the Los Angeles office, which has 126 employees.
Mr. Gensler said his secret to attracting talent is that he has enough self confidence to hire people smarter than him. "I get as much joy out of seeing one of the people I've picked do extremely well as I do seeing a building I've done," he said.
Ms. Grant Harris added, "He always sees the positive, not the negative. He gives you a lot of rope -- not to hang yourself, but so that you'll be more resilient."
 
 
 
TO BUILD, OR NOT TO BUILD? COMPUTING AN ANSWER
 THE lease on Taco Bell's corporate headquarters in Irvine, Calif., does not expire until November 1996. But at the urging of Taco Bell's architectural and interior design firm, Gensler & Associates, the $3 billion fast-food subsidiary of Pepsico Inc. began planning its headquarters of the future a year ago.
The critical question: Should Taco Bell construct a new building or extend its lease and renovate its existing space? The plans have yet to include a single blueprint or color swatch. Instead, Gensler, which designed Taco Bell's current headquarters in 1985, has turned the project into something akin to a business school case study, one that revolves around the changing nature of the workplace.
Gensler has looked into organizational design, outsourcing, which groups need to be in the same building and whether the headquarters should be a single structure or be split into regional sites.
Gensler is providing traditional cost analysis and regulatory-impact studies. But the firm has gone a step further, offering Taco Bell a variety of presentations on how office space will be affected by new approaches to work like "telecommuting" and the use of cross-functional teams, which get involved in different disciplines in a company.
One of the first design firms to embrace computers, Gensler has used sophisticated software to create three-dimensional computer images of what a new Taco Bell headquarters building might look like on a dozen potential sites.
"Most architects simply don't have the capability to talk to our business and planning people," Rudy Pollak, vice president of administration and employee services for Taco Bell, said. "A lot of architects try, but I don't believe anyone else out there is doing this."

HEADLINE: Teachers to the (Child) Stars

BYLINE: By By Mimi Avins 

DATELINE: Los Angeles

 BODY:
There are two teachers and three students inside a three-room house trailer parked in the shadow of Dopey Drive at the Disney Studios in Burbank, Calif. -- hardly an educational quorum, under normal circumstances. The situation, however, is decidedly out of the ordinary, because the pupils in the well-appointed mobile home classroom are the juvenile stars of the popular television comdey series "Home Improvement."
 "Do we have to do school now?" whines Zachery Ty Bryan, 12 years old, who portrays Brad, the eldest son. "I don't want to do these stupid lessons." Steve Elster ignores Zachery's lament and plunges into a lecture on how amino acids contribute to hereditary cell defects. As a studio teacher, Mr. Elster is one of a cadre of professional hybrids on whom children like Zachery depend. In order to do their jobs well, Mr. Elster and his co-teacher, Daphne Boelsma, must be by turns tutors, friends, therapists, protectors and surrogate parents for their young charges.
While California minors toil making commercials, acting in television shows or movies, those who haven't graduated from high school must go to school three hours a day, 15 hours a week. Although all states require a minimum number of hours of instruction for children working in the entertainment industry, only California law specified that even when a child's educational needs have been met, a state-certified studio teacher must be present on the set, serving as guardian of his or her health and safety, even during summer vacations.
 With children so prevalent in movies and television the last few years, studio teachers have not been faced with the intermittent unemployment that plagued them in the past. Hired by production companies from a roster maintained by the teachers' union, they earn more than public school employees when they do work -- though considerably less than their students do.
 Children who work have to be registered in accredited school, and the curriculum covered by their studio teacher is determined by their school of record. Students with continuing jobs, such as roles on television series, sometimes don't actually visit the schools at which they are nominally enrolled; they are often in independent study programs, which were developed for pregnant students trying to keep up with their lessons while out of school.
 
Rare Visits to 'Regular School'
 Zachery, a sixth grader, and his two television brothers call their home schools "regular school," an apt term since studio schooling is predictably irregular. Some children study with a studio teacher only a few days a year while appearing in commercials, while others spend several months making a movie or miniseries. And since many situation comedies schedule a break one week each month, the youngsters in their casts can return to their home schools periodically.
 Jonathan Taylor Thomas, 12, a sixth grader who plays Randy, the middle son in 'Home Improvement," says: "A lot of kids at my regular school don't understand. They go, 'Oh, you're so lucky. You don't have to go to school.' It's not like that. We do the same exact work that the public schools do, but sometimes it's more difficult because we have to do it in a shorter amount of time."
 Studio teachers maintain contact with their students' home-school teachers, getting copies of texts used and tests given. In many cases, they fax or mail work done on the set to the classroom teacher. For a junior high or high school student, they will keep track of work assigned by as many as six different teachers.
 The goal of most studio teachers is to keep students academically up to grade level and personally down to earth. Mr. Elster's dry sense of humor surfaces when his pubescent scholars sound inappropriately mature. "I like being on this show because I know I have a steady job," 12-year-old Jonathan tells a visitor. "Right," Mr. Elster adds. "He has the ex-wives, the alimony, the mortgage to worry about."
 How well studio schooling works depends on how important education is to the parents involved. Parents who value learning communicate that ethic to their children, who work hard in school even while they're busy acting. Conversely, the unmotivated student typically comes from a family more interested in a child's earning potential than in his acquisition of knowledge.
 Arlene Singer-Gross has been a studio teacher for 15 years, 8 of them on the long-running comedy "Who's the Boss?" "I've worked with parents whose priority was, 'How come my child didn't get a close-up and the other child did?' rather than 'Can she read?"' said Ms. Singer-Gross.
 She briefly taught a 16-year-old whose parents considered education a necessary evil. They were eager for the boy to take his high school proficiency exam so he could work longer hours as an actor. "He had gotten the message," Ms. Singer-Gross said. "It wasn't like he wanted to do homework; he wanted to do his publicity photos. I felt in that situation, my job was to teach him life skills. I taught him how to write a check, how to balance a checkbook."
 By law, California studio teachers may work with a maximum of 10 students, but the student-teacher ratio is usually one or two to one. As in Ms. Singer-Gross's experience, opportunities to tailor programs to a student's needs are abundant. "I can take a child in the seventh grade and have him reading Shakespeare, if he's that advanced," she says. "Or if a child is having a hard time with the multiplication tables, I can work on that for three days, design an approach just for him, or turn the math lesson into a game."
 Actors and actresses are the beneficiaries of the societal assumption that because a person is attractive and personable, he or she is bright. "I've taught some wonderful, sweet kids who were great when it was time for them to do their scenes, but they were struggling in school," says Laura Gary, a studio teacher who went on location when the movie "Free Willy" was filmed, and is currently working on "Full House," one of the television comedies that started the trend to family shows with young cast members. She enjoys being able to explain and drill until a subject is mastered, without worrying about boring the faster learners that inhabit a large, heterogeneous classroom.
 Zachery of "Home Improvement" says, "You get a lot more accomplished on the set because it's one on one with the teacher, not one on thirty. The teacher doesn't have to wonder about me not understanding something, because if I don't I'll just tell her. If I get it right away, we can just go on to the next thing."
 Studio teachers are as aware of a student's moods as his academic strengths and weaknesses. Although one of the professional child's survival skills is adaptability, the actor who goes directly from performing a very emotional scene to grappling with geometric proofs might not have an easy time making the switch. "When they come into the schoolroom from the set, I try to give them a cooling-off period," Ms. Singer-Gross says. "I might encourage them to talk about the experience they went through and how they internalized it, or instead of doing math, which takes more concentration, I give them an assignment to read for a while, so they can calm themselves down."
 When she isn't making a movie like "The Addams Family" or its sequel, 14-year-old Christina Ricci attends a suburban public school in New Jersey. For the four months she will work on the upcoming film "Casper" (about the friendly ghost), school is a one-room trailer that she has adorned with a Red Hot Chili Peppers poster, berthed on the Universal Studios lot. Although there are desks in the trailer, Christina can lie on the floor, pop a tape into her cassette player and drink a soda while she completes her assignments. "Here I call my teacher Rhona," she said. "In regular school, it would be Ms. Gordon." That reflects the rapport and trust that frequently, and rewardingly, develop between student and studio teacher.
 Like the private tutors once engaged for children of privileged class, studio teachers, by virtue of the intimacy and variety of situations they share with their students, inevitably impart more than the basics. When a teacher and student eat dinner together on location, a number of teachers say they can't help but notice a child's table manners and would be inclined to correct them if the need were obvious.
 Everyone expects that addition, subtraction and the causes of the Civil War will be covered in school. But questions of values that may not arise in regular classrooms are inescapable in an environment that is part school, part glamorous workplace.
 "There is no other business that tolerates the kind of behavior you see in this one -- spoiled, demanding behavior," Ms. Gordon says. "It happens with adults, teen-agers and young children. I've worked with children who were supporting their families and the balance of power was off. It got to be, like, who's running the store here? The kid was used to controlling everybody, and I felt it was up to me to teach him to treat adults with respect, because no one else had done it."
 But while it is inevitable for studio teachers to take on a variety of roles in their students' lives, including buddy and confidant, often what a young person really wants in a friend is someone the same age with the same interests, fears and curiosities.
 Lecy Goranson portrayed the eldest daughter on the top-rated television show "Roseanne" from age 13 to 18, and during that time, she said, she craved friends in her own age group. Ms. Goranson attended Vassar her freshman year, and at 19 is currently taking night classes at the University of California at Los Angeles. "When I went to college," she said, "I was better prepared in some ways than my peers, because I was always around adults on 'Roseanne,' and that was a very advanced learning experience."
 "But I think I missed out being isolated," she continued. "Even though my TV sister, Sara Gilbert, is really smart, there were still just the two of us in a little room. There was no recess, no walking from one class to the next where you would see other kids. You don't learn just from books or from your teacher. You learn from other students, too, from hearing what they have to say. When I think about having sat in the same room for hours and hours every day for five years -- the closest parallel I can draw is a prison."
 The 7-year-old stars of "Full House," Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, "do school" in a blue-carpeted second floor schoolroom inside a Burbank sound stage that is windowless, but hardly prison-like. The saucer-eyed twins (identical except for temporarily differing patters of baby tooth loss) sit on the flowered cushion of a white wicker loveseat taking turns ready a picture book, "Josefina Finds the Prince," aloud with their teacher, Ms. Gary. A rehearsal for "Full House" is going on directly below, on the permanent set for Uncle Jesse's attic apartment.
 
Growing Up on 'Full House'
 The twins have shared the pivotal role of Michelle since they were nine months old. They have thus virtually grown up on "Full House," and their parents, acting coach and teachers have made special efforts to infuse the twins' lives with elements of normalcy, including ballet classes for Ashley and riding lessons for her sister. The show films on a four-day workweek, so the girls attend separate second-grade classes at a private school on Mondays and every fourth week, when the show is on hiatus. To eace the transition between the two school settings, Ms. Gary has deliverately made herself less available in her classroom, prohibiting questions from her two students in the middle of a test, for example.
 The attempt to foster autonomy makes sense, but it seems to be an uphill battle. When Ms. Gary previews a nutrition test that will have to be completed and sent to their school ("Which picture shows a balanced meal?"), the girls, natural cuddlers, get up from their Lilliputian desks and each cling to one of her arms as they study the material.
 Independence, manners, spelling, a sense of persective about show business and single-cell reproduction -- if children in studio school learn all their lessons, they have the chance to avoid what every child dreads, being different. "I've met kids in this business who have never been around kids their own age and they don't know how to relate to them," Christina Ricci says. "It's weird."

THE COLLECTED WORKS OF HAROLD CLURMAN
Six Decades of Commentary on Theater, Dance, Music, Film, Arts and Letters.
Edited by Marjorie Loggia and Glenn Young.
Illustrated. 1,101 pp. New York:
Applause Books. $49.95. 
 Harold Clurman was no slouch as a director; his more notable achievements include the subtly stylized, emotionally profound 1935 Group Theater production of Clifford Odets's play "Paradise Lost" and the haunting 1950 premiere of "The Member of the Wedding" by Carson McCullers. But he really excelled as a cheerleader for the theater. Among students and friends, his dazzling conversation was legendary. "In a civilized country, Harold would have been employed simply to talk," Arthur Miller once told me, although he went on to admit that he often wondered how actors managed to extract useful information on how to actually play their parts from Clurman's enthralling torrent of words.
Happily, Clurman wrote as fluently as he spoke. As a drama critic for The New Republic from 1949 to 1952 and for The Nation from 1953 to 1980, and as a frequent contributor to The New York Times and many other periodicals, he assessed current productions and analyzed the state of the drama with an encyclopedic knowledge of theatrical history and technique and a warm sympathy for the artists' aims. "The Collected Works of Harold Clurman" reprints fully one-third of his journalism, capturing his sharp intelligence and salty humor. Only the ringing Bronx accent that made his speech so flavorful is missing, and Clurman's generous sprinkling of exclamation points and charmingly idiosyncratic use of quotation marks (usually to highlight words he feels are misunderstood or overused) give a nice intimation of his verbal style.
What is most striking in this collection is the coherent set of principles Clurman espoused, a philosophy about what theater is that did not essentially change from the time he founded the Group Theater with Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford in 1931 until his death in 1980. In a previously unpublished 1931 essay that stands as a keynote for the entire book, he declared, "If the theater is an art, if it has any value beyond that of decorating the emptiness of our existence, it . . . must say something, it too must create from the chaos which is the common experience of its members an expression that will have, like that of the individual artist, an identity and a significance." If only all critics were so forthright about their basic beliefs.
Clurman was not a snob in his reviews -- he loved a good variety show and raved over the 1960 "Ice Ca pades" -- but theater as entertainment engaged him only marginally. He was primarily interested in a playwright's ideas and how well a production conveyed them. His brilliantly argued essays on the 1947 premiere of "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Peter Brook's 1964 version of "King Lear" voiced hearty appreciation for their superb direction and acting but strongly criticized the overall interpretations as false to the authors' intentions. You need not agree with Clurman's opinions to appreciate his valuable dissent from the "glowing enthusiasm disassociated from any specific meaning" that was his bete noire as a critic and theatergoer.
Despite a generally good-humored tone, Clurman could be devastating. Of Ingrid Bergman in "Joan of Lorraine" he remarked, "She is sincere, she is unspoiled, she is devoted and loyal -- and if we had a real theater she might soon learn to act." "Sleuth," he informed his readers, "is written with a certain literary coquetry which the innocent mistake for style." On the whole sympathetic to the 1960's avant-garde experiments, he deemed the Living Theater to be "more concerned with 'living' than with theater." He preferred a "travesty" like Joseph Papp's 1968 production of "Hamlet" to Richard Burton's "no 'Hamlet' at all" in 1964; in fact he was so aggravated by embalmed productions of Shakespeare exhibiting unthinking reverence rather than a point of view about the material that at one point he cried, "No more classics!" But he never seems nasty because, in his words, "I speak only from love -- and the exasperation that goes with it!"
A review can highlight only a few of the treasures in this wonderful but much too long collection. Readers must pick up the book themselves to savor the sensitive, supportive way Clurman followed dramatists throughout their careers, avoiding raves and pans in favor of sustained critical engagement with their work. (See everything he wrote about Eugene O'Neill and his thoughtful assessment of Edward Albee's "All Over," a play most reviewers scorned.) Readers will find his analyses of the economic factors that are killing serious drama as cogent now as when they were first published (some date back as far as the 1930's). They will soon spot his prejudices, about which he was candid: he thought musicals were fluff and had no appreciation for attempts to make them more challenging; he could admire but seldom really liked highly abstract work. Above all, they will feel his love for the theater, his conviction that it is the most exciting and deeply human of all art forms.
CLURMAN'S genius has not been properly supported here by his editors. At a minimum, Marjorie Loggia, a former television writer and producer, and Glenn Young, the publisher of Applause Books, should have provided a brief biography outlining Clurman's educational and personal background, his work with such organizations as the Group Theater and the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, and a list of the plays he directed. (This could have profitably replaced their gushing foreword.) Instead, readers must glean virtually all biographical information from references in Clurman's own writings.
Slipshod organization and production also mar the book. Given the chronological approach -- the text is divided into sections titled "The Thirties," "The Forties" and so forth -- why place 1920's material, 1930's reviews from The Daily Worker and unpublished papers from all decades in appendixes? Surely it would not have required too much more type to append to each article the full name of the publication in which it appeared, rather than cryptic abbreviations the reader can identify only by flipping to a list at the very beginning of the book. The index is maddeningly incomplete and contains at least a few incorrect page numbers. Typographical errors include such howlers as the misspelling of a well-known evangelist's name as "Father Devine" rather than Divine.
An even more serious flaw is the editors' failure to be selective. The material on music, painting, film and dance here is enjoyable but peripheral. In addition, as the foreword notes, "there are many nearly verbatim reiterations of Clurman's fundamental tenets," reiterations he himself cut from collections that appeared during his lifetime. Clurman understood that books and journalism serve different purposes. Over years restatements of long-held opinions make perfect sense in a magazine or newspaper; they are unnecessary in a single volume that will probably be read in a few weeks.
By allowing repetitive material to swell the book's bulk to a point where it cannot easily be carried for long, the editors insure that their volume will reside primarily in libraries and other institutions. They do a disservice to the finest drama critic America has yet produced, an appealing and lovable man whose vision inspired generations of theater lovers and theater artists, and whose words deserve the widest possible readership.
 
 
 
THEATER FOR THE FUN OF IT
 We suffer nowadays [October 1948] from an inability to play. . . . A show is not a festivity to which we have been invited; it is a challenge. We doubt the host's honesty. Our wits are alerted; we are ready to administer due punishment if our demands are not met. This is our brand of the critical spirit. We are ready to forgo it if we are sure the host has no serious intentions -- if he merely proposes to knock us out with fireworks or narcotics. But let the party be of a quieter nature, where we may retain a modicum of our normal selves, and the relation between host and guest must be stated in terms of combat. . . .
If it is not to be just fun -- in the manner of a binge -- we demand that our entertainment be worthwhile, "pay off." . . . There is something sound in the instinct that prompts this attitude, but the results are nevertheless meager; they bring no joy. What we overlook is that life itself has no utilitarian value, that everything we hold dear has no end beyond itself. . . . In art what appears simplest and least demonstrably good is often the most enduring. . . . Does a flower, a bird, a river have to "prove" itself? There is in the ability to play something of that same sense of acceptance with which all men in a state of health face the world.
I say all this because during the past month I have noticed that my pleasures at the theater . . . have come from modest efforts which because of the topsy-turvydom of commerce are often represented to the public as special and abstruse.

HEADLINE: Health Alliances Could Get Very Expensive

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Health care alliances (editorial, March 27) must be approached with care if they are not to degenerate into debacles like the New Jersey Joint Underwriting Association for automobile insurance. The Joint Underwriting Association ran up a deficit of billions by trying to insure high-risk drivers at low-risk rates. You state: 
 "Purchasing cooperatives are the best way to make sure that the chronically ill, employees of small firms and the unemployed are able to enroll in the same high-quality health plans, at the same prices, as employees of Fortune 500 companies."
The chronically ill are a high-risk group for health care. The unemployed may be high risk because they may be unable to get a job for health reasons. The employees of small companies may or may not be high risk as a group. All three groups, because of lack of cohesiveness, will have higher unit expenses. It is unlikely they can be covered under Fortune 500 plans at Fortune 500 prices.
How much more will they cost, and who will pay? As in the Joint Underwriting Association, costs are likely to be underestimated at first for many, maybe most, health alliances. As a result some alliances would soon be bankrupt or force health plans to accept risks at inadequate rates, thus driving some plans into bankruptcy. You suggest health alliances will be able to take money from plans not in trouble and transfer it to plans in financial difficulties. If not enough money comes into the system, such an approach merely changes the order in which plans become bankrupt.
Any legislation setting up health alliances must make sure that every alliance will be financially viable, not just in the short term, but forever. This means they must have the power and the will to raise rates when necessary. That may not be politically feasible.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA SHOWS SIGNS OF RECOVERY AS JOBS INCREASE

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 8

 BODY:
After nearly four years of recession, and well behind the rest of the nation, the economic and political powerhouse that is California is finally showing signs of recovery.
Since January, California has added 29,000 jobs, a three-month spike in employment after a long, painful decline. That increase is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of aerospace jobs that disappeared in the 1990's, but it nevertheless has economists here trumpeting better things to come. 
 The national recovery is the main engine behind the California turnaround, which economists say is fragile and could be choked off by rising interest rates.
The recovery here came sooner than expected, by one fiscal quarter, because of the Jan. 17 earthquake, which brought a boom in construction jobs and an infusion of Federal aid to Los Angeles, where the sting of recession has been sharpest and where the most jobs have been lost.
Leading the way in optimistic predictions is the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles, which offered the gloomiest, and most accurate, assessments early in the recession when others were reluctant to see the tarnish on the Golden State.
U.C.L.A.'s latest quarterly report last month was practically giddy. "By the time you read this California will be in recovery!" the report announced. "After almost four years in the Dumpster, the California economy is beginning to show signs of life, particularly in the job market."
Even the doubters are only quarreling around the margins. "There's some question whether the word 'recovery' is the appropriate word to use," said Joseph A. Wahed, the chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "I would rather use the word 'improvement.' "
California had a net gain of 7,300 payroll jobs in January, 15,900 in February and 5,800 in March, the first consecutive gains since hard times began here in 1990. That is a pittance compared with the 600,000 to 800,000 jobs lost during the long recession, and most of it comes in low-paying service and construction jobs.
Still, the new jobs have pushed the unemployment rate down to 8.6 percent in March, with U.C.L.A. predicting that it will dip an additional point by 1996, an improvement from recent years in which the rate occasionally moved above 10 percent.
Among the new workers are Francesco Canales, Luis Menjabar and Miguel Hernandez, who have helped swell the payroll at Ed Sylvis Construction in nearby Pasadena to 20 from 12. Rather than washing cars, delivering newspapers or searching for work, the three men are now paid $6 an hour to bolt house frames to their foundations for homeowners worried about the next earthquake.
Economists at U.C.L.A. and elsewhere also cite indicators beside job growth to prove their case:
*Sales of existing homes, which have risen for eight consecutive months, are up more than 30 percent. Last April, these homes were selling at an rate of 380,000 a year; in January they were selling at a rate of 520,000 a year. Most of the activity has been in the lower price range, but in recent weeks there have been reports from real estate brokers in the Los Angeles basin that buyers are again at least poking around in the million-dollar market.
*The home building industry, which hit bottom in June when the rate of housing starts was 80,000 a year, brightened as the rate edged up to 90,000 in January. Again, this is a far cry from the boom years of the late 1980's, when a quarter of a million homes went up in California each year. But the major builders are optimistic, reporting that their unsold inventory is finally selling without discounts or other concessions. And financial planners are urging bold clients to invest in home building companies.
*Business failures as tracked by Dun & Bradstreet have fallen more than 20 percent, compared with a year ago. And help-wanted advertising is on the rise, according to the prognosticators at Salomon Brothers, who urged clients in a January report to buy stocks of companies in the state because "California is turning."
That Salomon Brothers report was prepared before the earthquake and things have further improved since then, with $9.5 billion in Federal aid and at least $4 billion in insurance reimbursement flowing to this hard- hit region. "It's like a Marshall Plan for Southern California," said Don L. Gevirtz, chairman of the Foothill Group, a financial services company here.
 
Political Beneficiaries
 The turnaround is widely regarded as a boon to both Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican in the midst of an uphill re-election campaign, and President Clinton, a Democrat who has courted California and its trove of electoral votes with frequent trips to the state and a speedy infusion of Federal earthquake relief.
"Their fortunes are ironically linked," said Merv Field, director of the Field Poll, a California polling concern. "Both of them are dependent on an improved California economy -- Wilson totally dependent and Clinton largely dependent."
The President scores points with some economists here for the size of the Federal aid package and the speed with which the money reached the state. Adrian Sanchez, at First Interstate Bank here, said he had wrongly predicted a few "down months" after the quake. Instead, in contrast to the situation after the 1992 hurricane in Florida, the money flowed immediately from Washington, stimulating construction and retail sales.
Another difference is that there were plenty of unemployed workers ready to step in when the earthquake struck. Virtually all the demolition, repair and reconstruction work has been handled by local concerns, Mr. Sanchez said, and the relief money is recirculating in the region rather than flowing out of the state, as it did from Florida.
The most palpable benefit from the earthquake is the boom in construction employment. Of the 29,000 net gain in jobs since January, 6,000 are in construction, including the relatively low-paying, nonunion jobs at small concerns like Ed Sylvis Construction and the higher-paid, union positions at the huge highway rebuilding projects, like the Santa Monica Freeway, which is scheduled to reopen next Tuesday, months ahead of schedule.
At Ed Sylvis, the payroll has grown substantially, but others in addition to the new workers have gained. Existing employees who had seen their hours cut back in the slow months of 1993 are again working full time.
The early completion of the Santa Monica Freeway is largely a result round-the-clock repairs that have yielded an overtime bonanza for workers. Larry J. Kimball, the director of the U.C.L.A. Business Forecasting Project, noted that this extra income will stimulate retail spending here, which has yet to show a significant rise.
But even overtime does not turn these jobs into the equivalent of those lost in the aerospace industry. While the rate of job loss there has slowed somewhat, according to economists at U.C.L.A. and at Salomon Brothers, the nose dive is expected to continue. Northrop, for instance, which recently announced layoffs of 2,000, is expected to eliminate more jobs after its merger with Grumman. And in addition to aerospace cuts, the full impact of military base closings in the state is not expected to be felt until next year.
"You still have drags out there on the economy," said Jack Kyser, the chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County.
The biggest concern at this tentative stage in recovery is the recent rise in interest rates. Other regions have enjoyed a significant increase in construction because their recovery began while mortgage rates were at record lows. But with a later recovery, California may not have that advantage.
"We're not going to get any help from aerospace, so housing is the key," said Ted Gibson, the chief economist at the state Department of Finance. "I'd hate to see home building cut off at the knees by a rise in interest rates. That's the big worry."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Vacuum: U.S. Fears Bureaucrats Will Rule

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 10

 BODY:
To understand the enormous frustration of the Clinton Administration as it waits for a Japanese leader with the clout to deal head on with Tokyo's worsening relations with America, just ask the country's fallen Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, about his dining room table and his television set.
Not long after Mr. Hosokawa took office, he and his wife, Kayoko, were shocked to discover how the Japanese Government expected the leader of the world's second largest industrial economy to live. In the dingy official residence, the dining room came equipped with a dirty carpet, a single, bare fluorescent lamp, and what Mrs. Hosokawa described the other day as "a folding table, the kind you would find in a school cafeteria." The TV set was a flickering, 20-year old dinosaur from the pre-remote control era; whenever Mr. Hosokawa wanted to turn on the talk shows and watch someone attack him, he had to get up and fiddle with the dials. 
 The Prime Minister sought a small budget to fix the place up. "The staff said 'No, no, nothing else is possible,' " Mrs. Hosokowa recalled. "They said that in a few years, we'll be building a new prime minister's residence anyway. Maybe then." The Hosokawas surrendered. They borrowed a table from the Prime Minister's small political party, and bought their own new television.
 
Power Vacuums Likely
 Just as the redecoration was just the first of many projects sabotaged by the bureaucracy and his own allies in the bickering coalition Government, so is his premature resignation a portent of the difficulties to come. The Clinton Administration is facing the prospect of several months if not years of power vacuums and setbacks in Tokyo, in which the people who say no to the prime minister also say no to the President.
Ultimately, the country's leading politicians argue, the momentous transition Japan is going through should change all that. When the political parties are reorganized, when a new election system -- Mr. Hosokawa's one great accomplishment -- empowers urban voters, when the drive toward deregulation gains speed, Washington should finally find some leaders in Tokyo with the mandate to get things done. But getting from here to there, everyone agrees, is going to be a messy, chaotic process.
"There cannot be a strong Government here until there is a new election under the new system, and maybe two or three," Gerald L. Curtis, a Columbia University professor who has studied Japan's Byzantine political system for decades, said today. "Until then, no one will really be in charge. But in the long run, the forces for change seem inexorable."
In the meantime, the Clinton Administration seems reduced to only one real strategy: Sit back and watch. Its early bet, that heightened American pressure on Mr. Hosokawa and his new Government would speed the course of change, has gotten nowhere. Now, there is growing agreement that the strategy needs considerable rethinking: Whatever its frustrations with Mr. Hosokawa, Washington is likely to find that his successor is neither as articulate nor as impassioned in voicing the need for change.
"The reality is that no matter what we say, this is all going to be in the air for a while," one of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers on Japan issues said over the weekend. "We are going to be left talking to the bureaucrats, because no one else is going to have time for us. And you have a pretty good idea how far that is going to get us."
Until his financial scandals exploded in the Parliament, Mr. Hosokawa had a very methodical, extraordinarily ambitious agenda for change laid out for the first half of this year. He talked of changes in building and zoning regulations to make it possible to build bigger houses -- with imported lumber. He had commissions under way to cut through the country's morass of regulations. He talked about short-circuiting a distribution system that manages to double the price of every import.
But the fact of the matter was that he had no political capital left to get any of it done. To pass political reform legislation earlier in the year, he spent every bit of influence he had. Mr. Hosokawa's hope had been that passage of the bill, even in the watered-down fashion that finally became law, would give him momentum. Instead, it sapped his coalition of what little sense of unity it had left.
 
Tax Reform Bungled
 In the ensuing three months, Mr. Hosokawa tried, and failed, to get a tax reform plan through. He bungled the presentation of the plan, and it was quickly torpedoed by the powerful Ministry of Finance -- which refuses to use deficit spending as a tool for spurring the economy -- and by the Socialists, the biggest party in the coalition. An effort to reorganize his Cabinet also died, but not before it transformed some of his one-time allies, including the chief cabinet secretary, Masayoshi Takemura, into sworn enemies.
Mr. Hosokawa's get-tough response to President Clinton in February in Washington, where he said "no" to a demand that Tokyo agree to "numerical indicators" and other targets for American imports, played well back home. But he failed to follow it up with a strategy for solving the trade surplus problem or repairing relations with Japan's chief ally.
Close advisers to the fallen Prime Minister say his helplessness was partly a function of the institution: a Japanese prime minister has almost no political staff to make independent judgments or set a long-term course for the country.
 
Top Politician's Strategy
 "In Japan currently, no system exists that would help the prime minister be the top politician," Shusei Tanaka, who was Mr. Hosokawa's closest aide until earlier this year, said in a recent interview. "In the future, the question is what can we do to create a support system around the prime minister. If you have to make decisions in such an isolated environment, you cannot be a top politician or a reformer."
Among those advocating a far stronger role for the prime minister is Ichiro Ozawa, perhaps the country's most powerful behind-the-scenes politician and the moving force of one of the leading reform parties in the coalition, Shinseito. He is also the figure at the center of the current maneuvering to pick Mr. Hosokawa's successor.
His strategy is clear: The current rag-tag coalition must go, and should be replaced with an ideologically cohesive party, or a smaller collection of parties, that can begin to exercise real power. To accomplish that, he must dump many of the Socialists, whose vision of a minor world role for Japan -- scant military involvement with the United Nations in peacekeeping, continued protectionism in many markets -- has virtually frozen any major policy changes.
But he cannot get rid of them until he has sufficient replacement votes to keep the coalition in power -- and to keep the Liberal Democrats, who governed the country for 38 years, from returning. He will try to do that this week, trying to lure more Liberal Democrats to defect from their party. But if he fails, and that seems likely, there will be little change until an election is held. Most people think that will be nine months away, because the process of redistricting the country under the new election laws has just begun.
In the end, Mr. Tanaka says, "the direction we are seeing is one in which decisions will finally be made by the politicians." Then the American strategy -- to place political pressure on Japan, making it clear to Japanese voters that its demands for more open markets will also bring down prices and increase their choices -- has a chance of working. Until then, though, Washington is pushing on a string, trying to get 1990's-era decisions out of politicians still watching 1970's-vintage television sets.

HEADLINE: Plan Is Announced For Russian Ships

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, April 10

 BODY:
A Congressional delegation and top Russian military officials agreed today to bring old Soviet ships to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to be dismantled.
The shipyard is scheduled to close next year, taking with it about 45,000 jobs in the Philadelphia area. Its unprecedented new use could "provide hundreds if not thousands of jobs here," said Representative Thomas M. Foglietta, a Democrat whose district includes the base. 
 Local lawmakers, announcing the pact after returning from Moscow, said the arrangement would help the 193-year-old navy yard make the transition to the private sector.
The first contract is to be signed 90 days after economic and environmental studies are completed and a private American company is selected to buy the vessels, the lawmakers said. They said toxic materials like asbestos and lead paint would be removed before the ships sail for Philadelphia.
American officials have said the success of any such arrangement would hinge on developing procedures that are environmentally sound and consistent with environmental regulations, and on developing a profitable business plan.
Mr. Foglietta, who made the trip with four House colleagues, could not say exactly how many jobs would be created. At least 155 Russian ships could sail into the port, he said.
Though the plan would be a private-sector venture, lawmakers said it could be partly financed by some of the $1.6 billion in defense conversion funds the United States plans to given the former Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Clinton and Technology: Some Policies Clash

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 10

 BODY:
It would be hard to find a President more enthusiastic about promoting technology than Bill Clinton. Yet in a striking number of cases, the Administration seems to be picking fights with the very companies that want to build its cherished information superhighway.
Even as some Federal agencies funnel billions of dollars in tax breaks and new spending for research on projects from high-resolution video to high-performance computing, others are taking actions that even some Democrats say could weaken the nation's commercial technology prowess. 
 Signs of the internal conflict are almost everywhere. The President and Vice President Al Gore have made several high-profile trips to Silicon Valley and have courted its executives as advisers. At the same time, however, the Justice Department is pursuing an intense antitrust investigation of the Microsoft Corporation, the biggest software company.
 Even as Vice President Gore has promoted his broad vision of high-speed computer networks, the Federal Communications Commission has forced the cable television industry to swallow $2 billion in rate reductions. That decision helped scuttle two big mergers between telephone and cable television companies that were intended to foster construction of advanced networks.
And while the National Security Agency and the F.B.I. have been promoting technologies that would insure law enforcement officials' right to wiretap telephone and computer networks, the Commerce and State Departments have been relaxing export restrictions on computer and satellite technology that some security experts worry could fall into the hands of foreign enemies.
Lester C. Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, criticized what he saw as the Administration's push-and-pull on advanced information technology. "Here you've got the hottest industry in the world at the moment," he said, "but it's an industry that has historically been regulated and the role of Government has been to slap it down."
Yet, for all the seeming contradiction, there is a discernible pattern to the Administration's information technology policy. When forced to make a choice between promoting commercial technology companies and traditional national security interests, the Administration will usually side with commercial companies. But when crime or consumer issues are at stake, Clinton officials are less likely to toe the industry line.
White House officials concede there is a tension between goals but deny any policy confusion. "Even within a company you have huge fights about the right way to maximize profit," said W. Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the President for economic policy. "A government has a whole set of societal objectives and it has to try to keep the herd headed west in a reasonably coherent way."
 
Pleased, in General
 Executives in the computer and telecommunications field are on balance pleased with the attention the Administration has given to their fields. And even as they express frustration with particular actions, they acknowledge that all of them can be supported by reasonable arguments.
But economists and even some Democratic supporters of the Administration, say that the Government often appears to be working at cross-purposes as different agencies pursue agendas that collide with each other.
White House officials say that even seemingly contradictory actions may in fact be serving the same goal. Efforts to enforce antitrust laws will benefit all companies by promoting competition, they say, and new rules on cable prices merely prevent the extortion of monopoly profits.
Indeed, the Administration has demonstrated a certain consistency in its political priorities.
The White House announced two weeks ago, for example, that it would lift most of the export restrictions on advanced computer and communications equipment that had been previously considered to have military value. The decision was a big victory for companies that make high-speed computers and fiber optic communications equipment, and it came after years of resistance from the Pentagon.
Similarly, the White House recently overruled reservations by the Central Intelligence Agency and decided to let American companies develop commercial satellite imaging services based on spy-satellite technology.
 
Siding With Consumers
 On the other hand, if the Administration must choose between promoting advanced cable television networks and responding to consumer complaints about high prices, it will side with consumers. Likewise, the Administration seems wedded to the more traditional Democratic idea that bigness in business is suspect and that antitrust laws need to be enforced aggressively. And the Administration's support for computer companies is outweighed by its desire to be tough on crime.
The White House has brushed aside vehement objections from computer and software companies and is pressing the industry to adopt a new encryption technology called the Clipper Chip that would allow Federal investigators to intercept coded transmissions over computer networks. Computer companies object that many customers, particularly foreign ones, will never trust a coding technology developed by the United States Government and that American companies will be hurt on the global market as a result.
Some of the potentially biggest conflicts with technology companies are at the Justice Department's antitrust division, headed by Anne K. Bingaman. In sharp contrast to its predecessors in the Bush and Reagan Administrations, Ms. Bingaman's antitrust division is seeking out cases even before it receives formal complaints. Agency officials say they have begun 50 new "preliminary investigations" on their own initiative in the last year -- up from 4 in 1992.
"There is absolutely no conflict between what we're doing and what the Administration is doing," Ms. Bingaman said in a recent interview. "We're investigating situations in whatever industry that are in violation of the antitrust laws. Our obligation is to create a level playing field, where no company is squelched by a monopoly player."
 
Microsoft Inquiry
 The Justice Department began its investigation of Microsoft after the Federal Trade Commission ended its own three-year investigation without taking action. Microsoft, which sells about 80 percent of the operating systems that run I.B.M.-compatible personal computers, has come under fierce attack from rivals who say the company has used its dominance to thwart rivals who make word-processing and other applications software.
The Justice Department has also begun investigating the cable television industry. The focus of that investigation is on the General Instrument Corporation -- a key supplier of advanced set-top boxes and scrambling technology -- but Government officials say they are looking rather broadly at "relationships and practices" throughout the industry.
But the new activism has caused concern even among Democratic economists. One prominent critic is Robert J. Shapiro, vice president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a policy research group in Washington, who was an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton during the election campaign.
Mr. Shapiro contends that the Microsoft investigation may damage the overall strength of the software industry because it may be based on premises that are outdated in the information industry. In software and other technology markets, he contends, the need for common technical standards tends to leave a few companies with a dominant share of the market.
At the same time, he said, dominant companies in the information industry remain vulnerable to displacement from new rivals that offer innovative alternatives. Microsoft, like I.B.M., is only as strong as its next generation of products.
 
Issue of Bigness
 The question is not how big a particular company has grown but whether the market is "contestable" for new players, Mr. Shapiro said. Attacking the industry leader, he argued, risks subsidizing lagging players and weakening the industry as a whole.
"What I'm trying to argue is that the antitrust division needs to understand how modern markets operate," Mr. Shapiro said. "Having a big market share in certain markets is not the real issue. Rather than a sign of dysfunction, it's a sign that the market is working well."
Justice officials respond that they are not simply presuming that big is bad. "Size alone is not the determinant," said Stephen Sunshine, a Deputy Assistant Attorney General. "It's the practices. We're interested in exclusionary power and market power."
Some critics say the Administration shows even more internal conflicts in its effort to promote what it calls a National Information Infrastructure -- a ubiquitous array of advanced networks that offer two-way video communications and high-speed data to homes, schools and local government agencies.
Mr. Gore and other top Administration officials have made it clear they expect private industry to build these networks, but they have also called on the industry to meet broad public goals like extending the networks to both haves and have-nots. Likewise, Mr. Gore warmly supported the Federal Communications Commission's decision in February to cut cable television rates by a total of 17 percent.
 
Companies Cite Regulation
 The cable regulations were justified on the basis that most cable television systems enjoy exclusive franchises and have been able to raise prices for years at a pace well above the rate of inflation. A day after the rate cuts were announced, Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. abandoned their effort to merge and form a joint effort to build hybrid telephone-video networks across the country. On Tuesday, Cox Enterprises and Southwestern Bell called off plans for a $4.9 billion joint venture and blamed the F.C.C. as well.

HEADLINE: Workers Behind Federal Red Tape Find Its Strands Impeding Retirement

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 7

 BODY:
When the clock strikes midnight on Sept. 30 ending the fiscal year, nearly 50,000 Federal workers will retire or take early leave as part of the Clinton Administration's plan to remake the Federal Government. But leaving is not easy.
In a Kafkaesque turnabout, the makers of so much red tape will themselves now face a maze of forms and briefings before they can leave their jobs. 
 There are compulsory departure seminars to attend, identification cards to return, E-mail codes to be divested, interviews to be given, signatures to be checked and an inch-thick stack of forms to fill out. The higher the position held, the more material required.
Each month hundreds of Federal workers across the nation leave Government employment for a variety of reasons including retirement or taking private sector jobs.
But the departure rate is expected to step up considerably in the coming months because of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994. Better known as the Buyout Bill, it authorizes Federal agencies to offer up to $25,000 to employees who resign or retire early.
As many as 50,000 Federal workers will leave their jobs as part of the Administration's push to downsize the Government.
 
Lists of Rules
 Vice President Al Gore, who is overseeing the departures as part of his mission to "reinvent Government," said the reduction "would help rid the Federal Government of unnecessary and duplicative layers of management control that result in inefficiency and red tape."
But unless the current system changes, those wishing to take advantage of the offer will have to make their way through layers of management control. The process is much more exhaustive than the relatively simple procedure most people go through in leaving jobs in the private sector.
"You're actually given a checklist," said Richard E. Bissell, a former assistant administrator at the United States Agency for International Development who left the Government a year ago. "There are literally dozens of items to be checked off, each of which requires a separate form and a visit to a different office."
 
'Ripe for Reinvention'
 Richard Seifman, another A.I.D. official who retired earlier this month, said, "The retirement process itself is ripe for reinvention."
Jim King, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, leavens his observations about the departure process with humor but does not hold out much hope for change.
He ticked off a series of forms and checklists for what is known as "disengagement," but warned, "I'm touching on the high points now, not everything."
"Take Form 4754-A," Mr. King explained. "That assumes that you have led a notorious life and that you have in point of fact been every place in the Government and have something that you should return and apologize for: library card, equipment, bank or credit union loans, forwarding address, Government identification, cars, car keys.
"Over the years," he continued, "every agency has identified that somehow someone slipped out in 1947 without doing something, and so they keep adding to the list."
Federal employees face a bewildering set of options on a long list of things like health insurance and where and to whom their retirement benefits should go. As part of the process, most agencies have seminars that orient the departing worker to the departure process.
 
Manuals and Confusion
 "You're required to attend it so you can fill out all the forms correctly," said Mr. Bissell, now a research associate at the Overseas Development Corporation here. "Otherwise, it's impossible to make sense out of them."
Before the seminar, the worker is bombarded with manuals and pamphlets offering information about choices. Some departing employees compare these to the instructions for programming a VCR. The required seminars, they say, comes as a relief.
"At that point, you're just so happy to have a human being speaking in plain English, you don't mind," Mr. Bissell said.
The process is especially difficult if an employee had top-level Government security, allowing access to classified documents, said Jerry Shaw, director of the Senior Executive Association, which represents 7,500 career senior executives in the Government, 40 percent of whom are eligible for retirement.
 
Red Tape Doesn't End
 Mr. Shaw pointed out that for top-level officials, the red tape does not disappear once they are out the door. "There are substantial post-employment restrictions," he said, noting that top officials are barred from writing about or talking about their field of expertise or from doing business with their former departments for several years.
Once back in the private sector, Mr. Shaw said, lawyers and contracting officers must check with the ethics office or the general counsels of their old agency before taking on certain work so they will not face criminal prosecution.
But Madeleine Jacobs, now managing editor of Chemical and Engineering News Magazine, worked for the Federal Government for 21 years had a different experience. She left her job at as director of communications for the Smithsonian Institution.
"I had a very good experience," Ms. Jacobs said. "My organization, the Smithsonian was very helpful and I only gave three weeks notice."
She acknowledged, though, that her departure may have been eased because at 47 she did not have to fill out pension forms. "I still have a whole package of forms saved to fill out for when I'm 65," she said.
Mr. King concedes that the paper hurdles to departure "on the surface, look foolish." But he said that the costs of changing locks on desks if employees failed to turn in desk keys added up and that the difficulty of relaying information when an employee had not left a forwarding address was considerable.
Despite the Restructuring Act, Mr. King said there would be "no big queue" of departees lining up come fall.
"For the most part the system works very well because most folks know how to work the system," he said. "The more senior officials should think of it as an ego trip. The longer it takes, the more they should be flattered."
Ron Sanders, principal director for civilian personnel policy at the Department of Defense, said the Pentagon had had the authority to buy out employees since the 1990 fiscal year.
"We've reduced by about 200,000 since that time," said Mr. Sanders, who is a hot commodity on the lecture circuit. "Most people are amazed that the Federal Government can do something so well, and we've still got 120,000 more to go by the end of the century."

HEADLINE: Jobs Program May Become The Casualty Of Its Success

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
A federally financed program to provide housing and job training to the homeless has worked so well that the Clinton Administration wants to copy its methods on a larger scale and put it out of business.
Though this could mean more help for the estimated one million homeless Americans, the directors of the smaller, largely autonomous project say that its shoots of hope will be trampled by the big foot of the Federal bureaucracy. 
 The Administration acknowledges that the program, run by 20 nonprofit community agencies, has proved effective, but said it wanted to revamp and consolidate the 154 employment and job training programs. And Labor Department officials said the programs were demonstration projects not intended to continue indefinitely.
But several lawmakers, including Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, have complained. "It makes no sense to dismantle successful programs in order to create new programs elsewhere," he said in a recent letter to Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich.
Such an action, Mr. Glenn wrote, the department "is throwing all the knowledge that was learned through the demonstration program" away "and put us back at square one."
 
8,000 Homeless Each Year
 Part of a program established under a 1987 law on the homeless, the community agencies have been steering 8,000 homeless people a year into jobs in 12 states, including New York, and the District of Columbia. The Labor Department provides most of the money for the agencies: about $40 million in six years. Businesses and state and local governments contribute the rest.
The biggest reason the agencies have worked so well, proponents say, is that they are not constrained by a raft of government regulations and can tailor their aid to suit individual needs. The agencies are judged by their results, not by how they do their job. The majority of Government job training programs have stringent regulations aimed at limiting abuses and keeping costs in line.
The agencies' officials and their advocacy groups had hoped that they were laying the foundation for a larger network to help the homeless.
Instead, they said, they were stunned in late February when the Labor Department announced that their grants would not be renewed when they run out on April 30. The department has since extended the agencies' financing to run through August, but at sharply reduced levels.
The services are now turning away applicants and cutting staff. Michael Daniels, director of the largest agency, Jobs Consortium for the Homeless in Berkeley, said he is looking for local funds but has limited his clients to those already on his rolls and plans to cut back on staff on May 1.
Eliminating the small demonstration projects is part of a plan, announced last month by Mr. Reich, to consolidate and revamp Federal unemployment insurance and job training services. Douglas Ross, assistant secretary for employment and training, said the demonstration projects were experiments to see if the homeless could be helped.
"We invested a little capital to see if this hypothesis about job training and the homeless had any merit," he said. "We found out that it does. The next step is to find out what was learned so we can introduce it into our local labor market organization."
The Jobs Consortium here, eight blocks down Telegraph Avenue from the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, works from cramped cubicles with hand-me-down furniture on a budget this year of $850,000, of which the Labor Department provided $710,000.
"We see people nobody else will see," Mr. Daniels said. "If a person walks in the door with a disability or an addiction, we don't freak out."
In the last 11 months, Mr. Daniels said, 879 people have come in for help. So far, the agency has found homes for 550 and jobs for 228, many of them the same people. The jobs included carpenters, security guards, electricians, truck drivers, secretaries, cooks, janitors, home health care aides and graffiti removers. Their average hourly wage was $8.05, far higher than the $4.25 minimum wage. Half of those who found jobs were still working three months later.
 
'How Can I Help You?'
 The consortium's clients shower praise on the agency. David Osbourne, 30 years old, said he has been off cocaine for a year. The agency gave him meal vouchers, counseling, training to be a security guard, leads to job interviews and carfare.
"This place, you say, 'Help me,' " Mr. Osbourne said. "They say, 'How can I help you?' "
He said other Government agencies he visited were brusque and cold to and presumed he was unsalvageable.
Early this month, a security agency hired Mr. Osbourne for $8 an hour, and he is now moving from a shelter to a room in one of eight transitional houses in Berkeley, subsidized and operated by churches and nonprofit organizations, mostly for the homeless who have found jobs.
 
Jobs for 34 Percent
 A job training consultant, James Bell Associates of Arlington, Va., examined the Berkeley consortium and the other agencies -- known collectively as the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Project -- in a report last month to Congress for the Labor Department.
Over five years, the study said, 34 percent of the people who sought help found jobs through the 20 community agencies and 26 others that took part in the program earlier. The proportion still on the job after 13 weeks rose to 53 percent from 40 percent over the five years.
The average cost of job training for a homeless person was $1,342. The authors said the agencies provided "evidence that a substantial minority of the homeless population can immediately benefit from employment and training programs."
Larry Robbins, an independent consultant who has evaluated the Berkeley homeless consortium for the Labor Department, contrasted the billion-dollar partnership program with the community projects.
He said the larger program's regulations frighten people off. "They're not user-friendly," he said.
Franklin Newman, 33, needed user-friendly services once. In early 1990 he and his wife broke up, and he moved out of their apartment. Then he was dismissed from his job as a shipping and receiving manager for an electronics company after a feud with his boss.
Mr. Newman said he went to a check-cashing service with his last paycheck from that job, for $286.50, and planned to take a bus home to see his parents in San Bernardino in Southern California.
"Two guys pulled a gun," he said. "They took my suitcase, all my money." He went to a shelter. "I was on the verge of commmiting suicide," he said.
Then Mr. Newman went to the Berkeley agency. "They called the suicide prevention," he said. "They took me to the hospital. I was released in 48 hours, and they found me counseling. They got me clothing."
Earlier this month, Mr. Newman, in a white shirt and necktie, stopped by the Telegraph Avenue office to complete paperwork after landing an $18,000-a-year job with full benefits as a manager of a retirees' organization.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Turner Channel Seeks Carriers

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
When Ted Turner does something, he likes to do it big. And so when he starts his new cable channel, Turner Classic Movies, on Thursday, he will do so from that most public of spaces: Times Square. The channel's first few minutes of programming will be carried on the giant Jumbotron screen above Broadway.
The question is: Besides those gathered in the street, will anyone else be able to see it? 
 The Turner Broadcasting System is starting Turner Classic Movies, or TCM, at a time of enormous turmoil in the cable industry. Cable operators are still trying to make sense of the voluminous regulations issued recently by the Federal Communications Commission mandating yet another cut in cable rates.
Before cable systems add new channels, they will be looking for ways to pass costs on to consumers, or at least not lose any money. And that is making it hard for Turner to sign up carriers.
 
'In a Straitjacket'
 "We're sort of in a straitjacket until we sort through these new rules," John Rigsby, the president of Paragon Manhattan Cable, said.
At this point, he said, Paragon has no plans to add Turner Classic Movies to its lineup. Even though Paragon's parent, Time Warner Cable, has a partial stake in Turner Broadcasting, the cable operator has made no commitment to try to introduce the channel on its systems. The same is true for Tele-Communications Inc., which also owns part of Turner Broadcasting. Tele-Communications and Time Warner are the nation's largest cable operators.
Further, many cable systems around the country have run out of channel space, at least until new technology lets them expand capacity. Indeed, many systems were already forced to drop some channels last year when new Federal cable regulations took effect. The act required many systems to carry more broadcast stations.
Turner Classic Movies is Mr. Turner's sixth cable channel, after TBS, CNN, Headline News, TNT and the Cartoon Network. The channel will be built largely around the MGM film library, which Mr. Turner bought for $1.4 billion in 1986. (The steep price was what forced Mr. Turner to take on Time Warner and Tele-Communications as partners.)
 
Movies and More Movies
 Like its closest rival, American Movie Classics, or AMC, Turner Classic Movies will run movies 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without commercial interruptions. First on the schedule is "Gone With the Wind."
Brad Siegel, the general manager of TCM, refused to say how many viewers would be able to watch the channel after Mr. Turner pulls the switch in Times Square. "We are literally adding subscribers and systems on a daily basis," he said.
Cable industry analysts say the cost of starting TCM is so low that the channel can be profitable without a large audience. Turner Broadcasting, they note, already owns many of the films to be shown, and can promote them on its other channels.
"This is all about channel real estate," said Larry Gerbrandt, senior vice president of Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm. "If you've got the programming and you've got the economies of scale, it makes sense to clear as many channels as possible."
He said TCM might take some viewers away from Mr. Turner's other channels, but over all, it should add viewers to the Turner empire. "The net effect is you want to end up with more viewers than you had before," Mr. Gerbrandt said.
 
Aiming for a Bigger Audience
 AMC focuses almost exclusively on movies of the 1930's, 40's and 50's. But TCM plans to show films from the 60's, 70's and 80's as well. Mr. Siegel said this should let the channel appeal to a "much wider demographic, not just to older people."
Executives at AMC, which is owned by Rainbow Programming Holdings Inc., say they are not worried that TCM may cut into their franchise. AMC is available in 43 million households. "We really feel our niche is alive and well," Jayne Wallace, AMC's director of public relations, said. "We've been building a brand that is really steeped in the golden age of Hollywood. People tune in to AMC because they want to be back in that time.
"What you often hear from Turner is that they have the MGM library and we don't, which is true," she said. "They might have more titles, but the question is: Are they any good?"
To encourage cable systems to carry the channel, Turner is allowing them to package it in ways that maximize their profit. Thus, while some systems may carry the channel as part of their basic service, many are likely to offer it as part of a higher-priced tier, or on an "a la carte" basis for a special monthly fee. "We're giving the operators flexibility," Mr. Siegel said.
He said he was not worried about the channel's initial reach. "We're patient," he said. "We're in this for the long haul."

HEADLINE: Salt Mine Cave-In Brings Pollution and Jobs Debate

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RETSOF, N.Y., April 8

 BODY:
Just two months ago trucks lined up in record numbers at the Akzo salt mine here, hauling away road salt to melt heavy winter snow throughout the Northeast.
But a banner winter for Akzo, the largest salt mine in North America, has been followed by a nightmarish spring. Since the March 12 collapse of part of the mine roof, millions of gallons of water have been flooding the mine, which covers an area roughly the size of Manhattan some 1,200 feet underground. No one was injured in the collapse. 
 If nothing is done, the whole mine could collapse because water is eroding the salt pillars that hold up its roof, said Thomas Pearson, an environmental engineer who is leader of the team assigned to the mine by the New York State Environmental Conservation Department.
The collapse is evolving into a struggle between those worried about the more than 300 jobs at the mine and residents of the Rochester area who are concerned about what will happen if plans are approved to pump millions of gallons of salty mine water into the Genesee River. The salt mine is in Livingston County about 25 miles south of Rochester.
 
Contamination Concerns
 "We spent a billion dollars to clean up the Genesee River," said Edward P. Curtis Jr. who runs a cruise boat service in Rochester and used to direct Monroe County's tourism and convention efforts. "I'd hate to see that contaminated again for any reason."
Initially the collapse was believed to have been caused by an earthquake that measured 3.6 on the Richter scale. Now geologists and seismologists have all but ruled that out, suspecting instead that the readings were caused by the collapse itself.
Some environmental groups have charged that the collapse was caused by overmining to meet the heavy winter demand for salt. But an Akzo spokeswoman, Catherine Bolton, said that the vast majority of the salt mined this winter came from elsewhere in the mine.
Company officials believe that whatever caused the collapse disrupted an aquifer that is the source of the water flooding the mine. So far, the flooding has taken place in a relatively small section amounting to less than 10 percent of the total mine, Ms. Bolton said.
 
Trying to Level Volume
 "The vast majority of the mine is in fine shape," Ms. Bolton said.
The long-term answer is plugging the hole in the aquifer, company officials say, but meanwhile, they are seeking permission from the Environmental Conservation Department to discharge some of the salt water so the flooding does not get any worse.
"It would buy us some time," Ms. Bolton said.
Mr. Pearson maintains there are not many options besides pumping water into the river. The volume of water is too great to haul away by train or truck. A pipeline would take too long to build, as would an evaporation plant.
The conservation department has not formally issued the company a permit for pumping the water into the Genesee River, but has drafted guidelines for one.
 
Keeping the Mine Open
 The department has proposed allowing the mine to pump water with 1,000 parts per million of chloride after complete mixing into the Genesee for 30 days and then 500 parts per million after that. Pumping would be significantly reduced in the summer when river levels are low. Water already in the mine that is heavily saturated with salt would remain there. The pumping would be aimed at keeping the volume of water in the mine from growing.
Keeping the mine open is considered vital to Livingston County, where Akzo is the third-largest private employer. When transportation jobs connected with the mine are included, Akzo is the largest private employer, accounting for some $50 million annually going into the local economy.
The environmental conservation department has held two public meetings to explain the water-pumping plan. At the first in Livingston County, the audience seemed receptive. But a second meeting in a Rochester suburb was contentious. At one point the department's regional director threatened to end the meeting if the audience did not improve its behavior.
Gary Neuderfer, an aquatic toxicologist with the conservation department who drafted the standards Akzo will have to meet for pumping water, said the river can safely handle the amount of salt water prescribed by his agency. He said salt water in the ocean contains about 18,180 parts per million of chloride.
"I fish the Genesee," he said. "I live here. I have a vested interest in protecting this river."

HEADLINE: Probability Experts May Decide Pennsylvania Vote

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Fraud, virtually everyone agrees, should not be allowed to decide the election of a public official. But how is a court to determine whether the fraud was decisive? How certain must it be to take the extreme step of seating the nominal loser?
That problem faces Judge Clarence Newcomer of Federal District Court in Philadelphia, who will soon decide whether to order a new election in Pennsylvania's Second State Senatorial District in Philadelphia or declare the losing candidate, Bruce Marks, a Republican, to be the winner last November. To help, Judge Newcomer has hired a consultant from Princeton University who is an expert in the mathematics of probability. 
 The analysis of the expert, Orley Ashenfelter, an econometrician, along with that of statisticians hired by the Republicans and Democrats, may or may not sway the judge.
At the very least, though, the work of the statisticians will give the judge a rigorous basis for arguing about the probabilities that the election was stolen, and the case offers a fascinating glimpse at the no-man's-land where the law's wish for certainty meets a reality that many events can be explained only in terms of chance.
 
Absentee Ballot Problem
 In the special election to fill a Senate vacancy, Mr. Marks received 19,691 votes on the voting machines to the 19,127 for William Stinson, his Democratic opponent. But in absentee ballots, Mr. Stinson outpolled Mr. Marks by 1,391 to 366, giving him a victory by 461 votes. And in spite of charges of fraud by the Republicans, Mr. Stinson, a former assistant Deputy Mayor of Philadelphia, was sworn into office, temporarily giving the Democrats exactly half the seats in the State Senate.
In February, Judge Newcomer ruled that many of the absentee ballots had been improperly obtained and processed by the Democratic-controlled Philadelphia County Board of Elections as part of a "massive scheme" to control the outcome of the election. In some cases, for example, registered Democrats were given absentee ballots and told that they need not go to the polls to vote. In other cases they were specifically guided to vote Democratic. Judge Newcomer declared Mr. Marks, a former aide to Senator Arlen Specter, to be the winner.
Then, on March 12, a Federal appellate court ruled on the case, letting the decision to void the results of the election stand, but ordering Judge Newcomer to reconsider his decision to seat Mr. Marks rather than to call a new election. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Stinson and two Democratic campaign workers were charged with election fraud by the Pennsylvania Attorney General, a Republican.
How might statistical theory be used to determine the probability of the Democrats' stealing the election?
Professor Ashenfelter's approach is to analyze the relationship between machine-counted votes and absentee ballots in state senatorial contests in Philadelphia over the last decade.
There have been 22 such contests since 1982, including the disputed 1993 election. And using the standard statistical technique of regression analysis, Professor Ashenfelter found that the difference between the Democratic and Republican tallies in the machine-based vote has been a good indicator of the difference between the two parties' absentee vote.
Assuming this relationship in the 21 previous elections had held in the most recent, Professor Ashenfelter estimates that the Republican's 564-vote edge on the machines should have led to a 133-vote advantage in absentee ballots. In fact, the Democrat ended up with a majority of 1,025 absentee votes.
 
Chance and Statistics
 But as Professor Ashenfelter readily acknowledges, the predicted relationship between machine and absentee balloting is statistical in nature and dependent on the stability of the historical relationship. There is some chance that random variations alone could explain a 1,158-vote swing in the 1993 contest -- the difference between the predicted 133-vote Republican advantage and the 1,025-Democratic edge that was reported.
More to the point, there is some larger probability that chance alone would lead to a sufficiently large Democratic edge on the absentee ballots to overcome the Republican margin on the machine balloting. And the probability of such a swing of 697 votes from the expected result, Professor Ashenfelter calculates, was about 6 percent.
Putting it another way, if past elections are a reliable guide to current voting behavior, there is a 94 percent chance that irregularities in the absentee ballots, not chance alone, swung the election to the Democrat, Professor Ashenfelter concludes.
Paul Shaman, a professor of statistics at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania who is the statistical consultant retained by the Democrats, exploits the limits in Professor Ashenfelter's reasoning. Relationships between machine and absentee voting that held in the past, he argues, need not hold in the present. Could not the difference, he asks, be explained by Mr. Stinson's "engaging in aggressive efforts to obtain absentee votes?"
Elizabeth Holtzman, New York City's former Controller who has had a practical education in the vagaries of election statistics, agrees. With the exceptionally low turnout in the State Senate contest -- no surprise in a special election -- she believes it is unfair to project voter sentiment from historical relationships.
Brian Sullivan, the statistical consultant working for the Republicans who is an economist with the Center for Forensic Economic Studies in Philadelphia, responds to some of Professor Shaman's and Ms. Holtzman's objections. He analyzed the findings of a post-election poll of registered voters who had applied for absentee ballots. From the survey responses that he judged most reliable, he estimated that 84 percent of the absentee ballots had been illegally solicited or cast. By this reckoning, even if every legitimate absentee vote had gone to the Democrat, the Republican would still have won a majority in the overall vote.
Professor Shaman questions the quality of the survey, which was conducted by Republican campaign workers without supervision by neutral professionals. He notes, among other things, that the survey implies a total of 1,395 absentee ballots were illegitimate -- more than the total absentee ballot vote for Mr. Stinson.
 
Polluted by Irregularities
 Where does this leave an impartial observer? There is certainly a widespread impression that the election was badly polluted by irregularities. Were Mr. Stinson convicted of election fraud he would not be eligible to serve in the Senate, even if an analysis later found that the fraud was insufficient to change the election result. But those observations are of little help in deciding whether to seat Mr. Marks or call another election -- an election that would be won by the Democratic candidate if registered voters cast their ballots along party lines.
Lowell Finley, a partner in the San Francisco firm of Altshuler, Berzun who specializes in election law, thinks the burden of choice should rest on those who would declare a winner in the absence of certainty. "In a democracy voters ought to have the last word," he argues, "not judges."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Set to Change The Guard

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., April 7

 BODY:
When Connecticut voters go to the polls in November to choose their next governor, the top line on the ballot will belong to A Connecticut Party, the party of the victor in 1990, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
But now that Mr. Weicker is leaving office, whether voters are interested in continuing their experiment with an independent governor remains to be seen. 
 Mr. Weicker, most politicians grant, has proved that a governor can govern without a major party behind him. He has accustomed the state to hearing its chief executive say what many people think: partisan politics does not make good government.
And the party he founded will have a well-financed candidate, Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, to carry the anti-politics, good-government banner forward to November.
 
Coattails Not Apparent
 But Democratic and Republican leaders say A Connecticut Party has never been anything more than a personal vehicle for Mr. Weicker, and a recent poll by the University of Connecticut found that image widespread. Four out of five people surveyed said they expected the party to disappear after Mr. Weicker's term.
"Lowell Weicker continues to be seen to a great extent as Lowell Weicker," said G. Donald Ferree, the director of The Connecticut Poll, done by UConn's Institute for Social Inquiry. "It's not at all clear that he's been able to transfer that to anybody."
Mr. Weicker's legacy to state politics may prove to be his removal of the great unmentionable, the personal income tax, as a block to the candid debate of issues. Or it could be the younger generation of political leaders who are entering a field cleared for them by his tenure.
But this year, at least, his third party will have an influence by holding over Democrats and Republicans the continuing suspicions of the state's voters as the candidates debate how to turn around Connecticut's bleeding economy and create jobs. The candidates are acknowledging that influence by pledging to talk straight and with specifics on the issues. Good government and heeding the people's will are all the rage.
 
Leaving Politics of Blame
 "This period has provided us with an opportunity to get away from the politics of blame," said Senator John B. Larson of East Hartford, who is supported by much of the old Democratic leadership even as he talks of the potential for a "paradigm shift" in the way government operates.
"Weicker's not going to be the focal point," Mr. Larson said. "It's going to be the candidate who can be candid with the people and put forth solutions. People want to take back their government."
The State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., who will challenge Mr. Larson at the Democratic convention and is expected to wage a primary fight if he falls short there, said the state government itself is an issue.
"One thing this campaign is about is a generational change in the political leadership of the party and of the state government," he said. "It's about looking at some of the old orthodoxies with fresh eyes and making a transition that is long overdue."
"The anger over the performance of government is as deep-seated as it has ever been. People don't really believe that it is capable of change."
How well Mrs. Groark does in November may be most critical to the Democrats, who finished third in 1990 with only 21 percent of the vote, after holding the governorship for 32 of the previous 36 years.
Mr. Marcus, the Democrats' state chairman, says the election "is kind of like Armageddon" for the party, as he lobbies for unity among Mr. Larson, Mr. Curry, and two other candidates, State Senator Richard J. Balducci of Newington and Joseph P. Ganim, the Mayor of Bridgeport.
The Republicans, a smaller party with a more loyal core of voters, could again gain from a three-way race. John G. Rowland, the former Congressman from Waterbury who nearly beat Mr. Weicker in 1990, is hoping to block a primary challenge by the Secretary of the State, Pauline R. Kezer, and then turn Mr. Weicker's record against both Mrs. Groark and the Democrats.
 
'They Worked With Weicker'
 "Whoever is running for the Democratic Party has to run on the record of the Democrat-controlled Legislature," said Mr. Rowland's press secretary, Richard Slawsky. "They can't run away from that record, and it is a real handicap. Start with the fact they worked with Weicker to give us the income tax."
Mrs. Groark says she will run on the Weicker administration's record of restoring the state's financial stability and of fighting the recession by cutting business taxes and making loans and grants to employers.
"We've invested too much time and energy to allow the state to be turned back to partisan politics, where it's the strength of the party or someone's candidacy that is more important than the welfare of the people," she said.
"The Democrats and Republicans would like to think that if they turn around and look the other way, this candidate and A Connecticut Party will disappear. But I'm running on our record, and there is very little else to talk about in this campaign."
 
Anything More Than Weicker
 The ultimate question is whether A Connecticut Party has come to mean anything to voters apart from Mr. Weicker, a former three-term Republican Senator who was perhaps the state's best-known politician when he formed his own party in 1990.
Peter Gold, a former Weicker hand who now is Mrs. Groark's campaign chairman, said the party, with only 1,770 members, is mainly a legal mechanism for putting a third candidate on the ballot.
It succeeded, he said, by appealing to the broad interests of voters across party lines, just as Mr. Weicker has governed in Hartford by forming coalitions of Democrats and Republicans and mediating what Mr. Gold called "the partisan interests that tend to overwhelm the system."
But while the poll by the Institute for Social Inquiry found that residents were persuaded that an independent governor could govern, it found little evidence that they thought the nature of governing had changed. And only one in 10 thought A Connecticut Party would become an established party.
The independent streak among Connecticut voters is more a lack of commitment to the major parties than an identification with a new one, said Mr. Ferree, the poll's director.
"Lowell Weicker is seen as being something unto himself, and should she be elected, Eunice Groark would most likely be seen as something unto herself," Mr. Ferree said. "It is fair to say that the present administration, and its possible successor, may well be an interlude."

HEADLINE: Truck Strike Impact Seen As Limited

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 10

 BODY:
The American economy is likely to wiggle through even a lengthy trucking strike by the teamsters' union with minimal disruptions, transportation experts and business executives say.
Since the 75,000 teamsters walked out at 22 trucking companies at midnight Tuesday, there have already been anecdotal reports of shipments canceled, production schedules altered and other dislocations, and experts expect many more, including scattered manufacturing layoffs, if the strike lasts more than a week. But no one expects a repeat of 1979, when a much broader 10-day teamster strike against 500 companies provided a severe if short-lived economic jolt that forced the Chrysler Corporation, for one, to shut down 9 of its 10 North American auto assembly lines. 
 The greatest concern about the impact of this strike has been that many companies -- including auto makers, which are the primary pace setters for the industrial sector -- are operating more leanly than ever before to reduce the amount they have invested in inventories. But their dependence on more frequent delivery of raw materials and components from suppliers has not led to greater reliance on the teamsters union.
Instead, the huge expansion in the last decade of the nonunionized trucking sector has given them unprecedented flexibility in choosing how to ship goods and materials while new computer systems have helped them use that flexibility more wisely.
"I doubt there will be anyone screaming to Congress to intervene," said Hugh Randall, head of the transportation group at Mercer Management Consulting, a firm in New York that often studies logistics issues.
The most obvious change since 1979 has been the creation of an estimated 30,000 trucking companies after the deregulation of the industry in 1980, resulting in a total of 45,000 companies today. Members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, who once accounted for nearly 90 percent of intercity truck traffic by tonnage, now handle about 15 percent in total and less than half in the "less than truckload," or L.T.L., business, the segment that is the target of the current strike.
L.T.L. carriers generally pick up loads from 50 pounds to 10,000 pounds and often handle several different orders in a run that goes to a variety of destinations. They face competition at the high end of their $18 billion market from full-truckload carriers, who prefer to take an entire truckload of materials from a single pickup point to a single delivery site, and at the low end from companies like the United Parcel Service and Roadway Package Systems.
 
Gains by Alternative Shippers
 Some L.T.L. customers are also being wooed by alternative shippers like airlines and railroads. Some of these shippers have been able to consolidate small loads into full truckloads, which can then be handled by truckers not affected by the strike, or better yet stacked onto trains.
Wall Street analysts say such "intermodal" truck-train traffic can cut fuel costs by as much as two-thirds per ton shipped. Railroads can ship the same tonnage as trucks over a long distance with one-seventh the number of workers.
While less obvious, the economy's vulnerability to a teamsters' strike has been tempered by new technology as well as by the increase in nonunion truckers and other transport options. The process of becoming leaner has forced many companies to develop a clearer picture of where they should focus their efforts when faced with transportation disruptions. Billions of dollars have been invested in computerized inventory and production management systems that allow them to keep better track of their operations.
"Companies have a much better idea of what they need," Mr. Randall of Mercer Management Consulting said. Beyond that, the entire transportation system has become so laced with computer-based management systems that adjustments to disruptions can be made far more efficiently.
Initially, these management systems have been used primarily to help customers of the struck carriers figure out which goods now stuck in transit can be quickly retrieved and shipped on to their destination using alternate carriers.
 
Technology's Impact Unclear
 "In the past, there wasn't much information that accompanied shipments," said Gary Malek, contract and planning manager for the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, which expects to have recovered 90 percent of its shipments trapped by the strike by Wednesday. "Now we know exactly where our freight is."
How much the new technology helps will not be apparent for a while. A significant number of companies and their carriers took precautionary steps in advance of the strike. Yellow Freight Systems, the largest of the struck L.T.L. carriers, delivered so much freight on the Monday and Tuesday before the strike began that it had about half its normal load in transit when the teamsters walked about, said Kathy Finlen, a spokeswoman for Yellow Freight, based in Overland Park, Kan.
 
Problem Areas Remain
 Companies like Minnesota Mining, which has a routine plan for anticipating all sorts of labor conflicts, had used its electronic mail system to tell customer service teams to anticipate a strike in talking with customers about promotions or other projects that might create special shipping demands. There are still problem areas -- Mr. Malek cited hiccups in getting parts on schedule for production machinery scheduled for refurbishment -- but the company reports no significant interruptions to date.
"If you forecast your needs several days in advance, there's no problem," Mr. Malek said. "If you need a truck in a few hours, you could be in trouble."
The trouble results from the general strength of the economy, which already had many trucking companies scrambling to hire new employees and buy new equipment. Home Depot Inc., the rapidly growing home improvement chain based in Atlanta, stocked up in advance of the strike but now has low inventories of some products and is running into trouble with products delivered weekly by L.T.L. carriers, like power tools and plumbing accessories, said Peter Cleaveland, vice president of traffic and distribution.
Home Depot's distribution system is not set up to help manufacturers who rely on L.T.L. carriers to reach the chain, but others do have such flexibility. Cotter & Company, a cooperative in Chicago that represents more than 6,000 Tru-Value hardware stores, already picks up about 40 percent of the goods that are shipped to its distribution centers on return trips from delivery routes to its stores.
 
Making Adjustments
 "We have the capacity to grab more on the backhaul if manufacturers are having trouble getting things to us," Dean Challed, Cotter's national transportation manager, said.
The easiest adjustment for many suppliers is simply to ship products less often, which allows them to accumulate a big enough load to fill a truck on their own. That is what Corning Inc. is doing with some of its consumer glassware and scientific glass products, said Scott Proudfoot, the company's director of transportation. But strong demand from regular customers is limiting the ability of full-truckload companies to pick up all of the business being offered by L.T.L. customers. That adds to the demand for L.T.L. truckers not on strike.
"We are at or near capacity in every location," said Jeff Jordan, spokesman for Overnite of Richmond, Va., a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Corporation, which is the largest L.T.L. carrier not being struck. "Some locations are handling double their normal volume."
Some of the adjustments are temporary measures likely to be undone as soon as the strike ends. But others will not. Mr. Malek of Minnesota Mining said that once a company begins reconfiguring its shipping patterns, it often discovers that some of the changes result in faster and cheaper service than it had been living with in the past.
Minnesota Mining has begun shipping tape products from its plant in Hutchinson, Minn., to its distribution center in Forest City, Iowa, where full truckloads are made up for shipment around the country, instead of shipping via the distribution networks set up by national L.T.L. carriers.
"In many cases, we won't go back to the old arrangements," he said.

HEADLINE: Lawyer Says Rifkin Will Plead Insanity In L.I. Murder Case

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., April 10

 BODY:
Lawyers for Joel Rifkin, a 34-year-old Long Island man who has confessed to killing 17 women, say they will try to convince a jury that he was insane and unable to tell right from wrong when he strangled his victims and disposed of their bodies.
"It won't be the easiest task, but in this case I think the facts support such a defense," said John Lawrence, Mr. Rifkin's lawyer. "It will no doubt come down to a debate between experts." 
 The trial is to begin Monday in Nassau County Court with jury selection, which both the defense and prosecution expect to take several days.
"Because of all the pretrial publicity, it's probably going to take some time before a fair and impartial jury can be selected," said Mr. Lawrence.
He said that Mr. Rifkin was "well aware of what is going on" in planning his defense. "He is in his cell in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day, and the trial is what he dwells on primarily."
Fred Klein, the prosecutor, has been anticipating an insanity defense, which many law-enforcement officials view as a last-ditch effort. Mr. Rifkin, an unemployed landscaper, has been imprisoned in Nassau County Jail since he was arrested on June 28, 1993, in the killing of Tiffany Bresciani, 22. Her body was found in Mr. Rifkin's van after he crashed into a telephone pole, ending a 20-minute chase that began when the police tried to pull him over for a missing license plate.
After his arrest, Mr. Rifkin admitted killing 16 other women, recalling the details in a 12-page confession. Although he is to be tried in Nassau for a single count of murder, he is expected to face trial in the other killings in Suffolk County, Queens and Brooklyn.

The auto industry isn't afraid of higher interest rates, yet.

BYLINE: By James Bennet 

 BODY:
ARE rising interest rates a threat to automobile sales and auto makers' earnings?
Not yet, in the view of Wall Street analysts, dealers and auto executives. The increases brought on by the Federal Reserve so far have not deterred buyers, Alexander J. Trotman, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said at a news conference before the recent New York Auto Show. 
 "Interest rates are perceived as low in general by our buyers out there -- potential buyers -- and we've seen no damage from the recent turns of the screw," Mr. Trotman said.
But, Mr. Trotman added, he is not encouraging anyone to raise rates further. "We're hopeful that if there are any further increases this year, they would be extremely modest," he said.
One worry in the industry has been that far from scaring away buyers, the prospect of higher rates could start a stampede toward the showrooms, as consumers tried to lock in low rates. Such a response could shorten the auto recovery, causing it to peak earlier than 1996 or 1997, as most analysts have projected. Sales ran far stronger than expected in February and March.
Some sales people have incorporated the possibility of a rate increase into their pitches. Jas Marilley, a salesman for the Norm Reeves Honda Superstore in Cerritos, Calif., has warned wavering buyers that rates could reach 11 percent in six months. "I definitely preach doom if I want to increase the urgency," Mr. Marilley said.
But for the most part, executives, dealers and analysts say car buyers do not base their decisions on fears of future interest rates. "I don't think anyone who needs a car will go out and buy one just to head off an interest rate," said Abe Wiaz, sales manager for Englewood Dodge in Englewood, N.J. "He may do that with houses, but not cars."
Dealers said interest rates would not have much impact on car buying unless they hit double digits. Five years ago, buyers could pay 12 percent interest; today they can easily find financing for much less. At Star Hickey Ford in Detroit, for example, a customer buying a $19,000 Taurus could expect to pay about 8 percent interest, with $1,000 down -- yielding payments of about $385 a month for four years. An increase of half a percentage point, dealers argue, would translate into only a few extra dollars a month.
Still, analysts contend that interest rates do not scare off consumers by increasing the monthly payment, but by dampening their confidence in the economy. "I do see interest rates as a threat to consumer psychology that causes people to pull back from discretionary spending across the board," said Philip K. Fricke, auto analyst with Prudential Securities in New York.
The basic ingredients of the auto recovery are still in place, auto market bulls say. Consumer confidence remains high, employment is rising and cars on average are older -- about 7.5 years -- than they have been since 1946.
Rates would have to climb about two full percentage points before they began to scare off buyers, said Gurudutte Baliga, assistant portfolio manager for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. As a result, he said, he still favors the Big Three auto stocks because "these companies are going to definitely deliver the earnings."
Mr. Baliga predicted that if the growth of the economy was stable at about 3.5 percent, the auto market would not peak until 1996, at more than 17 million cars and light trucks -- well above its high of 16.2 million in 1986.

The Whitewater Pulse

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Every scandal has its pulse. Whitewater has entered a quiescent stage. As investigators silently dig deeper, previous revelations sink in:
Let's say I want to make an untraceable investment in a political figure. How could I launder the donation and even get a tax deduction for it? 
 I might find a broker willing to "allocate" trades in the futures market -- that is, to put in orders to buy and sell at the same time. He could then allocate the winning trade to my political friend and the losing trade to some poor sucker, or even to me; I would then take my losses on the down side of the "straddle," using them to reduce taxable gains from other trades.
In that way, a pol or his wife could make a bundle with no risk and little or nominal capital. The pol gets rich on reportable profits, while I have laundered -- effectively hidden -- my contribution to him.
This beats slipping cash under the table. Not only is my political friend's newly "made" money usable for other investments, the transaction is too complicated to outrage most voters.
Some mean-spirited partisans are advancing that hypothesis -- with no evidence offered in this case -- as a possible explanation of Hillary Rodham Clinton's ability to turn a thousand dollars (at most) into a hundred thousand in a single year.
That's a 10,000 percent return on her investment, more than just about any other investor in America in 1979. (Fair-minded observers will adjust for inflation; that makes hers a 9,987 percent return.)
The Clintons reject the sinister inference being drawn by slavering hounds of the press (especially the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which knows too much about straddles and futures). At first, the White House line was that the Clinton 100 G's -- some of which was later murkily invested in tax-sheltering Whitewater -- was the result of phenomenal investment acumen by a lawyer then still in her 20's.
Yesterday, backpedaling Clinton aides admitted to The Washington Post that James Blair, lawyer to Tyson poultry interests, did the cattle-futures ordering in her behalf. (That's probably because the broker, "Red" Bone, told other reporters that Mrs. Clinton was a stranger to him.) Soon after the 9,987 percent profit, Mr. Bone was suspended for three years for the preferential way he handled trades and margin requirements.
Maybe Blair and Bone operated entirely within the law, and the Clintons received only good advice -- and not what some of us leap to opine was in effect a $100,000 gift.
The special counsel may not be following leads into these new areas. How can the public discover the truth? The answer: from sworn testimony in Congressional hearings.
Speaker Tom Foley and Banking Chairman Henry Gonzalez are succeeding in their stonewalling in the Democratic House. They expect counsel Robert Fiske to make a finding of suicide in Vincent Foster's death, rebuking only mildly the obfuscation of White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum, who chose Fiske. The Speaker will then declare hearings unnecessary.
In the Senate, however, Republican leader Bob Dole will deliver a letter at noon today to majority leader George Mitchell specifying a proposed makeup and timing of the investigating committee; the experienced fraud squad on Senator Sam Nunn's government operations staff should be Mr. Bone's interlocutor. Hearings on confirmation of a Supreme Court justice could be held up until Whitewater hearings are under way.
Why pursue this "old story" to its source? Because when Whitewater was first exposed by The New York Times in early 1992, candidate Clinton effectively squelched it with a legal-accounting "report" that was at least misleading, and may turn out to be a tissue of lies. If so, President Clinton should be held accountable.
The pulse beats on: the mortification of civil penalties, not impeachment, may be in store.
Would it weaken this Presidency? Sadly, yes. But for one-party government to condone a campaign cover-up would damage the American system far worse -- which is why the truth about Whitewater must be flushed out.

Car Pooling

 BODY:
New York City's first car pool lanes will open next Monday morning on the Queensboro Bridge. "High-occupancy vehicle lanes," or H.O.V.'s, which are rare in the region, are meant to help governments and businesses comply with the Clean Air Act by rewarding commuters who share their cars with others. The H.O.V. that opened last month on Interstate 80 in New Jersey was expected to be used by about 600 vehicles an hour but so far it is getting more use than that, state transportation officials say. Vehicle counts for car pool lanes on Interstate 84 in Connecticut were declining -- partly because of the area's weak economy, officials say -- until last year when the rules were relaxed to allow cars with as few as two occupants to take the lane. The car pool lanes shown are open to vehicles with two or more people, busses and all motorcycles.

HEADLINE: In Musical Odessa, Playing On for the Love of It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ODESSA, Ukraine

 BODY:
Somehow, they just keep playing. Despite the poverty and the loss, the bleak future and the burdensome past, the musicians of Odessa refuse to lay down their instruments.
With little state support and even less from private business, orchestras throughout the former Soviet Union are wasting away. Music schools can no longer afford to pay for electricity, let alone salaries or instruments. 
 The great orchestras of Moscow and St. Petersburg have gone begging for rent money.
And here, in the musical center of Ukraine, where Jascha Heifetz was born and where generations of the world's most gifted virtuosos have been produced -- the violinists David Oistrakh, Nathan Milstein, Isaac Stern, for example, and the pianists Benno Moiseiwitsch and Emil Gilels -- the economic situation is as bad as it can be. The entire annual payroll of the 103-member Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra, less than $34,000, would not be enough to hire a good second violinist for the New York Philharmonic.
"Every one of us has considered leaving," said Viktor I. Kuzikov, the Odessa's 50-year-old concertmaster, who recently received Ukraine's highest artistic award. "And of course many, many have. But there is something about this city, I don't know what it is, that won't let go of me. It isn't easy to explain, but there is a quality about Odessa, sadness maybe, or desire, that makes music more beautiful."
 
Prodigy Factory
 It has always been this way. This cosmopolitan city has long supplied the concert halls of the world with its musical prodigies, drawn, as Isaac Babel recalled in one of his memorable tales of Jewish life here, from the slums of the Moldvanka. Children when they were 4 or 5 would be plucked "from the evil-smelling courtyards of the Old Market," he wrote, and shipped off to a "factory of infant prodigies, a factory of Jewish dwarfs in lace collars and patent leather pumps," where they would learn to play the violin.
Mr. Stern once joked that cultural exchanges between the United States and the Soviet Union were simple affairs: "They send us their Jews from Odessa," he said long after he moved to America. "And we send them our Jews from Odessa."
Little has changed. The smells still linger in the Moldvanka. And so does the talent. Here there are no basketballs in the broad courtyards, no Michael Jordan T-shirts. The streets are filled with 10-year-old boys clutching violin cases. The Philharmonic, housed in the acoustically dead former stock exchange building and conducted by a charismatic young American, sells out every concert. And at the school of Pyotr Stoliarsky, one of the world's renowned training grounds for young musicians, the thick stone walls ring with the rich sound of children's dreams.
 
Different in Odessa
 "We are just fanatics about our music," said Pavel P. Butovsky, the deputy director of the Stoliarsky School. "It's in the water or the air. There is this belief now in Moscow and abroad that technical skills above all are the path to achievement. That without them you can be nothing.
"We have always disagreed. Here you play with the heart. First comes the freedom. Then comes the technique."
Of course, the Stoliarsky approach to musical education could hardly be described as lax. The 400 students who enroll in the 11-year program are expected to practice daily, from dawn to dark. And they are expected to practice what they are told to practice. But since its creation in the early years of the century, students here have always been taught to use their technique to communicate something more profound than physical dexterity.
The results are beyond dispute. The school no longer keeps a list of international prizes awarded to its pupils on the wall of the director's office. It got too long. Just last month, three 10-year-old Stoliarsky students took the first three prizes in a competition in Kharkov in central Russia, bringing home $200 each, more than the average annual salary for many adults here.
There is an unlikely guiding spirit behind Odessa's current musical vitality. Hobart Earle, the 34-year-old Princeton graduate who conducts the Philharmonic, is the first American to be the conductor of an orchestra in the former Soviet Union. And in March, after the Odessa Philharmonic sold out three straight performances in Kiev, he became the first foreigner to be honored by the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk. Last year, Mr. Kravchuk granted the orchestra federal status, making it eligible, members joke dryly, to receive no salary like the rest of the country.
 
Harder Every Day
 Mr. Earle, who first came here in 1990 when he was living in Vienna, took the orchestra abroad for the first time last year to the United States, where it performed in Carnegie Hall in front of many former Odessites. In the fall the musicians plan to tour Austria, Germany and Switzerland. And their concerts in the Ukrainian cities of Chernivtisi, Lvov, and Ivano-Frankovsk all sold out, bringing live performances to people who had never attended a concert.
Despite the abundance of talent, success gets harder every day. Touring at home seems impossible. Touring abroad has become the orchestra's only hope of earning enough money to stay alive. The average wage of $27 a month (twice what any other Ukrainian orchestra earns) still barely covers food bills. An attempt by Mr. Earle to replace fragile old handwritten orchestral parts with printed sheet music has been stymied by costs. Most of the orchestra's instruments are so bad that the average American high school would toss them out. When it travels abroad, the orchestra borrows drums.
"It's really very frustrating," said Mr. Earle, who came here without knowing a word of Russian but now speaks it and Ukrainian fluently. "They are capable of so much. And they have achieved so much. But to go to the next level without decent instruments or housing or a hall that even has a changing room seems very difficult to imagine." He isn't giving up though. He has a dream of building cooperative apartments for orchestra members in Odessa. For the many musicians who share a room with seven or eight other people, often without heat or plumbing, it would be a miracle.
Mr. Earle also wants to move the orchestra from the ornate, old stock exchange building, a beautiful place to watch music but a horrible place to hear it, to a new hall. "But that," he said, "would take a Carnegie, or a Mellon or a Rockefeller. Somebody with roots here who wants to come to the rescue."
So far no such person has appeared. Donations have been on a smaller scale: the Chicago Symphony Orchestra sent bow hair and strings last year for example, and some desperately needed sheet music has come from Europe.
 
No Compromises
 There are even artists here who fear success, who seem to find comfort in the eternal struggle to survive that occupies so much of their energy.
"I am totally free," said Sergei Terentiev, who many people feel is the city's most gifted pianist. "I never compromise. It is easy for me, of course, there has never been anything to compromise for." Mr. Terentiev has performed in St. Petersburg and Moscow, but under Communism his free interpretations of classics by composers from Liszt and Chopin to Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett were not widely appreciated.
"I was not asked back," he said, without a trace of unhappiness. "They would have preferred that I disappear."
Things are changing for Mr. Terentiev, a wildly bearded man of 50 who recently returned from the Festival of Music in Perth, Australia, where he received unanimous acclaim both for his classical performances and for jazz improvisations.
"Now I am asked again to perform and to travel," he said, warily. "But it is such a risk to go abroad. To change language and tempo. It is so dangerous. It could be interesting to work abroad for a while. After all Tchaikovsky did it, Glinka did it. But I love this place. And I am afraid what will happen if I leave it."

HEADLINE: Money Growing on Trees? No, but Study Finds Next Best Thing

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
PLANTING trees in cities and suburbs can reap millions of dollars in long-term savings by making it less costly to heat and cool buildings, by absorbing air pollution and by conferring a range of other environmental benefits, according to a study by the United States Forest Service.
The three-year study focused on metropolitan Chicago, and the researchers estimated that planting 95,000 trees in Cook and DuPage counties would result in a net benefit of $38 million over 30 years. 
 Scientists have long known that trees exert a cooling effect, absorb pollutants, improve water quality, lessen flooding and abate noise, among other benefits. But the new study is believed to be the first to put dollar amounts on the benefits and measure them against the cost of planting and maintaining trees in a specific area. In the course of their investigation, the researchers also produced an unusually detailed examination of the role of vegetation in an urban-suburban ecosystem.
 
Questions of Worth
 Metropolitan Chicago is particularly well endowed with trees -- more than 50 million of them in the two-county study area, according to the study report by Dr. E. Gregory McPherson, Dr. David J. Nowak and Dr. Rowan A. Rowntree, all research foresters with the Forest Service.
Trees "have long been recognized as valuable community assets" by Chicagoans, Dr. McPherson wrote. But, he went on, officials faced with dwindling budgets are questioning whether trees are worth the cost of planting and maintenance, and homeowners are beginning to wonder whether coping with fallen leaves, invasive roots, grass-killing shade and broken branches is worth the trouble. "Urban forestry programs," he wrote, "must now prove their cost-effectiveness."
The report estimated that in 1991 alone, the value of the removal of pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone and particulate matter from the air by trees amounted to $9.2 million in the study area.
By providing shade and blocking winter winds, the study found, a single 25-foot tree can reduce annual heating and cooling costs by 2 to 4 percent, and three adroitly placed trees could save Chicago homeowners $50 to $90 a year. The economic analysis found that energy savings could exceed costs by 35 percent for trees planted near typical two-story buildings and by 90 percent for trees near energy-efficient wood-frame buildings.
"You can manage your trees to improve energy efficiency by planting the right species in the right spot and doing the right pruning," Dr. Nowak said.
For example, trees planted on the western side of a house generally provide maximum shade. Trees planted on the southern side would also increase the cooling; but in northern climes, they would also block valuable southern sunlight in the winter, thereby raising heating costs. Even the branches of leafless deciduous trees can block 30 to 40 percent of incoming solar radiation, Dr. Nowak said.
Selecting "solar friendly" trees with open crowns that drop their leaves early in the fall and sprout them again late in spring can mitigate this problem, according to the report. Among solar-friendly trees listed in the study are, for instance, ash, Norway maple and poplar. And trees planted on the northern or northwestern side of homes in many northern areas can turn away chilling winter winds, reducing heating costs.
Street trees, which account for 10 percent of Chicago's trees and 24 percent of total leaf-surface area, were found to be a major source of building shade. The researchers calculated that the shade of a large street tree situated to the west of a typical brick residence can reduce the use of air-conditioning energy by 2 to 7 percent.
While the study found that large trees remove 60 to 70 times more pollution than do small ones, it also discovered that most of the Chicago area's trees are small. Many of these are invasive species that sprout readily in disturbed areas, grow quickly and live a relatively short time.
The most common trees are buckthorn, green ash, white ash, various species of the cherry family, box elder and the American elm. The invasive buckthorn, a European native originally imported as a decorative shrub that has widely proliferated and crowded out many native species,accounts for 12.7 percent of the total tree population but only 2.9 percent of total leaf surface, according to the study.
Buckthorn is being eradicated in some parts of the Chicago area as part of a program aimed at restoring some of the region's original oak savannas. For pollution reduction, it would be an advantage to replace buckthorn with bigger trees, Dr. Nowak said.
 
Doing the Calculations
 The overall cost-benefit calculations were based on the planting of 95,000 green ash trees, which were described as a typical tree species in the Chicago area. The calculations found that planting the trees and maintaining them for 30 years would cost $21 million, while the benefits conferred by the trees would be $59 million, for a net benefit of $38 million, or $402 per tree planted.
Environmentalists engaged in urban reforestation were quick to praise the study, contending that it bolstered their case for planting more trees in a time of budgetary limits.
"It's the first thorough study of a city that could be reasonably compared to a city like New York or other older, densely populated cities," said Nancy A. Wolf of the Environmental Action Coalition, a nonprofit research and educational group in New York.


GRAPHIC: A study measuring the environmental and economic benefits of trees in metropolitan Chicago quantified how much trees improve air quality and reduce energy costs.
Diagram: "Potential Cash Value of Urban Greenery"
 They do so by absorbing atmospheric pollutants (1) and (2). When located properly, trees reduce energy use in buildings (3), which inturn results in lower carbon dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel power plants (4).
 Pollution "storage"
 The amount of carbon stored annually by one tree with a 3-inch trunk diameter is estimated to equal the amount of carbon emitted by one car driven 10 miles.
 Best-placed trees
 Trees opposite west-facing windows and walls were found to provide the greatest summer shade and protection against winter winds.
 Shade from a 25-foot tree west of a typical brick residence reduced annual heating and air-conditioning costs by about $50 a year. Three trees, including an evergreen to the west or north, saved $90 a year (about 10 percent of a typical annual fuel bill in Chicago.)

HEADLINE: Electricity Stalls Power of Wind As a Statewide Source of Energy

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., April 11

 BODY:
With the cost of the technology dropping, windmills could help the Northeast meet its energy needs more cleanly, experts said today at a conference on renewable energy sources.
The catch is that, right now, the region is awash in cheap electricity, so there is little economic incentive to invest in windmills. 
 California is by far the largest user of wind, with windmills producing 1.2 percent of its electricity, and up to 7 percent in peak-demand periods. If every site were used, the state could generate one-third of its electricity with wind, said Donald Aiken, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
But New York State has even more wind power available than California, and could use wind to meet half its electricity needs if all potential sites were used, Mr. Aiken said.
 
Low Winds Forecast
 Wind projects are scattered around the Northeast, including one in New York State. But Bernard Fox, the president and chief executive of Northeast Utilities, which serves most of Connecticut and large parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said, "We're not going to be ordering much of anything for the next few years."
The combination of the recession and conservation efforts means that the company will not need any new generating stations until well into the next decade, he said.
In addition, the company will not pay more for renewable energy than it has to, Mr. Fox said. Northeast is now paying $215 million a year for electricity from plants that burn wood or garbage that it could generate itself for $50 million. The reason is that it priced the power in the early 1980's by comparing it to the cost of oil, which was then high, and the estimated future cost, which was even higher. But the price of oil fell.
Utilities' use of renewable energy is important because electric companies consume more than 40 percent of all fuels used in the nation, and the proportion is rising; if the economy moves to non-depletable resources, the utilities will play a huge role.
The conference, organized by the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, of Greenfield, Mass., drew hundreds of utility executives, scientists, environmentalists and others to the Sheraton Hotel here for three days of workshops and lectures. Wind, rain and sun each got their own conference room this afternoon.
Photovoltaic cells, which make electricity from sunlight, are also dropping in cost. Jane M. Weissman, coordinator of an inter-utility testing group, said that in Boston, despite three feet of snow in February, there were still 16 days of strong sun.
Solar-cell manufacturers have high hopes for the Northeast, particularly New York City and Long Island, which have the highest electric rates of almost anywhere in the country. Their product cannot make electricity nearly as cheaply as a conventional power plant, but the cells can produce electricity for less than the retail cost.
The technology that is closest to making its way in the competitive market on an unsubsidized basis -- and is beginning to do so -- is wind.
Hydro-Quebec, the Canadian provincial utility that exports hydro-electric power to the states in the Northeast, plans to install about 300 wind machines, with a capacity of 100 megawatts, on the south shore of the St. Laurence River in the next two years, a $110 million project. The wind will produce as much energy as 30 megawatts of hydroelectric capacity -- enough to power 15,000 houses, the utility says, and up to 40 megawatts on windy days in the winter, when demand is highest.

HEADLINE: Looking at the Markets;
With Future Bright, Stocks and Bonds Fall; Economists Grapple With Contradictions

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
For more than three years stock and bond prices marched optimistically upward in spite of economic forecasts that varied from murky to guarded. But once the clouds lifted to reveal a sunny future for the American economy, the securities markets took their worst dive since the recession of 1990.
Economists have a plausible explanation -- fear of inflation -- for this seeming paradox, but they have had a lot more trouble explaining the timing or depth of the mini-crash that jolted public confidence and left traders scrambling for portents of the aftershocks. 
 Indeed, economists are once again grappling uneasily with the contradiction between their textbook image of securities markets as well-oiled machines for grinding new information into prices -- sometimes referred to as "efficient markets" -- and the reality of securities traders who seem to stampede as mindlessly as groupies at a rock concert.
"We just don't understand the social psychology of financial markets," said Richard Thaler, an economist at Cornell.
The part that is well understood is that in a rational world, good news for the economy can be bad news for traded securities.
The price of a bond is inherently sensitive to changes -- or expectations of changes -- in the interest rates charged on freshly minted i.o.u.'s. So when the economy showed signs of heating up and the Federal Reserve tweaked interest rates in what was advertised as a pre-emptive strike against inflation, it is at least plausible that bond prices fell in anticipation of more interest rate increases down the pike.
Why stocks get jarred is trickier (but still possible) to rationalize. For one thing, said Burton Malkiel, an economist at Princeton, inflation raises the effective tax rate on corporate earnings because the tax laws do not take into account the fact that corporations incur the heavy burden of replacing worn-out capital equipment at higher cost. For another, periods of inflation often presage recession, and thus lower profits. So shifts in inflationary expectations could certainly lead to a sharp drop in stock prices.
This is hardly the whole story, however. While fear of inflation could explain why stock and bond prices tanked in tandem this winter, it doesn't say much about the timing or magnitude of the drop. Indeed, with hindsight, it is clear that the probability of an economic boom had been building for many months, as had talk that both stocks and bonds were due for a fall.
But if securities markets are really precision instruments for setting securities prices, why didn't they incorporate shifting opinions a little at a time, drifting down to a new level that fully incorporated the new expectations?
Mr. Thaler, for one, sees a possible answer in "herding" -- the notion that securities traders tend to act in concert, creating sharp breaks in securities prices rather than smooth adjustments. But, as he is happy to acknowledge, herding is more a description of what happens than an explanation for it.
One possibility is what Mr. Thaler calls "safety in numbers." Most decisions to trade securities these days are made by managers of mutual funds, pension plans and the like, who have a strong interest in not looking stupid when their competitors are looking smart. If, for example, a money manager buys when others are selling and the markets go down, he is likely to be out of a job.
On the other hand, it's almost O.K. to look stupid when everyone has also made a fool of himself. Hardly anyone blames a money manager who loses by doing just what the rest of the pack does.
 
How Keynes Saw It
 Another way of rationalizing herd behavior, offered by Jeremy Stein of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, draws on John Maynard Keynes's image of the stock market. Keynes likened the stock market to an unusual beauty contest that had been sponsored by his local newspaper. The pictures of a dozen women were displayed. But readers were asked to pick the one who they thought others would think prettiest, not the one they themselves thought prettiest. By analogy, Mr. Stein said, it is wrong to be right ahead of the pack -- to sell while others are still driving up prices, or to refrain from selling when everyone else is dumping stocks.
Yet another explanation for herding, one held dear by economists still wed to the idea that securities markets are efficient, is that actions speak louder than words -- that a lot of information is actually broadcast by the act of buying or selling.
Consider the last plunge in securities prices on the heels of the nudge by the Federal Reserve to interest rates and warning from its chairman, Alan Greenspan, that he had spotted inflation in his tea leaves. One might have expected an "efficient" market to anticipate the news and act accordingly. On the other hand, if the the major players in the market look to each other for confirmation of their suspicions, what looked like panic selling could have been a rational rush for the exits. And the rush could have been exacerbated by the need to unwind debts backed by falling stock values.
 
The Sheep's Perspective
 The trouble with herding hypotheses is that they do not begin to explain what investors and policy makers really want to know. It may be comforting to believe that herd behavior makes sense from the perspective of the sheep. But it doesn't provide a hint as to when the sheep will change direction, or how far they will stampede. Nor does history offer many clues, said William Schwert of the Simon Graduate School of Business at the University of Rochester.
According to Mr. Schwert, who has plotted the volatility of stocks over the last century, there are no discernible trends to be ferreted out. In spite of all the institutional changes over time -- the advent of securities regulation and standardized accounting procedures, the growth of professional money management, computerized trading, electronic distribution of business news -- the data on volatility show a monotonous squiggle of modest ups and downs, randomly punctuated by catastrophic breaks.
The last few months' market activity suggest no exception to the rule: Indeed, they are almost lost in the noise of history. "A lot of things that people think are important in explaining volatility probably aren't," Mr. Schwert concluded.
It is conceivable that market behavior is inherently "chaotic" in the sense that the timing and magnitude of market changes may be exquisitely sensitive to what natural scientists call "initial conditions."
 
Seemingly Random Dance
 Next month's weather will be no surprise in the sense that it will more or less follow from known rules of physics. But whether it rains or shines in Chicago next month, we now believe, may depend on effectively unknowable details of cloud and wind patterns this week halfway across the world. By the same token, it is conceivable that securities markets bounce from unstable equilibrium to unstable equilibrium within broad bands, in a seemingly random dance to the tune of simple responses of traders to each others' actions.
This would suggest that economists may someday understand what makes the stock market tick (the way meteorologists understand what makes weather), yet be forever precluded from accurately predicting the big bumps in stock indexes. Economists who study the securities markets, however, are not quite ready to stop worrying and learn to love chaos. Indeed, some believe that models of market behavior with predictive power may be within reach.
Robert Shiller of Yale is amassing data on how securities traders respond to other traders by asking them hypothetical questions. And some of the answers are provocative, if hard to interpret. For example, Mr. Shiller found that the percentage of professional money managers who believed that the stock market would go up the day after a 3 percent tumble fell from 34 percent in early 1990 to just 18 percent in mid-1990.
As yet, Mr. Shiller has no testable theory that would use surveys to predict trading behavior, but he is frustrated that social scientists are not more aggressively pursuing this approach. "Economists depend too much on what they observe" rather than what they could find out by asking, he laments.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Bear, Stearns Hires Former Fed Governor

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Bear, Stearns & Company, the Wall Street investment bank, said yesterday that it was appointing Wayne D. Angell, a former Federal Reserve governor and inflation hawk, as its chief economist.
Mr. Angell, 63, resigned from the Fed in early February after completing an eight-year term that included the stock market crash of 1987 as well as the beginning of the bond market meltdown of 1994. A fourth-generation Kansas wheat farmer, former banker and longtime economics professor at Ottawa University, a Baptist college in Ottawa, Kan., Mr. Angell is well known on Wall Street and in financial circles around the world. 
 He had been something of a gadfly at the Fed -- actively promoting his monetarist and supply-side views -- and has become a favorite of journalists, a popular speaker and a frequent contributor to opinion pages.
Mr. Angell is replacing another high-profile economist, Lawrence A. Kudlow, who resigned abruptly a little over a month ago and recently told journalists that he had been battling drug and alcohol addiction. Mr. Angell, a grandfather eight times over and a teetotaler, could scarcely be more different from Mr. Kudlow, a sophisticated baby boomer who grew up in the New York suburbs and attended Princeton University.
Senior managers at Bear, Stearns made it clear that they regarded Mr. Angell as a real catch. "He's got an incredible persona, he's highly respected, he's a hard money guy; there's no 'I'll tell you later' about him," said James Cayne, the firm's president. "It's not just a terrific hire, I'd call it a major step in building the franchise."
While Mr. Angell and Mr. Kudlow have markedly different backgrounds, they share a knack for getting attention, hold strong free-market views and exude brash self-confidence. Indeed, Mr. Kudlow had regarded Mr. Angell, the leading supply-sider in setting Fed policy, as something of a mentor.
"Wayne Angell follows perfectly in the Kudlow tradition," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, the securities firm. "He's well connected, he's in the same philosophical tradition and he states his opinions very clearly."
To the firm, Mr. Angell is someone with whom Bear, Stearns clients, traders and salespeople will feel comfortable. His name recognition in financial circles abroad is a plus, given the firm's strong push into emerging markets from Argentina to China. And the fact that he is a close friend -- not to mention frequent tennis partner -- of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, doesn't hurt either, especially at a time Wall Street is fixated on the Fed's next interest rate moves.
 
An Indelible Mark at the Fed
 The fact that Mr. Angell does not have a track record as a forecaster is less important, several analysts asserted, than the fact that he took a strong stand in a variety of disagreements with other members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. In the last year, as the Fed has kept interest rates low, Mr. Angell dissented four times, always urging the central bank to adopt a tighter policy of higher short-term interest rates than most of the rest of the committee wanted.
"He made an indelible mark on all of us," Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor and fellow anti-inflation hard-liner, said.
"I am much more attentive to commodity prices and price-level targeting than when I first became a governor," Mr. Lindsey added, referring to Mr. Angell's influence.
Bear, Stearns got in touch with virtually every big-name economist on Wall Street in an effort to fill Mr. Kudlow's shoes quickly. But once Mr. Angell -- whose name was put forward by an economist at the firm -- came on the scene, he had no serious rivals.
 
Not a Mouthpiece
 Mr. Angell, a former Kansas state legislator who once aspired to be a Republican senator, hit it off immediately with senior managers in his first meeting with them. "He was in New York to give a speech," Mr. Cayne said. "I asked him, 'How would you like to speak full time?' "
Mr. Angell had been planning to become a money manager, investing the resources of pension funds and other large institutional investors.
Asked what at Bear, Stearns appealed to him so much that he did not bother to look at other firms, he said, without missing a beat: "Right off the bat, I thought, 'Gee, these people are really very intelligent because they wanted me.' Wayne Angell isn't exactly the kind of person you go after if you want a mouthpiece."
Mr. Angell would not say how rich his compensation at Bear, Stearns would be, but senior managing directors, one of Mr. Angell's new titles, are thought to earn a base salary of $200,000. Bonuses generally run several times the base pay, and it is safe to say that Mr. Angell will be earning at least $1 million, if not more.
His new schedule will be grueling, requiring constant travel and frequent meetings with clients. But Mr. Angell, who rode 42 miles on his bicycle last weekend and often flies his own plane, says he has energy to spare.
Mr. Angell is not the first Fed official to try his hand on Wall Street. A former vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., recently joined a group of ex-Salomon traders at Long-Term Capital Management, and Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, is an investment banker at James D. Wolfensohn.

HEADLINE: U.S. Puts Sanctions On Taiwan

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration said today that it was imposing trade sanctions on Taiwan for refusing to halt the sale of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns, the first time that Washington has deployed trade sanctions to protect the environment.
While trade sanctions have often been used by the United States as a lever to promote human rights or to lower trade barriers imposed by other countries, they have never been used to protect endangered wildlife. 
 "I am delighted that the U.S. has taken the lead in this worldwide battle to save the rhinoceros and tiger before it is too late," Diana E. McMeekin, head of the African Wildlife Foundation, said. "It is as if the governor has issued a last-minute stay of execution for those magnificent creatures on the edge of extinction."
The sanctions on Taiwan will involve a ban on all Taiwan wildlife-product exports to the United States, which amount to about $25 million a year in coral and mollusk-shell jewelry and in snake, lizard and crocodile skin shoes and other leather products, the White House said.
This is a fraction of Taiwan's trade with the United States, which last year involved $25.1 billion in exports to the United States and $16.25 billion in American exports to Taiwan.
 
 
Underground Trade
 Tiger and rhinoceros parts are used by people in Taiwan and many other Asian nations for medicinal purposes, and because many people consider them sexual stimulants. Their use has become so widespread that an underground trade has developed and populations of both animals have been decimated.
"This is the first time any country has acted on the international call for trade sanctions to protect endangered species, but if the illegal trade in rhinos and tigers is not eliminated, these species could be extinct in five years," President Clinton said in a statement. "The world must know that the United States will take strong actions to protect the earth's natural heritage."
[In a statement released Tuesday in Taipei, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed "deep regret and dissatisfaction over the U.S. Government's obviously unfair and unjust sanction." Asked if Taiwan planned reprisals, a Government spokesman, Eric Chiang, said, "We haven't discussed any counteractions."]
The American move underscores the fact that as trade grows more global and as barriers between countries come down, the environmental consequences can be enormous. When advances in hunting techniques are combined with lower trade barriers and rapidly growing populations that demand medicines made from exotic wildlife, a species can be wiped out in one generation.
Tigers, commonplace in circuses and zoos around the world, will shortly be extinct in the wild if this trade is not stopped. At the turn of the century, the world tiger population was estimated at about 100,000; today, there are fewer than 6,000.
In 1970, there were more than 65,000 African black rhinos and today there are fewer than 1,800, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. There are only about 10,000 rhinos of all species left in the world.
It is a common practice in Asia to grind the bones of both animals for medicines and aphrodisiacs. Tiger and rhino parts are prescribed by doctors in Taiwan, China and Korea for fevers, arthritis and impotence.
The Administration's Interagency Rhino/Tiger Task Force, which recommended sanctions to the President last week, had been considering imposing sanctions on China as well. At the last minute it decided to act only against Taiwan, saying China had taken some limited steps to curb the sale of exotic-animal parts.
At a time when Chinese-American tensions are running high over human rights issues and Washington is considering revoking Beijing's preferential trade status, the Administration probably did not want to open a new front with the Chinese on wildlife -- even though the Chinese are considered by experts to be among the worst offenders.
Still, the move against Taiwan, argued the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, constitutes "a major step forward."
"Other administrations have threatened these kinds of measures to protect the environment before, but none has ever acted," he said.
The United States had warned Taiwan and China in November that it might impose trade sanctions if they did not demonstrate by March 30 "measurable, verifiable and substantial progress" in curbing illicit trade in tiger and rhino parts.
China took some steps, the most notable a public burning of tiger and rhino medicines, and made an effort to register stocks of those medicines and to educate people against their use. But Taiwan did little to satisfy American demands to safeguard rhinos and tigers, which are protected under the Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species.

HEADLINE: Bank Mutual Fund Saless Face Check

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
In a partial concession to Congressional critics, the Treasury Department announced today that its officials would begin making anonymous visits to banks to determine if bank officials were advising clients about the risks of putting their money into mutual funds.
At the same time, the Treasury, which is trying to maintain bureaucratic authority over the issue despite challenges in Congress, announced a plan that would effectively expand its oversight of bank's sales of such funds. The alternative would have been to hand this responsibility over to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a step opposed by banks but urged by some members of Congress who consider the S.E.C. better staffed and more independent. 
 The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance is scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday on whether to bring in the S.E.C. to oversee bank-managed mutual funds.
 
Warning on Insurance
 The goal of the Treasury Department's planned anonymous visits is to force banks that sell mutual funds to warn customers that these investments are not insured by the Federal Government, unlike certificates of deposit and other bank accounts.
If the checks find banks to be behaving improperly, the Treasury has the power to fine banks or even order them to stop selling mutual funds.
Banks won the legal right to sell mutual funds only a decade ago, but have only plunged heavily into the business in the last several years. With interest rates low in the early 1990's and the stock market growing strongly, many bank account holders switched into mutual funds and banks began selling the funds themselves to avoid losing these customers entirely.
An S.E.C. survey late last year of 1,000 households found that 66 percent believed erroneously that money market mutual funds sold through banks were Federally insured. The survey, released on Nov. 10, also found that 28 percent of the households believed that all mutual funds sold through banks were Federally insured. The S.E.C. also found that 36 percent of households thought that mutual funds purchased from a stockbroker were federally insured.
 
Checks Began in 1993
 Until now, the Treasury has contended that it could adequately oversee bank mutual fund sales through spot-checks by bank examiners. A Treasury agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, began making these checks late last year.
That stance has dissatisfied several influential members of Congress, who have introduced legislation to put the Securities and Exchange Commission in charge of overseeing bank-managed mutual funds.
John D. Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has led these criticisms, with support from prominent Republicans on the committee and from Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the committee's panel on telecommunications and finance.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, made two new proposals in a letter today to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the S.E.C.
 
Calls for Test on Sales
 He called for all five agencies to test bank sales practices. Leonora Cross, a spokeswoman for the Comptroller's office, said today that testing banks meant using anonymous visits.
The F.D.I.C. recently indicated that it would begin using anonymous visits. Ms. Cross said that the Comptroller's office planned to proceed with such visits regardless if any agencies other than the F.D.I.C. joined in.
Until now, the Comptroller's office has relied on reviewing bank sales pamphlets for mutual funds and checking banks' records of these saless, with some phone calls to mutual fund customers to ask whether they understood what they were buying.
"It is becoming increasingly clear to me, however, that we regulators also need to conduct testing in this area," Mr. Ludwig said.
 
Fear of Legal Issues
 The Federal Reserve Board has opposed the use of anonymous visits to test if banks engage in racial discrimination but has not taken a position regarding anonymous visits and mutual funds. Officials at the Office of Thrift Supervision declined to comment. The S.E.C. believes that anonymous visits raise legal issues that need further legal review, said Barry P. Barbash, the director of the division of investment management.
Mr. Ludwig also proposed an interagency task force that would involve each agency performing separate reviews of mutual funds operated by banks or savings and loans.
Mr. Markey, who wants the S.E.C. to play a greater role, warned that this approach might create a "hydra-headed regulatory monster.

Dollar Drops Against Yen On Fears of Trade Tension

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar finished sharply lower against the yen yesterday on the prospect of no early resolution to American and Japanese trade tensions.
The concerns were fueled largely by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's abrupt resignation in Tokyo on Friday. Despite assurances to the contrary from American officials, dealers said there was a growing perception that Mr. Hosokowa's departure would slow the pace of trade negotiations. 
 "The feeling is that with the political disarray in Japan, the Japanese are not going to take any actions in the near term to permit their current account surplus to decline," William Arnold, chief dealer at Chemical Bank, said.
American officials have argued strenuously for Japan to address its rising trade surplus with the United States by providing foreign products more access to the market.
Much of the dollar's decline against the yen occurred in overseas activity, with trading in New York relatively quiet by comparison.
The dollar was quoted at 103.48 Japanese yen late in New York, down from 105.26 yen on Friday. In Tokyo, it slipped to 104.48 yen, from 104.95 yen on Friday.
Dealers said they expected the dollar's weakness against the yen to continue, and some reckoned that the Bank of Japan might eventually be forced to intervene in the currency markets to halt the dollar's fall.
"The market is really going to test" the Bank of Japan, Stefan Carlsson, chief dealer at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken N.Y., said, "to see how committed they are to defend dollar-yen levels."
In late trading against other leading currencies, the dollar was little changed. Against the German mark, the dollar was quoted at 1.7130 marks in late New York trading, up fractionally from 1.7125 marks on Friday. Earlier in Europe, the dollar stood at 1.7075 marks, down slightly from 1.7125 on Friday.
While officials from the German Bundesbank are scheduled to discuss prospective monetary policy on Thursday, traders said the widespread expectation was for no change in official interest rates.
The British pound slipped to $1.4690 in late New York trading, from $1.4760 on Friday. In London, it closed at $1.4715, from $1.4760 on Friday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4430 Swiss francs, down from 1.4455; 5.8675 French francs, barely changed from 5.8633; 1.3870 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3834, and 1,628 Italian lire, down from 1,633.

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Mixed Ahead of Inflation Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday in moderate trading, as investors awaited new inflation data today and tomorrow.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 8/32 , to 884/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from prices, was 7.23 percent, down from 7.25 percent on Friday. Ahead of reports on producer and consumer prices investors and dealers sharply reduce their trading. 
 The Labor Department releases the Producer Price Index for March today. Economists surveyed by the Reuters news service expect the closely watched gauge of wholesale prices to show an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent over all and an increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in the core, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components.
In February, producer prices rose half a percentage point and one-tenth of a percent when food and energy were excluded. That was slightly higher than analysts had expected, and the market rallied.
 
Consumer Report Is Due
 Tomorrow the Government will release the Consumer Price Index for March, which is a monitor of price pressures at the consumer level. The index is expected to be up two-tenths of 1 percent over all and three-tenths of 1 percent in the core.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said that the market was also likely to pay attention this week to the monthly retail sales report tomorrow and capacity utilization on Friday.
"The retail will give us a good idea of consumer spending and a better line on the gross domestic product for the first quarter," Mr. Alexy said. "Both the retail and capacity numbers probably offer the most potential to surprise the market, so everyone is being careful not to get caught too far out of position."
Mr. Alexy said that the market might have become a little oversold on the long maturities, which might have accounted for their rebound in the afternoon, supported by lower commodity prices and gold.
 
Attention to Fed
 And the market continues to pay attention to comments by Federal Reserve officials. The president of the Federal Reserve bank in Dallas, Robert McTeer, told the Association of Private Enterprise yesterday that he saw the first-quarter gross domestic product growing at an annual rate of more than 3 percent and saw inflation "behaving well."
In the municipal market yesterday, many investors were reluctant to make purchases as long as there was still the possibility of higher interest rates. That is one reason municipal bond prices have been hammered over the last couple of months.
As a result, few issuers were in the market. The biggest deal yesterday was a $199 million sale by Harris County, Tex., through underwriters led by Dillon, Read & Company.
The general obligation revenue bonds were initially priced to yield a maximum of 6.40 percent for an issue due in 2020. For shorter-maturity bonds serials were priced to yield from 6 percent in 2008 to 6.30 percent in 2013. An issue due in 2016 was priced to yield 6.35 percent.
Underwriters said the financing included zero-coupon bonds, which make no quarterly interest payment, but if held to maturity yield from 5.70 percent in 2001 to 6.25 percent in 2007.
The issue is rated Aa by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by Standard & Poor's, expect for the zero coupons, which are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and are rated triple-A.
With the municipal market somewhat stablized, New York City priced a $250 million tax-exempt general obligation variable rate issue through J. P. Morgan Securities.
The debt issue has a 0.95 percent coupon and is offered with various maturity dates and at various prices, with a 10-year noncall provision. Underwriters report the issue is triple-A rated by Moody's and S.& P. because it is insured by Ambac, M.B.I.A. and the Financial Security Assurance.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction of new three- and six-month securities, the average discount rates were mixed. The discount rate for a three-month bill was 3.63 percent, down from 3.71 percent last week.
The rate for a six-month bill increased to 4.03 percent, from 4.02 percent last week and is the highest rate at auction since March 30, 1992, when it was 4.19 percent.
The following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.082	97.963	Discounted Rate	3.63%	4.03%	Coupon Yield	3.72%	4.17%	High Price	99.085	97.968	Discounted Rate	3.62%	4.02%	Coupon Yield	3.70%	4.16%	Low Price	99.080	97.963	Discounted Rate	3.64%	4.03%	Coupon Yield	3.72%	4.17%	Accepted at low price	10%	43%	Total applied for	$57,185,081	$51,977,144	Accepted	$12,409,181	$12,201,791	Noncompetitive	$1,426,819	$1,072,383	
 
Both issues are dated April 14, 1994. The three-mon bills mature on July 14, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 13, 1994.

HEADLINE: New York City Drawing Fewer In Need of Aid

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
In the late 1980's, according to fresh census findings, the flow of welfare applicants into New York City all but dried up. In stark contrast to the experience of a decade earlier, New York City appears to have become a net exporter of welfare families.
Between 1985 and 1990, an analysis of newly released census results shows, more families left New York and signed up for public assistance elsewhere than arrived in the city and joined the welfare rolls. 
 It appears that New York City's severe recession of recent years prompted many poor families to seek better opportunities elsewhere. The exodus may have been pushed by an erosion in the city's welfare benefits as well.
In the latter half of the 1980's, about 815,000 people moved to New York City. But only a minute fraction -- 30,000 adults -- told census takers that they were on welfare in 1989.
By contrast, in the like five years a decade earlier, nine times as many newcomers turned to welfare. In the late 1970's, 625,000 people moved to New York City, nearly 200,000 fewer than in the late 1980's. But a far larger proportion of them -- more than 270,000 adults -- told 1980 census takers they were relying on welfare.
If, as some scholars have argued, New York City's relatively generous welfare benefits were once an attraction, luring waves of poor people from the South, from Puerto Rico and from elsewhere in the United States, they are no longer.
"A major reversal has occurred in a historic trend," said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who conducted a computer analysis of fresh data from the 1990 census for The New York Times. "New York is no longer a welfare magnet." He said the migration trends found by the census probably continued into the 1990's.
The census results suggest that people who end up on welfare often are responding to the same allures as other people.
In the late 1980's, when New York City was in a severe recession, hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers moved away, mostly in search of better jobs. Their place was taken by hundreds of thousands of immigrants. Both of those flows -- the out-migration of New Yorkers and the great influx from abroad -- were mirrored in the welfare population.
For instance, during the late 1980's, half the newcomers who settled in New York and then collected public assistance came from outside the United States. Nearly as many new claimants to welfare emigrated from the former Soviet Union -- almost 5,000 -- as from all 49 states outside New York combined.
 
Shift Is Contrary To City's Image
 Charles R. Morris, who wrote "The Cost of Good Intentions -- New York City and the Liberal Experiment" (Norton, 1980), agreed that the shift is "completely contrary to the image." He suggested that New York City lost some allure because welfare grants did not keep pace with inflation and it became harder to survive.
"People were acting rationally and going elsewhere on the basis of an economic judgment," he said.
Not everyone agrees that New York was ever a "welfare magnet." Mitchell I. Ginsberg, who served as welfare commissioner in John V. Lindsay's administration, which saw a huge expansion of the rolls in the late 1960's and early 1970's, contends that many people were drawn here by job prospects, not higher benefits.
"In our experience, overwhelmingly, two things stood out," said Professor Ginsberg, dean emeritus of the Columbia University School of Social Work. "One is that people came for jobs and then couldn't make it. And secondly, they came because other family members here preceded them. They found their relatives, but they didn't find work."
Dr. James R. Dumpson, the city's Human Resources Administrator during the administration of Abraham D. Beame in the mid-1970's, recalled that by the 1980's, people were going to other "places of choice" because eligibility rules had generally become less stringent. Federal courts had ruled by 1970 that states could not deny public assistance to new residents, perhaps prompting an influx into New York, where benefits were still relatively high.
Among those who left the city in the 1980's and had to turn to welfare, about one in three were still living in the New York region. Two in three went elsewhere in the United States.
The computer analysis of the 1990 census results also found that the new New Yorkers who claimed public assistance defied durable stereotypes of poor blacks from rural states like South Carolina or semiliterate cane-cutters from Puerto Rico.
According to the 1990 census, more newcomers who landed on welfare came from New Hampshire, where applications for public assistance and food stamps soared in the late 1980's, than from South Carolina. Fewer than 200 natives of New Hampshire migrated to New York City, but nearly half of them were receiving welfare benefits.
A decade earlier, more than two-thirds of the 272,000 people who came to New York City and ended up on welfare were black or Hispanic, and the vast majority of the new New Yorkers came from elsewhere in the United States.
By contrast, in the late 1980's twice as many Puerto Rican families left New York and collected welfare elsewhere as came into the city. More black families moved out and then received public assistance elsewhere than came to the city and collected welfare.
One in four recent immigrants born in the former Soviet Union were on welfare when the census was taken. They accounted for nearly one in five of the adults, often accompanied by children, who moved to New York between 1985 and 1990 and were collecting public assistance in their adopted city.
Beyond the golden door pried open by glasnost, many Soviet emigres discovered that the streets were paved only with glasphalt. A surprise detour on the road to riches often led to the city's cavernous Fort Greene Income Support Center in Brooklyn.
"I don't think they come here with the intention of being on public assistance for life, but they know exactly what's coming to them," said Robin Berg, the assistant office manager at the Fort Greene center.
 
A Modest Factor In Picking New York
 Wherever people came from, though, welfare was at most a modest factor in prompting them to move to New York during the late 1980's. Altogether, roughly 4 percent of the new arrivals turned to city government for public assistance. That proportion mirrored the national figures for welfare. The 1990 census found that across the nation 3.3 percent of the native-born population and 4.4 percent of the foreign-born were receiving welfare. That consistency indicates that people did not flock to New York City to collect more generous benefits.
The recent newcomers were also a modest factor in the city's welfare equation. They made up only about 3 percent of the million or more New Yorkers who depend on welfare. That finding corroborates a study late last year that suggested that the city's dependent population is largely home-grown or has been in New York long enough to put down roots.
Who goes on public assistance and where they migrate are questions with broad national implications. The answers affect national debates about tightening welfare eligibility, restricting the access of immigrants to welfare or requiring the Federal Government to help pay the cost of welfare benefits for immigrants.
"In Washington there is hot and heavy debate going on about taking money from immigrants to fund the Administration's version of welfare reform," said Dr. Richard P. Nathan, provost of the Rockefeller School of Government at the State University of New York in Albany.
In his successful 1992 campaign, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, maintained that New York had been transformed into a "welfare Cadillac" and proposed that benefits be reduced for recent migrants.
A survey by the American Public Welfare Association found that the maximum monthly welfare grant -- $573 for a family of three in New York last year -- was higher in only six states.
 
Short-Term Bridge To a New Culture
 For many, in particular for the immigrants from the former Soviet Union, welfare has become a short-term bridge to a culture where getting established is not easy. Typically, they are supported by relatives or by American philanthropic agencies for a few months or more. Because they lack proficiency in English and do not have American degrees or licenses to practice their professions, they eagerly enroll in college, where they can often continue to receive welfare benefits, or they leave welfare to accept jobs for which they are overqualified.
Some people worry about welfare undercutting the immigrants' characteristic eagerness to become self-reliant, and they fear that many remain on public assistance largely to get Medicaid.
"Russians as a group may not be as vulnerable," Dr. Nathan acknowledged, "but it still makes me nervous when people get too close to the welfare culture, and their transition may not happen or may be deferred. It would be better to have a health care system where you don't have to get caught up in a welfare trap."
Oleg Sokolov, a 50-year-old immigrant from Ukraine, personifies the flow of Soviet immigrants who may remain on welfare several years while they go to school, look for work and try to match their professional skills to American licensing standards.
Mr. Sokolov, who received a master's degree in engineering and a doctorate in radiology in the Soviet Union, was on welfare for 11 months until he landed a job as an X-ray engineer in Connecticut two years ago. His wife and daughter remained in Rego Park, Queens.
"I had two, three, four hours of English every day, but language was maybe 5 percent of the problem," Mr. Sokolov recalled. "You have to first observe the life and absorb it, from how to sit on the chair to how to make coffee."
As refugees, immigrants coming from the former Soviet Union, among others, are immediately eligible for public assistance. Legal immigrants may receive welfare benefits; illegal immigrants do not qualify.
The migration patterns emerged from an analysis of recently released details from the 1990 census, conducted by Dr. Beveridge, who directs the Program of Applied Social Research at Queens College of the City University of New York.
These census findings were extrapolated from a questionnaire administered to about 1 household in 20. Among other things, it asked whether the household had moved during those five years and whether it was on welfare in 1989.
 
A Net Outflow Of Welfare Families
 The census results leave some questions unanswered. They do not establish whether people were on welfare before they moved -- only that they were dependent on public assistance thereafter. But experts say it is highly likely that many were. So the upshot appears to be a net outflow of welfare households.
The net outflow of Puerto Rican families on welfare was remarkable, the city's Planning Department pronounced in a migration study last year, "given that it entailed a loss of New York City's public assistance benefits, which rank among the highest in the nation."
"There were fears that high public assistance benefits could induce migration to high-benefit states like New York and inhibit the migration of those already on public assistance," the Planning Department said. "Neither scenario was borne out during the 1980's."
From 1985 to 1990, the census data showed, welfare recipients represented one in five of all the adults who arrived from Puerto Rico. All told, 5,500 Puerto Rican-born adults who arrived from there in that period were on welfare in 1989. Still, for every household that arrived in New York from Puerto Rico and wound up on welfare, twice as many Puerto Rican households left the city and ended up on welfare somewhere else. Half of them went back to Puerto Rico.
"It kind of goes against some of the stereotypes," said Dr. Joseph Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's Population Division. "But when people speak about public assistance benefits being higher in New York, they forget that the cost of living here is also higher."
About 12,700 Hispanic adults, including the 5,500 Puerto Ricans, moved into the city and began receiving benefits. About 10,600 left and were collecting public assistance where they had relocated.
Among non-Hispanic whites, 9,300 who moved in claimed welfare benefits, and 6,400 who moved out collected them elsewhere. Among Asians, too, more newcomers were on welfare, 3,300, than the number who had moved away, 1,400. Among blacks, though, 7,300 newcomers said they received public assistance, compared with 10,600 who had left the city.
Since 1990, Dr. Salvo said, the greatest annual source of immigrants for New York, regardless of whether they went on welfare, has been the Dominican Republic, as it was in the 1980's. The Soviet Union moved to 2d place from 12th during the 1980's.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: NEWS ANALYSIS;
NATO's Balkan Gamble: Using Force Is the Best Way of Achieving Peace

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Crotia, April 11

 BODY:
In twice bombing Serbian positions around the Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the United States and its Western allies have wagered that force will bring the Serbs back to the negotiating table because force is the one thing Serbian soldiers in Bosnia understand.
It is a big gamble. Ever since the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, began whipping up Serbian nationalist sentiment in 1987 as a means to consolidate his power, Serbs have been fed an unrelenting diet of myth and history in which their warrior attributes, heroic struggles against the Ottoman Turks and the Nazis, and their capacity for martyrdom have been a constant theme. 
 The basic nationalist message is that Serbs never bow to pressure, and there is no more fervent believer than the commander of the Bosnian Serbs' army, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who ordered the recent onslaught on Gorazde. General Mladic, whose father was killed in 1945 fighting Nazi and Croatian fascist forces in Bosnia, is apparently driven by the conviction that only military might will save Bosnia's Serbian minority.
One American official said: "When we bomb, we are telling Mladic and the Serbs that their aggression will no longer be tolerated and we want them back at the negotiating table. But we have not even been able to see Mladic yet, and his aims remain hard to gauge."
 
Highly Centralized Army
 The nature of those aims are crucial. From a bunch of often undisciplined militias, the Serbian force in Bosnia has evolved in two years into a highly centralized army under General Mladic's command, Western diplomats say.
Thus, if General Mladic wants to prosecute the war, he has the means to do so.
"Milosevic surely wants peace because he wants to free Serbia from economic sanctions, but it's questionable that Milosevic can stop Mladic at this stage," said John R. Lampe, the director of East European studies at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. "General Mladic appears to be worried that the recently formed Muslim-Croat federation will eventually have the effect of freeing the Muslims to attack the Serbs."
Western diplomats say they believe that the Serbian military commander may also be worried by the prospect of a large United States troop deployment in Bosnia in the event of the peace settlement, the possibility of war crimes trials and the effect on his army's morale of any territorial concessions made to secure peace with Bosnia's Muslims and Croats. So he acted by blasting Gorazde.
 
Gorazde Settlement Is Key
 A United States special envoy, Charles Redman, has been talking to Mr. Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic. On the basis of these discussions, he reportedly felt until this weekend that an overall peace settlement bringing the Serbs into some loose association with the Muslim-Croatian federation was attainable.
But in a television interview today, Mr. Redman conceded that no progress would be possible until the situation in Gorazde is resolved through a cease-fire, the deployment there of United Nations troops and the withdrawal of Serbian forces -- a solution similar to the one now sustaining a tenuous peace in Sarajevo.
"We now have a difficult issue to deal with in Gorazde," Mr. Redman said. "That has to be settled first."
A spokesman for Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the region, said Mr. Akashi would travel to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale on Tuesday for talks with Dr. Karadzic aimed at securing a cease-fire in Gorazde. Only after that would broad peace talks resume.
This new caution clearly reflects the fact that Mr. Redman has been confronted in the Gorazde attack with the reality that undermined and frustrated previous intermediaries in the quest for a Balkan peace: The Serbs are quite capable of saying one thing and then doing another.
The question now is who is serious: Mr. Milosevic and Dr. Karadzic when they talk of their earnest desire for a just peace, or General Mladic when he speaks at Gorazde with howitzers and mortar shells?
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government says the Serbs remain fundamentally united in their commitment to the logic of war. Mr. Redman, who spoke today of his hopes of resuming negotiations soon, apparently thinks otherwise.
NATO has now backed Mr. Redman's efforts with a show of force. That, however, may not be enough to make a lasting impression on General Mladic, who likes to repeat a favorite phrase to reporters, "The Serbs will not roll over."

HEADLINE: Quake-Damaged Freeway Reopening Ahead of Time

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 11

 BODY:
Less than three months after an earthquake shut it down and more than two months ahead of schedule, the Santa Monica Freeway, aorta of this city's circulatory system, reopens on Tuesday. And if every public official claiming credit for the rapid repair stood on them at once, the two newly restored bridges over La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue might just collapse again.
On Tuesday morning, Vice President Gore will join Gov. Pete Wilson; Mayor Richard J. Riordan; the Federal Secretary of Transportation, Federico Pena; Rodney Slater, the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, and other officials for the reopening. "Every politician west of the Pecos and a few east of it will be in attendance," said Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Mr. Wilson. 
 The orange cones and other barriers that have tortured commuters since the Jan. 17 earthquake will disappear, and the rubber from the first of the 300,000 cars that use the freeway daily under normal seismological circumstances will hit the restored pavement. Today, as workmen swept and restriped the roadway, Mayor Riordan and Mr. Pena fought bumper-to-bumper traffic on parts of the road that never went down as they headed for a test drive on what just went up.
The reconstruction -- it cost $29.4 million, all from the Federal Government -- has been hailed as a rare example of what government can do when it really works. Spurring everyone on was the realization that in Los Angeles, where one radio station gives traffic updates every six minutes, political careers can ride on commuting time. To reopen the nation's busiest highway, money was no object -- particularly since it all came from Washington -- and bureaucratic niceties were secondary.
"Anyone who did even the slightest thing to become an obstacle would have paid for it dearly," said Joel Kotkin, a political analyst who has written extensively on California politics and the economy.
In the last few days, government officials have also been working against one another, trying either to bask in the project's success or to belittle it. The question here is how they ever finished the Santa Monica Freeway so quickly, and at what cost.
The contractor for the job, Clinton C. Myers of Rancho Cordova, Calif., nearly doubled his earnings by finishing the work 74 days ahead of schedule. His company, which was supposed to receive $14.9 million for finishing on time, got $200,000 for every day it beat the June 24 deadline.
To Mr. Wilson, the deal represented a sensible use of market incentives and a bargain to boot: his research office said Los Angeles and neighboring communities paid $1 million in extra commuting and delivery time for each day the highway was down. Mr. Wilson's critics, mostly Democrats -- he is a Republican -- say that the target date was pushed back deliberately to make the repair seem even more swift and that taxpayers in California and elsewhere were paying for electoral gamesmanship.
 
'Generous Time Line'
 "Either the Governor's transportation department is all incompetent and ought to be fired, or someone purposely set a very, very generous time line in order to come in early," State Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sylmar said over his car phone while driving on another freeway. "This was a manipulation of the process for maximum political benefit."
Mr. Pena said he had no reason to believe that the incentive system, which is being used in 20 states, had been abused in this case. Nevertheless, he said Federal officials would review the contract with the California Department of Transportation.
Four more bridges damaged in the earthquake, on two interchanges at Interstate 5 north of Los Angeles, are still to be repaired.
Politically speaking, Governor Wilson headed everyone off at the overpass. In a move that angered officials in Washington and Los Angeles alike, the Governor, embroiled in a re-election campaign with implications for 1996 Presidential politics, announced last Tuesday from the unfinished roadway that the freeway would open in six days. Less than 24 hours earlier, state transportation officials had told Mayor Riordan and Senator Dianne Feinstein that the project would not be completed for another three to five weeks.
"The Mayor was surprised; I was surprised," Mr. Pena said.
 
Cutting Through Red Tape
 Standing at a wooden lectern amid piles of pallets and mounds of dirt, and competing with the noise of heavy equipment, the Governor called the pace of the repair job "truly phenomenal." He said it had taken a 10h of the time it would normally have taken had he not cut through mounds of red tape by executive order. "I must say, I did that with great glee in this case," he said.
While Mr. Riordan later saluted "the Clinton team from Washington," the only Clinton Mr. Wilson mentioned either in his speech or in an accompanying press release was Clinton C. Myers, the burly, plain-spoken contractor whose 400 employees worked round the clock to complete the project.
Mr. Myers, the low bidder on the job, said that with higher overhead than expected, he would clear about $8 million from the project. He said he had pocketed enough of a premium to put a down payment on a larger airplane -- a Citation 3, he said -- if not to buy it outright.
Mr. Myers said taxpayers had got their money's worth from the new bridges. The concrete pillars on the new ones are larger, have bigger bases and have more and stronger steel than those that failed, exceeding the standards of existing bridges being retrofitted. They are also sunk twice as far into the ground as those that were damaged.
 
Contractor's Seismology
 "If they have another earthquake, and all of Los Angeles flattens out, these things will still be standing," he said. An earthquake like the one on Jan. 17, measuring 6.7 on the Richter Scale, he said, "wouldn't even rock" the new bridges, and that one measuring 9.0 "might not bother them either." He even offered a money-back guarantee.
Bruce Bolt, a retired seismologist at the University of California at Berkeley, was skeptical about the contractor's seismology. "It's a great challenge to build something to withstand Armageddon," he said.
Some critics say government officials failed to use the earthquake-induced hiatus to explore ways of weaning Angelenos off their freeways. Others lamented that the social leveling brought about by the earthquake -- when residents of the affluent West Side were forced to drive through poorer neighborhoods rather than fly past them at 70 miles an hour -- would surely prove ephemeral.
But others, including Robin Kramer, Mayor Riordan's deputy for communications and community affairs, seemed to equate the last few months to a coronary bypass operation, and the repair of the freeway as the replacement of vital valves.
"If you're on that freeway and you're lucky to have a convertible and the sun is shining and you're heading west, the freeway has a wonderful curve that goes just to the north," she said. "And as you round it, you see this incredible ocean and beach spread out before your eyes -- and you remember the reason that you're here."

HEADLINE: Benefit Funds May Run Out Of Cash Soon, Reports Warn

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
If Congress takes no action, the Clinton Administration said today, the Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money in seven years and a separate trust fund that pays benefits to disabled workers will be exhausted next year.
The estimates were part of reports on Social Security and Medicare finances that have to be submitted to Congress each year. Such reports are often gloomy, but the figures this year are, in some ways, slightly worse than those of recent years. 
 The Administration said there was a "high probability that the hospital insurance trust fund will be exhausted around the turn of the century." Looking to the future, the report added, "the Medicare program is not sustainable in its present form."
Medicare finances health care for 36 million people, at a cost of $143 billion in the last fiscal year.
The Administration said the Social Security trust fund that paid cash to disabled workers would be exhausted next year if Congress did not change the existing law. The Government is receiving record numbers of applications for disability benefits and approving them at a higher rate than in the past.
 
Proposal to Cut Retirement Fund
 The Administration said that problem could be solved, at least temporarily, by taking money earmarked for the Social Security retirement program and shifting it to the disability program. The trustees made a similar recommendation last year, but Congress did not act on it. The trustees said today that the need was "more urgent now."
Even without the change, the reports said, the trust fund for the retirement program will be exhausted in 2036, eight years sooner than predicted last year. People born in 1971 turn 65 in 2036.
Social Security paid $302 billion in benefits to 42 million people last year. As baby boomers age, the ratio of active workers to retirees will decrease, worsening the problems of Social Security and Medicare alike, the trustees said. But, they added, the hospital-insurance fund "is projected to become exhausted even before the major demographic shift begins to occur."
The outlooks for Medicare and Social Security were described in detailed reports from the trustees of the trust funds, including Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Dr. Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The reports, widely regarded as authoritative, were prepared by Government actuaries.
 
Specter of Political Trouble
 The bankruptcy of Medicare or Social Security is politically unthinkable. As in the past, Congress is likely to pass legislation to keep money flowing to elderly people, their doctors and hospitals.
But the trustees' reports show that the financing of Medicare, the biggest Federal health program, is shaky as Congress considers large programs to finance care for 39 million people who lack health insurance.
The Medicare hospital trust fund had a balance of $127.8 billion at the end of last year. Under current law, the trustees said, it is expected to decline to $100.9 billion at the end of 1998 and $40.4 billion in the year 2000 before it runs out of money in 2001.
"Medicare's financial condition," Dr. Shalala said, "would improve significantly as a result of general cost containment under the President's health-care-reform proposal." But some members of Congress, as well as the Congressional Budget Office, say the Administration has underestimated the cost of the Clinton proposal.
In a separate statement the two independent public trustees of the Medicare trust fund, who are not part of the Administration, said, "Current national health-reform proposals do not adequately address the serious long-range financial imbalance in the Medicare program."
In an interview, one trustee, Stanford G. Ross, a tax lawyer who was Social Security Commissioner in 1978 and 1979, said:
"The long-term deterioration in the Social Security retirement trust fund is a serious concern. When combined with the long-term financial imbalance in Medicare it suggests that we need to take a serious look at the long-term financing of these programs."
Medicare is growing much faster than Social Security. The trustees highlighted the difference by measuring the programs in relation to the economy as a whole. Social Security outlays equal 4.8 percent of the gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services. That share will rise to 6.9 percent in 75 years, the trustees said.
By contrast, they said, Medicare outlays, now 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product, will rise to 10.4 percent of G.D.P. after 75 years.
Mr. Ross and the other public trustee, David M. Walker, an expert on employee benefits at Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm, said people should worry about these problems now, when the solution is relatively painless.
"The changes that will be required can be relatively small and gradual if they are begun in the near future," they said in a joint statement. "However, the magnitude of those changes grows each year that action is delayed."
In a statement attached to the report, the chief actuary of the Medicare program, Roland E. King, expressed some concern about the trustees' estimates of growth in workers' earnings. He suggested that the estimates might be too optimistic. Medicare's hospital-insurance program is financed with a payroll tax on earnings.

HEADLINE: Struck Trucking Company Closes Business

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
One of the 22 trucking companies that the teamsters union struck last week went out of business today, leaving more than 2,000 employees, most of them teamsters, unemployed.
"The economic impact of the strike and the economic impact of increased costs once the strike is settled led us to the decision that we could not operate," said Kenneth F. Churchill, president of Churchill Truck Lines Inc. of Chillicothe, Mo. 
 Philip Young, president of Local 41 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in Kansas City, Mo., which represents 200 of the workers, said he doubted that the strike was at the root of the company's decision. "They've been indicating they were considering closing down for some time," Mr. Young said.
A teamsters' spokesman here, Bernie Mulligan, said the workers accepted a 10 percent pay cut last year to help Churchill reduce its costs. "We estimate that they had given back $3 million in wages," he said. "But that wasn't enough to overcome poor management decisions."
The company, which was established in 1926, operated 95 terminals in 26 states. It owns 2,300 trailers and 1,007 tractors that pull them. It employed 1,561 unionized workers and 560 nonunion workers, all of whom are losing their jobs and will not receive severance pay.
News of Churchill's closing came on the fifth day of a nationwide strike by 75,000 teamster drivers and loading-dock workers. The union and Trucking Management Inc., the bargaining consortium representing the struck companies, disagree over the companies' insistence on using part-time dock workers to reduce costs.
The workers handle most of the nation's freight that weighs 150 to 10,000 pounds per order. The trucks go door to door picking up shipments from customers and deliver them to terminals, where they are sorted for nationwide delivery.
Competition in the business has grown with Federal deregulation of trucking 14 years ago. Nonunion companies, which pay well below the teamsters' typical $17 hourly wage, have driven out many unionized companies, and the number of union jobs has plunged to about 110,000 from 300,000 in 1980.
Last Tuesday, on the eve of the strike, the fifth largest company in the consortium, Carolina Freight Carriers in Cherryville, N.C., broke with the bargaining group and agreed to go along with any settlement reached by negotiators. Consequently, the union permitted drivers to keep working.
Today, the union reported that another company, Preston Trucking in Preston, Md., broke with the consortium to negotiate its own contract.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Ron Brown Re-emerges in Halls of Power, and Thrives

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
During a breakfast meeting at which the Secretary of Commerce was communing with his senior staff last week, the topic drifted from Russia to Japan to China and then hovered, briefly, over his recent visit to the great state of Iowa.
The Secretary, Ronald Harmon Brown, a study of nervous energy even in repose, took a long, slow sip of coffee, brushed a wayward bit of doughnut from his elegant blue suit and then fixed his gaze on the woman who had arranged the trip. 
 "Iowa," he said with a deep sigh. "Uh, yeah, I-o-w-a."
It was a subtle reprimand for what Mr. Brown obviously saw as a 17-hour low point. He quickly moved on. But later, when he rose to get another cup of coffee, he stopped to make amends, sharing a laugh and a warm moment.
 
A Definite Style
 The sum of Ron Brown's style could be printed on an index card: Maximize your time. Focus on your goals. Know who runs what. See them. Make your point. Don't linger. Never look back.
Mr. Brown, 52, has never looked back. Nor has he had to. A quintessential operator with a perfect pitch for power plays, he remade the Democratic Party as its chairman and then stepped easily into the Clinton Administration, accepting a department that had long been a low-watt bulb within the Cabinet.
He seemed perfectly situated to remake a lumbering bureaucracy with 36,000 employees and a $3.5 billion budget into an aggressive element of an Administration sworn to deliver on its most famous campaign line: "It's the economy, stupid." Mr. Brown floated through his Senate confirmation and several early missteps with hardly a scratch.
But then he took a difficult detour that seemed to threaten both his reputation and his future.
Shortly after Mr. Brown's confirmation, field agents from a Miami office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a criminal investigation into accusations that he had accepted a $700,000 bribe from a representative of the Vietnamese Government in exchange for arm twisting to liberalize American trade policy toward Vietnam.
Centered on accusations by Ly Thanh Binh, a Vietnamese businessman living in Florida, the investigation dragged on for months, moving in and out of the headlines. It gained new force with conflicting reports from the Commerce Department over whether the Secretary had met with the man who was supposed to have arranged the bribe, Nguyen Van Hao, another Vietnamese expatriate in Florida. Mr. Brown finally admitted that he had met with Mr. Hao three times, but he denied any wrongdoing.
In February, the Justice Department agreed. Concluding that Mr. Brown had not misused his position, it closed the investigation.
 
Back in Play
 Now Mr. Brown is back. While other Administration officials duck over the Whitewater matter, the Commerce Secretary has been winning extravagant praise. In short order he has produced the apparent oxymoron of a Democratic Administration that is good at doing business with big business.
After playing an important role pushing through the North American Trade Agreement, he won kudos for his deft maneuvering to win a $6 billion passenger jet deal for the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in Saudi Arabia; for persuading Russian officials to drop a threatened 50 percent tariff on imported aircraft, and for pushing those same officials to reduce a $5-a-barrel oil tax that would have hampered or killed pending deals with American oil giants like Texaco.
Fresh from those successes, and now huddling with President Clinton on classified negotiations over issues like international patent law and China's trade status, Mr. Brown is secure enough to let a reporter trail him in even some of the more private meetings of his day.
And he is, again, where he is most comfortable: dead center in the power circle, sipping cocktails with world leaders. In Russia last month, he met with President Boris N. Yeltsin. In South Africa, on an earlier trip, he met with President F. W. DeKlerk, Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi.
It is precisely that ability to play in the symphonies of power that has been both Mr. Brown's strength and his Achilles heel. In a career marked both by astonishing success and persistent suspicions, his style and substance always raise the same questions.
Detractors say Mr. Brown exemplifies the slippery slope of Washington politics that the Democrats once railed against. His strength, by his own admission, is in his contacts and his familiarity with the strange ether of this capital. Critics, though few will speak on record, say he is a master of insider dealing and quiet profit taking.
 
Praise and Criticism
 A former partner in the powerful Washington law firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow, Mr. Brown retired last year with a $1 million golden handshake but retains a web of ties that have left lingering questions about mixing business with government. He is sure-footed, wealthy, subtle and elusive.
Many longtime Washingtonians see nothing wrong with that. "You can't fault people for being savvy, smart and well-connected," said Anne Wexler, a Deputy Secretary of Commerce under President Jimmy Carter. "Ron Brown does very well with everything he is given."
Others are much less charitable. "The long and short of it is that he is an operator," said Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity and one of the few Washington insiders willing to question the Secretary on the record. "He knows everybody. And they need him."
In 1992 Mr. Lewis raised conflict-of-interest questions about Mr. Brown, who was then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a report titled "Private Parties: Political party leadership in Washington's mercenary culture." It did not include a smoking gun, just smoke.
Mr. Lewis praises Mr. Brown for competence but says the landscape that the Secretary knows best is a quicksand of interconnections. "He knows the game," Mr. Lewis said. "And he knows where the edges are. And he is willing to walk right up to the edge. To the absolute edge."
That, of course, is not illegal. Yet some who have questioned the connections have learned first hand one way in which Mr. Brown may use his power.
Before the publication of his report, Mr. Lewis said, he got a call from a union leader on the center's board. After praising Mr. Lewis's work, the leader said he had received a call from Mr. Brown and asked Mr. Lewis to hold the report until after the Presidential election because of its criticism of Mr. Brown.
Mr. Lewis, a former producer of the CBS News program "60 Minutes," refused. The labor leader withdrew from the center's board and canceled his financial commitment to the fledgling research organization. Within a month, Mr. Lewis said, "half the labor money dried up."
Other critics cite a general uneasiness with Mr. Brown's style, but give no examples. On the other hand, to a person, friends and longtime colleagues speak with respect that borders on reverence. Many friends say Mr. Brown has been subjected to a double standard because he is a black man in what has always been a white man's job. They say he is always underestimated, and then when he does what everyone said he could not do, which is to take an inside track, he is condemned.
 
Seeking a Party Post
 That was particularly true, they say, in his passage through the Democratic National Committee. When Mr. Brown, who had made his mark steering Jesse Jackson's 1988 Presidential campaign and rising through the ranks of the National Urban League, announced in the fall of 1988 that he intended to run for Democratic chairman he created a storm inside a party that seemed to be energetically crafting its own obituary. He had to fight hard, enlisting the support of old friends like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo (one of his law professors at St. Johns University), Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Senator Bill Bradley.
Alexis M. Herman, a friend from the Jackson campaign and now an assistant to the President, remembers the rawness of that fight. Critics complained, she said, that Mr. Brown could not get Jewish money and support because of his links to Mr. Jackson. They also argued, she said, that he could not attract big business to the party and would alienate conservative whites.
None of that proved true. Instead, Mr. Brown so deftly worked the sidelines that every other candidate for the chairmanship pulled out.
 
'A Tough Town'
 Seated in his elegant office one afternoon last week, Mr. Brown looked back at the trials of his last year and said they had made him grow.
"There are a lot of people out there who maybe feel I haven't needed them," he said. "Maybe I should have spent more time being loved. This is a tough town that way."
Yet Mr. Brown is loved in the way that only Washington can love. James Hackney, a friend of 20 years and Mr. Brown's counselor at Commerce, said Mr. Brown has "from 15,000 to 16,000 friends" if that can be measured by the people who call Mr. Hackney and identify themselves as such.
That smoothness started early, as Mr. Brown was growing up in Harlem and coming into contact with intellectuals, artists, politicians and other members of the black elite. "There was always something different about him," said his wife of 31 years, Alma Arrington Brown. "He was more mature than the other boys, and sure of himself."
And even then, he didn't waste much time. After his first date with Alma Arrington, Mr. Brown fell sound asleep in the car ride from Greenwich Village back to her home to Brooklyn.
It hardly seemed like a good sign. But as soon as he woke up, she said, he started planning their next date.
 
Trying the 'Political Hat'
 He still plans, though he denies it. At an afternoon meeting with several hundred staff members at the Commerce Department on Wednesday, between a meeting with Vice President Al Gore, private talks with Egyptian officials, a reception at the Willard Hotel and a trip to Los Angeles, a clearly relaxed Ron Brown took questions.
Easily fielding queries from salaries to foreign policy, he smiled when asked about the toll the Whitewater matter was taking next door at the White House.
"Now," he said. "You are asking me to put on my political hat. And it almost doesn't fit me any more."
For a moment, the room fell silent. Then, like a storm gathering just beyond the horizon, the sound of laughter started until it crashed about like thunder. For a moment, Mr. Brown looked taken aback. Then, he leaned way back and started laughing, too.

HEADLINE: For a Hot Mutual Fund, Hard Issues

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Thomas H. Bailey, the iconoclastic founder and chairman of the Janus Capital Corporation, a hot stock-picking mutual fund boutique, leads an enviable life. Three days a week, he works out of his Aspen office, right near the ski slopes. As the stock market began its nail-biting slide just before Easter, Mr. Bailey, a trim 56-year-old, was out-of-pocket on a sailboat in the Caribbean. Oh yes, and last year, he took home more than $9 million in salary and dividends.
But behind this seemingly effortless approach to money-making, lies a mutual fund company that after years of living a charmed life now faces some hard issues. The eye-popping returns of its flagship funds, particularly the $9.5 billion Janus Fund, have turned dismal of late. The rush of money that came into Janus chasing these returns has slowed. And where Janus and its top executives were once touted on the cover of investment publications, the $22 billion fund group is coming under criticism for growing too far too fast. 
 "Growth snuck up on Janus," said Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar, a mutual-funds research company. "They were picking stocks in relative obscurity in Denver and then they had an explosion in assets and interest. Incredible money poured in. But their performance hasn't been as good since. The tail wind that was helping them has now turned into a head wind."
Now some of the strategic decisions Janus made during the mid-1980's are raising troubling questions about how well Janus is prepared to face the future, particularly if the equity markets that gave it such impetus continue to be rough. Clearly Janus has walked a different path than most mutual fund companies. "We're a different kind of organization," said Mr. Bailey, who came to an interview dressed more for mountain climbing than for business.
Janus is a creation of Mr. Bailey and reflects his conservative, iconoclastic bent. Where funds of similar size have more than 2,000 employees, Janus makes do with just 700 people. Where many fund companies have a depth of investment managers on the bench, Janus has just two stars. And where other fund companies live and die by their own bottom line, Janus is fortunate to have the deep pockets of Kansas City Southern Industries, a railroad conglomerate that owns 81 percent of Janus.
But now this conservative bent means Janus has little else but equity funds to offer at a time when stocks are falling. Janus has been slow in getting into fixed income funds, and its array is skimpy by fund industry standards. Especially when markets are unsettled, having a broad array of investment options helps keeps investors from fleeing.
"Janus is several years behind in broadening its product line," said W. Gordon Synder, an executive vice president at the rival Twentieth Century Mutual Funds in Kansas City, Mo. At Fidelity Investments, Roger Servison, a managing director, agreed: "Janus's core issue is they don't have enough depth. There are not enough money managers. Can they become more than a hot equity house? Investment styles are not hot forever."
 
Beaten By Rival
 Where the company's flagship Janus Fund, a growth stock fund, once racked up annual returns of 46 percent (in 1989) and 43 percent (in 1991), it has lately underperformed its rivals and barely matched the Standard & Poor's 500 index, the benchmark of average. Since 1991, the Janus Fund has been consistently beaten by the rival Fidelity Magellan fund. This year, the Janus Fund has closed the quarter with a 2.6 percent loss, a full percentage worse than Magellan's quarterly showing.
As a result, the money flowing into Janus has slowed -- disconcerting in a business where the amount of assets under management determine how much a mutual fund company earns. Since January, for instance, net fund sales have slowed to less than a 1 percent quarterly increase. This compares with 200 percent net annual increases in the early 1990's when net sales came to $3 billion, $4 billion and $5 billion a year. What is more, two of Janus's larger funds, Janus Twenty and Janus Venture, have seen up to 10 percent of their money flee this year alone.
If these trends aren't troubling enough to Janus, they are also of concern to Kansas City Southern Industries, which bought its 81 percent stake for $16 million in 1984 to diversify into financial services. (Mr. Bailey remains a 17.5 percent owner of Janus with the rest owned by a few minor shareholders). The original sale netted Mr. Bailey $5 million, along with a stream of dividends from Janus since.
Last year, the Janus stake accounted for more than 40 percent of Kansas City Southern's earnings -- some $39 million. Since 1990, Janus has contributed a total of $28 million to the railroad's earnings. As a result, Kansas City Southern's stock doesn't trade like a transportation company, it trades like a financial services company -- in line with such mutual funds as T. Rowe Price and Dreyfus.
With so much of Kansas City Southern's income coming from Janus, the railroad is vulnerable to what happens when -- and if -- investors cool to Janus. "The question is how will they keep people from running out of Janus when the markets take a dive," said Elizabeth Fusco, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
 
Taking Money Out
 Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston, said, "A market correction will slow funds into Janus and that's a concern when Janus has been so profitable for the railroad." Since the recent break in stock prices, investors have been slowly taking money out of Janus equity funds. But, so far, it's "not a flurry," said Chrissy Snyder, a Janus spokeswoman.
The railroad's exposure to Janus's fluctuating performance has led to speculation that Kansas City Southern might consider spinning off Janus to a new owner. At current prices, Janus could fetch more than $700 million. But Landon H. Rowland, the railroad's chairman, doesn't seem so inclined. "It would be with great difficulty," he said.
Mr. Rowland sees Janus as part of a foray into financial services that began in the mid-1960's when it bought, and later sold, Kemper Financial Services, which is now being sought by General Electric. The railroad already owns DST Systems, a transfer agent for mutual fund companies, and it has an 18 percent stake in Berger Associates, another mutual fund company.
 
Long Term Is 'Favorable'
 "Financial services represent real growth and, while there are momentary highs and lows, the long-term secular trends are favorable," Mr. Rowland said. For now, Mr. Rowland says Janus "needs more diverse product offerings" and Mr. Bailey "has been alerted to that concern."
There had also been speculation that the railroad may buy a fixed-income operation and merge it with Janus. But Mr. Rowland said that was not on the table now -- although "something like that might pop out of the blue." Besides, anything the railroad does to change control at Janus must be approved by Janus investors -- and if Mr. Bailey and his crew leave, the fund investors may not approve. "They can sell only if they make me happy and make my boys happy," Mr. Bailey said.
 
Adding Bond Funds
 Back in Denver, however, Janus is taking steps to improve its showing. It is planning to add about one to three new bond funds a year, it has hired some new fund managers and reduced the workload on those managing the Janus Fund so it can be their top priority. It has also taken a defensive position to protect investors from a possible bear market by keeping high cash levels in the fund.
"My own sense is that these guys were just in the wrong stocks," said Michael Stolper, a San Diego mutual-fund-industry consultant who owns a small percentage of Janus. "It's not a problem that the funds have gotten too big. They just made some bad stock picks." For instance, one of its biggest holdings is Wal-Mart shares, which have fallen by 30 percent in the last 18 months.
Even James Craig, manager of the Janus Fund, says that times may favor Janus's style. "It's harder to discover companies with undiscovered earnings," Mr. Craig said. "The opportunities now are fewer. And if you look at last year, when stocks had 17 and 18 percent returns, you are not going to see that."
Janus's investment strategy reflects Mr. Bailey's belief in growth stocks -- by picking companies with growing earnings, a rising stock price will follow. (This contrasts with managers who pick stocks based on economic cycles, or hidden asset values or other strategies.)
Mr. Bailey's dislike also of spending money accounts for Janus's thin resources. While some might argue that by selling out in 1984 for a few million dollars, Mr. Bailey gave up hundreds of millions in future gains, he's happy. Psychologically, Mr. Bailey admits, he lacks the fortitude to have brought Janus to this level without the security of a corporate parent.
"Tom has a bear market mentality," Mr. Stolper said. "The firm wouldn't have grown to this size, or any fraction of it, without the railroad. Tom would not have bought a zillion dollars worth of computers or put 40 people on an 800 number. It's not his nature."
 
'Something Different'
 "The railroad allowed me to do something different," said Mr. Bailey, who would be interviewed only if his two top portfolio managers remained in the room with him. "I would have never been able to do it on my own. If I had just continued running money, I'd probably have one or two funds with, maybe, $500 million and that would be it. The railroad allowed me to take this and see what I could make of it."
Right now, Mr. Bailey is focused on protecting investors from a choppy market: "Everyday we come to work, trying to find stocks we think will go up. Performance can be streaky, but over the long term, we've done pretty well. The market could drop significantly and we at Janus will still be open for business."

HEADLINE: A Primer on Hedge Funds: Hush-Hush and for the Rich

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
If investment bankers and junk bond dealers were the popular Wall Street villains of the 1980's -- living lavishly on hundreds of millions of dollars of earnings -- managers of hedge funds are being cast as the suspicious characters of the 1990's.
There is almost no way that hedge funds would not arouse suspicion. They are, by law, secretive investment partnerships of rich people seeking to make a lot of money selling stocks short, using complex financial techniques and borrowing huge amounts of money for their investments -- things not usually available to ordinary investors. They tend to be managed by strong-willed, often-reclusive trading impresarios. 
 If that's not enough to create the presumption of some sort of conspiracy in the minds of people who do not have $1 million required for the minimum investment, hedge funds have been blamed for many of the recent traumatic events in world financial markets, including the collapse of Europe's plan for stable currency rates and the recent slide in the stock and bond markets.
Today the House Banking Committee, led by Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, will question the biggest hedge fund manager of them all, George Soros, whose Quantum Fund group controls more than $11 billion, as well as Ezra Zask, who runs a much smaller portfolio, and several financial market regulators.
"One hundred years ago, central bankers would have been concerned about a Morgan or a Rothschild, but you don't hear about those sort of people any more," said Greg Kipness, a former hedge fund manager who now heads proprietary trading at Jefferies & Company. "Today, it is George Soros, who has no particular power base other than the ability to move quickly with a lot of money."
While Mr. Soros is one of the most visible of the managers of this breed of fund, both because he is one of the biggest and most experienced managers and because of his extensive charitable activities in Eastern Europe, the industry has mushroomed in recent years as investors have sought higher profits in an era of low interest rates.
There are about 700 different hedge fund groups, each plying its own strategy for beating the markets. Most of these are relatively small, with assets of less than $200 million, and focus on buying and selling short American stocks. Short-selling is a way of betting that a stock price will fall. Some investors try to exploit technical discrepancies in the bond market, often by using mathematical models.
But the largest funds have moved beyond stocks to roam the world looking for opportunities, moving from stocks to bonds, currencies to commodities. Typically they borrow heavily, both from banks and brokerage firms, which increases their investing power but also their risks.
And their profits have verged on the spectacular, with many of the largest funds earning their investors more than a 50 percent return last year. Of course, some of their losses have been just as stunning, with many of the same funds losing half last year's gain in the last three months alone.
 
A Bad Bet on Yen
 Mr. Soros, for example, in March, acknowledged that he had taken a $600 million loss from a bad bet on the yen -- but since that only represents about 5 percent of his investments, he was able to shrug his shoulders and focus on his next moves.
But not all hedge funds are so well heeled. Askin Capital Management, a small hedge fund company that lost nearly all the $600 million it had under management in just two months in the mortgage markets recently, was forced out of business.
Despite the ever-present risks, the potential for big payoffs has helped hedge funds attract ever more investors, both among the affluent individuals who are their traditional customers and institutions like pension funds and charitable organizations. The Rockefeller Foundation, for example, last year allocated $130 million -- 5 percent of its assets -- among 10 hedge funds, in search of returns that are 6 to 10 percentage points higher than short-term Government bonds, said David White, Rockefeller's chief financial officer.
Investors like Rockefeller have helped hedge funds more than double their assets in the last year, to some $75 billion, from $35 billion a year earlier, according to E. Lee Hennessee, who advises clients on hedge fund investments for the Republic New York Securities Corporation. But while the number of funds has increased from only 100 in 1987, half the capital is controlled by the largest dozen or so fund groups.
The rapid growth has been driven in large part by the low short-term interest rates, which have led investors of all kinds to seek higher returns from more risky activities. Moreover, the low cost of borrowed money has made it much easier for hedge funds to borrow cheaply, using the leverage to increase their positions -- and their potential earnings.
 
Rush of New Funds
 The hedge fund boom has also been prompted by the rush of new fund managers, as mutual fund operators, Wall Street analysts and even academics have been lured by the money they can make by running a hedge fund. Typically, hedge managers receive a fee of 1 percent of a hedge fund's assets annually, plus 20 percent of the trading profits.
"It's a business which attracts a lot of entrepreneurs because it's easy to get into, and people can do very well very quickly if they have good performance," said Antoine Bernheim, who publishes the annual U.S. Offshore Funds Directory.
Of course, the reverse is also true. Even last year, which was the best of times for most hedge funds, 5 percent of the funds Mr. Bernheim tracks closed. But the hedge fund managers who succeed are among the most successful investors in the world.
"Hedge funds get you the brightest minds, the people who have the guts and believe that they are better than the pack," said the manager of one of the enterprises that funnel money into several different hedge funds.
They also have enormous self-confidence and tolerance for risk -- and do not shy away from portraying themselves as hungry animals. In a particularly telling interview, in Jack D. Schwager's 1992 book, "The New Market Wizards," Stanley Druckenmiller, the chief trader for George Soros, described the financier's philosophy: "Soros has taught me that when you have tremendous conviction to a trade, you have to go for the jugular. It takes courage to be a pig. It takes courage to ride a profit with huge leverage. As far as Soros is concerned, when you're right on something, you can't own enough."
 
Focusing on Three Issues
 This week, when Congress tries to look beyond the secrecy and greed, it will focus on three main issues.
Are consumers placed at undue risk by the existence of these funds and their operations? While customers can, indeed, lose large sums in hedge funds, the current limits on hedge funds probably keep all but the most sophisticated investors away.
Are the funds bad credit risks whose possible failure could create problems for the banks and brokerage firms that lend money to them? While lenders may indeed lose some money, many lenders say the risks for them are no larger than for other lending they do. And the worst casualty to date -- the failure of Askin Capital -- seems to have resulted in no more than about $25 million in losses for any one lender.
Do the funds, with their sheer size and leverage and ability to flit from one market to another, add to the instability in global financial markets, sharply increasing the instability?
This is the question that most disturbs central bankers and investors. Yet many other institutions including banks, insurance companies and pension funds trade in large size often with leverage. Moreover, it is unclear whether it is possible to restrict such disruptive trading and whether those restrictions would cause more problems than they solved.
When hedge funds got their start in the 1960's, the field consisted of a small coterie of managers whose main strategy was to buy some stocks and sell others short. These funds were considered hedged because their portfolios were split between stocks that would benefit if the market went up and the short positions, which would gain if stocks fell.
 
Shift to World Markets
 But during the last few years, the largest hedge funds, like those managed by Mr. Soros, Michael Steinhardt and Julian H. Robertson Jr., have departed from their traditional strategies and moved beyond American stocks to bet on broad global shifts in stock markets, currencies and interest rates. Increasingly, these funds bet on the overall direction of markets rather than simply picking stocks.
"One question hedge fund owners ask now is where is the hedging in the hedge funds," said William McBride of Lipper Analytical Services. Indeed, some old-timers complain that "hedge fund" is no longer an accurate term for the range of strategies in what they term "private investment partnerships."
The trading strategies of the large funds have evolved in part because of the opportunities recently in bond and currency markets and also because their funds have grown so big that it is difficult to make the returns they want simply from stocks.
The large global hedge funds have also been active users of derivatives, the rapidly growing category of financial techniques whose value is based on -- or derived from -- an underlying financial market. Derivatives like interest rate and currency swaps allow investors to bet on market moves with virtually no upfront cash.
Moreover, some hedge funds use derivatives as part of complex investment programs. For example, one very large hedge fund manager was said to be betting positions that the Japanese stock market was going down, but he worried that the one thing that would prompt that market to rise would be a drop in interest rates. So as protection, according to a big derivatives dealer, the manager bought options on the bond market that would pay off in cash if interest rates fell, compensating the fund for the expected losses on its short equity position.

HEADLINE: To Justify Flogging, Singapore Cites 'Chaos' on U.S. Streets

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, April 12

 BODY:
Defending the decision to flog an American teen-ager for vandalism, the Senior Minister of Singapore suggested in a television interview broadcast today that tough criminal laws had saved this wealthy, authoritarian city-state from the "chaos" found in the streets of the United States.
"The American society is the richest and most prosperous in the world, but it is hardly safe and peaceful," the official, Lee Kuan Yew, told an interviewer for the Government-controlled Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. "If you like it that way, that is your problem. But that is not the path we choose. They always talk about human rights. I think it is just a convenient slogan." 
 Mr. Lee's uncompromising remarks about the need for strict criminal laws in Singapore were more unwelcome news for Michael Fay, an 18-year-old Ohioan who was sentenced by the authorities here to six lashes with a cane after he confessed to spray-painting several cars and other acts of mischief.
 
Appeals for Clemency
 Mr. Fay has appealed for clemency. President Clinton has called the caning sentence "excessive" and has protested the punishment, which lacerates the skin, leaving permanent scars, and is so painful that prisoners typically go into shock. Yet public opinion polls in the United States suggest that Singapore's methods have broad support among Americans fed up with crime in their own neighborhoods.
Mr. Lee stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990 after 31 years in power, but his views are known to carry great weight among Government officials, presumably including President Ong Teng Cheong, who will review Mr. Fay's clemency appeal.
"Which is more important, the interests of the whole society or those of an individual?" Mr. Lee asked in the Chinese-language broadcast. "The majority of our people support the Government's efforts in protecting the interests of the society. This is the right thing to do."
Arguing that the Western concept of individual rights had been taken to extremes and had left the United States in a crisis, he catalogued a list of social ills that plague the United States but scarcely exist in Singapore -- street violence, homelessness, unemployment.
 
'Out of Control'
 "Just look at the problem of drug abuse," he said. "It has gone out of control. In Singapore, if your behavior is questionable and the police or officials suspect you are taking drugs, they can have your urine tested. If you are tested positive, you'll be dealt with. For three or four months, you will be kept away from drugs until you are rehabilitated."
"In the States, you will not be able to do anything like that" because of laws that limit government drug testing as an infringement of civil rights. "That's why the whole country is in chaos."
In Singapore, conviction for drug trafficking carries a mandatory death sentence.

HEADLINE: P.& G. Bet On Rates Turns Sour

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
The Procter & Gamble Company said yesterday that it would take a $102 million after-tax charge against its third-quarter earnings as a result of having been "badly burned" in two derivatives contracts.
The contracts, which soured as interest rates rose, were entered in hopes of "managing" its interest rate exposures, said Erik G. Nelson, senior vice president and chief financial officer at P.& G. 
 The loss was one of the largest reported by an American corporation on derivatives contracts, which are investments that are linked to, or derived from, an underlying financial market, like the market for currencies. Companies use them for various reasons, including the reduction of risk when they translate the earnings from their foreign subsidiaries to dollars.
While analysts who follow P.& G. did not find a $102 million charge to be catastrophic for a $30 billion company, they expressed concerns that the news could be a harbinger of problems among other companies that have taken positions in complex financial instruments.
 
A 'Bigger Story'
 "I think it's the tip of the iceberg," said Joseph H. Kozloff, a consumer products analyst at Smith Barney Shearson. "It's obviously an embarrassment for P.& G., and that's unfortunate. But the bigger story is, 'What the hell else is out there on corporations' balance sheets?' "
The chairman and chief executive of P.& G., Edwin L. Artzt, said in a statement last night that the company was considering legal action against the Bankers Trust New York Corporation, which designed the derivatives.
Meanwhile, however, P.& G.'s own treasurer has been put on "special assignment," the company said yesterday. Raymond D. Mains, who, until yesterday, was vice president and treasurer, has been replaced by Clayton C. Daley, who had been vice president and comptroller. A spokeswoman for the company would not comment on whether the news on Mr. Mains constituted a demotion; she would also not say whether any P.& G. executives had been dismissed.
Bankers Trust, in its own statement last night, said that it had entered into "a number of leveraged derivative transactions" with P.& G., several of which brought profits to its client. Further, the bank said, the two interest-rate swaps that led P.& G. to take the one-time charge against earnings had been entered into "after extensive discussion of the risks" with P.& G. executives, who "expressed a bullish view of U.S. and German interest rates" at the time the contracts were entered.
But those interest-rate bets turned out to be wrong, and, by Bankers Trust's account, the bank "strongly and formally recommended" that P.& G. begin getting out of the contracts when interest rates began to rise sharply in March. "Senior officials rejected these recommendations," Bankers Trust said in its statement.
Derivative instruments known as swaps amount to contracts in which two parties agree to exchange money based on the movement of an underlying market -- typically interest rates or currencies.
"For P.& G., a $100 million noncash write-off is basically irrelevant," Mr. Kozloff of Smith Barney said. "We're in a very volatile interest-rate environment and they got nailed. Whether it's Bankers Trust's fault or P.& G.'s fault, let them fight it out. You just wonder what else is out there."
He noted that other companies had increasingly attempted to hedge their interest rate, currency, and other exposures in the derivatives market, though he said it was anyone's guess how many other companies could be at risk.
In a telephone conference call with analysts and reporters, Mr. Nelson said P.& G. had entered into the contracts upon the suggestion of Bankers Trust. When it became clear that P.& G. was at increasing risk as a result of the swaps, "we had to close these down and take a one-time charge and put it behind us," Mr. Nelson said.
After taking the accounting charge against earnings this year, "the cash effect begins in the next year and continues on for five years," he added.
Both companies declined to say whether they had now severed their business ties. But the spokeswoman for P.& G. said the company still had relationships with other packagers of derivatives.

HEADLINE: Easier Arms-Maker Mergers Asked

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
A Federal panel of defense and antitrust experts recommended today that the Government reduce procedural obstacles to mergers of defense contractors, but did not propose the partial exemption from antitrust rules that some companies had sought.
The outcome represented a compromise between the Justice Department, which has opposed giving special consideration to armament builders, and the Defense Department, which has become increasingly interested in helping weapons makers cope with a steep drop in orders. The panel included a lawyer from each agency, as well as military-industry executives and academics. 
 Industry executives welcomed the report as making it easier to create mergers, but Justice and Defense Department officials were much more cautious, saying they were only trying to improve the process.
Bernard L. Schwartz, a panel member and the chairman and chief executive of the Loral Corporation, a defense electronics producer, said that while he had wanted a change in antitrust rules, he was satisfied with the outcome. "It defines the antitrust issues that both the industry and Government need to focus on," he said.
But Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, an antitrust advocate, was also satisfied. "This report assures American consumers that defense industry mergers will continue to get rigorous scrutiny and will be challenged if they are costly and anticompetitive," he said.
The panel's main recommendation was that the Defense Department designate one or two of its lawyers to provide advice to the Justice Department on mergers among military contractors, said Stephen Preston, the Pentagon's acting general counsel and a member of the panel. This would make it easier to advise both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission on such mergers, he said.
Paul G. Kaminski, chairman of the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon agency that advises on commercial and technology issues and that organized the panel that produced the report, said the study "concludes that competition among firms in the defense industry is significantly different from competition among firms in other sectors of the economy, but that the antitrust merger guidelines are flexible enough to take into consideration the special circumstances of downsizing in the defense industry."
In previous mergers, officials from different Pentagon agencies have sometimes taken conflicting positions on mergers. Anne Bingaman, the Justice Department's top antitrust official, remarked that "this gives us a number to call over at the Pentagon."
Officials differed on how much difference the report would make. Mary Lou Steptoe, director of the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of competition, said it would not have changed the outcome of 300 mergers that antitrust-enforcement authorities have looked at over the last 15 years, 297 of which were approved.
But Mr. Schwartz of Loral said it was more significant, producing closer relations between the Defense Department and the antitrust agencies.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
The Canadian Triangle Where High Tech Reigns

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WATERLOO, Ontario

 BODY:
Thirteen years after starting a company here in Canada's high-tech hub, a Waterloo University professor, J. Wesley Graham, and his 50 backers are some $100 million richer.
As head of the university's Computer Systems Group, Professor Graham founded the Watcom International Corporation to produce software he developed that makes it easier to learn computer programming. The software has been used by more than one million students worldwide. 
 Watcom, which offers a variety of specialized programming tools, was bought by the Powersoft Corporation of Burlington, Mass., early this year. The deal gives the professor and each of his backers, many of them former students who now work for Watcom, bundles of Powersoft shares worth about $2 million (United States).
 
Haven for Entrepreneurs
 Watcom is one of hundreds of fledgling companies that have emerged from Canada's main industrial incubation area, a pocket of college towns in Ontario that has become known as the Canadian Technology Triangle.
Three highways connecting Waterloo-Kitchener, Guelph and Cambridge form the rough triangle, which is an hour's drive west of Toronto.
In Waterloo, there is Waterloo University, which has 21,000 students and is strong in engineering and mathematics; Wilfred Laurier University, which has 6,000 students and a graduate business administration program ranked fifth in Canada by one Canadian business magazine survey, and Conestoga College, whose 9,500 students learn a variety of technical and management skills. Only 20 minutes away is the University of Guelph, which is regarded as a heavyweight in biological and agricultural sciences, with 12,000 students.
Immigrants from Germany and Central Europe settled the area in the 19th century. About half a million people live there today.
Canada is still largely a natural resource producer, and the long global recession curbed demand for its lumber, metals, and other commodities, contributing heavily to today's double-digit nationwide unemployment rate. But within the 100 square miles of the triangle, where knowledge is the only natural resource, unemployment is 7 percent, lowest in the nation.
The triangle did not go unscathed during the long recession. Shutdowns of the Labatt brewery, the Uniroyal Goodrich tire factory, the Seagram's distillery, metal-stamping plants and other heavy-duty manufacturing operations added up to a loss of 6,000 manufacturing jobs.
Yet the region generated 11,000 new jobs, said D. G. McKenzie, director of economic development for the city of Waterloo. Mr. McKenzie was one of those hit by economic change. He had been president of the local subsidiary of the Buffalo Forge Company, a position that he said, smiling at the euphemism, was "restructured."
Now at least 350 high-tech companies give the region its economic lift. Many are start-ups like Watcom, hatched from talk over beers at the pub or around the soft-drink and juice machines in university research labs.
 
Optimistic Outlook
 J. Alex Murray, dean of the school of business and economics at Wilfred Laurier, has been smiling over the region's prospects. His annual survey of regional business conditions found that 52 percent of companies that responded said they were financially better off than a year ago, and 66 percent expected their financial picture to improve in 1994.
As with Route 128 in Boston or the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, here the lines between industry and academia are often blurred.
Professor Graham of Watcom never gave up his teaching job. Now that his company has been sold, he is resigning as chairman to teach full time. "Nobody told me to," the 62-year-old academic said, "but I've arrived at a stage where I just felt it's better to let the younger people carry on."
Other entrepreneurs have retained their academic ties. Prof. Savvas G. Chamberlain started Dalsa Inc. 10 years ago to make high-performance image sensors for document scanning and other uses. He still runs the company today while teaching microelectronics at Waterloo's electrical and computer engineering department.
"Before 1984," said the 53-year-old professor, who was born in Cyprus, "I didn't know the difference between a balance sheet and an income statement, but I learned quickly."
Professor Chamberlain originally offered his technology to I.B.M. and then to Northern Telecom. Both companies turned it down because they did not regard the potential market as big enough. Now Dalsa, an acronym of his and a friend's names, employs 70 people and has revenue of more than $10 million a year.
The smudging of boundaries between office and classroom is enhanced by co-op programs, in which students spend alternate semesters working for local companies, usually in positions closely related to their field of study.
The programs extend the academic year to 12 months but are popular because the students earn wages, gain work experience and have job prospects upon graduation. The companies gain low-cost consultants and a skilled work force.
The American software giant the Microsoft Corporation has a close relationship with Waterloo University. Dr. Arthur J. Carty, dean of research at the university, said Microsoft snapped up more graduates from his institution than from any other university.
A team from Waterloo won the 18th International Collegiate Programming Contest in Phoenix in March, sponsored by the Association for Computer Machinery. Harvard was first last year.
Waterloo collects $2 million a year in royalties from technology born in its labs, Dean Carty said. The 106 companies it has spun off employ more than 2,130 people.
 
Nurturing Enterprises
 Each of the four institutions in the triangle has spawned entrepreneurs.
Dan Einwechter worked his way through Wilfred Laurier in the 1970's driving trucks. Now 39, he operates one of the biggest trucking companies in Canada, Challenger Motor Freight Inc. in Cambridge, which employs 700 people in North America.
Challenger is high-tech trucking. Football-sized satellite dishes are mounted on the top of the truck cabs. The system lets the head office know exactly where the trucks are and how long it takes them to reach their destinations. The drivers send and receive messages on laptop computer keyboards.
Another company, Langford Laboratories in Guelph, was born in the veterinary school of the University of Guelph. It developed a vaccine for bovine respiratory disease and is now the animal research arm of Cynamid Canada Inc.
Zepf Technologies Inc., another private company in Waterloo, is prospering as a designer, manufacturer and installer of automation equipment for packaging lines. It is run by a machinist, Larry Zepf, who is a graduate and benefactor of Conestoga College.
 
Fostering Innovation
 Innovation is the key to all the enterprises, said Gordon F. Cummer, who manages the Canadian Industrial Innovation Center. His center, formed in 1976 by Waterloo University, is now independent and assesses hundreds of inventions a year for their commercial potential.
"We're a very innovative people," Mr. Cummer said, alluding to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, Gideon Soundback's zipper and other inventions by Canadians, like basketball, five-pin bowling, table hockey, the Laser sailboat and Trivial Pursuit.
"When you have a relatively small country with a large geography," Mr. Cummer said, "it means you're constantly solving problems, whether you're a farmer trying to get grain harvested or a shipper trying to get something to market."

HEADLINE: Definitions of Financial Terms Involved

 BODY:
Hedge Fund: A flexible investment fund for rich people and institutions. The minimum investment is typically $1 million and the manager usually receives 20 percent of the profits. Hedge funds can use virtually any investment technique including short-selling -- borrowing shares and selling them in hopes of benefiting from a decline in prices -- and heavy borrowing, or leverage, neither of which is allowed for mutual funds.
Short-Selling: A way to bet that the price of a stock, or other security, will go down. A hedge fund would borrow the stock from a brokerage firm and sell it in the market, hoping to buy it back for a lower price and return it to its owner. Stocks bought the normal way are said to be owned "long." 
 Leverage: A way to amplify the potential gain or loss of an investment, usually by investing with borrowed money. For example, a fund with $100 of its own cash might borrow $900 -- making it "highly leveraged," allowing it to buy $1,000 in bonds. If the bonds rise by 10 percent, or $100, the fund would effectively earn a 100 percent return on its initial investment, far greater than the $10 it could have earned if it had used only its own cash to buy just $100 in bonds. Of course, if bond prices fall by 10 percent, the fund's entire investment would be wiped out after paying back its $900 loan.
Hedging: A strategy for protecting against financial risk by taking two positions that offset each other if prices change. Hedge funds originally tried to protect themselves by purchasing some stocks long and selling others short. If the stock market fell, the short positions would be worth more, but the long positions would lose money. If the market gained, the reverse would be true. The fund would make money, not because of the overall market movement, but because the stocks it bought long would do better relative to the ones it sold short. Today, not all hedge funds hedge.
Arbitrage: A form of hedged investment meant to capture slight differences in the prices between two securities that should be related. The classic example of arbitrage would be buying gold in London and selling it at a higher price in New York. Many hedge funds specialize in various forms of arbitrage, for example, in the relationship between the common stock and the preferred stock of the same company. Usually the price discrepancies are small, but the investment returns are amplified using leverage.
Derivatives: A broad class of transactions whose value is based on, or derived from, a financial market like stocks, interest rates or currencies. Hedge funds have become big user of derivatives to take large positions, either as outright investments or as hedges, quickly and secretly. Derivatives can also be a way of investing with leverage because many derivative transactions require little or no upfront cash payments.
Margin Calls: A demand for more collateral by a brokerage firm that has lent money to an investor. Investors are said to be taking a margin loan when they borrow money, but put up stocks or bonds as collateral. But when the value of those securities falls, the lender calls for more collateral to cover it if the borrower defaults. If the margin call is not met, the broker may sell the collateral he does hold to pay off the loans.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Challenges Doctors On Ordering Diagnostic Tests

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Doctors order many more diagnostic tests when they have a financial interest in the equipment and clinics that perform the tests, Congressional investigators said today.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said that doctors were three to five times as likely to order CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound procedures and other diagnostic imaging services when the equipment was owned by the doctors themselves or by groups with which they were affiliated. 
 The accounting office produced the report at the request of Representative Pete Stark of California, a California Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the first Congressional panel to take up proposals for restructuring the health care system.
On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, suggested today that work on health care legislation might not go as quickly as the Administration had hoped. Mr. Moynihan said his committee would continue holding hearings on health issues through mid-May and would probably not start writing a bill until some time in June, about a month later than planned.
 
Timetable Troubles Mitchell
 Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, the majority leader, expressed disappointment at the delay. "It had been my hope we could begin a little sooner than that," he said.
As part of any comprehensive legislation, Congress is considering proposals to tighten the limits on doctors' ability to profit from the referral of patients, an issue that has been debated for some time.
Congress has already prohibited doctors from sending Medicare patients to laboratories with which the doctors have financial relationships. On Jan. 1, 1995, the ban will be extended to cover these services under Medicare and Medicaid: physical therapy, radiology, home health services and hospital services.
But the law permits one doctor to refer patients to another one in the same group practice. In the last few years, some doctors have formed loose affiliations among themselves so they can call it a group practice. These "clinics without walls" have proliferated in Florida, California and other states as doctors try to avoid the ban on certain referrals.
 
Stark Cites Abuse
 The accounting office reviewed 2.4 million claims for imaging services. It did not try to determine whether the tests were medically necessary. But Mr. Stark said the data suggested that some doctors were "ripping off taxpayers" by ordering too many tests.
"The magnitude of over-ordering of tests by doctors who own an interest in an X-ray or M.R.I. practice is staggering," he said. "We are talking about billions of dollars of waste and abuse."
The American Medical Association declared in 1991 that it was unethical for a doctor to refer patients to clinics and other health-care businesses in which the doctor had a financial interest. But the application of this policy to specific cases is hotly debated.
 
Doing What Comes Naturally
 Kirk B. Johnson, senior vice president and general counsel of the association, said today that the data collected by the General Accounting Office were not surprising.
"If you have the equipment at your fingertips and you operate it yourself, you have complete confidence in the results, and you're more likely to use it," he said. "I'd rather go to a doctor who has his own machine and will feel free in a close case to use it. The economics of medicine are such that blatant overutilization is going to make a physician's practice uncompetitive."
With the spread of managed care and other techniques to control costs, Mr. Johnson said, "the real issue for patients is whether they will get the tests they need, not whether they are getting too many."
 
Hospitals Official Sees Harm
 At the Finance Committee hearing today, lobbyists for hospitals, doctors and the elderly said it would be disastrous to cut the growth of Medicare as much as President Clinton and authors of competing health plans have proposed.
Richard J. Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, said: "Hospitals are firm supporters of fundamental health care reform. But hospitals strongly disagree with the idea that Medicare reductions are a reasonable way to finance reform."
The cutbacks proposed by the Administration would harm the quality of care, forcing hospitals to lay off workers and postpone the purchase of new equipment, he said.
White House officials, by contrast, assert that hospitals could be much more productive and could save money by sharing costly new technology.
The Congressional Budget Office says the Clinton plan would cut the growth of Medicare by $103 billion, or 9 percent, from 1996 to the year 2000. Under these proposals, Mr. Davidson said, the Government would pay hospitals 71 cents on the dollar for Medicare patients, as against 88 cents today.

HEADLINE: Alvin Ward Vogtle Jr., 75, Dies; Led Big Power Supplier in South

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Alvin Ward Vogtle Jr., a former president and chairman of the Atlanta-based Southern Company, parent of one of the country's largest electric grids, died on Sunday at Rockdale Hospital in Conyers, Ga. He was 75 and had lived in Reddick, Fla., since his retirement in 1983.
The cause was apparently heart failure, the company said. 
 Mr. Vogtle led the holding company through a period of growth and challenges as its president and chief executive from 1969 to 1983 and as chairman and chief executive for the months remaining until he stepped down that fall. Among those challenges were the Arab oil embargo of the 1970's, a worldwide recession and inflation rates that drove up the cost of electric power.
Southern's operating divisions include Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power in Florida, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric.
A native of Birmingham, Ala., Mr. Vogtle graduated from Auburn University and the University of Alabama Law School. As a member of a Birmingham law firm, he became legal counsel and then president of the Southern Electric Generating Company, a Southern Company subsidiary.
 
Pilot in World War II
 He was elected a vice president of Alabama Power in 1962 and three years later took the same position at the parent company and Southern Company Services, another subsidiary.
Immediately after graduating from law school, Mr. Vogtle entered the Army. As an Army Air Force pilot in World War II, he flew more than 30 missions before crash-landing in North Africa.
Captured and sent to a prisoner of war camp in Germany, he made four unsuccessful escape attempts. On his fifth try, in 1943, he reached safety by scaling a 14-foot barbed-wire border fence and crossing the Rhine to Switzerland.
Mr. Vogtle is survived by his wife, Rachel Giles Vogtle; three daughters, Kathryn V. Humphrey of Durham, N.C., Anne M. Baldwin of Birmingham, and Rachel G. Vogtle of Gainesville, Fla; four sons, Alvin W. 3d, of Charlottesville, Va., Bryant W., of Charlotte, N.C., William P., of Ocala, Fla., and Robert J., of Gainesville, and four grandchildren.

The Economy
 Hedge funds have been vilified as the junk bonds of the 90's: they are being blamed for many of the recent traumatic events in world financial markets and their managers, like George Soros, have come under fire. But hedge funds -- funds for rich people and institutions that typically borrow huge amounts of money for their investments -- continue to attract investors. [Page A1.] 
 Producer prices rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in March as energy costs steadied. Although the report on inflation was reassuring, analysts predicted it would do little to dissuade the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates further. [D1.]
The Government should reduce some obstacles to mergers of defense contractors, a Federal panel recommended. [D2.]
 
Companies
 Procter & Gamble, as a result of losses on risky interest rate investments, plans to take a $102 million charge against earnings. The company said it was considering legal action against Bankers Trust, which was involved in a number of the transactions. [D1.]
What does Michael Ovitz want? That is the question being asked in Hollywood after the chairman of the Creative Artists Agency appeared to stir turmoil at two entertainment giants. [D1.]
Macy's senior creditors submitted their plan for reorganizing the retailer. Creditors, who were generally unhappy with Macy's plan for emerging from bankruptcy, are meeting with Cyrus R. Vance, the mediator appointed by the bankruptcy court. [D4.]
Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic announced an agreement that would give Delta its first toehold at Heathrow Airport. [D4.]
Motorola shares fell sharply for a second day. The company reported strong earnings that still disappointed Wall Street. [D4.]
Bank of New York reported a 33 percent gain in first-quarter earnings, helped by increased income from loans and fees. [D4.]
 
Business Technology
 Canada has its own Silicon Valley, a pocket of college towns in Ontario that has become known as the Canadian Technology Triangle. The area has spawned hundreds of fledgling companies in software, medicine and other technologies. [D1.]
Commerce has come to the global computer network known as the Internet. A new high-speed business-to-business network for those connected to the Internet was announced. [D5.]
International Germany's biggest real estate developer has disappeared, leaving his company and its creditors in the dark and possibly liable for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of debts. [D1.]
 
Markets
 Technology stocks fell sharply, dragged down by disappointment over Motorola's earnings. The overall market was down slightly in subdued trading as the Dow fell 7.14 points. [D6.]
Treasury prices gained after the Federal Reserve bought Government securities to increase banking system reserves. [D16.]
The dollar rose against most major currencies amid expectations that the German central bank would soon cut interest rates, making the mark less attractive. [D18.] Lumber prices surged after reports that improved weather across the country was increasing demand for wood. Cotton prices also gained. [D18.]

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Rise As Fed Buys Securities

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds gained yesterday after the Federal Reserve Bank bought Government securities to increase banking system reserves.
The Labor Department's report on producer prices, showing low wholesale inflation for March, also helped prices. The price of the bellwether 30-year bond rose 11/32 point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from prices, fell to 7.20 percent, from 7.23 percent on Monday. Prices of intermediate- and short-term maturities also gained. 
 The advance in prices, the fifth in six trading days, helped restore stability to a fragile market that until only recently had been buffeted by waves of selling by panicky investors.
"Trading is returning to more normal kinds of dynamics, said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis at First Chicago Capital Markets in Chicago. "We're likely to find we're in a trading range consolidation period."
But he added, "it's unlikely that all of a sudden the markets are going to say all is forgiven and rally back."
 
No Interest-Rate Rise Seen
 The central bank's purchase of Treasury securities, known as a coupon pass, had been expected and did not signal a further interest-rate increase by the Fed.
But the Fed's estimated $3 billion to $4 billion purchase gave a lift to the overall secondary market for government securities, Mr. Johnson said. The purchases raised bond prices, convincing others who anticipated further rises to buy as well.
Bond prices initially edged higher in early trading after the Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index rose two-tenths of 1 percent in March, continuing the trend of low inflation of the last year.
The slight increase was generally in line with expectations. But since inflation can erode the value of fixed-income securities, the data reassured investors that the Labor Department's report on consumer prices, due out today, would also show inflation remained subdued in March.
Another major economic release today is the Government's report on March retail sales. A strong increase in sales could indicate an acceleration in economic growth, which could aggravate inflation pressures.
Also supporting the market yesterday was the Johnson Redbook's weekly report, which showed retail sales dropped 9.5 percent in the first week of April from the March average.
"We're starting to get a little bit of a positive tone," said Nick Kinas, a government bond trader at the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York. "The jury's still out, but in the interim, the market is trying to regain its footing."
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.97, to 1,235.74.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.63 percent as the discount dropped 0.07 percentage point, to 3.56 percent, from the level at Monday's auction. Six-month yields fell to 4.10 percent as the discount fell 0.06 point, to 3.97 percent, from the auction. One-year yields fell to 4.64 percent as the discount lost 0.02 point, to 4.43 percent.
Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are sold.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 923/32 , up 11/16 from late Monday. The average yield to maturity was 6.31 percent, down from 6.40 percent.

HEADLINE: 4 Former Brookhaven Officials Indicted in Bribe Scheme

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, L.I., April 12

 BODY:
Four former officials of the Town of Brookhaven have been charged in a Federal indictment with accepting bribes of as much as $250,000 to support a prominent developer's real-estate projects.
The indictment, unsealed today, grew out of statements made in September 1992 in Federal court by John McNamara, a car dealer and Long Island developer who pleaded guilty at that time to bilking General Motors out of $436 million in loans by faking the export of tens of thousands of vans. 
 As part of his plea agreement, Mr. McNamara admitted bribing officials in the Brookhaven town government, and for months, residents of this town of 420,000 people and 326 square miles, the largest on Long Island, have waited to learn their identities.
In the 1980's, Brookhaven, with its vast expanses of open space, became something of a last frontier for developers, and the town's favorable attitude toward some of them led many residents to nickname the town "Crookhaven." Some civic leaders questioned why town officials approved the plans of developers like Mr. McNamara over the objections of homeowners who sought to preserve some of the last enclaves of pine barrens and meadows on Long Island.
Some residents hailed the indictment today as an important step toward ending the backroom deals they say characterized the town's government, though they questioned whether it had gone far enough. Law-enforcement officials said the investigation was continuing, with more indictments possible.
In a statement released this morning, Zachary Carter, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District, announced that Buovodantona (Anthony) Aliperti and Peter A. Sapienza, former members of the Town Planning Board, and Anthony Losquadro and Donald W. Zimmer, former members of the Town Board, had received kickbacks in cash, discounted cars, real estate commissions and jobs in return for supporting Mr. McNamara's development projects.
 
Shell Game Alleged
 Alan Vinegrad, the Assistant United States Attorney who supervised the investigation, said, "The payments by McNamara were motivated to insure that the defendants would act favorably on his real-estate projects." The defendants, who held office in the 1980's and left in the early 1990's, voted on Mr. McNamara's many projects during their terms.
In a separate indictment, the Government also charged Mr. Sapienza with assisting Mr. McNamara in his scheme to bilk General Motors.
According to court papers, Mr. Sapienza operated Kay Industries, a shell corporation owned by Mr. McNamara in Indianapolis, that apparently provided Mr. McNamara with false paperwork involving the purchase of tens of thousands of nonexistent vans and cars. This paperwork enabled Mr. McNamara to borrow more than $4 billion from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financing branch of the corporation, from 1989 to 1991.
Mr. McNamara then used that money to build a $400 million real-estate empire that included luxury town-house complexes and apartment buildings in Brookhaven, a golf course in Florida and a gold mine in Nevada.
Lawyers for Mr. Sapienza, Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Losquadro insisted that their clients were innocent and that Mr. McNamara was lying about their activities to save himself. Paul Gianelli, Mr. Aliperti's lawyer, did not return phone calls asking for comment.
In the court papers, Mr. Sapienza appears to be the biggest beneficiary of Mr. McNamara's payments, though all four men are accused of entering into a conspiracy to extort money from Mr. McNamara and his real estate and automobile companies.
 
Payments Listed
 Prosecutors said that Mr. Sapienza received $250,000 in cash payments from Mr. McNamara, and that he and another town official also were paid a $95,000 commission from Mr. McNamara's sale of land in Brookhaven shortly after the town had approved Mr. McNamara's request to rezone the property to allow more building.
The indictment also charges that Mr. Sapienza received $37,600 in kickbacks and more than $20,000 in home improvement work from the Crystal Brook Construction Corporation, a company not connected with Mr. McNamara.
The Brookhaven Town Supervisor, John LaMura, said today that he was disturbed by the indictments and that he had made reforms in the town government since taking over in 1992.
Some residents remain convinced that corruption persists. They point to Mr. Zimmer's being rehired by the town a few years ago as an executive assistant in the town's Economic Development Department and Mr. Losquadro's being given a job with the Suffolk County Off-Track Betting Corporation, as examples of how things have not changed.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up a Modest 0.2% in March

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
Prices paid to American producers increased a modest two-tenths of 1 percent in March as energy costs steadied after steep advances earlier in the year, the Labor Department reported today.
But while the eagerly awaited figures were seen by economists as fairly reassuring -- and did not unhinge the bond or stock markets -- analysts predicted that they would do little to dissuade the Federal Reserve Board from raising interest rates further to keep inflation in check. 
 "The Fed wants to see inflation trending down and this number's not pointing to that," said Carl J. Palash of MCM Moneywatch, a New York advisory firm.
When the volatile food and energy components are excluded, leaving the core rate of inflation, prices of finished goods rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994, compared with nine-tenths of 1 percent in the final 1993 quarter, today's report showed. This acceleration was paced by industrial equipment and consumer durable goods like cars.
Core inflation was calculated at two-tenths of 1 percent for March and a scant four-tenths of 1 percent for the latest 12 months.
The performance at earlier stages of production was mixed, with a jump in energy prices driving raw materials up 2.8 percent, the biggest increase since October 1990, soon after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
But analysts did not fret particularly about higher prices for raw materials -- excluding food and energy, they were up nine-tenths of 1 percent for the month and 10.9 percent for the year -- on the ground that commodities are a relatively small part of the cost of most products.
The biggest cost for most companies is labor, and this was subdued as companies offset moderately higher pay costs, 3.5 percent in each of the last two years, with aggressive increases in efficiency.
"Unit labor costs in manufacturing almost certainly declined again in the first quarter and will probably decline for the year," Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch & Company, told clients today. "That means companies can enjoy fatter profit margins even without raising prices."
Indeed, higher prices for raw materials like cotton have generally not filtered through even to the intermediate stage of production, which in this case would be a bolt of cloth.
Intermediate goods moved up just two-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as for finished goods, and are a mere seven-tenths of 1 percent higher over the last year.
 
More for Finished Goods
 "It's a long way from what these crude materials cost at one end of the pipeline to what the consumer pays at the end of the distribution chain," said Joseph R. Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg.
What he and other analysts did find a bit unnerving, however, was the predominance of increases in the finished-goods index, which is made up of items ready for sale to the individual or business user. Mr. Liro said that among the 74 product categories, goods rising two-tenths of 1 percent or more outnumbered goods that fell two-tenths or 1 percent or more by 40 to 14. The rest moved only slightly or were unchanged.
"I don't think we're on the cusp of a sharp acceleration," he said, but this imbalance could be reflecting faster industrial operating rates "spreading to more sectors."
On Wednesday, the Government is to publish its report on consumer prices for March, with forecasters expecting the index to rise two-tenths of 1 percent.
 
How Shrewd Was the Fed?
 Economists say it will probably be weeks, perhaps months, before data will show whether the Federal Reserve moved too soon, too late or just at the right time in beginning to raise interest rates on Feb. 4.
The Fed, seeking this time to head off inflation before it appears, has observed that waiting for the inflation gauges to register has meant waiting too long to act.
A major factor in the rise in finished goods last month was a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in food prices, reversing a February decline. The upturn mainly reflected a 9.8 percent surge for vegetables.
Energy prices were unchanged as gasoline and home heating oil fell while natural gas jumped more than in February. Capital equipment, up three-tenths of 1 percent last month, rose at a 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter, compared with a rate of less than 1 percent in the final quarter of 1993.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Speculation About a German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday amid speculation that the Bundesbank may cut interest rates at a meeting tomorrow on German monetary policy.
Many traders expect the German central bank will continue to lower rates to revive the country's slumping economy. The Bundesbank last cut its discount rate, the lowest rate it charges banks to borrow money, to 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent in February. Lower rates make investments denominated in marks less attractive. 
 "People sold Deutsche marks against everything today," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader for NBD Bank in Detroit. "They're expecting rate cuts in Germany, perhaps as soon as Thursday."
The dollar was quoted at 1.7161 marks in late New York trading yesterday, up from 1.7126 marks on Monday.
At the least, traders said, the Bundesbank is expected to lower its securities repurchase rate, a money-market rate, this week. The rate, which banks pay to borrow from the Bundesbank, has fallen to 5.73 percent from 6 percent in six weeks.
The dollar strengthened against the yen, rising slightly in New York to 103.70 yen, from 103.41 yen on Monday. The dollar was helped when Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said he did not see the trade dispute between the United States and Japan widening. Formal trade talks between the nations collapsed in February.
"There's not going to be a trade war," Mr. Altman said. "No one in the United States is in favor of a trade war."
The dollar plunged against the yen on Monday amid concerns that trade relations will suffer as Japan scrambles to find a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned Friday.
"Hosokawa's resignation made people think the U.S. would start talking tough on the yen again," said David Durst, a trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. Mr. Altman's comments eased some of those concerns, he said.
Also yesterday, the British pound rose to $1.4765 from $1.4708. The dollar rose to 5.8686 French francs from 5.8656 francs and strengthened to 1.4455 Swiss francs from 1.441 francs. The dollar rose to 1,634 Italian lire from 1,628 lire. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.52 United States cents from 72.12 cents yesterday.

HEADLINE: Washington Dining: A Deficit No More

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 11

 BODY:
Michel Richard, the chef and owner of Citrus in Los Angeles, is ensconced in Georgetown.
Patrick Clark, who made his mark at Metro in New York, is cooking at the Hay-Adams Hotel, across from the White House.
Dean & Deluca and Les Halles, both offshoots of New York operations, are drawing crowds. 
 Opening on Friday is Coco Loco. It is owned by Yannick Cam, best known as the chef of Le Pavillon in Washington, and by Savino Recine of Primi Piatti here. B. Smith's, a New York restaurant, and Legal Seafood of Boston are expected to be in residence soon.
The nation's capital is the country's hot new dining spot, and it's about time. Unlike other capital cities -- Paris, London, Rome -- Washington has never been a culinary mecca. But in the last year, the number of restaurants here that can hold their own with respected places in New York or Los Angeles has increased at a dizzying rate.
While out-of-towners have been moving in on the local chefs, the locals have not been standing still. Roberto Donna, who owned two restaurants two years ago, is now involved in five. Jean-Louis Palladin, whose restaurant Jean-Louis in the Watergate Hotel holds the distinction of being the most expensive in town, has opened a less expensive place, also at the Watergate. With Mr. Donna, he also owns Pesce, a moderately priced fish restaurant.
And in keeping with the supposed preferences of the Arkansans who have moved to town, several restaurant owners have opened places with a Southern feel.
In the 1960's and 1970's, when the best restaurants in other cities were serving French haute cuisine, the best meals in Washington were found in embassies and in private homes. The people who had money to spend in restaurants were lobbyists, and they weren't on a quest for culinary excellence.
By the 1980's, diplomacy had changed and the embassies had lost their power and their cachet. The grandes dames who entertained so splendidly at their mansions had dwindled to a precious few. Washingtonians, like everyone else, began to eat out more, and became much more sophisticated about food.
A result, said William D. Lecos, executive vice president of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington, is that the city has become a destination for aspiring chefs. And it's a city with money to spend.
"Washington is still growing: the recession wasn't as bad here as elsewhere, and there is a new Administration," Mr. Lecos said. "The Clintons dine out a lot, which is consistent with the baby-boomer age group, and that sets a style."
Among the new restaurants, here are some of the better-known ones:
 
Citronelle
 One of the most consistently excellent newcomers is Citronelle, the less expensive version of Mr. Richard's Citrus. Located in the Latham, a small hotel in Georgetown, it is full of cheerful light and many of the city's movers and shakers.
Unlike many other restaurants, this one combines good people-watching with stunning food that reflects Mr. Richard's French background and his years in California. He is particularly adept at weaving the homey and the elegant.
A diner who ordered the foie gras with mashed potatoes, paper-thin oven-dried beet chips and a vibrant red beet sauce wondered whether he could lick the plate. Equally fine were rabbit and lentils, quail, crab cakes, and sweetbreads and rice. The desserts were sublime, and the wine list very good, although expensive.
 
Hay-Adams Hotel
 Patrick Clark cooked at Odeon and at Metro in New York, then went on to Los Angeles, where he was at Bice. He is now making splendid food at the Hay-Adams Hotel, a small and charming place whose windows look across Lafayette Park at the White House. This luxurious Old World setting, with handsome furnishings -- crystal chandeliers and upholstered armchairs -- is just right for Mr. Clark's sophisticated food.
Two out of three meals at the Hay Adams were splendid. The mouthwatering names attached to some of the dishes are justified: smoked salmon and potato layer cake, shrimp with Thai seasonings, roasted salmon with Moroccan barbecue sauce, and pan-roasted Maine cod with leeks, potatoes and mussels.
If there is still room for dessert, the intensely flavored sorbets, the gingery creme brulee or the mint chocolate marquise would make almost anyone happy. At a restaurant where entrees are from $18 to $28, it is not surprising that the wine list, though extensive, is expensive.
Jaleo
 There is lots of stucco, wrought iron, flamenco music and flavor at Jaleo (pronounced ha-LAY-oh), a wildy successful tapas bar and restaurant in the old section of downtown, which is undergoing a rebirth. The owner of Cafe Atlantico and the owner and chef of the two Austin Grills, three of the city's hipper places, have added a fourth hot spot.
America's increasing interest in spicy food is well satisfied here. And it isn't only the tapas: many other dishes were successful, including the paella. Outstanding tapas include lentils and greens, marinated mussels and green beans, grilled portobello mushroom, spinach with pine nuts and raisins, warm goat cheese with garlic toast and grilled chorizo with mashed potatoes and turnips. This is a good place to go with a lot of friends, so you won't miss any of the tapas.
Vidalia
 Now that Jeffrey Buben, formerly of the Occidental in Washington, cooks in a restaurant he owns with his wife, Sallie, he has come into his own. They have turned a basement space into Vidalia, a charming country dining room.
When he is hot, which is most of the time, you will not find better onion rings, mashed potatoes, grits, corn bread and other Southern delicacies. When he isn't, the food is still O.K. He has a blue-plate special of vegetables that could make converts out of meat eaters. Also superb are shrimp with caramelized onions and creamy grits and seared salmon with an onion-coriander sauce.
The quality of the desserts is in keeping with the rest of the food.
Sesto Senso
 From linguine in a sauce brimming with freshly cooked seafood to the more unusual buckwheat noodles with spinach, potatoes and fontina cheese, there are not too many missteps at this restaurant opened by former employees of Bice in Washington.
The lentil soup at lunch is enough for a meal, especially when you include the bruschetta that arrives when you sit down. The pizzas are crisp and thin, the lightly fried calamari tender, the seafood risotto creamy and moist. Even the tiramisu is noteworthy.
But beware the canned music. Those with sensitive ears need to go early before the scene and sound become unbearably cacophonous.
Georgia Brown's
 Those looking for noisy fun will find some soul-satsifying food at Georgia Brown's, one of the Southern restaurants that opened when the Arkansans arrived in Washington. These people know how to fry -- oysters, fish, crab cakes.
But this is a 1990's Southern restaurant. As one patron, a Tennessean by birth, said, "The grease is gone."
Tasty pork and collards and spicy chicken sausages redeemed an uninspired vegetable plate. Dress is casual and the crowd is young.
Mimmetta
 Anyone with even the slightest curiosity about Sicilian dishes should make a reservation at Mimmetta, where Mimmetta Lo Monte is pleasing the guests in her homey dining room with simple food.
Scallops seasoned with mint and ginger; grilled tuna with lemon, garlic and oregano, and beef rolls with bread crumbs, pine nuts and currants are distinctively Sicilian and suffused with flavor. The more familiar Italian dishes, like baked eggplant with lemon, garlic and tomato, and fusilli with tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini, are also appealing.
Kinkead's
 Bob Kinkead started off in Washington with the well-regarded and very expensive 21 Federal, which went out of business when the economy started to slide and deductions for business meals were reduced. Now, he has opened a less expensive, much less formal restaurant, Kinkead's, and it is packed. You can go there in a black sequined spaghetti-strap dress or a plaid flannel shirt.
Can success spoil it? Sometimes.
This wonderfully cozy restaurant with lots of little nooks and crannies and a reasonably priced wine list was having a very bad night on my last visit. It took 45 minutes to get the first course, the swordfish was overcooked, the waiter was mainly invisible and the pear crisp had a doughy underbrowned crust.
Blame it on the rave review in The Washington Post a week earlier. At three meals eaten before the review, the food had been quite good, particularly the tuna with white beans, salmon with a crunchy crust of pumpkin seeds, a comforting roast chicken and some well-dressed salads.
Ristorante Luigino
 Ristorante Luigino is located in a former bus station in a part of downtown Washington that has very little in the way of good places to eat. But even on a freezing day in February, the tomatoes were so well marinated they tasted like summer.
The antipasti were the standouts: firm asparagus in a creamy sauce of fontina, earthy wild mushrooms sauteed with garlic and parsley, soft polenta with Gorgonzola. The entrees were forgettable.
Il Radicchio
 Il Radicchio, the latest in Roberto Donna's growing stable, is a spaghetti-pizza parlor with pretensions. A bread basket of exemplary focaccia and Tuscan bread with olive oil for dipping helps to while away the very few minutes you wait for your dinner, once you are seated; there are no reservations.
The pastas, with 23 different sauces, all priced under $10, are the best choice. There's a simple pomodoro, a zesty but sweet radicchio, sausage and red wine and a powerful puttanesca with black olives and capers. Crusts on pizza are thin and crisp. But a chicken was still pink and we had to argue with the waiter about taking back a potato pizza with undercooked potatoes and pancetta and burned garlic. Maybe that's how they get the food to the table so fast -- they don't finish cooking it.
Palladin
 Some of the well-known chefs aren't living up to their previous reputations.
Jean-Louis Palladin, whose restaurant in the Watergate is probably the most expensive in Washington, has opened another in the same hotel, using his last name instead of his first and reducing the tab significantly.
Palladin is lively; the people are all dressed up, and the tableware is a reminder of the days when nouvelle cuisine was in flower and entrees came on 18-inch plates. Unfortunately, the contents were not worthy of their impressive containers. One night the food was mediocre; on another it was often delicious and mostly salty.
The clam consomme was salty and filled with flavors of the sea; the onion tart in a wonderfully crisp and buttery crust was salty, too. There was an excellent but salty galantine and a dish of salty shrimp and beans. Several dishes that were not salty had no taste.
Pesce
 Whoever is overseeing the kitchen in Palladin must also be overseeing the kitchen at Pesce, the fish market-cum-restaurant owned by Mr. Palladin and Mr. Donna. Salt was the primary seasoning.
There are blackboard menus, huge portions, great focaccia and uneven cooking. It's a neighborhood restaurant with reasonable prices.
Gerard's Place
 In McPherson Square, Gerard Pangaud has a attractive bistro where he has not achieved the quality of cooking for which he was known when he was a two-star chef in France.
The Hot Spots of the Capital's New Restaurant Scene
 At expensive restaurants, a three-course dinner with tax and tip costs $40 or more; at moderate restaurants, $25 to $40; and at inexpensive restaurants, less than $25.

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
AS soon as the early-morning bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto pulled out of the station, Japanese children pulled out their breakfasts: deep-fried chicken nuggets, pork cutlet sandwiches, hot dogs and soft drinks.
There may be poetic justice here. 
 If, as some believe, the Japanese are undermining the American economy by their trade practices, Americans may be quietly undermining the health of the Japanese public -- with its eager cooperation -- by selling it billions of dollars' worth of hamburgers and french fries, ice cream and Danish pastries. There are at least a thousand McDonald's in Japan today.
The Japanese seem to have an ever-growing appetite for Western-style food high in fat and calories and low in fiber and complex carbohydrates. "Diet is related to the change in economic growth," Dr. Shuhei Kobayashi, the director of the National Institute of Health and Nutrition, said earlier this month in Tokyo. "The richer people are, the more food they eat." Especially food that is high in fat.
The Japanese fascination with Western food is not based on taste alone. Western food is easier to prepare than the traditional labor-intensive Japanese meals, with their emphasis on rice and vegetables. And fast food is much cheaper than even the simplest bowl of soup in a noodle restaurant.
On a recent trip to Japan, it was obvious that the trendiest Japanese adolescents, in their neatened-up version of grunge, eat fast food often, and on some of them it is already showing, as they grow horizontally as well as vertically.
"I eat hamburgers and french fries and a Coke two or three times a week, and cakes and pastries, but not every day," said Saori Yamaguchi, standing in front of a McDonald's.
Hayashi Masazumi, with the top of his hair dyed red, several earrings and a John F. Kennedy medallion around his neck, said he ate cheeseburgers, fries, milk and ice cream every day. "It tastes good and it's cheap," he added.
A report by the Japanese Government released last month shows the impact of Western food. It warns that if the Japanese continue to increase their consumption of fat, which rose from 8.7 percent of calories in 1955 to 25.5 percent in 1992, they risk a much higher rate of chronic diseases.
Between 1960 and 1991, consumption of grains in the Japanese diet dropped from about 14 ounces to less than 10 ounces a day per person. Rice, the staple of the Japanese diet, dropped from a little over 10 ounces a day to less than 7 ounces, while milk and dairy-product consumption rose from about 2 ounces a day to about 8 ounces. Low-fat dairy products are unheard of.
Meat consumption per person, according to the report, rose from less than an ounce a day to more than 3 ounces; consumption of fats and oils tripled, from less than half an ounce to an ounce and a half.
But the consumption of sodium, which once amounted to 20 grams a day, has dropped strikingly, to a little less than 13 grams a day.
These dietary changes have resulted in a mixed bag for the Japanese. The height and weight of younger Japanese have increased strikingly, reflected in the need to buy larger school desks. The decrease in salt consumption has strikingly reduced the number of deaths from stroke and from stomach cancer. And the incidence of infectious diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis, caused by malnutrition, has dropped.
While the Japanese continue to have the longest life expectancy of any nationality, there has been a significant increase in the mortality rate from colon, lung, rectal and liver cancer among men, while breast cancer among women is also on the rise.
Dr. Takashi Sugimura, president emeritus of the National Cancer Center in Tokyo, said that the striking rise in the cancer rate among men may be due to their eating so much more Western food than women do. "In Japan housewives still stay home," Dr. Sugimura said, "but men have many outside dinners and meetings, and food is Western style because it is easier and more convenient for the hotel or restaurant to prepare."
And perhaps, as others have suggested, Western food, especially French and Italian, is seen as more sophisticated.
The relation between colon cancer and a high-fat diet is pretty clear, Dr. Sugimura said. The relationship between breast cancer and fat is less so.
A recent study of the cholesterol levels of Japanese children from ages 8 to 14 does not bode well for their future health. Children in urban areas have higher cholesterol levels than their American counterparts.
"The Government is concerned; pediatric cardiologists are concerned," said Dr. Teruo Omae, president of the National Cardiovascular Center in Osaka. "They are warning that the situation is very risky and that children will have a greatly increased risk factor for heart disease."
Over all, the mortality rate from heart disease has decreased somewhat, but the incidence of heart disease is rising. Dr. Omae said the impact of the Westernization of the Japanese diet on heart disease will probably not be clear for 20 years.
The Japanese have embraced the worst aspects of the American diet and don't seem to know how to counteract their effects. Dr. Kobayashi said that there are 800 health centers throughout Japan with professional dietitians who meet with people in the workplace and in schools. But the information in the Government's pamphlet on health may be too vague to be helpful.
A few samples:
* Have a nutritionally balanced diet.
* Eat a variety of types of food.
* Avoid excess calories, especially as fat.
* Don't smoke; otherwise, smoke as little as possible.
After 10 years of publication only 200,000 copies of the booklet have been handed out.
Dr. Sugimura said some of the suggestions in the book were softened because of food industry criticism.
"This kind of compromise is always necessary," he said. "We have to have everyone feel happy. We need mutual coexistence.
Dr. Sugimura is not in favor of more specific advice. "I think recommendations on food should be very soft," he said. "I think scientists need to be modest. They sometimes think they know everything, like God. Government does not have the responsibility to do this education. Government is too busy fighting each other. It's people's responsibility to decide what they eat."

HEADLINE: Cutting Too Deeply

 BODY:
The House is poised to vote on a motion that would cut the Federal budget to damagingly low levels. The motion would reduce discretionary spending over the next five years by $26 billion below the stringent levels set by last year's deficit-reduction package. The Senate has already approved the cut; the House motion will instruct House conferees to accept that decision.
The vote will appear bloodless because the motion backs the idea of cuts without naming victims. But if the cuts become law, they would force Congress to gut President Clinton's investment program, diminish its own crime initiative or reduce defense spending. 
 Promising to cut Federal spending always sounds prudent. But in this case the promise is unnecessary and unwise. The 1993 budget law will drive the deficit below $175 billion by 1995, low enough to keep the nation's debt from growing faster than the economy. Domestic discretionary spending will be held constant for five years; that would bring such spending to its lowest level, compared with the size of the economy, in 30 years.
Congress will be hard pressed to meet these spending targets. The President's plan, for example, includes $15 billion in budget savings over five years that few outside the Administration believe will materialize. Nor is Congress expected to grant many of Mr. Clinton's proposed cuts -- forcing them to come up with more of their own.
At risk is the President's planned investment program. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it started out at $120 billion over four years but has already been pared back, because of last year's budget law, to less than $75 billion. Congress plans to raise Mr. Clinton's proposed spending by $9 billion for crime prevention and by $11 billion for defense programs this page has opposed. If Congress now requires an additional $26 billion cut, these plans will be scuttled.
Neither the White House nor Congress has yet found some $10 billion to pay for the GATT treaty, which the world's trading partners took seven years to negotiate and which they will sign next week. It makes no sense for Congress now to move the fiscal goal posts $26 billion further away.

HEADLINE: Women Campaign for New Plan To Curb the World's Population

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 8

 BODY:
For decades, when population planners talked about the world's poorest women, they concentrated on how to keep them from having more babies. Vast programs in Asia, Africa and Latin America were geared to sterilizing women, implanting them with IUD's, handing out contraceptives and imposing quotas on family size.
Despite the success achieved by family planning programs in India, Thailand, Kenya and other countries in curbing population growth, women's groups argue that these traditional methods are demeaning and coercive, and that a dramatic shift is needed. 
 The women's groups have won broad support among many population experts for a new emphasis on expanding health services to include prenatal care, educating girls and promoting women's equality.
The proponents of change argue that birth rates in poor countries will decline in the future only after the status, health, education and economic opportunities for women rise.
But some longtime population experts criticize the new approach, fearing that money spent for these broader goals, however worthy in principle, will divert resources from programs that have worked to curb population growth in the past.
"As women gain more control over their lives, they will have fewer children," said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United Nations Population Fund and an advocate of the new policy. "This has been the experience of successful programs that have pursued a broader approach."
A debate over how to proceed on population control is taking place this month at a United Nations conference, attended by 170 countries, that will shape how billions of dollars are spent by rich countries, the World Bank and poor countries themselves in the next decade.
The delegates are arguing over the wording of a document to be adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo this fall. The document is to serve as a kind of blueprint for international agencies and countries on how to devise population programs and channel money in the future.
The real fights, experts say, will come later: whether to spend scarce money for, say, implanting intrauterine devices, or for prenatal care and other services that would lead women to curb the size of their families on their own.
The new approach set forth in the draft plan at the conference has been devised partly by women themselves, and has the support of the Clinton Administration. Delegates say they expect it to be adopted in general form.
The draft plan would offer women and teen-agers a broad range of health services, including prenatal care, counseling about AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases, child immunization and a free choice of contraceptives.
But there are powerful detractors lobbying for changes in the draft.
The Vatican, for example, is attacking the plan because it does not rule out abortion and because counseling and birth control services would be offered to married and unmarried women alike. There is strong opposition in many countries, including the United States, to offering sexual counseling or contraceptives to adolescents.
Many developing nations also resent any pressure to change traditional customs or interfere with their own programs. Specifically, countries with conservative social traditions resent talk of providing "sexual counseling" to young women, especially if they are unmarried.
Perhaps the most surprising opposition to the new plan comes from advocates of traditional family planning programs that have helped to reduce birth rates in developing countries by about a third since the 1960's. Many of these experts say that these gains may be imperiled if resources for such programs are cut back.
"They never face the issue of what to do when resources are scarce, and they are," Dr. J. Joseph Speidel, president of Population Action International, said about advocates of the new plan. He argued that widening the services without increasing the money for them would mean that fewer women would benefit.
 
Feminism vs. Birth Control
 In some quarters, the debate has become acrimonious, pitting longtime population control advocates against feminist groups.
"The women don't like to talk about rapid population growth," said Charles F. Westoff, professor of sociology at Princeton University. "See if you can find any unambiguous statement in that document that fertility rates are too high and women should be discouraged from having children. You're hard put to get some recognition by these women that birth control is one of the best ways to improve women's status."
Providing the services called for in the new plan would cost an estimated $13.2 billion in the year 2000, an amount that several groups said was not enough.
Breaking with previous policies, the new plan also asks men to take responsibility for using birth control and preventing sexually-transmitted diseases.
Despite the criticism from traditionalists, population experts say the plan reflects an emerging consensus that family planning alone will not work fast enough.
 
World Population May Double
 United Nations demographers project that the world's population, now 5.7 billion, will reach more than 10 billion by 2050, but the conference has set a goal of stabilizing population at 7.8 billion by that year.
Dispensing contraceptives alone does not necessarily lead families to want fewer children or give women a voice in that decision. The demographers cite studies showing that birth rates drop when women are better-educated and when immunization and other health services help children survive into adulthood.
Many experts also say that slower population growth may well depend on offering counseling or birth control to adolescents so they postpone childbearing.
 
Women Find a Voice
 Delegates say that never before have so many women, in rich countries and poor ones, participated in the planning and policies likely to be produced.
"When we say population policy, people think family planning, and we're saying it's far more than that," said Joan Dunlop, president of the International Women's Health Coalition, a nonprofit group. "To talk about gender equity and women's rights in population policy -- it's unbelievable. It's such a dramatic change."
Women are a minority among the official delegates, but women from around the world are crowding the corridors here this week, and the conference's Secretary General, Dr. Sadik, is a woman.
"Women's groups really drove this," said Timothy E. Wirth, the State Department Counselor, who said he heeded their advice in drawing up a broader United States population policy.
But opponents to this new approach are working to alter the draft plan during the next few weeks.
 
Sharp Exchanges
 There have already been some sharp exchanges at the conference. Shortly after the Vatican representative, Msgr. Diarmuid Martin, said the plan lacked a "coherent moral vision," the conference's chairman, Dr. Fred Sai of Ghana, rose to disagree, and women from several countries held a news conference to denounce the Vatican position.
The Vatican is particularly troubled by the radical shift on abortion since the last population conference in Mexico City in 1984, when the United States backed a decision not to give aid to family planning programs that offered abortion.
Vatican representatives, who have observer status at the conference, say they will try to persuade member countries to oppose including abortion in family planning services, and to narrow the definition of family to married couples only.
 
Catholic and Muslim Allies
 Allied with the Vatican on these issues are Latin American governments that side with Roman Catholic teaching against abortion and Muslim fundamentalists who oppose the emphasis on equal rights for women.
The draft plan still allocates the most money to family planning services -- $10.2 billion of the $13.2 billion, with the rest for expanded health services and AIDS prevention. But Ms. Dunlop argues that some family planning programs, like sterilization, are more expensive than efforts to help women.
Defenders of traditional family planning programs argue that the accomplishments of past programs are being overlooked. They cite estimates that these programs have already reduced the world population by about 400 million people.
But women's groups say that many family planning programs do not help poor women understand their rights or contraceptive choices.
 
Bangladeshi Model
 Ms. Dunlop, of the International Women's Health Coalition, pointed to a program in Bangladesh as a model for the broader services the United Nations plan envisions.
The Bangladesh Women's Health Coalition began in 1980 by offering abortions. But at the urging of the women it served, it soon expanded to include family planning, basic health care services, child immunizations, legal aid, and training in literacy and employment skills.
According to its director, Sandra Kabir, the coalition now serves 110,000 women a year at 10 clinics.
Ms. Kabir told the story of one 18-year-old woman who approached them for prenatal services. She returned after the birth for contraception, had her daughter immunized, joined an adult literacy program, underwent job training and now runs a successful village business. She was also decribed as determined to educate her young daughter.

HEADLINE: Ferry Service Makes Ready To Broaden In the Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
After seven years of gradual expansion, ferry service in the New York region is about to branch out in a big way with several new routes to serve commuters -- and two designed especially for baseball fans.
Arthur E. Imperatore, who already operates ferries across the Hudson River, will announce plans today for a new service, beginning in May, between a dock just south of Newport Center in Jersey City and Battery Park City in lower Manhattan. In June, he said, service will begin between a barge just south of 35th Street in the East River and another in Hunters Point, Queens. 
 By opening day of baseball season in 1995 -- and perhaps before this season ends -- he said another new ferry route will connect the East River barge with a dock 1,500 feet west of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
While Mr. Imperatore so far dominates the ferry service industry in the region, others want part of the business -- encouraged in some cases by interest from the state. But even if all the new routes become reality, they will fall far short of resurrecting the heyday of ferry travel at the end of the 19th century, when ferries plied the waters on 125 separate routes from Manhattan to docks elsewhere in the region.
 
Only One Survived
 Those ferries died a slow death, as commuters found other options in new river bridges, tunnels for cars and trains, and highway systems; only the stalwart Staten Island Ferry survived through the last 90 years.
Environmentalists and urban planners say the demise of ferries came at great cost, eliminating alternatives for motorists who now drive to the city and belch harmful emissions in their wake, and leaving old piers and docks abandoned and rotting along the region's vast expanses of waterfront.
Now, according to Mr. Imperatore and others, a revival has found its underpinnings in simple economics: people are willing to pay more to ride a ferry to Manhattan than to ride trains, buses and other forms of public transportation, most of them heavily subsidized by the government.
"We find that people chose ferries for reasons other than price," said Donald Liloia, director of ferry services for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has conducted several surveys of people using the region's embryonic ferry services since the late 1980's.
What attracts them to the ferries, he said, is their reliability and safety, as well as the opportunity they provide for an esthetic break in commuters' workaday lives.
 
Started in '87
 "People ride the ferry to punctuate the day," said Mr. Imperatore, a New Jersey trucking executive and real estate developer who formed the Port Imperial Ferry Bus in 1987, with ferry service connecting Weehawken and Hoboken to docks at Battery Park City and West 38th Street in Manhattan.
Mr. Imperatore, who has renamed his company NY Waterway, said the decision to expand was based largely on the success of his ferries running from Hoboken and Weehawken. The ferries carry 20,000 riders a day, compared with less than 1,000 a day in 1987, he said.
Even as his business was showing what ferries could do, a High Speed Ferry Task Force, formed in 1992 by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, has been negotiating with several New York State towns to set aside piers and docks, and reviewing proposals from ferry operators.
A group of American and Norwegian executives, the New York Fast Ferry Consortium, is planning to build ferries in a shipyard in Mammaroneck and provide service, beginning by the end of 1995, between the St. George Terminal on Staten Island and Pier 79, at West 39th Street in Manhattan. The group also plans service by 1996 between a dock at the foot of Wall Street and another in the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Not all of the new routes envisioned by state officials have attracted operators. When the task force asked ferry companies last year for proposals to provide service between Manhattan and Tappen Beach Marine in Oyster Bay, no one bid for the job.
 
Heading Upstream
 But other routes being encouraged by the state have attracted operators, mainly Mr. Imperatore, who is planning additional service by the end of 1995 between West 38th Street and Nyack, Yonkers and Tarrytown, and the Sandy Hook recreational area of New Jersey.
Although New York City and other municipalities in the region have readily offered to turn over derelict piers and docks for the use of the ferry operators, disputes in some places may delay new routes.
Along the Hudson River waterfront in Manhattan, plans for new ferry service have come into conflict with other plans by the city and state to remake the shoreline from 57th Street to Battery Park into a park and esplanade. At issue is whether ferry operators will be allowed to use Pier 79, just north of the pier that is already used as a ferry dock by Mr. Imperatore's company.
In Rockland County, Nyack, the Town of Haverstraw and the Village of Haverstraw are all vying to be the destination of ferries connecting them with Manhattan. Mr. Imperatore, who has already been selected by New York State to provide the service, says a dock at the foot of Main Street in Nyack would be best, but the New York State Thruway Authority, which has been designated to mediate between the competing towns, said no decision on the selection had been been.
But despite the disputes, experts said ferry service seems certain to expand.
One reason is the speed of the ferries already in use on the Hudson River and being planned for other routes. They cruise at 35 miles per hour, nearly double the speed of the Staten Island Ferry.
And if the popularity of Mr. Imperatore's boats now plying the Hudson is a reliable gauge, customers are willing to pay for the luxury of ferry service. His company charges $4.50, one way, for service from New Jersey to midtown Manhattan, a price that also entitles customers to the use of shuttle buses that the company operates in Manhattan. By contrast, PATH trains to Manhattan from New Jersey charge $1 per rider.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article and a subheading yesterday about ferries in the New York region described plans for expanded service incorrectly. A new ferry route is planned to connect an East River barge with a dock 1,500 feet west of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx; there was no announcement about service to Shea Stadium.

HEADLINE: Health Debate Splinters After Initial Consensus

SERIES: The Basics of Care: A periodic report on national health issues.

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
"Too high premiums and not enough health care." That was how a clerk in Fargo, N.D., answered last month when asked what was the nation's biggest health care problem.
Her reply was a singular moment of clarity in the current debate. 
 In contrast, the arguments on Capitol Hill have concentrated on detail, process and politics, frequently cast in incomprehensible jargon as legislators and lobbyists compare hard-to-explain parts of President Clinton's plan with elements of competing proposals that no one, except perhaps their sponsors, understands.
The clangor has left the public confused and, recent polls show, perhaps even less knowledgeable than it was a few months ago.
The problems Congress is trying to solve are often drowned out in the din. But the main points are as the Fargo clerk identified them: cost and coverage.
Except among some very conservative Republicans, there is a consensus that major gaps exist in the present system and that costs have produced a crisis. And as Congress returned today from its Easter recess, there is widespread agreement with the message that Hillary Rodham Clinton carries everywhere these days: "Maintaining the status quo cannot be an acceptable alternative."
 
Identifying the Problem
 Agreeing on problems is a first step toward fixing them. But what comes next is a giant step, because a solution to one problem can make the next one worse.
The politicians' reluctance to tell constituents that there is no free lunch is reciprocated; the public has not descended on Capitol Hill to say what it wants to sacrifice.
For the Fargo clerk, who would give only her first name, and hundreds of others interviewed in a recent New York Times Poll, the connection between cost and coverage is clear: cost means the higher and higher insurance premiums they have to pay.
But it is a different side to the cost problem that is forcing Congress to grapple with this vast, complicated issue: health care has become the monster that eats Federal budgets, forcing up deficits and starving other initiatives.
Coverage is largely a function of insurance. About 38 million Americans have no health insurance. After years of steadily increasing private insurance coverage, in the late 80's more Americans started losing insurance than were signing up. Rising costs were the main reason. Millions of other Americans found themselves with only bare-bones coverage. People without insurance do get medical care, but it is worse than the insured receive, although many uninsured are young and healthy.
 
Other Constituencies' Desires
 Beyond these two biggest problems are a swarm of other issues, each crucial to someone. There have to be more medical personnel in rural areas if the promise of health insurance is to mean more than possession of a plastic card. But there also may be a need to produce fewer specialists.
Doctors think that if change is coming this must be the moment to change the malpractice lawsuit system. The elderly argue say now is the time to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and at least a start on benefits for long term care.
The difficulty is that all these issues, especially in combination, lead some lawmakers to despair and ask if it would not be enough to deal with just a few of the issues, the ones people agree on, like restraining the most grating practices of the insurance industry.
But the dominant view is the one offered recently by John Rother, legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons: "You can't solve only one or two without making the others worse."
 
Costs
Rising Rates Across the Board
 About 14 percent of the United States' gross domestic product is spent on health care. That is a greater share than any other country spends, and it could reach 19 percent or 20 percent by the end of the century.
To most people, the issue of cost is more personal: soaring bills. Many employers never tell workers how much the company pays on their behalf, but benefits have been cut back and employees' payments have been steadily increasing. The Health Insurance Association of America says the cost of family coverage under an average group insurance plan went to $436 a month in 1992 from $235 in 1988, an average annual increase of 17 percent.
For people who have to buy individual insurance, the increase has been even steeper, "20 percent or a little bit more than that" a year, says Cecil Bykerk, chief actuary for the nation's major individual insurer, Mutual of Omaha. Their premiums are vastly higher, too, because high administrative costs and a lack of bargaining power mean that only about $55 out of every $100 in premiums goes to pay claims. In large group plans, as much as $90 may go to claims, meaning the insurance company charges less for the same benefits.
Those difficulties might not have seized the attention of Congress and the Administration if the Government did not face sharply rising bills, too.
Federal health spending for care for the elderly under Medicare and for the very poor under Medicaid went to $200 billion in 1992 from $128 billion in 1988. That is a smaller rate of increase than in group policy costs and was accomplished partly by medical providers' shifting costs onto patients for whom the Government does not pay. Nonetheless, it is still much more than the Government can manage in an era when it is beginning to take the Federal deficit seriously.
 
States Spending More
 States are no better off. The National Association of State Budget Officers contends that states' spending for their share of Medicaid went up 22 percent in 1991 and 33 percent in 1992. Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York at Albany, argues that those figures are exaggerated and that the real increase is around 17 percent in each year, but that even so, Medicaid is the fastest-growing component of state budgets.
In 1994, Mr. Gold said, the 50 states together "are spending more for Medicaid than for higher education."
Why are costs going up?
Dick Davidson, president of the American Hospital Association, argues that the answer is this: "We pay for medical care on a piecework basis. There's an incentive for more medical encounters."
Dr. Philip R. Lee, Assistant Secretary for Health in the Department of Health and Human Services, says a surplus of specialists causes more spending than necessary.
In medicine, an excess supply of services does not drive prices down; instead, it seems to drive demand up. "When a physician goes into practice," Dr. Lee said, "you generate more costs, ordering lab tests, doing X-rays, in some cases doing procedures."
 
Access to Care
How to Help The Uninsured
 Health insurance is not the same as appropriate care, but it is the first step. The 38-million figure used by President Clinton for the number of uninsured is just a momentary snapshot, because people go on and off insurance rolls, especially as they get jobs or lose them. Diane Rowland, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and a leading student of health statistics, says she believes that about 50 million Americans lack insurance at one time or another in the course of a year.
Conservative Republicans often argue that too much is made of the number of uninsured people, because Medicaid is available to the poor, or at least the very poor. And that belief exists, says Mr. Davidson, the hospital association president, because hospitals have boasted they treat anyone who comes in, regardless of whether they can pay for it. While the boast is accurate for life-threatening circumstances like emergency appendectomies, Mr. Davidson says, it is not for postponable treatments like hip replacements.
Indeed, a book on the problem, "Falling Through the Safety Net," to be published next month by the Johns Hopkins University Press, concludes that being uninsured "has a substantial effect on the amount, location and even quality of care received."
The authors, Joel S. Weissman, who teaches health policy at the Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Arnold M. Epstein, a domestic policy adviser at the White House, say the insured have less primary care and less preventive care. "People who lack insurance delay care," they write, "and there is evidence to suggest that they come into the hospital more severely ill. They may also be hospitalized more frequently for conditions that could have been treated on an ambulatory basis."
In addition, the authors say, "there is also emerging evidence that the quality of their care may be compromised."
 
Other Issues
Cutting Specialists, And Lawsuits, Too
 Though there is wide agreement that controlling costs and broadening access are the goals of overhauling health care, the list of serious problems does not stop there.
One problem is the question of whether the United States has the right number, in the right mix, of primary care doctors, specialists, nurses and physician assistants. There is a consensus that the nation produces too many specialists, though there is also fierce disagreement on how to slow the increase.
Linda Aiken, a professor of nursing and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the nation ought to be using twice its current total of 35,000 nurse practitioners and ought to ease the restrictions many states place on what those practitioners can do, such as prescribing drugs. The nurse practitioners do provide basic care both in places where there are no doctors and in place of more expensive physicians in health maintenance organizations and other forms of collaborative medical practice.
But there is also a widespread sense that more personnel alone will not solve the problem of access, either in rural areas or urban slums. Dr. Lee, the assistant secretary, says that in the slums in particular it is far-fetched to expect many doctors to open up practices because "the environment is just too difficult." But he says the problems are least severe in areas served by networks like the one established by Montefiore Hospital in the South Bronx. Similarly, a rural network of clinics, nurses, hospitals and doctors has minimized the personnel shortages in the open spaces of the Dakotas.
Few health care problems evoke such widespread complaint as insurance practices. Insurance companies have an endless variety of rates and policies.
Mr. Bykerk, the Mutual of Omaha actuary, says that only 1 percent to 2 percent of the public is "uninsurable," meaning that they have "such a bad health condition that under today's conditions a typical insurance company would not insure them under any circumstances."
But many millions more have health conditions that either mean much higher rates or exclude that a particular problem from insurance coverage. People usually have to be insured anew when they change jobs, and many fear that they will not be approved. If a person loses his job, his insurance is usually lost, too. Small companies that provide insurance can find that one worker's sick child can cause their rates to soar or for them to be told that unless that worker is excluded, the insurance will not be renewed.
 
Malpractice Litigation
 The result is a worried nation. Thirty percent of the public, in the Times poll last month, said they were "very concerned" that in the next five years they would lose their insurance.
Insurance companies today, unlike the Blue Cross agencies that really began hospitalization insurance in the 1930's, look for good risks and charge people differently. Even the Health Insurance Association of America does not defend these practices and would be willing to see them barred, so long as the rates of good risks could be raised to pay for coverage of poor risks.
A less clearly defined issue is malpractice litigation. Doctors and most Republicans regard it as a very serious burden, not only because some plaintiffs win immense verdicts but also because the threat of being sued forces wasteful habits on doctors who overtreat in self-defense. In some fields, particularly obstetrics, soaring insurance rates have driven doctors out of business.
Counterpressures, from lawyers' organizations and genuine skeptics about the medical industry's commitment to policing its own quality, have stalled past efforts to change the laws on malpractice. That skepticism persists. "I'd like to see the A.M.A. reduce their fees in return for malpractice reform, " said Mr. Rother, who has often battled the American Medical Association on behalf of retired people.
Doctors and hospitals alike contend that antitrust laws scare them out of getting together and agreeing on ways to eliminate expensive duplications. (Mr. Davidson says that as far as hospitals are concerned, the Clinton Administration is easing the antitrust fear by spelling out the rules in advance.)
 
Covering Prescription Drugs
 Only organizations representing the elderly have made an issue out of prescription drug coverage. Still, there seems to be widespread agreement that a change in medicine since Medicare was enacted in 1965 away from hospitalization and towards greater use of prescription drugs supports the demand for adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare now, though the expense is scary.
While the elderly annually spend about three times as much on prescription drugs as do other Americans, nearly two-fifths of them have no insurance to cover it. So Mr. Rother and his group's members, who vote heavily, see coverage as the bottom line.
"If you don't have coverage for prescription drugs for my people," Mr. Rother said, "it's like not having health care."
Then there are other, widely acknowledged problems in the health care system, ones that affect its spirit and that none of the overhaul proposals seem to combat. One is paperwork. Eighty-two percent of the adults in that Times poll said there was too much paperwork in health care today.
A related problem is the tone of modern medicine for its practitioners. The steadily growing private efforts to cut costs require continual checking with insurance companies, and doctors do not like it, saying it denies them the dignity they expected when they picked their profession.
As Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the A.M.A., said, "They have to call 1-800-CONTROLL before they can do anything."

HEADLINE: Real Estate

BYLINE: By Kathleen Sharp 

DATELINE: OXNARD, Calif.

 BODY:
A COASTAL area of Southern California that embraces Oxnard has gained a substantial number of office tenants as a result of the Jan. 17 earthquake in Northridge, 30 miles to the east.
In the first quarter of this year, about 100 companies left their earthquake-damaged buildings in Los Angeles County and have leased space here in southern Ventura County, William Kiefer, an associate with Grubb & Ellis, a real estate company, said. 
 Most of these leases appear to be short term, brokers said.
The area, about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, also includes the towns of Camarillo, Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park. Quake-related relocations have accelerated the region's economic growth.
The area has a total inventory of 23.5 million square feet in office and industrial space. Leasing for the first quarter totaled 750,000 square feet, said Rick Heath, industry property specialist for Grubb & Ellis in Oxnard.
"Normally, it would take us a year to do that kind of business," Mr. Heath said. "The market has changed dramatically in the last 60 days."
Camarillo has an inventory of 8.8 million square feet of industrial and office space, accounting for most of the commercial real estate in the area. Oxnard has 8 million square feet, Newbury Park has 4.5 million square feet and Thousand Oaks has about 2 million square feet.
At the end of the year, the occupancy rate for Oxnard was 21 percent and Camarillo's rate was about 9 percent. At the end of the first quarter this year, Oxnard's rate dropped to 17 percent, while Camarillo's fell to about 7 percent, according to Grubb & Ellis's figures.
To assist the many small and midsized companies that had to move quickly after the earthquake, a group of 20 business people here formed an organization called Partners in Action. Spearheaded by the Ventura County Economic Association, it found temporary sites for about a dozen companies until their former buildings could be repaired.
Within a few weeks, the group helped lease 600,000 square feet of space in southern Ventura County.
Packard Bell, for example, moved its operations to Camarillo from Chatsworth in Los Angeles County.
In one two-year deal, the computer giant leased 160,000 square feet of space in Westlake Village, Mr. Heath said. In another, it leased 125,000 square feet in Camarillo from Daytron Transco.
"At first, we thought many of these deals would be short term," said Michael Slater, a Grubb & Ellis broker. "But in many cases, we ended up doing five-year deals." He forecasts that many of the new commercial residents will remain in the region.
With a population of 150,000, Oxnard is known primarily as an agricultural town. Named in 1898 after a sugar-beet farming family, Oxnard borders the only deepwater port between Los Angeles and San Francisco -- Port Hueneme (pronounced WHY-nee-me) -- and has a Naval Construction Battalion Center, a small airport, a major thoroughfare in Highway 101 and housing less expensive than Los Angeles County's.
In the late 1980's, the city rezoned about 1,600 acres from agricultural to industrial use, Mr. Heath said. Speculators developed a few business parks, like the Northfield Industrial Center, owned by Vista Properties of Texas, and many commercial buildings. A large volume of commercial space became available as Southern California's recession arrived, and much of the new space had sat vacant.
About a third of the current leases are unrelated to the quake relocations. In one lease, for example, GTE California, a telephone carrier based in Thousand Oaks about 20 miles away, announced that it would consolidate its customer operations spread throughout Southern California, moving into a 115,000-square-foot building in Oxnard by September. The company leased a building from the Chevron Oil Company, which built it in 1990 for $15 million but never moved in. GTE will employ 650 people.
De Weese Inc. is also moving to Oxnard, said John Weingarten, its president. Five years ago, the swimsuit manufacturing company sold its 78,000 square-foot building in downtown Los Angeles, and leased back the space. Two years ago, it decided to look for a permanent home outside of Los Angeles.
"We weren't enjoying living downtown," Mr. Weingarten said.
The company now leases 7,000 square feet in the older industrial part of Oxnard from Deardorff Jackson. By August 1995, the company intends to occupy a total of 65,000 square feet.

HEADLINE: States' Eagerness to Experiment On Welfare Jars Administration

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
California is fingerprinting people on welfare. Massachusetts wants to enroll them in a work program within two months. New Hampshire wants to straighten their teeth, on the theory that better looks will lead to better jobs.
With a record 15 million Americans on welfare, more than 30 states have asked the Federal Government for waivers allowing them to run welfare experiments. The requests have prompted an unusual debate: do the programs represent responsible social science or a backdoor war on the poor? 
 The states say the experiments allow them to act, in Justice Louis D. Brandeis's famous phrase, as "laboratories of democracy." They say the programs, which are being evaluated by social scientists, may yield important information about ways to reduce welfare dependency.
But opponents have sued to stop the experiments in California and New Jersey, and they are threatening to do the same in Wisconsin and several other states. They say that some of the programs violate laws governing experiments on humans and, by reducing aid, subvert the fundamental purpose of the welfare system: to provide a safety net for poor children.
The proposals put the Clinton Administration in a politically awkward position. Several of the requests have alarmed officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, who have privately voiced fear that some of the experiments could leave poor families with no support.
But as a former governor who long argued for flexibility in Federal programs, President Clinton has vowed to approve experiments, even when he disagrees with them. And with the public clamoring for changes in the welfare system, the Administration does not want to be accused of standing in the way.
"We try to focus completely on the policy, but we are not unaware of the political consequences," said Mary Jo Bane, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, who presides over the waiver proposals. "It's a balancing act, but I'm quite confident that we've achieved a good balance."
Mark Greenberg, a lawyer for the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington advocacy group, estimates that the experiments already in place affect about a third of the nation's welfare recipients. They vary widely, and many have generated no objections. New York and at least 13 other states, for instance, are allowing welfare recipients to earn more money without losing benefits, to encourage them to work.
But other states are trying strategies that reduce, or even end, cash assistance in some circumstances. Maryland, for instance, is reducing the payments to mothers who fail to have their children immunized. Ohio and Wisconsin are reducing payments to families whose children skip school.
 
Limits on Payments
 Arkansas, Georgia and New Jersey won approval to eliminate increased payments to mothers who have additional children. Florida and Wisconsin are experimenting with different versions of a two-year limit on cash payments. And California has reduced benefits for all recipients, calling the move an experiment that will prompt more people to work.
Critics argue that behind the talk of experiments, states are dismantling a system set up to protect poor children. "It has become a backdoor way of a state to enact any policy it wants, regardless of the potential harm to families," Mr. Greenberg said.
Lawsuits in California and New Jersey contend that the programs violate Federal regulations that bar human experiments without informed consent. Jay Katz, a Yale psychiatrist who is a specialist in human experimentation, filed a supporting affidavit in California that called "informed consent a basic tenet of research ethics." The suit was rejected in Federal court and is being appealed.
Michael Wiseman, a professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin, raises a different set of objections, arguing that the flurry of activity is producing flawed research.
Contending that the experiments sometimes test too much at once, he notes a Colorado program that not only establishes time limits, but also substitutes cash for food stamps, penalizes parents who do not get their children immunized and allows families to own more expensive cars. Whatever the result, Mr. Wiseman said, it will be hard to know which policy was responsible.
A previous generation of welfare experiments, begun in the early 1980's, produced valuable research about job training and led to adoption of a nationwide program. But the current proposals are far more radical.
They began with President George Bush, who, facing a re-election campaign with virtually no welfare policy, found one through waivers. He pledged in his 1992 State of the Union speech to make the waiver process "easier and quicker," and approved a flurry of experiments, including one that a Federal court later found unlawful.
That waiver gave California permission to offer reduced benefits to welfare recipients who move in from other states. A Federal court blocked the move, citing precedents that barred such residency requirements.
 
Negotiating With States
 In defending the Clinton policy to give the states great leeway, Ms. Bane emphasized that she would not grant waivers for experiments she considered unconstitutional. She barred, for instance, an Illinois proposal that would have lowered benefits to new state residents.
She also negotiated with Florida and Wisconsin to modify their experiments placing a two-year limit on cash assistance.
Florida, for instance, initially proposed a two-county experiment that would have simply ended cash assistance after two years, with no guarantee that recipients could find work. "There might not have been anything for people, even if they worked hard and followed the rules," Ms. Bane said.
Instead, she persuaded state officials to guarantee a job for all the welfare recipients affected by the two-year limit. Jim Towey, the state's Secretary of Health and Rehabilitative Services, credits Ms. Bane for devising a program with better safeguards.
"We are very happy campers," Mr. Towey said. "They took our raw material and polished it, and they did it with amazing speed."
Ms. Bane reached a different accommodation with Wisconsin. Participants in the two-county experiment there will not be guaranteed a job when their two years end, even if they cannot find one on their own. But Ms. Bane did insist on a clause that gives the Federal Government permission to suspend the experiment if the local economy is too weak.
Advocates have called that scant protection, saying many welfare recipients cannot find jobs even when the labor market is good. But while she clearly does not relish the Wisconsin idea, Ms. Bane defends her solution. "I'm actually pretty proud of our record over the last six months," she said.
 
Welfare and Fertility
 Among the most criticized waivers are those that deny increased payments to mothers who have additional children while on welfare. The Bush Administration approved a New Jersey program that applies the provisions statewide. Ms. Bane then approved a statewide experiment in Georgia and a program in Arkansas that operates in all but 10 counties.
Critics say there is no evidence the policy will deter childbirth and among the scholars they cite is Ms. Bane herself, a former Harvard professor. In a study published 10 years ago, she concluded there was "no real evidence supporting the proposition that welfare and fertility among young women are linked."
Mr. Greenberg argues that duplicating the experiment around the country needlessly exposes additional families to potential harm. A New Jersey mother who has a second child must now get by on $322 a month, for instance, rather than the $424 she would have received in earlier years. The $102 cut could force families to go hungry or lose their homes, he said.
Ms. Bane acknowledged that she probably would not have suggested such experiments, since she doubts their effectiveness. But when much of the public believe a policy should be tested, she said, "it is appropriate for us to be responsive." She also said it mades sense to test the idea in several states at once, to see if results can be replicated.
The Bush Administration approved the fingerprint plan in California. The Clinton Administration has still not ruled on the two-month limit in Massachusetts, or the dental plan in New Hampshire. It has, however, continued a Bush waiver that gave California permission to cut benefits to $607 a month for a family of three, from $633.
In calling the benefit reduction an experiment, California officials argued the policy would encourage more adults to work. But Amy Albright, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Social Services, acknowledged that the state had a fiscal agenda in addition to its research interests.
Noting the cuts save $140 million a year, she said, "California is in a position where it needs to achieve substantial budget savings."

HEADLINE: '81 Tobacco Study Discussed Raising Levels of Nicotine

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
A 1981 study by two tobacco company researchers discussed techniques for raising or lowering the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, a Congressman who is a strong opponent of the tobacco industry disclosed today.
The Congressman, Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of a House subcommittee on health and the environment, said at a news conference that the study was evidence that the tobacco companies had lied about whether they manipulated the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. 
 The Food and Drug Administration has been investigating whether the tobacco companies manipulated nicotine to make sure that smokers stay addicted. The agency has said it has the authority to regulate cigarettes as drugs and will consider doing so if its suspicion can be demonstrated. A senior official at the agency said the article showed "the industry in its own words talking about setting the levels of nicotine."
The tobacco industry has denied the contention, and one company, Philip Morris, has filed a suit against ABC accusing the network of libel for making a similar accusation.
Today, the leading tobacco companies broke decades of silence about the additives put in cigarettes made in America. They released a list of 599 such ingredients and additives, from acetic acid to yeast. Not all the chemicals are used in all brands, and most are added in tiny amounts for flavoring.
The companies said they had not released the list before out of concern that their secret formulas might be compromised.
But a report last week on National Public Radio said that 13 of the ingredients in the list might be hazardous because they are not in the Federal Government's list of approved additives. The six largest tobacco companies jointly released the list, not saying which company uses which ingredients.
Company spokesmen said almost all the additives were commonly used in foods and beverages, including cocoa, vanilla and licorice. Others were agents like glycerin, which is used to keep the tobacco moist.
In releasing the 1981 study, Representative Waxman accused the chief operating officer of Lorillard Inc., Alexander W. Spears, of deceiving Congress in testimony last week. Mr. Spears was the co-author of the 1981 paper. Asked if he was accusing Mr. Spears of perjury, Mr Waxman said he was not "because that is a legal determination, but it is a criminal offense to try to mislead Congress."
 
Dispute About Study
 Dr. Spears said in a written statement today that Mr. Waxman "made a serious error in reasoning" in reading the 1981 article. The article, written by Mr. Spears and S. T. Jones, who also worked for Lorillard, was presented to the 35th Tobacco Chemists' Research Conference in 1981. The paper points out that low-tar cigarettes using special blends of tobacco could keep the level of nicotine up while tar was reduced.
"Higher nicotine levels can be achieved by decreasing Oriental, and the stem and tobacco sheet, and increasing the Burley and upper stalk positions of both the Flue-cured and the Burley tobacco," the article said. As a result, the paper said, "current research is directed toward increasing the nicotine levels while maintaining or marginally reducing the tar deliveries."
Appearing before Mr. Waxman's committee on March 25, Mr. Spears said: "We do not set nicotine levels for particular brands of cigarettes. Nicotine levels follow the tar level."
In his statement today, Dr. Spears said the amount of nicotine in ultra-low-tar cigarettes was lower than the nicotine in regular cigarettes. But his statement did not dispute that tobacco companies used tobacco blends with higher levels of nicotine when they make low-tar cigarettes. As a result, the low-tar brands are nearer the regular brands than they would be if high-nicotine blends were not used.
Several scientists who once worked for leading cigarette companies supported Mr. Waxman's reading of the report, saying that cigarette makers routinely adjust the levels of nicotine and other substances during the maufacturing process.
Vedpal S. Malik, a biochemist who worked in the Philip Morris research laboratory in Richmond for more than 11 years, said he and other Philip Morris scientists had developed methods to remove nicotine and other chemicals believed to be harmful. But he said the company did not encourage additional research.
"A safer cigarette can still be made. But they don't want that," Dr. Malik said in an interview. "They don't want the projects to succeed."
Lawyers for Philip Morris contended that Dr. Malik's experiments were inconclusive and that his accusations were motivated by anger over his low performance ratings and his dismissal in 1992, which they said came as part of a companywide staff reduction. They also said the research he initiated, including an attempt to produce a nicotine-free tobacco plant, was continuing.
 
Approved in Foods
 On the matter of the 599 ingredients, David Fishel, an executive of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, said the ingredients were virtually all approved by the F.D.A. for use in food.
Mr. Fishel said the companies submitted the list of ingredients to food scientists at a number of universities last month and received a report back saying the ingredients were not hazardous in cigarettes.
Scott Ballin, chairman of the Coalition on Smoking or Health, which is an alliance of the American Lung Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, said today that whether the ingredients were approved for use in foods was not relevant because the ingredients in cigarettes are inhaled, not eaten.
Victor Zonana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that releasing the list of ingredients was a smoke screen. "We know that the two main ingredients in cigarettes are tobacco, which kills, and nicotine, which addicts," he said. Every year, 419,000 people die from cigarettes and the cost to the economy is $68 billion dollars a year, he added. "Those are the relevant facts."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Soar as Hata Moves Ahead

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, April 14

 BODY:
The Tokyo stock market soared Wednesday amid rising expectations that Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will be selected as Japan's next Prime Minister. The market's performance reflected investors' hopes that Mr. Hata, a moderate conservative, can stabilize the country's fractured political order and help pull the economy out of recession.
Share prices bobbed nervously throughout the day today because of the political uncertainty but generally held their gains. 
 Parliament is not expected to vote until early next week, but opposition to Mr. Hata has begun to die down, along with the squabbling that has wracked the governing coalition since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced on Friday that he intended to resign.
Mr. Hata, 58, does not have Mr. Hosokawa's oratorical skills or sense of mission, and he has not yet won the support of all the political leaders and factions that he needs to wrap up the election.
 
Pragmatism Welcomed
 Nevertheless, Mr. Hata's knack for getting things done and his experience in the back rooms of Parliament, where legislative battles here are settled, were welcomed by a country seemingly eager for pragmatism over flair. In addition, he appears likely to hold the ruling coalition together, forestalling at least for now a more sweeping and tumultuous reorganization of the political order.
The 225-stock Nikkei index rocketed up Wednesday by 412.08 points, or 2.1 percent, and closed the day at 20,060.41. At the close today, the market was down 73.21 points, or 0.36 percent, to 19,987.20. The market is now back to its level of three weeks ago, when nasty political infighting and a personal financial scandal began to push Mr. Hosokawa out of office.
"The market breathed a sigh of relief," said Kathy Matsui, stock market strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The political question mark has been set aside. And as far as the market is concerned, any step toward the right politically is a good thing."
Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, reflected what appears to be a certainty among many analysts that Mr. Hata will be installed.
"The choice of Hata means there won't be an election for a new parliament right away, which is what many people were afraid of," he said. "We'll probably have a little better direction for the economy."
If chosen for the job, Mr. Hata's first order of business is expected to be enactment of a long-delayed budget for the fiscal year that began April 1. That budget includes big increases in public works spending and a tax reduction to stimulate the economy.
He is also seen as likely to develop an economic deregulation program in an effort to mend Japan's tattered trade relations with the United States. These goals hearten most Japanese, even though Mr. Hosokawa made little progress with them.
"Mr. Hata is a very pragmatic person," Satsuki Eda, a member of the coalition and the current head of the Science and Technology Agency, said in an interview.
 
'Probably the Best Person'
 "He is a pure politician," Mr. Eda said. "That may be regarded by some people as old-fashioned, and he is typically Japanese in that he doesn't say things clearly and so on. But he's quite good at managing things. As for United States-Japan relations, be's probably the best person in this situation."
Mr. Eda, who heads a small party, added, "Mr. Hosokawa paved a very rough road. That means Mr. Hata will be able to push forward a little more easily."
Of course, no one expects instant solutions to the country's deep economic and political maladies, just greater effectivness than Mr. Hosokawa displayed. And Mr. Hata's innate conservatism suggests he would not work for bold or dramatic changes, as Mr. Hosokawa had.
The first problem is the coalition, an odd combination of Socialists and conservatives who defected last year from the Liberal Democratic Party. Bitter personal feuds almost split the party after Mr. Hosokawa said he was quitting last Friday because of financial scandals.
It is unlikely that, even if most coalition members throw their support behind Mr. Hata, the deep differences will heal quickly. Thus, any difficult issue that comes up, particularly the sensitive question of how far Japan would be willing to go to halt North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program, could provoke a return of the paralyzing divisions.
In addition, Mr. Hata would have only until July, when the Group of Seven industrialized nations summit takes place in Naples, to come up with a satisfactory program of deregulation and market opening measures to cut Japan's trade surpluses.
Mr. Hata has never proven himself overly pliant in the hands of American trade negotiators. Indeed, he is the one who argued several years ago that Japan could not import American beef because it did not suit the unique Japanese digestive system.
But he generally favors strong relations with Washington and has demonstrated before his ability to come up with compromise agreements.

HEADLINE: Suit Over Police Beating Goes to Los Angeles Jury

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 13

 BODY:
The nation's most scrutinized police beating -- 81 seconds of violence followed by a lifetime of disability -- is worth $15 million to its victim, Rodney G. King, his lawyer said today as arguments concluded in Mr. King's civil suit against the City of Los Angeles.
The case went to the jury this afternoon after three weeks of testimony that minutely examined Mr. King's injuries and their effects, as well as the audio part of the amateur videotape of Mr. King's beating by Los Angeles police officers. 
 The city has already conceded liability in the beating, so the job of the racially mixed jury of seven women and three men will be to determine the amount of damages that would compensate Mr. King for his physical and emotional injuries.
Deputy City Attorney Don Vincent proposed a range of damages from $500,000 to $1 million, suggesting $800,000 as a fair figure. Before the trial, Mr. King had rejected the city's offer of $1.25 million plus lawyer's fees and had demanded $9.5 million.
 
Next Phase of Trial
 Once the jury makes its determination, a second phase of the civil trial will assess the liability and possible damages against 15 current and former police officers whom Mr. King is also suing.
The jury that is deliberating now is the third to ponder the meaning of the videotape, which shocked television viewers after the March 3, 1991, beating that followed a lengthy high-speed chase. Four white police officers were acquitted of assault in a state trial in April 1992, and the verdicts touched off rioting that took more than 50 lives.
In a Federal trial last year, two of the officers, Stacey C. Koon and Laurence M. Powell, were convicted of violating Mr. King's civil rights. They are serving 30-month terms in a Federal prison.
In the civil suit, more than in either previous trial, race has become a central issue, with Mr. King, who is black, insisting more confidently than in the past that he was taunted with racial slurs during the beating.
"He's a decent man that has become a symbol of a wrong to a people," said Mr. King's lawyer, Milton Grimes. "This is a race case. I don't know how you can separate the Rodney King incident from black people, from African-American people, from how we feel."
On this third judicial examination of the videotape, it was the audio part that played a major role, with witnesses and jurors straining to determine whether they could hear racial epithets amid the din of the beating and the roar of a police helicopter.
 
Analyzing Blurry Sounds
 George Papcun, an audio expert who has analyzed the blurry sounds, testified that he could hear the command, "Nigger, hands behind your back."
Mr. King testified that he had heard officers shout at him, "We're going to kill you, nigger. Run!" During the Federal trial he said he recalled similar words, but under cross-examination he said he was uncertain of his memory.
Mr. Grimes urged the jurors today: "Close your eyes and listen to the tape. You can't close your eyes and pretend that 'nigger' wasn't said on March 3, 1991, because you don't want to hear it."
The defense has countered that the tape is unclear and that the racial slurs exist only in some listeners' imaginations. David Love, the only black officer among nearly two dozen at the scene, testified that he had not heard racial epithets. "Me being African-American, it would have offended me very much," Officer Love said.
In any case, Mr. Vincent argued today, the presence or absence of racial epithets is not central to the civil suit. "If it was said, it was said at a time of passion, a time of battle," he said.
Mr. Vincent said that neither Mr. King nor his mother, Odessa King, had told the truth on the witness stand. Mrs. King had testified that her son told her about racial slurs in the first days after the beating. But another witness disputed her account.
When Mr. Vincent referred to that witness, Mrs. King cried out from among the spectators, "He lied!" Judge John G. Davies of Federal District Court ejected her from the courtroom. As she left, she turned to the judge and said, "Sir, begging your pardon, but he certainly lied."
Most of the 38 witnesses in the trial, which began on March 23, testified to the nature and extent of Mr. King's injuries as well as his character and life style. An expert testifying for Mr. King estimated that his lost potential lifetime earnings totaled $1 million, while an expert for the city set his estimate at half that sum. Mr. King was unemployed at the time of the beating.
Experts also disputed a major ambiguity of the videotape: whether the injuries to Mr. King's face were caused by a blow to the head or by a fall.
One twist on this issue came from Officer Theodore J. Briseno, one of the two officers acquitted in both state and Federal trials. In the civil suit, in which he will be a defendant during the second phase, he changed his testimony to assert that Mr. King had not been struck in the head.
His previous testimony about blows to the head had contributed to the convictions of two fellow officers. But he said that his study of an enhanced videotape had since convinced him that he had been wrong.
 
Dispute Over Injuries
 The causes of Mr. King's injuries were in dispute, but his long-term physical and emotional difficulties seemed clear. An oral surgeon, Dr. Howard Ravins, described Mr. King's pain, jaw displacement and cracked teeth, and said he drooled, had trouble chewing and often bit his cheek, which has lost its feeling.
A neurosurgeon, Dr. Dilworth Thomas Rogers, said Mr. King had complained of nightmares, fatigue and depression, and wore a bulletproof vest to his medical consultation, complaining of a fear of being attacked.
In its defense, the city sought to portray Mr. King as a violent man who drinks heavily and has had numerous run-ins with the law both before and since the beating. But even the circumstances of an earlier conviction for armed robbery were argued, with the victim, a shop owner, saying that Mr. King had attacked him with a metal bar, and Mr. King insisting that he had only thrown pies at him.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Eases a Bit; Prices Rise 0.3%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
Despite an early Easter, consumers spent carefully in March, Commerce Department figures showed today, strengthening a general belief that economic growth has slowed significantly this year from the unsustainable pace that prevailed in late 1993.
The rise of four-tenths of a percent in retail sales last month, to $182.26 billion, meant that sales in March were slightly lower than those of December, after adjusting for inflation. 
 "One-third of the economy treaded water in the first quarter," Irwin L. Kellner, the chief economist for Chemical Bank, said.
Separately, the Government reported that prices paid by consumers for all manner of goods and services climbed three-tenths of a percent for a second straight month. Inflation in medical care, for which prices rose two-tenths of a percent, was the lowest since 1984.
Taken together, the two sets of figures implied moderating growth of the economy and steady inflation, a combination that would usually be considered reassuring by the securities markets. But today, bonds rallied briefly on the retail sales results, which were somewhat weaker than predicted, then reversed course and finished sharply lower, dragging the stock market along.
Although there is still scant evidence of accelerated inflation, the Federal Reserve is not waiting for conclusive proof of such an outbreak and has raised short-term interest rates twice since early February.
Many analysts predict further Fed increases to push real rates -- that is, those adjusted for inflation -- firmly into positive territory after a long period during which they were essentially zero. Yet judging from the latest soundings, the economy has already slowed significantly from the unsustainable 7 percent rate of growth it posted in the final three months of last year.
"One would be hard-pressed to call today's report 'bad,' " said Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a consulting firm in St. Louis, referring to the retail sales figures. Yet "it does go hand in hand with the notion that the surge in fourth-quarter consumer spending, which was anchored by auto sales, is beginning to wane, and the momentum is slowly eroding."
Various Federal Reserve officials now doubt consumers' ability, whatever their optimism, to increase spending in light of high debt, lagging wages, record low savings, poor liquidity and tax increases.
"I believe that the household sector poses one of the most serious risks to the continuation of this recovery," Lawrence B. Lindsey, one of five sitting Fed governors, told a Baltimore audience last month.
 
 
Decline in Nondurable Goods
 Indeed, sales of nondurable goods, about 60 percent of retail sales, showed a tiny decline that rounded to no change for March. There were gains of 1.9 percent for drugstores and variety stores, three-tenths of a percent for clothing stores and two-tenths of a percent for stores selling general merchandise. But these were offset by declines of eight-tenths of a percent at food stores, of five-tenths of a percent at gasoline stations and of two-tenths of a percent at restaurants and bars.
Sales of durable goods rose 1.1 percent, paced by a 4.1 percent surge for building materials -- a rebound from a comparable drop in February, which was attributed to severe weather. Receipts rose nine-tenths of a percent at stores selling furniture and other equipment for the home, and automobile dealers took in five-tenths of a percent more. But in both cases the gains were much smaller than in February.
The department made slight upward revisions in overall retail sales -- which are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences, but not for price changes -- for both January and February. Last month's sales were 8.9 percent higher than those of March 1993.
The inflation report, which was about as predicted, showed consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent both for the total index and for the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the erratic food and energy components.
For a second straight month, a main contributor was higher-than-usual increases for the heavily weighted housing component, which climbed three-tenths of a percent. Homeowners' and renters' costs each rose four-tenths of 1 percent, partly offset by small declines for furniture and for maintenance and repairs.
 
 
Higher Food Prices
 Food prices edged up a tenth of a percent after two straight declines; beef climbed eight-tenths of a percent, the biggest rise in nearly a year. Apparel prices, which fell earlier in the year because of a slower-than-usual introduction of spring and summer merchandise, rose four-tenths of a percent.
Higher airline fares and increases for both new and used cars helped push transportation costs up six-tenths of a percent. But inflation in medical care eased to two-tenths of a percent as prices for drugs and medical supplies remained unchanged.
"There remains no pickup in inflation," Joseph Baggett, an economist at Paine Webber Inc., said.
Services, which account for about 56 percent of the index, rose four-tenths of a percent for the second straight month. Commodities, 46 percent of the index, rose two-tenths of a percent.
Among five major metropolitan areas, prices in New York rose at the same three-tenths of 1 percent pace as they did nationally, with Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia registering a bit more and Los Angeles a bit less.
The March reading of 147.2 for the Consumer Price Index means that an assortment of goods and services that cost $10 in the 1982-84 base period now costs $14.72, up 47.2 percent.

HEADLINE: It's Showdown Time for Globex

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 13

 BODY:
It is showdown time at Globex, the world's first international, round-the-clock electronic marketplace for futures and options traders.
The partnership agreement under which Reuters P.L.C., the British news and market information company, has developed the computer-based network for the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest futures exchanges, is certain to be officially dissolved in two weeks. And the Board of Trade may decide as early as tomorrow whether to pull its contracts off the two-year-old system, which has 342 computer terminals, mostly in Europe and America. 
 A thumbs down from the Board of Trade would hurt the reputation of Globex more than its performance; trading in the board's contracts has accounted for a scant 5 percent of activity on the electronic network recently. Still, losing the Board of Trade's contracts, which include some of the world's most heavily traded futures contracts, would raise doubts about Globex's prospects at a time when it needs to overcome a track record pocked with technological setbacks, management gridlock and unforeseen market developments. The world of finance is undeniably becoming more global and electronic but not in a straightforward way.
 
Expectations Exceeded Reality
 "The expectations were out of sync with reality," said John F. Sandner, who is chairman of the Merc and chief executive of the Globex Corporation, the joint venture with the Board of Trade that oversees Globex. The new governing system, with or without the Board of Trade, will allow other exchanges like Marche a Terme International de France, or Matif, the French exchange that is Globex's biggest customer, to share in control of Globex and give all parties more freedom to make rules affecting their members and products.
"The appetite for 24-hour markets isn't really there yet," said Patrick H. Arbor, the Board of Trade's chairman. He favors staying put, but he has had trouble convincing his exchange to support changes demanded by Reuters, the Merc and Matif. Board of Trade members say they fear the changes could shift trading from their pits to Globex's screens and undermine the Board of Trade's freedom to develop other alliances.
Globex's founding premise seemed unassailable when the system made its debut with champagne and fanfare nearly two years ago: traders needed a way to deal anytime, anywhere in widely held investment products like the Board of Trade's futures and options on Treasury securities or the Merc's futures on foreign currencies and Standard and Poor's 500 stock index.
Futures are contracts to buy or sell an underlying asset, like the stocks in the S.& P. index, for a set price at a given date. Options are the right, but not the obligation, to strike such a deal. Demand for futures and options does not disappear just because an exchange that is their primary marketplace closes.
Early this month, for instance, following the Government's release on Good Friday of stronger-than-expected employment figures, investors, expecting stocks to drop sharply when trading resumed on Monday, turned to Globex in record numbers on Easter to sell S.& P. 500 futures contracts.
 
Contracts Used to Hedge Risks
 Such contracts are speculative tools for many investors, but they also serve to hedge risks in international commerce. Multinational businesses, for example, protect themselves from currency shifts when they are buying and selling goods overseas, or they may guard against interest rate swings on loans.
One unanswered question is whether off-hours demand is strong enough to attract sufficient numbers of traders to Globex in the absence of such rare events as trading on Easter. Without a reasonably strong and steady trading activity, someone who buys or sells a contract has a harder time finding an offsetting position if prices take a nasty turn and losses mount. To compensate for the added risk of thin trading, or illiquid markets, would-be buyers tend to demand lower prices and sellers higher ones, thus widening the so-called spread.
As that disparity between asking prices and bids widens, it becomes harder to complete trades. Unless Globex volume picks up, the system now seen as an investment in the future will come to be regarded as a financial sinkhole for Reuters, the trading houses that subscribe to it and the sponsoring exchanges.
 
An Experiment in Progress
 "It's an experiment that's still in progress," said Merton Miller, a professor at the University of Chicago School of Business and a member of the Merc's board of directors. "I'm not sure yet whether the market niche is there."
The Chicago exchanges originally saw Globex as a way to enhance international interest in their contracts. They also hoped it would head off efforts by exchanges in Europe and Asia to introduce competing products and stem the move by banks and other institutions to steer more of their futures and options trading to unregulated, over-the-counter transactions. They figured other exchanges would flock to Globex, willing to accept Chicago's governance and ban on competing contracts in return for the right to add the rest of their products to Globex's screens.
Reuters foresaw a lucrative new market for its trading technology, which was already prominent in stock, bond and currency markets. It has plowed an estimated $100 million into adapting technology for Globex.
Hardly anything has turned out the way Reuters and the two Chicago exchanges planned. Globex's volume has been climbing, but even at the peak, just 124,123 contracts were traded on March 2. That total dwarfed the daily average of 45,827 for February, the best month to date, but still used less than 25 percent of the system's capacity, Paul Tattersall, Globex's managing director, said.
The biggest disappointment has been Globex's slow acceptance in Asia. Only a handful of the Globex terminals on trading desks worldwide are in Tokyo or Hong Kong, and none will reach Singapore before this summer. Globex backers say they have had a hard time reaching agreements with regulators and exchanges in Asia to distribute terminals. And Globex was started in 1992, just as Japanese investors, stung by recession, retreated from international markets. No Asian exchange has joined Globex yet.
 
Competition From Singapore
 Competition has also hurt. Futures contracts on Eurodollars -- dollar deposits held outside the United States -- are one of the Merc's major products, but, so far, Asian traders prefer to trade Singapore's version of Eurodollar futures in their pits to trading the Merc's contract on a Globex screen. With more than 30,000 Eurodollar contracts trading on an average day in Singapore, compared with fewer than 2,000 on Globex, Simex, as the Singapore exchange is known, offers traders far greater liquidity.
Globex has run into technological shortcomings as well. For instance, options have become bigger than Globex's designers expected. A sophisticated options trader may track relationships among several hundred products, far more than Globex's screens can conveniently display.
Globex technologists are currently scrambling to accommodate traders who rely on complicated mathematical programs that pinpoint trading opportunities and want to use computers to execute trades electronically the instant that conditions are ripe.
Some of the surprises have been positive. The biggest has been the surge in volume following the decision by Matif to join Globex a year ago and require all after-hours trading of its major French bond contract to move to the system. Matif routinely accounts for 80 percent to 90 percent of Globex's daily volume.
"I hope the Board of Trade stays on," Mr. Sander said, looking ahead to that exchange's board of directors meeting tomorrow. "But we're moving on either way."

HEADLINE: House Panel Given a Lesson in Hedge Funds

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
George Soros, the global high-roller whose billion-dollar currency bets have moved markets from Tokyo to New York, came to Congress today to deliver a tutorial on hedge funds to lawmakers.
Members of the House Banking Committee seemed to alternate between awe at being schooled by the man with the Midas touch and immense curiosity about the secretive world of hedge funds -- the partnerships of wealthy investors that scour the globe for often-exotic investments in currencies, bonds and stocks. The mystique of the funds seems to have been burnished -- rather than tarnished -- by tales of the wide swings they experience, including Mr. Soros's loss of $600 million in one recent currency deal. 
 Today's hearing was brought about by a strong feeling on Capitol Hill that hedge funds have become increasingly important in influencing global markets -- and may even have touched off the recent sharp drops on Wall Street. But the funds are so complex that even the lawmakers responsible for overseeing banks that lend them money were not quite sure how they worked and whether they needed to be specially regulated.
The most frequently asked question today by the committee members was: "Just what is a hedge fund?"
After noting that "the term is applied so indiscriminately that it covers a wide range of activities," Mr. Soros said that "the only thing they have in common is that the managers are compensated on the basis of performance and not as a fixed percentage of assets under management."
This approach has its dangers, he said, because if a fund is losing money, the manager "has a financial inducement to increase the risk to get back into positive fee territory rather than to retrench as he ought to." He avoids this problem, he said, because his fund managers have their own money at risk in the funds they manage.
Mr. Soros was more than happy to explain this and more to the lawmakers, but he also bluntly rebutted criticisms that hedge funds like his $10 billion Quantum Group of Funds helped foster the recent free fall of the stock and bond markets.
"Frankly, I don't think hedge funds are a matter of concern to you or the regulators," said the Hungarian-born billionaire, who has been in the hedge fund business since the 1960's.
 
Some Regulators Agree
 In some ways, the Government regulators, who also appeared at the hearing called by the committee's chairman, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, agreed with Mr. Soros. The officials, led by the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., assured the lawmakers that virtually all of the activities of hedge funds were already highly regulated under current banking and securities laws and that nothing new was required. This was also the view of John P. LaWare, the Federal Reserve governor who heads the Fed's committee on bank supervision.
But even the regulators said they wanted to know more about how the funds operated -- to make sure they were keeping pace with the risks and strategies in which these funds are engaged.
As a general rule, hedge funds pool money from groups of very large investors, who usually have to put up at least $1 million to participate. For every dollar that the hedge fund raises it might go to a bank and borrow $10 more, so a fund that begins with a pool of $100 million in equity may actually have $1 billion to play with in the market, thanks to its bank credit. This is called leveraging, and it greatly magnifies the economic clout of these funds.
The hedge funds then take their multibillion-dollar pools of money and make a bet. For instance, they might bet that over a certain period of time the Japanese yen is going to lose value against the dollar. So they enter into a futures contract in which they agree to sell yen at a certain set rate six months from today.
 
Bet Can Be Wrong
 If in six months the yen does fall in value, the fund can reap a huge profit. But if the bet is wrong, and the yen increases in value against the dollar, the fund can suffer a huge loss.
That is what happened last fall. Several huge hedge funds, including Mr. Soros's, bet that the Japanese yen was going to fall in value. They made that bet because they believed that President Clinton and Japan's former Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa were going to reach a settlement of their trade dispute last February and that such a settlement would lead the American Government to let the yen fall. The American Government had previously been encouraging the yen to rise in value as a tactic to put pressure on Japan in the trade negotiations, because if the yen is rising it makes Japanese exports more expensive and harder to sell around the world.
But Mr. Soros bet wrong. The talks between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa collapsed, and instead of the yen falling in value, it rose. Those losses were destabilizing because as banks demanded more collateral on the money they lent to the hedge funds -- a practice known as a "margin call" -- some of the hedge funds had to sell part of their holdings to raise the cash.
In this case, to cover their bad debt, many hedge fund dealers had to sell not only some of their Japanese securities but also some of their European positions. Hedge funds make dozens of simultaneous currency bets around the world, hoping that the winners will outnumber the losers. They are "hedging their bets," hence the name hedge funds.
 
Effect Felt in Europe
 But in this case, the forced selloffs by some dealers who had stocked up on yen caused a chain reaction on the other side of the world. Some other hedge fund dealers, who were not involved in Japan at all, had been betting that German and other European interest rates were going to fall, since the high unemployment there required these European governments to stimulate their economies. So they had stocked up on European bonds, assuming that as European interest rates went down the value of their European bonds would go up.
But when the hedge funds that lost money on the yen started selling some of their European bonds, it drove down the price of bonds all across Europe as well. This forced bond issuers in Europe to effectively raise their interest rates to keep attracting buyers.
That surprise move caught more hedge fund investors. Many of them had nothing to do with speculating in Japan but had been making what they saw as a sound fundamental long-term bet that trends in European economies were toward lower interest rates. Nevertheless, they, too, then had to sell some of their European bonds to cover their own margin calls. This, in turn, caused a rush to the door all at once that ravaged European bond markets and caused even worse losses for some hedge fund dealers.
Mr. Soros said he was not opposed to sharing certain information about his operations with Government regulators -- after the fact -- in order for the Government to understand more clearly why a market might have moved the way it did.
 
Sees a Danger
 But Mr. Soros said that sharing information with the Government while he was trading could not only hurt him financially, but be dangerous. If word got out about what bets he was making on certain bonds or currencies, it could lead to a stampede of copy-cat trades that might be enormously destabilizing.
"I strongly agree that regulators should gather sufficient data to be able to supervise markets," Mr. Soros said. "However, I suggest that such disclosure to regulators should not be made public. Such a disclosure could have a tendency to encourage trend-following investment. This could lead to greater market volatility."
The 63-year-old Mr. Soros generally tried to calm Congressional fears about hedge funds, saying: "I should like to emphasize that I see no imminent danger of a market crash or meltdown. We have just punctured a bit of a bubble that has developed in asset prices."
Mr. Soros said that if there were to be any new Government regulation of hedge funds it should be focused on leveraging.
"We do use borrowed money and we could cause trouble if we failed to meet a margin call," he said. But, he added, "If regulations are to be introduced, they ought to apply to all market participants equally."
Mr. Soros said it would be wrong to single out hedge funds when many investment banks, like Bankers Trust or Goldman, Sachs & Company, engage in the same sort of speculative trading for their own accounts as hedge funds do.
 
Derivatives Are Criticized
 He pointed a finger at mutual funds, and those who trade in financial instruments known as derivatives -- investments that are linked to interest rates, currency rates, stock prices and commodity prices -- as the real culprits in the market instabilities. He said they magnified market volatility by engaging in "trend-following behavior" -- buying in response to a rise in prices, which would tend to push prices even higher, or selling in response to a drop in prices, which would tend to push prices still lower, reinforcing whatever trend is dominant in the market.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency, told Mr. Gonzalez's committee that in his view, hedge funds do not pose a significant risk to the nation's banking system. Mr. Ludwig said that only eight national banks and nine national banking companies have a total of only $1.04 billion in credit exposure through loans or lines of credit to the funds. "Our examiners report that those banks are adequately controlling those risks," Mr. Ludwig said.
Nevertheless, he added, no one should ignore the potential the hedge funds have for destabilizing the markets when they make the wrong investment. The combination of their leveraged positions, complex trading strategies and instantaneous, 24-hour, global trading networks "has increased the rate at which shocks spread throughout the financial system," he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 20.22 as Low Volume Continues

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In the fourth straight session of unusually low trading volume, the stock market fell sharply yesterday, with many technology issues declining for the second consecutive day.
Stock traders got all the economic news that they wished for, but still refused to believe that inflation is in check and economic growth is moderate. 
 The outlook on inflation, interest rates and the level of corporate earnings are three factors that move markets. But traders yesterday managed to interpret positive signs in all three areas as reasons not to buy stocks.
Perhaps the only clear and convincing evidence for the stock and bond markets would be several months of low inflation readings. Such a process would mean the markets would not rally until well into the late spring or summer, some analysts say.
 
A Bright Spot for Traders
 If there was one bright spot for traders in yesterday's session, it was the restrained trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange of 279.4 million shares, or some 7 percent below that of a typical day.
Traders continued to sit on their hands, despite a fall by the Dow Jones industrial average of more than 50 points in afternoon trading. The 50.27-point fall led to special "circuit breaker" rules designed to slow high-speed computerized trading and thus reduce market volatility.
"Low volume is what you want to see in a corrective process," said David D. Holt, vice president, research and strategy for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "It means there isn't a mass exodus out of stocks, which is what you would see in a 400-million-or-500-million-share day."
Richard E. Meyer, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann Inc., said: "The guys who wanted to sell a lot have already sold. And the guys who wanted to buy don't want to buy until the dust settles."
For the record, yesterday's Consumer Price Index, the nation's most closely watched gauge of inflation, registered a small three-tenths of 1 percent increase and was within analysts' expectations, much like Tuesday's favorable two-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Producer Price Index. Modest inflation ought to influence the Federal Reserve Board to defer or moderate interest-rate increases.
And while some technology stocks, like Motorola, reported lower than expected first-quarter earnings during the week, the great majority reported profits that were within or exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations.
But it was to no avail. The Dow industrials fell 20.22 points, to 3,661.47 and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.31 points, to 446.26. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, where many technology stocks are concentrated, fell 11.84 points, to 727.38.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.89 point, to 247.46, with declining stocks outnumbering advancers by 1,505 to 696. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.74 points, to 437.95.

HEADLINE: 2 Railroads See Steep Increases in Ridership

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
During one of the worst winters in memory, the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road recorded steep increases in ridership in the first quarter of 1994, the railroads said yesterday.
Ticket sales rose 7.8 percent for Metro-North and 5.8 percent for the Long Island Rail Road, compared with the same period last year. 
 Officials of both railroads said the bad weather probably forced many commuters out of their cars. But they also attributed the increase in ridership to an improving economy and the railroads' own marketing efforts.
Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North, said higher ticket sales represented the payoff for a marketing campaign that included television and radio commercials and visits to suburban office parks. "This is the Good Ship Lollipop coming in for a landing," he said.
 
Seeing New Customers
 Metro-North sold an additional 349,000 tickets in the first quarter, out of 4,849,600 tickets.
The strongest category was "intermediate 10-trip tickets," which means a 10-trip pass good between two stations, neither of which is Grand Central Terminal. Those sales were up 13.6 percent, or almost 1,100 tickets. One-way, full-fare tickets were up 9.4 percent, or 175,100.
Monthly ticket sales, which have been flat for eight years, jumped 4.4 percent in the first quarter.
Arguing that Metro-North has won over new customers, Mr. Brucker said that storms generally force drivers onto the trains for a day or two at a time, but usually do not prompt them to buy monthly tickets.
He said that some riders may have been introduced to the trains by the weather, and stayed.
"Now they see the system, and see that it works well, and they like it," he said. "We think we're going to keep a number of them. How many we just don't know."
 
Off-Peak Hour Growth
 For the Long Island Rail Road, ticket sales were up 293,000, out of a total 5,350,000. The strongest increase was during off-peak hours. The number of rush-hour passengers boarding in Queens also grew.
The L.I.R.R. attributed the growth, in part, to better on-time performance, despite one storm this year that shut the line down completely. The on-time figure for 1993 was 92.9 percent, the railroad said.
"While the weather for the first two months of this year had a severe effect on the railroad and the region's transportation network," the railroad said, "on-time performance for the month of March 1994 was 91.1 percent, consistent with prewinter levels."
George F. Raed, director of marketing research at the L.I.R.R., said the economy was better, the number of off-peak trips was growing and the railroad looked more attractive than previously to people in eastern Queens. His department is conducting surveys to determine why.
The growth in off-peak travel may have come from increased part-time employment in New York City in service-sector jobs, he said.
 
Car Travel Down
 But some of the gain obviously came from weather, and was at the expense of car travel. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority said that toll collections on its nine bridges were down 11.4 percent in January and February. (March numbers are not available yet.)
Traffic on the Henry Hudson, which connects Manhattan and the Bronx, was off 20 percent in January and 14.6 percent in February; the Triboro, which connects Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, was down 12.3 percent in January and 9 percent in February, said a spokesman, Frank Pascual.
Mr. Pascual said that the bridges usually carry 750,000 vehicles a day. "We lost 75,000 vehicles just like that," he said.
The two railroads and the bridge and tunnel authority all have the same governmental parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
At New Jersey Transit, a spokeswoman, Penny Bassett Hackett, said that figures for January and February, the only two months of this year that have been compiled, would not be representative. But for the period between July 1, 1993, and the end of February, she said, total bus and train ridership was up 5.5 percent over the same period a year earlier.
The reason, she said, is an improving economy, good on-time performance, clean vehicles, heavy advertising and no fare increase or service cuts in the last three and a half years.

HEADLINE: Bigger Than Expected Budget Surplus Sets Off Fiscal Debate

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 13

 BODY:
Setting off renewed fighting over how much money the state can spend this year, the New York State Comptroller's office released a report today showing that the state finished the fiscal year that ended March 31 with a surplus of $1.5 billion.
The report also rekindled a debate over the strength of the state's economic recovery, and could further delay final agreement on the budget, now set at $33 billion, which is already 13 days late. 
 The report shows that the state's revenues were up 6.2 percent from the previous year, with business tax revenues growing by 9.2 percent and personal income tax revenues up by 5.5 percent. Some of the surplus was also the result of lower than anticipated spending by state agencies.
 
Room for a Tax Cut?
 The Republicans who control the State Senate said the numbers show that the economic recovery is robust and bolster their contention that business taxes can be cut without creating long-term problems for the state.
"The tax base is solid and growing at a rate that should encourage consideration of further tax reductions," said Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican.
But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, and aides to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said the report only reflects the previous fiscal year's cash surplus and can't be used to make rosy predictions for the coming year. Mr. Silver has warned that the Senate tax-cut proposal could cause budget deficits in future years.
The Comptroller, H. Carl McCall, echoed their concerns. "The Legislature and Governor should not see this surplus as an opportunity to start a spending frenzy," he said.
 
More Money to Spend?
 Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders also could not agree on whether the report showed that they now have more money to spend than they anticipated on April 1 when they reached agreement on the outlines of a $33 billion budget, when a surplus of more than $1 billion was already anticipated.
Mr. Cuomo said the report shows there is no additional money. Mr. Silver said it shows $100 million in additional revenue; aides to Mr. Marino put the number at between $100 million and $200 million.
All agreed that the additional revenue, if any, is a relatively small amount in a $33 billion budget.
"Even if there were more money than they expected, they should hold it for next year," Mr. Cuomo said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Speculation Fed Won't Raise Rates Soon

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday after Government reports indicating mild inflation prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates soon.
Currency traders sold dollars after the Commerce Department reported that domestic retail sales rose a modest four-tenths of 1 percent in March, while the Labor Department reported consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in March, in line with analysts' forecasts. 
 The reports suggest the Fed has less incentive to raise rates to head off rising inflation that usually accompanies economic expansion, traders said. Higher rates would make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
 
No Action by Fed Expected
 "The dollar got crushed after the economic numbers," said Tim Cunningham, a trader at American Express Bank.
Karl Halligan, a trader at ING Capital Markets, said, "Judging from these numbers, it looks like the Fed won't be doing anything with rates for the rest of this quarter."
The dollar was quoted late in the day at 1.7100 marks, down from 1.7161 marks on Tuesday. Meanwhile, gold for delivery in June slipped 40 cents, to $380.00 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver for delivery in May rose 1 cent, to $5.315 an ounce.
Speculation that the Bundesbank would lower German interest rates kept the dollar from falling further against the mark, traders said.
Many expect the German central bank to lower rates to revive the country's slumping economy. The Bundesbank last cut interest rates on Feb. 17, when it lowered the discount rate to 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent. The discount rate is the lowest rate banks pay to borrow from the Bundesbank.
"No one is going to sell the dollar aggressively before a Bundesbank meeting," Mr. Halligan at ING said.
 
Canadian Dollar Rises
 The dollar fell to 103.40 yen from 103.70 yen yesterday.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar rose against the United States dollar for a second day amid signs that the Canadian Government would further curb its deficit spending. Prime Minister Jean Chretien said yesterday that his Liberal Government will announce more budget cuts in the "millions of dollars" soon.
The Canadian dollar rose to 72.73 United States cents yesterday, from 72.58 cents in New York late Tuesday. The currency fell to a seven-year low of 71.48 United States cents on Monday.
Meantime, the British pound was little changed at $1.4765. The dollar fell to 5.8505 French francs from 5.8686 francs and weakened to 1.4405 Swiss francs from 1.4451 francs. The dollar fell to 1,630 Italian lire from 1,634 lire.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Compaq Computer wins respect in a volatile industry.

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
WITH investors suddenly skittish about technology stocks, a personal computer company whose share price has more than doubled in eight months would look ripe for a fall. And the Compaq Computer Corporation's stock has retreated from its 52-week high of $105.625 reached last Friday to $98.25, down $2.625, yesterday.
Yet analysts are surprisingly optimistic about the prospects for Compaq over the next year, an eternity in the personal computer industry, where corporate fortunes can reverse overnight. Analysts, including Lucianne Painter of Salomon Brothers and David Wu of S. G. Warburg, say Compaq's share price may well reach $120 or so over the next 6 to 12 months. 
 The consensus estimate for Compaq's first-quarter earnings, which will be reported next week , is $1.70 a share, up 38 percent from the comparable 1993 quarter, according to the First Call Corporation. For 1994 as a whole, profits are expected to be up more than 30 percent.
The reason for the upbeat prognosis is that more than any other company, Compaq has streamlined and retooled its business model, selling profitably to every slice of the competitive PC market. "Compaq has the position everybody else would like to have," said Philippe de Marcillac, director for personal computer research at Dataquest Inc.
Compaq's profit margins have held steady over the last five quarters. In the fourth quarter, for example, Compaq's operating margin -- profits as a percentage of revenue before taxes and interest expenses -- was 10.3 percent. By contrast, Apple's operating margin was 2.6 percent, AST's 4.6 percent and Dell's 3.7 percent.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Houston-based Compaq has been able to maintain a respectable profit margin, in spite of an aggressive drive to increase its market share. In 1993, its share of the worldwide personal computer market was 8.5 percent, more than double its 3.5 percent two years earlier, the International Data Corporation estimates. This year, analysts predict Compaq's sales will grow at twice the industry's rate, allowing it to surpass Apple Computer as the second-largest company in the industry, trailing only I.B.M. and closing the gap.
"What's so impressive about Compaq is that it has not yet had to sacrifice profits to increase market share," said Eric Lewis, the manager of personal computer hardware research for International Data.
Analysts point to an expected new-product announcement next week as an example of Compaq's present strength. The company will introduce new top-of-the-line models intended for business customers, called the Deskpro XL line. The move, in some ways, is similar to other manufacturers' upgrades to offer systems that use Intel's high-speed 486 and Pentium chips.
But with its research and design resources, analysts say, Compaq has overhauled everything from chip sets to exterior casings in the new line. And, they add, the company is pricing the lower-end new machines $500 or more below the models of comparable performance that they replace.
"That will intensify competition in the premium lines of personal computers and narrow the price gap between premium and midrange lines," said Mr. Lewis of International Data.
But looking out the next six months or year, there are still questions about Compaq's ability to keep up the current momentum. It will not be easy in an industry where new-product generations are measured in months, not years. Analysts have one lingering concern about the target set last year by Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's chairman: become the biggest personal computer company by 1996. That is an ambitious goal; Compaq finished last year with an 8.5 percent share, compared with 11.6 percent for I.B.M.
Chasing the market-share target, analysts warn, could undermine Compaq's profits, and thus the stock price. Still, there is little evidence of that to date. "Compaq is firing on all cylinders, and the outlook is for continued strength," said Todd Bakar, an analyst for Hambrecht & Quist Inc.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
China's approach seems a winner, but the test isn't over.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IS "shock therapy" necessary, or even useful, for curing what ails the failed socialist economies?
Boris N. Yeltsin's Russia, until recently advised by Western economists and institutions identified with the get-it-done-yesterday school of reform, has yet to take off. Meanwhile, China, which took the seemingly conservative route of grafting a free market economy onto the established planned economy, has, in the words of the economist Stanley Fischer enjoyed "the greatest increase in economic well-being within a 15-year period in all of history." 
 But before declaring the gradualists to be the winners in this great economic debate, it makes sense to look closely at whether China's success has much to say about Russia's failure. And probably the most serious effort to do just that will be published in the next issue of the European-based journal Economic Policy.
Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard and Wing Thye Woo of the University of California at Davis argue that China began with what the economic historian Alexander Gershchenkron dubbed the "advantages of backwardness." And they even speculate that the Chinese (who have yet to reach the living standards of Russians) will soon face the contradictions of their piecemeal reform.
Since economic growth means a bigger pie, everyone could be made better off by increasing the size of every slice. But the process is hardly automatic. And at the heart of the resistance to every shift from central planning to decentralized free markets -- fast or slow -- is the valid fear that there will be big losers as well as big winners.
China, Professors Sachs and Woo argue, has been able to finesse this worry with a combination of luck and political skill. In the late 1970's, reform was tried in agriculture, which had been relentlessly exploited to sustain higher levels of consumption in the cities and to finance industrial investment. Farm productivity rose so rapidly in the first few years of privatization that rural income could increase sharply without reducing the surpluses creamed off for the cities. There were virtually no losers, and thus virtually no opposition.
By the same token, private industry grew without exacting a toll on the state-owned industrial dinosaurs. The labor fueling the spectacular rise of export-oriented light industry along the south coast of China came from the vast surplus in rural areas. And much of the capital came from abroad.
Indeed, the two economists suggest, not only was there no inherent conflict between the prosperous new economy and the stagnant old one, there were also major synergies. The new demand for labor relieved some of the social pressure on rural China, which no longer had a commune system to guarantee subsistence for families that added little or nothing to output. And domestic production of higher-quality goods embodying Western technology reduced production costs for state-owned heavy industry.
What's more, prosperity in the south substantially increased the demand for currency and bank deposits, allowing Beijing to print money to keep hemorrhaging state enterprises alive without creating uncontainable inflation. This bonus from what economists call "seigniorage" is no small thing: Professors Sachs and Woo put it at about 8 percent of national income.
Contrast China's serendipitous flexibility with Russia's rigidity. Russian agriculture is heavily subsidized, so there is little prospect of short-term gain for farmers who forsake the womb of the collective. State-owned industry, construction and transport employ 52 percent of the Russian population, compared with just 19 percent in China. So the burden of keeping the inefficient state sector alive and fully manned is far greater.
Or, to put it another way: The Chinese were down so long that it all looked like up to them. Russians, with fewer prospects for rapid productivity change and much more to lose by abandoning the job-based social safety net, are trapped by their relatively high state of economic development and unrealistic short-term expectations.
Seen from this perspective, the comparison between Russia and China looks less like a test of rapid versus slow reform and more like an ironic historical joke. Russia, which for centuries has measured its success or failure by comparisons with the West, is far worse positioned to mimic Western economies.
Still, the most striking idea in the Sachs-Woo analysis is that China's prospects for no-losers growth may be running out. Beijing's ability to finance state enterprises without inflationary consequences turns on the improbable willingness of newly affluent Chinese to hold their wealth in cash rather than in tangible property. And the productivity gap between rural and urban dwellers is generating the capitalist revolution's first high-profile losers in the form of a vast migratory labor class.
The resulting social friction has yet to turn into political heat. But it may, the authors imply, unless the Government finds the will and way to reshuffle income now used to keep the peace in the state sector.

HEADLINE: Congress Loath to Finance GATT Treaty's Tariff Losses

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 13

 BODY:
After seven years of negotiations, a new global trade agreement will finally be signed Friday in Morocco. The treaty weighs 385 pounds and runs to more than 22,000 pages. It eliminates or freezes so many tariffs around the world that it is expected to stimulate some $5 trillion in new trade by the year 2005. There's a problem with it, though: It may not be ratified by the United States Congress anytime soon.
Why? No one can figure out how to pay for it. 
 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, involves the lowering of tariffs, which are taxes levied by governments on imports. Under the very tight pay-as-you-go budget rules in Congress, any reduction in a tax -- even one that as with the GATT agreement is expected to promote billions of dollars in new business and income tax revenue over the long run -- has to be compensated for either by a tax increase somewhere else or by spending cuts.
Since GATT is projected to cost $13.9 billion in tariff collections over the next five years, Congress and the White House are required by law to come up with an equal amount.
"We've had such a hard time trying to find the money that at one point I suggested to the Administration that maybe we could get it by raising some tariffs," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "I will do my damnedest to resolve this problem, but we could genuinely end up with an embarrassment."
Everyone agrees that it is ludicrous that a multitrillion-dollar treaty should be imperiled for lack of $13.9 billion -- small change in Washington terms. But, as Senator Moynihan remarked, with the current air-tight spending limits, "We are not a very grown-up government in budgetary matters right now."
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said his office had three independent studies that showed that in the next five years the Treasury would collect about $3 in revenue for every $1 lost in tariffs because of the GATT accord.
GATT, he said, "will contribute about a trillion dollars to our gross national product over 10 years -- that's the low end," adding, "So it's an enormous economic winner. But we can't count all that in the pay-go concept."
 
Fear of Voters
 With the budget already cut, and 1994 Congressional elections making lawmakers queasier than ever about any kind of tax increase for fear of raising voters' anger, no one knows how to get out of this budget box.
When some Clinton Administration officials broached the idea of Congress waiving the pay-as-you-go rule, it was quickly rebuffed by Republicans who do not want to give the Clinton team any precedents to use in financing health care or welfare reform. So it's back to the ledger.
"No one wants to look at something on either the spending side or the revenue side that is so controversial it undercuts the treaty getting passed," said Leon E. Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget. "It is my job to find a solution that doesn't cross that fine line."
Mr. Panetta said he is looking for a combination of spending cuts and fees that "are either innocuous or don't impact on major constituencies."
The latest idea floated by the White House is a royalty tax on some of the new transmission frequencies being granted to communications companies. But that has the communications industry up in arms.
The advantage that GATT has over the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Panetta said, is that there is no "huge political controversy surrounding it, so the funding issue is not taking place in a heated emotional atmosphere."
 
No Shortage of Opponents
 Or is it? As the approval debate on the GATT agreement gets closer, opponents are coming out of the woodwork. For instance, Public Citizen, the consumer group founded by Ralph Nader, takes issue with the role of the newly created World Trade Organization, which will oversee GATT's operations and serve as a global referee to settle trade disputes.
Public Citizen argues that the new GATT agreement will shift decision-making over sensitive matters, such as what pesticides can be used in growing food or whether American environmental laws can protect dolphins from tuna fishermen, to a group of unelected, faceless trade bureaucrats in Geneva. This tension between the environmentalists and the GATT bureaucrats -- known as "Flipper vs. GATTzilla" -- has a certain resonance on Capitol Hill.
"The danger for Americans in GATT," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's trade section, "is that the World Trade Organization would find many U.S. health, safety and environmental laws to be illegal trade barriers, which the United States must eliminate or face sanctions. Congress must either see to it that a moratorium is put on the environmental and consumer-related parts of the World Trade Organization, or they must reject the GATT agreement. Most members have not focused on it, but when you show them the language, they say 'Holy cow!' "
 
Some Would Start Again
 Congressional Democrats make it clear that they want any GATT financing legislation to be bipartisan, so that they are not punished by voters for a tax increase while the Republicans get the credit for all the trade benefits GATT brings. But some Republicans say they do not want any credit; they want a different agreement.
In order to secure the GATT accord, the Clinton Administration agreed to demands, mostly from European nations, that they be allowed to subsidize basic and applied research of some prized high-tech industries, like the European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie, which competes with American aircraft makers.
"For me, the big problem is this subsidies code," said Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, whose state is home to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. "This agreement green-lights certain subsidies for research and development, and we are saying that is too big a loophole. Airbus and others can walk right through. It is too late to renegotiate the treaty, but we must reach side agreements with some key manufacturing countries that really tighten up this subsidies code."
Otherwise, Mr. Danforth said, other nations will subsidize their critical industries, and then "we have to decide whether we want to lose these industries or get into a subsidies war that involves budget problems and picking winners and losers."
"I think the arguments will be compelling either to fix this or defeat it," he added. "GATT's ratification is not a done deal."
 
Nothing's Perfect
 This sort of talk exercises Mr. Kantor. "No code that is going to be adopted internationally will ever outlaw all subsidies," he said. "The fact is, it was the production and development subsidies to Airbus that were the most pernicious, and most of those are now either greatly limited or outlawed by GATT. Only basic and applied research is now allowed, and do you know which country spends more on that than any other? The United States. No one is even close to us."
The programs that will be most protected, Mr. Kantor argued, are ones begun in the Reagan and Bush years, like Sematech, the semiconductor industry consortium that works to pool American resources to maintain dominance in the industry.
White House officials are convinced that at the end of the day, no Republican with Presidential aspirations, like the minority leader, Senator Bob Dole, will want to stand in the way of such a pro-business treaty as GATT.
Senator Moynihan said that Republican concerns about the subsidies issue could not be dismissed, but that they should not be a reason for rejecting the GATT agreement. Countries, he said, "don't get rich subsidizing their exports."

HEADLINE: Black Composers Of Classical Music: Striving for More

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 9

 BODY:
"We are the invisible people in music," said Kevin Scott, a 37-year-old composer, echoing Ralph Ellison's phrase about the black man in society. He is part of a small but dedicated group, a minority within a minority: black musicians who compose for the concert hall.
In less formal venues, black Americans have been at the heart of musical life, the originators of ragtime, jazz, blues, gospel, soul, disco and hip-hop. But in the concert hall, black composers have been marginal. Their impact on the evolution of art music has been minimal. 
 For three days here last week, though, they were far from invisible, as 122 people -- composers, administrators, conductors, students and other interested parties -- gathered under auspices of the Detroit Symphony orchestra for a symposium on black American composers, the fifth annual event of its kind.
Beginning with a competition in which four compositions were played in an open orchestra rehearsal and then at the weekend's subscription concerts, the forum, sponsored by the Unisys Corporation, included detailed discussions of the works, along with career advice for black composers. There were also many conversations in which senior composers who have made careers against great odds traded insights with young, academically trained composers.
 
Relating Race and Music
 Composers usually assemble in groups according to shared stylistic interests. Here, the shared factor was race, and nearly everybody was examining what relationship race had to the music itself. This is precisely what administrators of the Detroit Symphony had in mind: it has turned itself into a laboratory for exploring issues of race and music.
During the last decade, the Detroit has been something of a pioneer in facing the problems that affect many American urban orchestras. Its troubles have in many ways reflected those of Detroit itself, which has gone from middle-class capital of the automobile industry to one of the country's most economically troubled cities. The symphony's white audience has moved to the suburbs and the overwhelmingly black population that remains has shown little interest in the orchestra's traditional activities.
During the 1980's, ticket income dropped, there were two strikes and, in 1989, the state legislature threatened to withhold funds unless the Detroit began to reflect the racial composition of its surrounding population. The demand was that a black musician be hired immediately, overturning the race- and sex-blind auditions that have become standard practice for American orchestras. The symphony acquiesced (to the shock of many in the music world). A black bass player, who was regularly filling in with the orchestra as a substitute, was hired, becoming the second black in the orchestra. But in 1991 the state, stricken by continuing economic problems, canceled $3.7 million in expected support anyway. This created a financial crisis, and each player accepted a cut in pay and benefits worth over $40,000.
 
A Daunting Challenge
 Against that backdrop, the Detroit's competition for black composers has become a small part of what is probably this country's most ambitious affirmative-action program to increase the involvement of black musicians, composers and listeners in the life of an urban orchestra. Not even 2 percent of symphonic musicians in the country are black, so the task is daunting. In fact, the Detroit has found no other qualified full-time black players since 1989.
But 12 of 66 members of the symphony's board are black. The associate conductor, Leslie B. Dunner, is black. All auditions, though they remain blind, must include a black applicant. There is a fellowship program in which young black performers essentially become apprentices, playing and studying with the orchestra; fellows are coached for auditions and are partially reimbursed for expenses even when trying out for other orchestras. In addition, the Detroit plays music of black composers in concert, and is making recordings of important black American compositions.
There is also a spirit of optimism among the players, despite the vast empty lots surrounding Orchestra Hall, where one is warned not to take a stroll. Some of it has to do with the success of Neeme Jarvi as music director; ticket sales have gone up at double-digit rates each year since he came in 1991, and the orchestra, with a budget of $17 million, finished last year with a surplus.
The Detroit's recording schedule has picked up; Mr. Jarvi will have recorded more than 30 CD's with the orchestra by 1996. And it has been invited to play at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland next year. The Detroit is also one of the few orchestras still heard on radio; concerts are broadcast in 511 markets, including New York, and reach 975,000 listeners a week. (It is to play in Carnegie Hall on April 23).
 
A Larger Presence
 The affirmative-action programs have clearly contributed to the change in atmosphere. The Detroit's presence in the city's musical life has expanded. It recently played at the mayor's inaugural celebration and regularly plays at a national N.A.A.C.P fund-raising dinner here that attracts 10,000 people.
There is still no proof that an art can find devoted audiences simply on the basis of racial identification with its practitioners -- the racial composition of subscription-night concerts has not appreciably changed -- but legislators have become supporters of the orchestra, and corporations, courted by the orchestra's executive director, Mark Volpe, are becoming more involved. And people here like Nancy Malitz, a former music critic for The Detroit News who has reported on racial issues in the orchestra, sense a more favorable attitude toward the Detroit among the city's blacks.
Still, the symposium highlighted the complications of trying to increase the participation of a particular ethnic group in a particular artistic tradition. The fact is that although each of the four new compositions displayed musical gifts, none would probably have been singled out in a standard composing competition.
Donald E. Dillard's "Childhood Scenes," which won the competition, includes a narration in which the composer recalls piano lessons, baseball games and church services. Mr. Dillard, 53, an organist and choir master in the Philadelphia area, has a fine ear for orchestral color, but the music is singlemindedly and rather obviously pictorial.
Dolores White's "Celebration" is meant to recall the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, but Ms. White, who is an assistant professor of music at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland and "older than 50," as she put it, does not bind her occasionally spirited tonal riffs into a compelling narrative.
The most interest was in the works by the two youngest composers. Jonathan B. Holland, whose "Martha's Waltz" was inspired by "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," is 20 and a student at the Curtis Institute of Music. His conservative piece, with its slightly awry, catchy waltz, has a verve and charm that made it a crowd pleaser.
Daniel Roumain's "Haitian Essay" -- a politically inspired evocation of Haiti's agonies -- was liked least by the judges, but it had large ambitions in its collage of violent musical effects, edgy dissonances, aleatoric noise and ruthless thrust. At 22, Mr. Roumain, a graduate student at the University of Michigan, tried for too much effect, but often did so with intelligence.
While the talents of such young composers will determine the future of black American concert music, the point of the symposium was not so much to discover major new works as to help a community take shape.
 
Trying to Define the Essence
 What makes music by a black composer black music? Alvin Singleton, 53, who delivered the keynote address, suggested in an interview that it was not the self-conscious invocation of black pop styles or jazz, but the life experience of the composer.
Some of the senior composers in attendance, like Hale Smith, who is 69, felt instead that there was an unbroken tradition. It might reach, perhaps, from such composers as Frank Johnson and Harry Lawrence Freeman, through William Grant Still and George Walker. Portia Maultsby, an ethnomusicologist at Indiana University, traced the evolution of popular black musical styles, arguing that black classical music shows similar influences.
The younger composers, like Mr. Roumain and Anthony Kelley, who won the competition last year, are actually trying to create a cross-fertilization among different genres. Mr. Roumain wants to write a "Rap Symphony," saying that there is a useful analogy to be made between rap and sprechstimme, the pitched, sliding speech used most famously by Schoenberg. The issues of self-definition kept recurring.
The symposium may mark a new stage in the evolution of this small but dedicated subculture, as Marsha Mabrey, the director of the symposium, pointed out in an interview. There was no anger this year, nor were there any accusations of tokenism like those made by Mr. Walker two years ago in a bitter lecture.
Antoinette Handy, who recently retired as director of the National Endowment for the Arts' music program, even told the participants: "Get off that bag that African-American composers do not have the opportunities of other composers. Racism exists. Of course it does. But options for African-American composers are no different from options of any other composers."
The challenges may also be similarly mundane: to be less invisible and more audible.

Anniversary Waltz

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Anniversaries of great occasions are news events that can be covered with care. Assignment editors, who rarely have the luxury of dealing with the expected, are rubbing their hands at 1994's summer of commemoration.
First: June 3, 1994, is the fifth anniversary of the bloody suppression of the peaceful demonstration in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. 
 A fitting way to mark this historic occasion is to reprise in every medium the indelible photograph of the lone man stopping the line of tanks.
The most suitable way for politicians to observe what the Chinese press delicately calls "the incident of June 3" is to accommodate the private wishes of the Chinese leaders regarding our threatened withdrawal of most-favored-nation trade status.
That surprising suggestion is based on the iconoclastic theory that Beijing is acting rationally in its recent human rights crackdown.
Inflation in China has soared to 26 percent per year. This loss of purchasing power is a source of growing anger among workers, threatening the ability of the jittery regime to avert turmoil after Deng Xiaoping dies.
How to stop rampant inflation? By slowing the economy, of course -- but that will increase unemployment. How does Beijing divert blame for austerity to foreign devils? With subtlety: by re-jailing the paramount dissident, Wei Jingsheng, thereby forcing President Clinton to suspend M.F.N.
Result: sharp reduction of Chinese exports to the U.S., which will close inefficient factories, raise productivity and curb inflation. Villains throughout the painful adjustment are the intrusive Americans and the destabilizing dissidents.
No Beijingologist has a better theory to explain why China is provoking Mr. Clinton to suspend M.F.N. If cutting off trade to spite inflation is its way of insuring both economic and political stability, we should accommodate China's desire to scuttle M.F.N. on the June 3 deadline date.
Three days later is the 50th anniversary of D-Day. American, British and other Allied forces stormed the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944, and President Clinton will be there to remind Europeans of our recurrent repayments to Lafayette.
How best to celebrate this golden anniversary of General Eisenhower's "great crusade"? It cannot be a replay of the memorable, made-for-movies, misty-eyed spectacle at the 40th. Let Clinton be Clinton, whatever that means; realists hope it does not mean dishing out another mushy helping of last December's "partnership for peace" Pablum.
As circumstances change, so should policy. The President should use this forum to reject both regional isolationism and impotent multilateralism, and instead urge the inclusion of Eastern Europe and the Baltics into NATO's military alliance.
His return-to-Oxford speech should be more serious than sentimental, focusing on this generation's need to defeat incipient fascist or Communist movements, and on the Western democracies' responsibility to lead the inexorable march toward individual freedom.
And that's just June. The next month, on July 20, we observe the 25th anniversary of the most soul-stirring moment of the previous generation: the landing of a man on the moon.
That would be the proper moment for all the liberal deriders of "Star Wars" to take a new, nonideological look at the need for a global nuclear shield. Soon we may have to take out the plutonium plants of North Korea, thereby to prevent nuclear blackmail, which might well trigger conventional war; wouldn't the world be better off with a space-based defense against missiles that would remove the incentive in rogue states to build bombs?
Saving only one cityful of people is worth a few billion a year. To paraphrase a cliche of the past generation, if we can put a man on the moon, we should be able to put in place a defense that does not permit any unauthorized missile to get far off the ground.
Finally, the moon landing triggers the memory of another 25th anniversary, on July 19, of an accident that ended dreams of a political Restoration. But the loss of a young person's life at the Chappaquiddick bridge is best memorialized at a private service.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Federal Reserve officials say they see no signs of accelerating inflation, but the nation's central bank is signaling anew that it will raise short-term interest rates again anyway. The reason: the officials believe that low short-term rates have already encouraged too much lending, giving stimulus to an economy that no longer needs it.
The goal of the Federal Reserve, according to its papers, Congressional testimony and interviews over the last two weeks, is a so-called neutral policy rather than a stimulative one. But the Federal Reserve's definition of neutral is likely to feel like a tap on the brakes to most Americans, slowing growth as companies and individuals pay more interest on their loans and mortgages. 
 The Federal Reserve's stance means that investors, who have been trading in declining, turbulent markets the last month, may not be able to find comfort even if monthly inflation reports continue to show that current price increases are moderate, as was indicated by the data for March issued this week. Despite the positive numbers, the Federal Reserve will still be leaning toward pushing short-term interest rates higher.
The Federal Reserve's desire to slow growth slightly could also irritate the White House, which has signaled repeatedly that it sees no risk of inflation and little need for substantial increases in interest rates. The stock and bond markets fell sharply after both previous Federal Reserve increases, prompting President Clinton and other top Administration officials to reassure investors that the economy was healthy.
In an Op-Ed article in Friday's issue of The New York Times, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, argues that inflation is in check and that "the financial markets appear to be reacting more to inflation myths than to realities." [Page A31.]
The Federal Reserve stimulates or reins in the economy by changing short-term interest rates, as it did with quarter-point increases in its target on Feb. 4 and March 22. At the time, financial markets interpreted the move as a sign that the Federal Reserve perceived incipient inflation that had somehow escaped private economists and investors.
To avoid roiling the financial markets, top Federal Reserve officials do not like to talk publicly about their plans for changing interest rates. Privately, they have let it be known that they do not see any immediate signs of accelerating inflation. But still they are signaling that they are uncomfortable with the current strong level of economic growth because it would eventually feed inflation.
Federal Reserve officials like to say that their old policy was accommodative to economic growth while the new policy is "neutral." Many people have interpreted this as meaning that the Federal Reserve is neither seeking to brake nor accelerate economic growth. But the truth now seems to be more subtle.
The Federal Reserve is really try-ing to make the economy grow at a rate that its officials consider neutral: the fastest rate possible without feeding inflation. The conviction of Federal Reserve officials is that a neutral rate of growth is equal to the growth rate of the economy's underlying capacity to produce goods and services. But such a policy implies some slowing of the economy.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, personally signaled the Fed's stance in a little-noticed remark during his last testimony before Congress on monetary policy. "We must move toward a posture of policy neutrality -- that is, a level of real short-term rates consistent with sustained economic growth at the economy's potential," he told a House Banking Committee panel on Feb. 22.
By most economists' estimates, the growth rate in the economy's underlying capacity, which depends mainly on productivity gains, is expanding nearly 3 percent a year. Most economists think the economy is growing faster than that now.
 
Consnensus on Growth
 Nobody knows for sure how fast the economy grew in the first quarter because the official figures will not be available until April 28. But the consensus estimate of prominent corporate economists is that the economy grew 3.3 percent in the first three months of the year. Lowering the growth rate to a "neutral" level below 3 percent will require higher short-term interest rates, Fed officials believe.
Economies with many unused factories and unemployed workers can temporarily grow faster than the rate of total productive capacity, by putting these factories and people to work. But once the economy is operating near full capacity and full employment, inflation begins to rise as companies bid up wages and prices for factory goods.
The main interest rate the Fed uses to influence the economy is the Federal funds rate -- the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Fed funds rate is currently pegged at 3.5 percent, after the two increases earlier this year, which were the first in five years. Officials refuse to say precisely how much higher the Federal funds target would have to be to bring down borrowing and spending so that the economy does not grow more than 3 percent. Private economists estimate that a Federal funds rate of more than 4 percent but less than 5 percent is needed for this to occur.
The timing of further interest rate increases has posed more of a problem for Fed officials than whether to raise rates at all. The main reason Fed officials are not raising rates more quickly right now is their worry that consumers are already financially strained and may cut back sharply on spending if rates continue to rise.
Forecasts of a Federal funds rate between 4 and 5 percent appear consistent with the reasoning of Fed officials. The Fed has paid extremely close attention in recent months to the amount by which the Federal funds rate exceeds the inflation rate. From 1955 to 1980 this gap averaged slightly less than a percentage point, and in the 1980's it tended to run several percentage points higher. Right now the difference is only half a percentage point. (The gap is used as an approximation of the real Federal funds rate, which is the amount by which the Federal funds rate exceeds investors' expectations of inflation).
Economists inside and outside the Fed have tried over the years to estimate the neutral level for this gap. The consensus is that the rate is higher than the historical average during economic recoveries and lower than the average during economic slowdowns. This suggests that the Fed will soon raise the Federal funds rate again and probably the discount rate as well, which is the rate at which the Fed itself makes short-term loans to banks.


GRAPHIC: Federal Reserve officials pay close attention to the gap between the Federal funds rate and inflation. The shrinking gap suggests to some economists that the Fed will rase short-term rates again, because a small or negative spread, if sustained during a recovery, eventually could produce inflation. The graph tracks the rate of inflation and the Federal funds rate since 1983. It also tracks the gap between the two over the same period. (Source: Lehman Brothers) (pg. D5)

HEADLINE: Leading Pickets, the Teamster Chief's Future May Also Be on the Line

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Three years ago, Ron Carey, a bodyguard at his side, drove an old Chevrolet to teamster locals around the nation in a grass-roots campaign for the presidency of an institution that had became a national symbol of corruption and brass knuckles.
Mr. Carey, chief of a Queens local, barely won, with just under half the votes in a three-man race in which less than half the members voted. Mr. Carey is running hard again, this time to save face and win something big for a union that still does not quite accept him. 
 He is leading 70,000 teamsters in a strike against Trucking Management Inc., a consortium of 22 freight carriers, in a fight against the companies' demand to use part-time workers, the central issue in the strike that is in its ninth day.
After calls today from Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, who expressed concern about the potential economic impact of the strike, the two sides said they would resume talks on Monday after a two-week hiatus.
Even so, Mr. Carey said he would press ahead with the strike, staging rallies and demonstrations. His credibility and his control of the nation's biggest nongovernment union are at stake, and they conspire to leave him little ground to give.
 
A Line in the Sand
 M. Carey has drawn his line in the sand on the employers' insistence on replacing full-time jobs with part-time jobs, "It's an issue that has to be taken on," he said at a news conference today, "head on."
Both Mr. Carey and Trucking Management Inc. have become entrenched. It is the teamsters' first nationwide strike in 15 years and the second ever. Before the Federal deregulation of trucking in 1980, the trucking industry and the teamsters enjoyed a cozy relationship.
Until then the Interstate Commerce Commission granted the companies highway monopolies, allocating routes among them and letting them fix rates. They charged their customers prices that insured their own profits and generous wages for the teamsters. President Jimmy Carter, who was concerned that rising teamster wages were driving up inflation, proposed legislation opening the business to all comers. Congress approved it, and as a result thousands of nonunion companies poured into the trucking business.
The companies affected most were those that load their trucks with the goods of many customers. Most of the 23 companies that make up Trucking Management contend that to survive they must bring their labor costs more into line with those of their nonunion competitors.
The teamsters who load the trucks and sort the freight are paid more than $17 an hour, plus $5 an hour in benefits -- about twice the pay of nonunion workers. Drivers, paid 43 cents a mile, can earn that much and more when they are on the road. With overtime, many drivers earn more than $50,000 a year, at least twice what nonunion drivers earn.
To cut costs, the consortium wants to hire part-time loaders, who would get $9 an hour and eventually do 24 percent of the dock work. The companies also want to cut back on the number of drivers by moving as much as 35 percent of their freight by railroads. Other unions affected by deregulation, like those of the airline workers, have made such concessions, and the heat of foreign competition has brought similar concessions from workers in many other industries.
 
'Confronting All Americans'
 But Mr. Carey disputes the companies' argument that survival requires more low-wage, nonunion, part-time jobs. Efficient employers can prosper and pay good wages, he says, and if the inefficient fold, so be it. That leaves more room for the strong ones to hire more teamsters.
"This is an issue confronting all Americans," Mr. Carey keeps proclaiming. "Part-time jobs, temporary jobs, no benefits, no pensions. I'm not going to add to the problem now by adding more part-time jobs. This is a fight about what's wrong with America."
There is also a personal issue at stake. Mr. Carey has suffered major embarrassments as head of the union. He trades on an image of living simply in a modest home in Queens and for having chopped his salary to $150,000, from $225,000. But in recent weeks he has acknowledged buying comfortable retreats in the sun, if with his own savings.
Accusations of corruption also continue to plague the union, raising questions about Mr. Carey's effectiveness in ending them. A strike he called against United Parcel Service in February crumbled in a day when some locals refused to go along. And last month the membership defeated, by 3 to 1, his proposal to raise dues by 25 percent.
Sensing weakness, officers of the old teamster regime who were defeated in races for higher office in 1991 have seized on these missteps. They cannot try to run him out of office until the next national election in 1996, and most support the strike.
But from their roosts in regional offices, they are pressuring Mr. Carey, harassing the lieutenants he sends to monitor them and assailing him by fax and press release. Mr. Carey struck back last month with a plan to shut down his opponents' outposts. He calls them inefficient, self-serving and a $14 million annual drain on the union.
The offices maintain that they provide invaluable services, helping to organize members and negotiate contracts. But Mr. Carey says his people in Washington can handle those tasks, just as they are managing the trucking negotiations.
Labor experts suspect that the consortium of trucking companies thought it could exploit the divisions within the union by letting the strike proceed. Companies in the consortium are just regaining the revenue they lost in the recession. And with their tens of thousands of rigs immobilized at terminals, not a dime is flowing into their coffers now, and small competitors are running off with their freight. As a result, the consortium has begun to fragment.
"I suspect that they thought the teamsters wouldn't stick together, and that they could split the teamsters politically," said Michael Belzer, a former teamster who is an expert in labor relations at Cornell University. "If that's so, they've miscalculated and exacerbated a conflict they will certainly lose."
 
Backing From an Opponent
 One of Mr. Carey's most outspoken critics, R. V. Durham, a regional leader in North Carolina and one of the men Mr. Carey beat for the presidency, backs his strategy in the strike.
"I have my differences with Mr. Carey," Mr. Durham said. "But basically all of us have agreed to try to get behind this effort. The employers have painted themselves into a corner."
If dividing the union to bring it around fails, the three biggest companies have another strategy. They have acquired their own low-wage, nonunion carriers. Too small yet to take over much of the business lost in the strike, they stand as a longer-term threat to teamster jobs and a way to frighten the strikers.
But that gives Mr. Carey one more reason to dig in. The richer the contract he wins, the better the case he can make in trying to organize the nonunion companies' workers.
He thinks he can show those workers that he can arrest employers' use of low-wage and part-time jobs. "I'm not negotiating a loss of the future for American workers," he told reporters today. "This is not my role here."

HEADLINE: 3 Players, 3 Agendas, One 3-Way Tug of War Fate of New York Coliseum Still Uncertain

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
It is, by most accounts, one of the most valuable potential development sites in New York City.
Yet nine years after Mortimer B. Zuckerman won the right to build a giant retail, residential and office complex to replace the New York Coliseum, the fate of the site is now tangled in a complicated three-way battle involving the developer, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Giuliani administration. 
 Although the three players say they share the goal of replacing the dreary-looking exhibition hall and office building with a new development that would generate tax revenue and jobs and brighten a corner of Central Park, the months of often bitter negotiations have made it increasingly clear that each has its own notion of how that goal is best achieved.
And looming above all the bitterness is the issue of mayoral politics and the question of whether actions by the Giuliani administration or its predecessor were made with partisan considerations.
 
Digging In His Heels
 Mr. Zuckerman, who had blamed the depressed real-estate market, dug in his heels and refused to pay the $338 million contract price that he agreed to pay years ago. Last month Mr. Zuckerman filed suit against the M.T.A., which owns the site, and the city, its partner in the transaction, claiming that the current contract is not valid. He maintains that he still wants to buy the property at 59th Street and Columbus Circle, but admits he is growing tired of the process.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose campaign last fall won the endorsement of Mr. Zuckerman's newspaper, The Daily News, has been pressuring the M.T.A. to agree to the developer's proposal for a price cut. The Mayor has argued that it is critical to complete the deal so the city can start reaping the tax benefits that Mr. Zuckerman's development would produce.
But the transit agency, which has tentatively agreed to a substantial price cut -- the most recent proposal is a $100 million deal for half of the original site -- has said price is not the only issue and that for the public good it cannot give in to pressure from City Hall to compromise just to get the project going.
In fact, despite the heated rhetoric of recent months, city and M.T.A. officials say Mr. Zuckerman and the agency have made progress in their negotiations and are close to agreeing on a purchase price.
 
A Monday Deadline
 Although the struggle over the Coliseum's fate had been going for for years, the battle lines have been drawn more sharply in recent days as Mr. Zuckerman approaches a deadline of April 18 -- Monday -- for closing the deal. If Mr. Zuckerman does not take advantage of an extension permitted under the contract, he will be required to close on the deal or forfeit a $33.8 million line of credit.
Last week the Giuliani administration proposed restoring $50 million in budget cuts to the transit agency in order to persuade it to "close the deal."
But after questions were raised about whether the offer was simply an effort to aid a campaign supporter, city officials withdrew it, even though they defended the move as a way of sparking economic development.
"Now, here's the city's interest in it," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview yesterday. "We need jobs, we need a construction project. It would be a real shot in the arm of the city to have a construction project."
The property in question is not just another piece of New York City real estate. Situated on a majestic corner of Central Park, any new development would be the gateway to the Upper West Side and sit above a major subway transportation hub. As a sign of the area's attractiveness, Donald Trump announced a plan last month to convert the nearby Gulf and Western tower into a luxury residential building.
Mr. Zuckerman's company, Boston Properties, is under a 1989 contract to build a 2.1 million-square-foot complex of offices, apartments, restaurants and stores at the site. After the last of a series of lawsuits from residents and environmentalists concerned that the original project was too big, Mr. Zuckerman protested that the project was no longer feasible because of the city's depressed real-estate market.
As a result, the city, Mr. Zuckerman and the M.T.A. reopened negotiations last July in an effort to strike a new deal on a scaled-down version of the project.
Despite speculation that Mr. Zuckerman is trying to back out of his commitment to building on the Coliseum site, Mr. Zuckerman said he still wants to build the project, the latest version of which envisions 700,000 square feet of office space and 150,000 square feet of retail space.
"I want to build," he said. "You don't put nine years and four months and equity into a project like this to walk away."
But he acknowledged that he is weary of the struggle. "If I had it to do over again," he said, "I don't think I would."
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani expressed his frustration at the delays and what he felt was the M.T.A.'s unreasonable resistance to sound proposals, including having an independent appraisal of the property in an effort to settle on a fair price. He also rejected speculation that the maneuvers from City Hall have been motivated by politics.
"It has nothing to do with politics," the Mayor said. "It has nothing to do with anybody supporting anyone. This is right now, this offer is the one that has the best prospect of getting something going there in the next year."
Still, this is not the first time questions have been raised about political motivations and the Coliseum. Last December, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Zuckerman criticized the Dinkins administration for siding with the M.T.A. in trying to force the developer to close the deal, saying it was a vindictive political move to punish Mr. Zuckerman for The Daily News's endorsement of Mr. Giuliani.
For its part, the M.T.A. has said it has resisted pressure to strike a deal to get the project under way because it views the Coliseum as a public asset whose value the agency has the chance to exploit only once.
"We are mindful of the need for development there," said Susan Fine, real estate director for the M.T.A. "But we view the Coliseum as an asset whose value will be turned into a capital subsidy for transit. We think of its worth in terms of how many subway stations we can renovate with the proceeds from the sale.
"We benefit once from this deal," Ms. Fine added. "For the city the real estate taxes go on in perpetuity."
Specifically, while the M.T.A. has indicated that it would accept $100 million, it is concerned about details like the amount of the down payment that would go with the new price and how much time it will give Mr. Zuckerman to complete the negotiation.

HEADLINE: Fortaleza Journal;
Bouquets for a State as Brazil's Dust Bowl Flowers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORTALEZA, Brazil

 BODY:
"Fortaleza: Brazil's Miami," a Rio newspaper gushed recently, describing a beachfront city of European tourists, foreign investors, imported cars, a thriving fashion industry, a new international yacht marina and steel-and-glass shopping centers with theaters showing Hollywood's latest films.
Ten years ago there was little to envy in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceara State. This northeastern dust bowl seemed condemned eternally to export its population, hat in hand, to work in Brazil's developed south. 
 But in seven years, Social Democratic government in Ceara has cut infant mortality by a third, drawn two-thirds of Fortaleza's street children into schools and produced state economic growth rates three times the nation's average.
"It proves that the basket case of Brazil can turn itself around," said David B. Atkinson, the Inter-American Development Bank's representative for Brazil.
Now this Alabama-sized state -- small for Brazil -- is to loom large in a sharpening struggle over Brazil's future. In six months Brazilians are to elect a new President.
For more than a year, polls have indicated that the head-and-shoulders front-runner is Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, a bearded socialist whose red flags and lack of government experience unnerve the middle class.
The strongest challenger is a Social Democrat, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, an urbane Sao Paulo senator. Election rules forced him to step down on March 30 as Economy Minister. Although he governed Brazil for 10 months as de facto Prime Minister, his record is not a vote-getter. On his watch, Brazil's inflation rate increased by one-half, hitting 45 percent a month in March, so Mr. Cardoso, a sociologist, is expected to try to swivel national attention to Ceara.
Since 1987, Ceara has been a laboratory for a development formula that the Social Democrats want to implant across Brazil: an aggressive attack on social ills paired with an equally aggressive courtship of private investors.
Trimming government to the essentials, Tasso Jereissati, the first Social Democratic Governor here, dismissed one-third of the state government workers. Tax laws were enforced, and the government paid its debts.
"Ciro has done a lot for the people, and he doesn't steal," Josalito Darcy Barbosa, a 23-year-old brewery worker, said, referring to Ceara's current Governor, Ciro Gomes. In nationwide public opinion polls, Mr. Gomes consistently ranks as Brazil's most popular Governor.
The state has started health-care programs that have won international acclaim. One program, Long Live the Child, lifted Ceara from near the bottom to near the top of Brazil's 26 states in child-protection indicators: vaccinations, breast-feeding and visits to pediatricians. With an army of 7,400 health agents visiting the state's poorest households every month, Ceara has reduced childhood diseases and has virtually wiped out polio and diphtheria.
Starting last year, the government extended to three-quarters of Ceara's municipalities Long Live the Woman, a program that offers cancer testing, prenatal and gynecological care and family planning help. Increasingly an international showcase for third-world health care, Ceara's Health Secretariat now receives financial and technical aid from 16 international organizations.
"I bet that Ceara gets more international aid per capita than any other state in Brazil," Mr. Atkinson said. "They have attracted good people into their ranks, and that translates into their capacity to put together good projects fast."
The Development Bank is financing three-quarters of a $403 million road and sewer project for Ceara, one of Brazil's largest infrastructure projects. By 1996, sewer coverage in this city of 1.8 million people is to expand from 16 percent to 65 percent. This should prevent a return of cholera, which surged through shantytowns here in January.
Ceara is also courting investment. "There has been enormous amount of deregulation," said Ivan Martins, a director of a real-estate company. "You can open a company here in one day, while elsewhere in Brazil it will take one month. A friend of mine, an advertising director, left his car in the middle of a Sao Paulo traffic jam and moved up here."
With new high-rises sprouting, Fortaleza has become one of Brazil's busiest construction markets. Throwing a $9 billion state economy into high gear, $2 billion in business investment projects are under way, a third of them by foreign investors. Ceara's economy has expanded by 24 percent since 1987, while Brazil's economy grew by 8 percent.
With $500 million in tourism investments under way, Ceara officials expect the number of visitors to double to one million by the end of the decade.
Tourism officials recently arranged with local hotels and an airline to provide free air tickets and hotel rooms to a crew filming a soap opera here for Globo, Brazil's most widely watched station.
It will be worth the trouble, said Antonio de Matos Brito, president of Coditur, the state tourism agency. "Imagine what happens when your state is featured on Globo every night for eight months running."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities' Yields Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The bond market, which has focused solely on domestic issues of late, was reminded of global uncertainties yesterday as yields of Treasury securities rose to their highest levels in two weeks.
Reports that two United States Army helicopters had been shot down over northern Iraq caused bond prices to tumble and oil prices to jump at the start of trading yesterday. The market calmed down a bit after the State Department confirmed that it had been American fighters that mistakenly shot down the helicopters, and not Iraqi forces. 
 Market analysts said as events unfolded there was a flight to the shorter end of the Treasury market, with gold and crude oil gaining on the heels of heightened tensions.
 
Help From the Bundesbank
 The market was helped, however, by the announcement by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, that it was cutting its discount rate to 5 percent from 5.25 percent and its Lombard rate to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent. Economists believe that with the German rate now closer to the United States', it will be competitive as a result.
The price of a 30-year long bond late yesterday fell 8/32 , to 8719/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from prices, rose to 7.28 percent, from 7.26 percent on Wednesday. The price declines were by no means restricted to the long maturities, as bills and intermediate notes also fell under selling pressure.
With the bond market focused on international events and today's release of March industrial production data, the report yesterday of the number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits had little impact. The claims report showed a rise to 348,000, from 336,000 the previous week. But analysts attributed the gain to seasonal factors.
The Government also released its report on business inventories for February, which was in line with economists' forecasts.
Ron Reuss, chief economist for Piper Capital Management, said one of the market's concerns had been capacity utilization, which if comes in today at the 83.7 percent medium estimate will not be a major concern. "In the major restructuring of U.S. corporations, we've written off a substantial amount of unproductive capital," Mr. Reuss said. "In the past, the threshold for inflationary pressures, or the number that inflation would become a problem, was about 84 to 85 percent capacity utlilization. But with globalization of markets we are no longer constrained to U.S. capacity because we can outsource products, as the automotive industry has done for years."
The Piper Capital economist sees the price of long-term Treasury securities as a bargain at the current first quarter inflation level.
"The fundamentals in the market have not looked any better in my 25 years as an economist," Mr. Reuss said. "I'm looking at the ability of the economy to grow at a 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent rate."
 
Corporate Bonds
 In the corporate bond market, MCM Corporatewatch, a new issues research and information firm, said only two deals were priced yesterday. The two issues, however, totaled $1.15 billion in junk bonds and both are related to acquisitions.
Thrifty Payless sold $550 million in junk bonds to finance the acquisition of Payless Drug Stores Northwest Inc., from the Kmart Corporation. The TCH Corporation formed Thrifty for the expressed purpose of financing the acquisition. The two-part financing was handled by underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. In the first part, rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service and B by Standard & Poor's, $250 million of 11.75 percent senior notes due in 2003 were priced at 100. The final $300 million of 12.25 percent senior subordinated notes 2004 were also priced at par.
The senior subordinated issue rated B3 by Moody and B- by S.& P., was done as a unit offering and included the issuance of class C common shares of the Thrifty Payless Holdings Inc., the holding company. The Huntsman Corporation, a Houston- based chemical maker, which is buying the Texaco Chemical Company, Canada Texaco Inc. and certain other assets from Texaco Inc., sold $600 million in junk bonds through BT Securities yesterday.
The two-part sale included $200 million of 10 5/8 percent first-mortgage notes due in 2001 at a price of 100, and $400 million of first-mortgage notes due in 2004 at 100.
Both parts are noncallable for five years and rated B1 by Moody's and BB- by S.& P.
Market traders said that despite the rise in interest rates, the deals were critical to making acquisitions and had to be done, and noted that the Payless deal was sweetened with higher coupons and common stock to insure its sale.

HEADLINE: Gore Insists Environment Is a Trade Issue

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco, April 14

 BODY:
Looking beyond a sweeping global trade agreement that will be signed here Friday, the United States said today that future trade negotiations should include discussion of environmental and labor questions, despite the opposition of many developing countries.
In an address to the closing meeting of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Vice President Al Gore said that the effect of expanded trade on the global environment and the well-being of workers could be debated for the first time when GATT's successor, the World Trade Organization, is created next year. 
 But with many developing countries expressing fear that these issues could offer pretexts for new forms of nontariff protectionism, Mr. Gore went out of his way to sound reassuring and nonconfrontational.
"The United States realizes that many countries fear that folding labor standards into the world trade context exposes their exports to potential forms of concealed trade restrictions," he said. "The United States will resist any effort to convert the issue of improved labor standards into a form of protectionism."
But Mr. Gore said that protection of natural resources was essential to improving world living standards. He insisted, though, that Washington opposed "green protectionism," under which nations might be denied trade benefits for environmental reasons.
The four-day conference here concludes more than seven years of negotiations on trade liberalization under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, The final ceremony Friday brings together ministers of more than 100 countries, who will take turns signing the 22,000-plus-page agreement lowering tariffs around the world.
The negotiations have been known as the Uruguay Round because they began in the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este in 1986.
Suspicion of American motives in linking trade to labor and environmental concerns runs deep in many third-world countries, especially the large exporting nations of Asia. "We see no merit whatsoever in the attempt to force linkages where they do not exist," Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee of India warned on Wednesday.
Today, Pakistan's Commerce Minister, Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar, echoed similar concerns about what he called "a new brand of protectionism under the garb of protection of the environment or the promotion of the rights of workers in developing countries."
Trade Minister Yeo Cheow Tong of Singapore, whose Government has frequently said that Western democracies try to impose their vision of human rights on the rest of the world, also warned against "the use of trade to bring external pressure for change in countries' domestic political or social structures."
 
Wedge for Broader Campaign?
 In raising issues like child labor, slave labor and the right to collective bargaining, the United States has said that it is not trying to eliminate the competitive edge of low-wage exporters. But the third world fears that the discussion of these issues could lead to broader debate of poor working conditions in many countries.
France, which has backed the American initiative, has argued that its industries, which are burdened by high wage and welfare costs, face growing difficulty competing against those in nations where workers do not enjoy long vacations and generous pension and maternity rights.
Mr. Gore used his one-day visit here to meet privately with Morocco's King, Hassan II, and with Japan's Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata, who is widely expected to become his country's next Prime Minister after Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation last week.
Mr. Hata, talking with reporters before his conversation with Mr. Gore, noted that the new government was still being formed. But he pledged that the coalition would continue the reforms initiated by Mr. Hosokawa and would "pursue further market openings in Japan" to take account of its huge trade surplus.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Calmed by Cuts In 2 German Interest Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was steady against leading currencies yesterday as concern about weak American stock and bond markets was offset by optimism about cuts in German interest rates.
Traders bought dollars after the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by a quarter-point, to 5 percent, and lowered its Lombard rate to 6.50 percent from 6.75 percent. The discount rate is what the German central bank charges commercial banks for loans, while the Lombard rate is what banks pay for emergency borrowing. 
 Many traders sold dollars later as United States bond prices fell and stocks languished.
The dollar was quoted late in the day at 1.7096 marks, up a fraction from 1.7091 marks the previous day. Traders often buy dollars when German rates fall because lower rates make mark-denominated deposits less attractive.
"What the dollar needs to get going is some money flowing into U.S. stocks and bonds," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange adviser for Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "Global pension fund managers haven't been putting money in U.S. assets."
The dollar fared better against the yen yesterday, mostly because European central banks aided the Bank of Japan and bought dollars for yen, traders said. The Bank of Japan often tries to curb the dollar's slide because a strong yen hurts Japan's manufacturers by making their products more expensive abroad.
 
Concern About Trade Talks
 The yen strengthened against the dollar in Tokyo trading amid persistent concern that United States-Japanese trade relations would suffer in the wake of the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan a week ago.
"The dollar will remain under pressure until there's progress in trade talks," said Koichi Takenaka, assistant vice president for Industrial Bank of Japan in New York.
The dollar was quoted at 104.29 yen in late New York trading, up from 103.40 on Wednesday.
Gold prices rose yesterday. The gold contract for June delivery rose 30 cents, to $380.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
In other currency trading, the British pound was little changed at $1.4775. The dollar rose to 5.8505 French francs from 5.8481 francs, and strengthened to 1.4430 Swiss francs from 1.4396 francs. The dollar was steady at 1,633 Italian lire. The Canadian dollar fell to 72.48 cents (United States) from 72.72 cents.

HEADLINE: In Surprise Move, Germans Cut Both Key Interest Rates

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, April 14

 BODY:
The German central bank, in an effort to help calm turbulent financial markets, cut its two key interest rates today and set off a round of similar small cuts across Europe. The Bundesbank also held out the prospect of further gradual reductions if inflation continued to decline.
The bank has a reputation for keeping its focus on only Germany and its fear of inflation, as was the case in a crisis in 1992 that led to a rupture of the European Monetary System. So it was a little surprising for the Bundesbank president, Hans Tietmeyer, to point out that the interest-rate cuts were made with a view beyond the improvement in Germany's inflation outlook. 
 "We believe today's decision will calm the financial markets," he said, referring to recent selloffs in stocks and bonds in the United States and Europe and speculation about further increases in American interest rates.
"The Bundesbank's role," he added, "is to reassure investors that they can have confidence over the long term."
In emphasizing a desire to calm troubled markets, Mr. Tietmeyer also acknowledged that the central bank's council of rate setters had discussed the consequences of the collapse this week of a huge German commercial real estate empire after the mysterious disappearance of its chief, Jurgen Schneider, owner of its bank accounts along with his wife.
"We are watching these developments very carefully," Mr. Tietmeyer said after the central bank's meeting today, "but I don't have enough information to make a judgment on what their effect will be."
He said the Schneider company's difficulties had no effect on the bank's decision to lower interest rates.
The Bundesbank had not been expected to lower its discount rate today, yet it did so by one-quarter of 1 percent, bringing it down to 5 percent -- 3.75 percentage points lower than at the record high in the summer of 1992. The discount rate is what the central bank charges commercial banks for loans, and it has the effect of setting the floor for German money market rates.
The bank also lowered by one-quarter of a point the Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling on German money market rates, taking it to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent. This was a smaller cut than had been expected, since money market rates are now well below 6.5 percent.
 
Salomon Not Enthusiastic
 In a statement after the Bundesbank's announcement, Salomon Brothers International said that "the latest Bundesbank rate cuts may help foster business confidence, but are unlikely to relieve market uncertainties about the interest rate path over the next year."
The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and Denmark all lowered their discount rates after the German announcement this afternoon, and in Washington, Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, who has repeatedly urged the Germans to keep cutting, welcomed the move as a stimulus to the German economy.
Despite the announcement, however, major European stock indexes ended the day slightly lower.
Mr. Tietmeyer warned that the Bundesbank would act cautiously. "Exaggerated interest rate reductions would risk rekindling fears of long-term inflation," he said after the decision by the central bank council, which consists of seven members of the Bundesbank's directorate and the bank's nine state presidents.
 
Further Talk of Inflation
 "The task of the Bundesbank," he said, "will continue to be to dampen expectations of inflation, and therefore to be very cautious in making interest rate reductions."
But the council noted that "the prospects of a continued reduction in the rate of inflation have improved," and said it assumed inflation would keep declining in coming months.
The bank last lowered its discount rate, to 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, on Feb. 17.
"It was a clever move to lower it again today because nobody expected that," said Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank. "It was certainly justified because the economy is still shaky."
German inflation, which was running well above 4 percent a year ago, fell to 3.2 percent in March and will probably be below 3 percent by the end of this year, Mr. Tietmeyer said today. But with unemployment running close to 10 percent and nearly four million Germans out of work, any economic growth is expected to be modest.
In the meantime, the whereabouts of Mr. Schneider remained a mystery today, as dozens of German banks that had underwritten his commercial real estate projects with an estimated $5 billion met with the company's shocked and baffled management to discuss what to do.
Prosecutors here announced that they had started a criminal investigation of the Schneiders after a complaint by Deutsche Bank, which had the most exposure, with loans believed to total $760 million.

HEADLINE: Top Dayton Hudson Officer Retiring

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In an announcement that was greeted with a shrug on Wall Street, Kenneth A. Macke, the Dayton Hudson Corporation's chairman and chief executive for the last decade, said yesterday that he intends to retire in July.
Robert J. Ulrich, chairman and chief executive of Target, Dayton Hudson's largest operating division, was named by the retailing company's board to succeed Mr. Macke. 
 Mr. Ulrich's appointment as chief executive is effective immediately. He will assume the additional title of chairman in July, when Mr. Macke retires.
Mr. Macke, who is 55, has long expressed a desire to take early retirement, analysts said yesterday. That may be one reason why investors scarcely reacted to the announcement. Dayton Hudson's shares closed at $75 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up 25 cents on the day.
Analysts cited two other reasons why the announcement did not rattle investors.
Despite continued problems at Mervyn's, the California-based softgoods chain, Mr. Macke is leaving Dayton Hudson in fairly sound shape. And Mr. Ulrich, his sucessor, is widely regarded as a highly talented executive.
"Some things could have been done better," during Mr. Macke's tenure, said David A. Poneman, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "But he has left everything essentially healthy."
In a telephone interview, Mr. Macke acknowledged that "Mervyn's would not be one of my great success stories."
But he added that much of the chain's recent problems have had much to do with the ailing California economy, and said the company was "very optimistic" about the division's prospects this year.
Despite those problems, Mr. Macke said his decision to step down "was not the result of any disagreement with the board."
Rather, after a 33-year career at Dayton Hudson, Mr. Macke said it was time to get off what he called the corporate treadmill.
"I have spent my entire career marching to a calendar," he said. "I want to decide to do some other things where I don't have a calendar."
For the foreseeable future, he said, "my fondest wish is that I will have the willpower to do nothing."
It is not altogether surprising that Mr. Macke might want a rest.
Among other things, during his tenure, Dayton Hudson successfully repelled a $6 billion hostile takeover by the Haft family, thanks in large part to the stock market crash in October 1987. Revenues more than tripled, from $6.5 billion in 1983 to $19.23 billion last year. During the smae period however, earnings rose at a much slower pace, to $375 million last year from $246 million in 1983.
"Earnings have been less consistent at Dayton Hudson than at other retailers because they have always done things to invest in the long-term good of the company," Mr. Poneman said. "That is not true for a number of other retailing companies," whose sights are more often trained on short-term results.
Mr. Ulrich, who is 50, began his career at Dayton Hudson as a merchandise trainee in 1967, six years after Mr. Macke joined the company.
He was named president of Target in 1984 and chairman and chief executive three years later. He joined Dayton Hudson's board of directors last year. "He is a dynamic leader who has brought Target to the level it is today, elevating it to be the quality discount store in the United States," said Walter Loeb, who runs his own retail consulting firm. "Basically, Target is carrying the company.

HEADLINE: Inventories and Sales Both Rose in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 14

 BODY:
Business inventories rose in February for the sixth time in the last seven months, but were outpaced by sales as both indicators scored their biggest gains since November.
Analysts said today's Commerce Department figures, generally in line with economists' predictions, were a sign there was room for manufacturing expansion in the months ahead. 
 In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits jumped by a surprising 12,000 last week to the highest level in more than a month. Most economists, expecting an improving unemployment picture, had forecast a decline.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 348,000, up from a revised 336,000 during the week ended April 2.
Also, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported mortgage rates declined this week for the first time in two months as 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.26 percent.
The 30-year rate was down from last week's 8.47 percent, the highest in nearly two years. This week's rate is still about one and a half percentage points above the 25-year low of 6.74 percent in October.
The Commerce Department said business inventories rose half a percentage point in February, while sales increased 1.2 percent.
The inventory increase followed a gain of two-tenths of 1 percent for January, which was previously estimated by the Government as unchanged from December. February's rise was the largest since a jump of half a percentage point in November.
 
Biggest Gain Since November
 Similarly, it was the biggest sales gain since a 1.2 percent rise in November. Sales have also increased in six of the last seven months.
Stocks held on shelves and backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted $871.4 billion, the Commerce Department said.
Sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted $617.3 billion, rebounding from a dip of four-tenths of 1 percent in January.
Michael P. Niemira, an economist with Mitsubishi Bank in New York, said even though sales outpaced inventory growth in February, "inventories are holding in line over all with sales."
Factory inventories have stayed low, he said, lagging behind increases at the wholesale and retail levels.
"The mind-set in the purchasing community is to keep those numbers down," he said. But he said in the months ahead factory inventories would likely catch up.
The inventory-to-sales ratio was 1.41 at the end of February, compared with 1.42 the previous month. That means it would take 1.41 months to exhaust stockpiles at that sales pace.
The ratio figure is viewed as a positive sign, with any further pickup in sales likely to translate into new orders to factories.
For many economists, the steady pace of inventories suggests room for expansion since businesses have been keeping their inventories lean and at historically low levels.
At the retail level, inventories rose six-tenths of 1 percent, to $273 billion, in February. They were up three-tenths of 1 percent at factories, to $380 billion, and up eight-tenths of 1 percent at wholesalers, to $218.4 billion.
February sales for retailers were up 1.6 percent, to $181.5 billion. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that retail sales in March advanced only four-tenths of 1 percent, lower than most economists had predicted and at a pace consistent with moderate growth.

A Matisse No More
Some fakes can fool even the most seasoned experts. Sotheby's had a surprise recently when it began researching paintings from the estate of the New York collector Harriet Weiner Goodstein, which the auction house is selling next month. "Woman in an Interior," a 1943 still life of a woman in an ornately patterned room, had been attributed to Matisse ever since Mrs. Goodstein and her first husband, Leon Mnuchin, bought the painting in 1956 with Eugene V. Thaw acting as the agent. 
 "I was in my mid-20's and had a shop in the Algonquin Hotel where I sold books and lithographs," recalled Mr. Thaw, now a prominent Manhattan art dealer. "Mr. Mnuchin, who was a very smart lawyer, had his office around the corner and would come into the shop from time to time. One day he brought me a photograph of a painting, which was in a private collection in Florida, near where my parents lived. He financed me to go to Florida and get the picture."
Since Matisse had died only two years before, Mr. Thaw said, no archives yet existed where his works could be authenticated. So Mr. Mnuchin showed the painting to Alfred H. Barr Jr., who was then the head of the Museum of Modern Art and a leading Matisse expert, and to Paul Rosenberg, Matisse's dealer. Both men, now dead, identified the painting as a Matisse, Mr. Thaw said.
David Nash, the director of Impressionist and modern art for Sotheby's worldwide, said: "Over the years a lot of dealers, scholars and auction house experts saw the Matisse." He added that "nobody had any idea" there was anything wrong.
Neither did Mr. Nash, who estimated that the painting could fetch $5 million to $7 million at auction. That was before he began researching the painting for the sale's catalogue. "I did think it was strange that the painting had never been illustrated in books or in exhibitions, which is unusual for a late Matisse," Mr. Nash said.
When he approached Wanda de Guebriant, the director of the Matisse archives in Paris, she said that the archives included a photograph of the picture and a note written by Marguerite Duthuit, Matisse's daughter, saying that the work was not by her father's hand. The note was written in either 1959 or 1960, when the painting was on exhibition in Belgium. Ms. de Guebriant told Mr. Nash she had no idea where the painting had gone.
Until now. Some experts believe the still life could have been painted by Elmyr de Hory, a Hungarian-born artist who was a well-known forger of Matisses in the 1950's. The painting is a pastiche, imitating many elements characteristic of Matisse. The woman is sitting next to a table with plants and a bowl of fruit on it, nearly identical to the objects on a table in "The Lute," a Matisse of the same date.
"I'm pretty good at spotting fakes, but in this case there's a suspension of disbelief," Mr. Nash said. "When you hear about a great painting that's in a great collection, it's like walking into a museum. You presume it's right." Sotheby's has withdrawn the painting from its estate sale.
Mr. Thaw said he had not seen the painting in 35 years and hadn't heard a word about it until he learned that Sotheby's was selling works from the estate. "I feel bad, but it happened so long ago I don't think there's anything to be done," he said. "I was only acting as Mr. Mnuchin's agent, and we checked it out with the best people of the time."
 
A Move to Paris
 Leslie Waddington sees the future, and it has a French accent. Mr. Waddington, one of London's most prestigious dealers of contemporary art, recently announced plans to close one of his five Cork Street galleries and open a gallery in Paris. "I'm just beginning to look for a space," Mr. Waddington said in a telephone interview this week. "It won't happen for two years."
The dealer said that as customs barriers between France and England were removed on Jan. 1 and with Sotheby's and Christie's marshaling forces to eventually hold auctions in Paris, it is important to "go where the source material is."
Doing business in Paris has its advantages: the value-added tax on the work of living artists is 17.5 percent in London and only 5.5 percent in France, and the London contemporary-art scene is still smarting from the recession.
"London has great assets, but it doesn't have the buying base or the material anymore," Mr. Waddington said. "Not only are there more rich people going into France than London, but I can find works like Matisse drawings and Miros in Paris."
 
Fresh Air for a Winter Show
 The powers behind the Winter Antiques Show seem to have got their act together. They have named new co-chairmen for next year's Manhattan show: Louis Bowen, who heads Louis W. Bowen Wallpapers, and Arie Kopelman, the president of Chanel in the United States.
They replace Bill Blass and Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest. Also just appointed is Catherine E. Sweeney, a former associate publisher of two magazines -- Art and Auction, and Art and Antiques -- to be the new manager. Miraculously, everybody seems happy.
The 40-year-old event has had a long history of discontent: dealers fighting with the manager; board members of the the East Side House Settlement in the South Bronx, the show's beneficiary, fighting with the manager; dealers fighting with one another. When this year's show closed on Jan. 30, James F. McCollom Jr., its top official, and N. Pendergast Jones, its manager, abruptly resigned, citing differences with the East Side board. The dealers, meanwhile, weren't happy with the vetting process or the pre-show publicity.
By choosing Ms. Sweeney, the antiques show is trying to find someone who knows the business and can work well with both the dealers and the East Side board members.
"It's a terrific step in the right direction," said Joan Mirviss, who heads the dealers' committee. "Although we haven't met her yet, she knows about art and antiques and how to manage people."
Ms. Sweeney said she planned to "to work on upgrading the show and to bring back the loan exhibition, which was a big draw in years past."
Questions remain. Does Ms. Sweeney plan to weed out inferior dealers? Will the show continue to have European participants or become strictly an American show?
"We haven't begun to talk about dealers yet," she said. "But there will be an overall review. I think we will come up with more formal guidelines about getting into the show."

Crying Out for Love Where Only Money Talks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
Peter (Vitus Zeplichal), a fanatically hard-working construction worker who bows and scrapes his way through Rainer Werner Fassbinder's sadly compelling "I Only Want You to Love Me," is one of the more poignant social casualties to be examined in the films of the great German director.
A caricature of a dutiful son and model employee, he regards the world with frightened rabbity eyes that plead for a love he is incapable of demanding out loud. Instead of verbalizing his needs, Peter tries to buy with gifts the love he craves so desperately but doesn't believe he deserves. In one scene after another, he is shown standing on a doorstep, a silent supplicant holding a wrapped bouquet of flowers. 
 The film's Manhattan engagement, which begins today at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, is the American premiere of a movie that was made in the mid-1970's but not released in the United States until now because of legal problems. Based on a true story from a German anthology called "Life Sentence," it offers a merciless view of bourgeois German society in the feverish grip of capitalism. The cost of West Germany's postwar economic miracle, it suggests, was emotionally and spiritually devastating.
The world it portrays is an environment in which the value of everything can be measured in monetary credit. Especially in the scenes of Peter's shopping sprees, the clerks have the look and body language of well-dressed mannequins guarding precious goods that have the glow of sacred icons. The credit agreements that Peter signs assume an almost religious significance. So much of the movie is devoted to detailing the financial plight of a couple living beyond their means that it might as easily have been called "Tragedy on the Installment Plan" or "Time Payment Madness."
At the same time, the story is a typically blunt and bitter Fassbinder parable of a misfit ground down by the relentless social machinery. Without delving deeply into the psychological whys and wherefores, it presents Peter as an eager, uncomplaining slave to the needs of his cold, imperious parents. The movie's opening scenes show him single-handedly building a house for them and then receiving only scant gratitude. A flashback of the young Peter being spanked suggests that the parents always confused administering discipline with giving love.
Peter shyly courts a neighbor, Erika (Elke Aberle), and then marries her in a ceremony at which the parents wear expressions of grim disapproval. After deciding to seek his fortune in Munich, which he is warned is the most expensive city in Germany, Peter takes a job on a construction site and rents a small two-room apartment. Once he has settled in with his wife, he is as desperate to please her as he was his parents. Not only does he furnish the apartment lavishly, but he also showers Erika with expensive gifts that he can't afford, going ever more deeply into debt.
The situation spins out of control when Erika becomes pregnant, and Peter is forced to buy maternity items on credit. The turning point of the drama comes when Erika insists Peter ask his parents for money, and he cannot bring himself to do it because it would be a sign of his failure. With no escape from his problems, Peter cracks up and commits an act of senseless violence against a man who resembles his father.
"I Only Want You to Love Me" looks at Peter from three distinct perspectives. The bulk of the film sees the world through his eyes. It is a cold, scary place in which everybody -- employers, store clerks, patrons in a bar -- exudes an ominous authoritarian aura, and he is the only person in the world who is unsure of his place. Periodically, the story is interrupted by documentary-style snatches of an interview with Peter by a prison psychiatrist, in which the prisoner seems merely bewildered. Now and then, the director intrudes with printed commentary expressing outrage at Peter's plight.
"I Only Want You to Love Me" is a grim Germanic variation on a classic theme that can never bear too much repeating: Can't buy me love.

HEADLINE: No Giveaway on the Coliseum

 BODY:
New York City has an undeniable interest in getting the old Coliseum site at Columbus Circle developed after years of delay and neglect -- but not at the expense of the public good. That is what makes the behavior of City Hall's chief negotiator, Deputy Mayor John Dyson, so regrettable. He sounds more like an agent for Mortimer Zuckerman, the developer, than a public servant.
Even if Mr. Dyson is motivated only by his zeal to encourage development, and not by any desire to reward a political ally, he has so mishandled the negotiations that they are tainted. How could Mr. Dyson propose that the city -- through hidden tax abatements and backdoor capital budget maneuvers -- subsidize a real estate developer at a time when the Mayor is demanding sacrifice from nearly every city agency and worker? 
 Stimulating the economy is one thing, and providing tax breaks and economic incentives to businesses that create jobs, including NBC, Chase Manhattan and The New York Times, is a common economic development tactic. But the sale of publicly owned, prime real estate is especially sensitive. Valuable properties should not be sold off in a climate of favoritism, or without determining that the public is getting a premium price.
Neither the city nor the site's owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, knows what the site is worth today because the development community hasn't looked at it since Boston Properties was designated the developer in 1985. Mr. Zuckerman's suggestion that he pay for an independent appraisal to establish the value of the property is proof that even he recognizes the lack of market judgment. The problem with his idea is that appraisers, too, need a market competition to demonstrate value.
The most sensible course now is for the city to find out anew the market value of this property, and that cannot be accomplished through negotiations with one bidder. Monday is the deadline for closing the deal with Mr. Zuckerman. If no deal is reached, the M.T.A. should simply claim Boston Properties's $33.8 million deposit and invite new proposals. That would restore the public's faith in the negotiations, and give the city and the M.T.A., the city's negotiating partner, a more realistic sense of what the property is worth today.
In nine years, the price has gone from $455 million to today's figure of $80 million, and the plan has shrunk from 2.7 million square feet to 900,000 square feet of office and retail space, on about half the site. Is that even the best use for such a choice piece of Manhattan real estate?
It was clearly the embarrassment of press disclosures that drove the Mayor to put the brakes on Mr. Dyson's latest proposal. It would have restored $50 million in budget cuts to the M.T.A. from city capital funds.
That, and the Dyson proposal to turn over $2 million annually for 20 years from the city's income from the project, were obviously intended to win the M.T.A.'s approval of a lower selling price for the property. Both proposals would provide Mr. Zuckerman with the equivalent of city subsidies, because they would allow him to pay a lower purchase price.
Negotiations must carry the appearance, as well as reality, of high ethical standards. Mr. Zuckerman is co-publisher of The Daily News and supported Rudolph Giuliani's mayoral bid. Former Mayor David Dinkins played politics with the Coliseum site, and now it looks as though the Giuliani administration is capable of doing the same.
City Hall must not appear to be orchestrating a favorable deal on the Coliseum as a political reward to a strong supporter; that would send a signal to all developers that they can count on the political system to bail them out should their commitments turn sour.
This page has argued for moving ahead with development on the Coliseum site after so many years of delay, but only in an apolitical atmosphere of fair dealings that bring an undisputed top price and put the public interest first. Whether it be eagerness for economic development, or political intrigue, City Hall shows every sign of losing its commitment to the public good.
The Giuliani administration's obligation is clear. It is not responsible for the expenses or cash-flow situation of any developer. After so many years of delay, there is no need to rush into a sweetheart deal. The property will still be there in a few years. A rebounding economy will likely increase its value. It is wiser to walk away than stumble into a giveaway.

HEADLINE: Inflation: Myth and Reality

BYLINE: By Laura D'Andrea Tyson; Laura D'Andrea Tyson is chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Fears of accelerating inflation have haunted the financial markets just at the time when the economy has turned in its best inflation performance in decades.
In 1993, the core indexes of consumer and producer prices (which exclude food and energy) registered their smallest gains in 20 years. Favorable trends are continuing this year: the annualized increase in the core Consumer Price Index over the past three months was 2.9 percent, the same as over the 12 months beginning in March 1993. 
 The Administration, like most private forecasters, predicts an uptick in inflation in 1994, as continued growth raises the utilization of industrial capacity and reduces unemployment. We certainly recognize the critical need to remain vigilant against inflation. The building blocks for a sustained expansion -- smaller Federal deficits, stronger business balance sheets, improvements in productivity, robust investment -- are in place. It would be a missed opportunity if the expansion suffered a premature end as a result of accelerating inflation.
So far, however, there are few signs of changes in the underlying causes of inflation. Rather, the financial markets appear to be reacting more to inflation myths than to realities.
Myth No. 1: Inflation can spike upward suddenly. Some commentators contend that inflation can strike at a moment's notice. History suggests otherwise. Since 1957, the first year for which core Consumer Price Index data are available, there have been only nine years in which the inflation rate increased by more than half a percentage point.
Five were oil shock years: 1973, '74, '79, '80 and '90. Oil prices can dramatically affect overall prices: core inflation jumped six percentage points from '73 to '74, and the '79 oil shock raised core inflation by nearly three percentage points in one year.
Since 1957 there have been only four years when there was no oil shock yet inflation increased by more than half a percentage point: '66, '68, '69 and '78. The first three were Vietnam War years, when the economy was overheated: capacity utilization was well over 86 percent and the jobless rate under 4 percent. The average jobless rate was considerably higher in '78, but that year was preceded by two years of rapid wage inflation, a trend we do not see now.
In short, it takes an oil shock or a severe overheating of the economy to produce a surge in core C.P.I. inflation. Neither appears to be on the horizon. Oil prices are low and likely to remain so at least for this year. And today's capacity utilization rates, in the 82 to 85 percent range, are well below the levels at which inflation might spike upward.
Myth No. 2: Price increases for industrial goods presage higher general price inflation. The price indexes of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and National Association of Purchasing Managers increased noticeably in February and were blamed for fueling inflationary expectations. It is true that these indexes are somewhat correlated with the producer price index for intermediate goods -- say, industrial chemicals and wood pulp -- and other measures of commodity prices. It is also true that commodity prices, severely depressed in recent years, can be expected to rebound as the economy expands.
But over the past decade, the purchasing managers' index has, unsurprisingly, been a poor forecaster of changes in C.P.I. inflation. The managers' index is based on a narrow survey that includes only industrial companies, which account for a small share of overall economic activity; in addition, that index covers only purchases of industrial commodities.
Myth No. 3: Wages will soon accelerate because we are so close to full employment. One source of inflation could be an increase in the growth rate of unit labor costs -- that is, the cost of labor required to produce a fixed amount of goods. But unit labor costs have been decelerating, not accelerating, in recent years.
During 1993, unit labor costs increased by only 1 percent, compared with increases of 1.3 percent in 1992 and 2.5 percent in 1991. Over the past half year, they have fallen as wage changes have remained roughly constant in the face of increasing productivity growth. These developments lie at the heart of the good inflation story.
But are we on the verge of accelerating wage inflation, as some observers suggest? No. Even though the economy has created about 200,000 jobs a month over the past six months, wage growth has remained slow. Average hourly earnings increased only 0.1 percent in March despite significant employment growth. Over the past 12 months, average earnings increased only 2.4 percent.
The major commercial forecasters believe that labor market pressures do not push wage inflation higher until the unemployment rate, as measured today, falls to the range of 5.9 to 6.3 percent.
The Council of Economic Advisers reached a similar conclusion in its recent review of the relation between unemployment and inflation.
These views are reinforced by the economy's most recent experience. If labor markets were truly tight, there should be signs of mounting wage growth. But wage growth has been stagnant over the last year. Even when the unemployment rate falls to the 5.9 to 6.3 percent range, it is likely that wages will begin to drift upward only gradually. And strong productivity growth will continue to moderate growth in labor costs.
Myth No. 4: Rising import prices will heat up inflation. During the past year, the dollar has depreciated against the yen and import prices of Japanese goods are up about 7 percent. But Japanese imports represent only about a fifth of total U.S. imports and only about 2 percent of our gross domestic product. The prices of imports from the rest of the world are lower than a year ago, partly because the dollar has appreciated against most other currencies. Over the past year, prices of European, Canadian and other Asian goods are down about 1 percent, and imports from developing countries are about 4 percent cheaper.
Price increases for imports other than oil remain lower than the rate of core inflation, as has been true during the past five years. It is highly unlikely that import prices will be a source of accelerating inflation any time soon.
Myth No. 5: Higher gold prices mean inflation will increase. Gold prices have rebounded from the doldrums and are at their highest levels in about three years. But we have examined the relationship between gold prices and core C.P.I. inflation, and we find that there has been no correlation between the two since 1982. Developments like gold hoarding in China and political turmoil in South Africa buffet gold prices to such a degree that any causal link between gold prices and U.S. inflation seems hard to imagine.
In the absence of an oil price shock, it takes a sustained period of strong pressures on productive capacity to ignite truly inflationary conditions. Unless capacity utilization exceeds 86 or 87 percent, or the jobless rate drops substantially below its current level for a prolonged period, these conditions are not likely to develop in the near future. Instead, the economy seems well positioned to experience a decade-long phase of steady growth and modest inflation, much as it did from the mid-50's to the mid-60's.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Flog Asians Only

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Americans keep talking about how clever the people of Asia are but keep acting as if they were dolts.
In the controversy about the caning of a young man from Ohio, somehow it does not occur to American business executives, journalists and politicians that Asians will ask why they close their eyes, mouths and hearts when the same canes scar the flesh of Asians. 
 Let's hope Singapore gives clemency to Michael Fay, now that George Bush is adding his appeal to President Clinton's. But let's also try, real hard, to grasp what Asians understand: from America the big human rights message is "flog Asians only."
The legal screws are being twisted hard against Mr. Fay. In the past five years only 14 people, all Asian, were caned for vandalism, the charge against him. But for a list of other offenses, 1,208 Singaporeans and other Asians were caned to the blood in 1987-88 alone.
Asians are not too doltish to know that Americans did not seem to give one solitary damn about that then, or now. Asians also realize that Americans still talk about Singapore as if it were some kind of Switzerland, running all neat and ticktock.
The issue is not only vicious flogging, but the other laws of which that is part and symbol: detentions without trial, administrative imprisonment and political, press and academic control, the whole nasty authoritarian collection.
None of this is any secret to Americans who have the greatest moral responsibility to speak up: those doing business in Singapore. But when it comes to Asian skin, pain and liberties, they have accepted it all without protest or complaint -- before the sentence against Mr. Fay, and since.
In China, American business accepts far worse. It accepts excruciating torture of Chinese and Tibetans. It accepts slave labor officially planned as part of the cheap labor so important to Communist growth. Compared with what goes on in China, Singapore's flogging cane looks like the torch of liberty.
I know many Americans who do business in China or hunt for it. They are people of attainment -- music lovers, art collectors, politically active Democrats or Republicans, men and women who have flowered intellectually and made their fortunes under liberty.
They would perish under the kind of government their investments support. We agree on that and many other things. But they oppose any effort to use America's tariffs and trade to try, at least try, to ameliorate tyranny, as the U.S. did in the Soviet Union and South Africa.
I wonder -- would their acceptance of Chinese atrocities change if an American businessman were arrested and given the treatment that millions of Chinese and Tibetans receive in Communist prisons?
Suppose this American had his hands kept handcuffed behind his back, ratcheted so tight that he could not clean himself after using the toilet bucket in his cell?
Suppose he were tortured by electric batons? Shackled hands and legs to a board for days, with a hole cut out for defecation? Suppose he were whipped, not once, but whenever the guards wished, 30 strokes or 50?
Pages 75-77. I told a friend in business that I would send him a book in which these tortures are just a few examples. But he can get it himself from Asia Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue in New York or 1522 K Street in Washington -- "Anthems of Defeat." That way, after he reads it, he will know where to send money.
Suppose an American were arrested and put in a cell where he could neither stand straight nor lie straight. Page 82. Suppose he were sent to a forced-labor brigade quarrying or finishing marble for export goods, where prisoners are deprived of food, sent to solitary or have their sentences extended for not meeting daily production quotas. Pages 104-111.
If that happened to an American would my friends in the China trade then agree to a little U.S. economic pressure, like removing low-tariff privileges? Would they go as a group to the Chinese foreign office to protest torture and slave labor for Chinese -- or just talk about that one American?
If that is the bottom-line message from American business -- flog Asians only -- then in China, as in Singapore, it will be treated as it deserves. Contempt will be returned for contempt.

HEADLINE: Rwanda Will Need Its Civil Servants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am horrified about the situation in Rwanda and Burundi. As a World Bank project officer in East Africa, I worked about six months a year for five years in Rwanda in the 1980's. The challenges are enormous: Huge population, minuscule family plots, mountainous terrain that makes for backbreaking, primitive tilling, extreme poverty, low literacy, high infant mortality. Government efforts, and our projects, were focused on helping this population survive. 
 I worked closely with the tiny group of educated civil servants in Rwanda, the handful of men and women trained at universities in Rwanda and abroad, who made things work. These are the people who could run the computers and prepare budgets, who were trained agronomists, who staffed the rural clinics, who dealt with all the crises of a country barely afloat. They were dedicated and worked hard.
I worry about the fate of the Rwandese civil servants, among them my friends and former colleagues.
The United States should find those surviving civil servants and help them leave the country safely until a working government can be re-established. If not, I fear a whole generation of Rwanda's leadership and governing capacity will be wiped out. I also urge the United Nations, with United States support, to stay in Kigali to prevent more wholesale slaughter.

HEADLINE: Brazil in an Accord With Large Banks On Cutting Its Debt

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Brazil, the largest debtor in the developing world, completed an agreement last night with its creditor banks that reduces its $49 billion foreign debt and provides the country with lower interest rates and new longer-term loans.
Although a number of new debtor countries, most notably Russia, still need to reach agreement with commercial banks on restructuring their foreign debts, the Brazilian agreement effectively ends the international debt crisis that began in 1982. 
 The crisis started with Mexico's announcement that it was no longer able to make interest or principal payments on its foreign debt, and grew as other countries followed. The problems severely strained the world's financial system and curbed economic growth in Latin America.
But since the late 1980's, when the United States led a new effort to resolve the crisis, big debtor nations inside and outside Latin America have received a reduction in their financial burdens in exchange for changes that both opened their economies and helped curb rampant inflation. The foreign investment that has been attracted in the wake of earlier debt-reduction agreements, like that in Mexico, has played a large role in the economic revival of these countries.
Approval of the Brazilian agreement came last night, bringing to an end the tortuous negotiations that began in October 1990. The agreement was announced by Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's Minister of Finance, and William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, Brazil's biggest bank creditor.
Mr. Rhodes, who has worked with Latin America's largest debtor nations since the crisis began, was clearly pleased to declare it over.
"It's been 11, and three and a half on this one," he said, in reference to Brazil and the number of years involved. "Now we can finally say this is over."
For Brazil, the agreement will cut its outstanding foreign bank debt to commercial banks by $4 billion, to $45 billion, and reduce interest owed by another $4 billion. The agreement is crucial to Brazil's efforts to liberalize its economy, attract foreign investment and stabilize prices.
Brazil's total debt burden, including loans from banks and from other governments, totaled $121.1 billion at the end of 1992, according to the World Bank. Mexico was second with $113.4 billion, Argentina third with $67.6 billion and Poland, which reached a debt-reduction agreement with its banks in March, fourth with $48.5 billion.
The 750 creditor banks in the Brazilian agreement include some of the largest in the United States. For the banks, the incentives for an agreement were the guarantees they receive on payments of debt and interest. In addition, the accord could provide profits for some banks by increasing the value of the debt they have on their books.
The agreement may also serve as a stabilizing force in Latin America. Since the beginning of the year, rising interest rates have hammered prices of the region's outstanding debt securities, raising questions among investors about the outlook.
"Closing this agreement will favorably affect the emerging debt markets by removing a major uncertainty," Mr. Rhodes said.
The Brazilian agreement caps five years of successful negotiations with Mexico, Argentina and other debtors that began after the Bush Administration outlined a new debt policy known as the Brady Plan, named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Under the plan, bankers were encouraged to help debtor nations reduce their burdens, while the foreign governments were required to reduce inflation and open their economies to foreign investment. Unlike other agreements, however, the accord between Brazil and its banks was completed without an approved economic program from the International Monetary Fund.
Although many bankers were initially critical of the Brady Plan, they now acknowledge its importance in solving Latin America's debt crisis.
"The architects of the Brady Plan have never been given enough credit," said John F. McGillicuddy, former chairman and chief executive of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company and, later, of the Chemical Banking Corporation. "As a result of the plan, banks were able to liquefy and recover much of what we had lent out. Without the Brady Plan, the economic circumstances of the hemisphere would be quite different."
The banks recovered much, but by no means all, of the value of their loans.
According to the Institute for International Finance, commercial banks have reduced the face value of their claims on debtor countries by about $90 billion since 1985. The Brazilian deal adds to that total.
At yesterday's closing, Brazil and its banks exchanged old loans for new bonds backed by guarantees on payment of principal and interest. Among the old debts were about $31 billion in loans that had been restructured in previous, unsuccessful efforts to resolve the country's problems. In addition, Brazil received $3.8 billion in fresh loans and the banks got $5.6 billion in unpaid interest.
Even with the debt-reduction programs instituted under the Brady Plan, Latin America's outstanding debt has continued to grow and remains highly vulnerable to a sharp run-up in short-term interest rates in the United States. Yet those who were involved in working out the debt problems of the 1980's said it was unlikely that defaults could happen again soon.
"The good part of the debt crisis is that Latin American countries very generally have introduced what most people think are much more constructive policies," said Paul A. Volcker, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for much of the 1980's was an important participant in debt negotiations.
One commercial banker who was involved in the Brazilian negotiations said, "You can't rule out another debt crisis altogether." But he added that the chances today were less than 10 percent.
The banker said the chances of a recurrence would increase if short-term United States interest rates rose to levels that exceeded the inflation rate by four to five percentage points. If rates reached those levels, "we would be scared," he said. Currently, the inflation rate is widely seen at about 3 percent.
But William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said, "if there is a repetition it won't be a threat to the financial system as the last one was."
He said that the banks were "much less heavily exposed in these countries than they were in 1982 and the losses they would take, as a percentage of their capital, are much, much smaller than they were in 1982."

HEADLINE: Rural Retreat Journal;
Store Closes, and a Way of Life Is Just a Memory

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RURAL RETREAT, Va., April 15

 BODY:
In a brick pharmacy in this hollow of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a former Confederate surgeon named Dr. Charles T. Pepper dispensed patent medicines in what was then fast becoming the "Cabbage Capital of the World." At least that's how the people of this hamlet saw it.
Local legend says that Dr. Pepper also spent time mixing mountain herbs, roots and seltzer into a fizzy brew, which his assistant later mass-produced. The assistant, Wade Morrison, moved to Texas and went on to fame and fortune as the creator of a best-selling American soft drink. Dr. Pepper went on to fame, but no fortune, as the brew's namesake. 
 And the pharmacy? Despite its brush with greatness, it never became a tourist draw. Instead, while electronic cash registers and computerized gas pumps infested small-town America, Rural Retreat Drug Store remained for more than 100 years an oasis where clerks read mail to unschooled neighbors, remembered birthdays and filled prescriptions on credit until a customer's Social Security check arrived.
Tonight, the pharmacy's rusty screen door screeched shut for the last time. The owners drawled "uncle," yielding to superstores and mail order catalogues. "Nowadays, if you're not big business, you're not in business," said W. Baynard Barton 3d, Rural Retreat's last pharmacist.
The nearest competitor is a dozen miles away. But the 995 residents of Rural Retreat will miss more than the convenience of a drugstore that was a gentle stroll away from Econ-o-wash, the laundromat that doubles as a public library.
Sixty-nine-year-old Nettie Sage, for example, can't make out the labels on her medicines. So the folks at the drugstore put her pills in different-colored bottles. Mrs. Sage says that over the years all she's had to do was call up and say she was "out of the blue ones," and the druggist would know she needed her "easin' pills," as she calls painkillers.
Walter Wynn, a retired farmer known to everyone as Chubeye, has routinely brought in his mail, proudly presenting it to the pharmacy manager, Shirley Hawthorne. "Got somethin' here to read, Shirl," he'd say, and she would read aloud the latest news from his brother in Maryland.
The pharmacy's owners, the Counts family of nearby Wytheville, say they were selling just 55 prescriptions a day and figured they needed 80 to stay afloat. "This place hasn't paid its bills in some time," said Mr. Barton, the pharmacist.
But then many a down-home pharmacy seems to be going the way of spittoons and scratch cooking. The number of independent pharmacies nationwide dropped from 40,000 to about 39,000 in the last two years, according to the National Association of Retail Druggists.
Todd T. Dankmyer, the group's spokesman, attributed the decline to a number of things: the restrictions that insurance companies have imposed on the pharmacies that policyholders can use, the drug manufacturers' price breaks for large vendors, and the growing popularity of mail-order drugs.
A packing box in the back of the Rural Retreat Drug Store brims with mugs painted with the names Earl, Cecil, Kermit, Emil, Ernest and the rest of the gang that used to sip coffee around the pot-bellied stove, whittling and swapping lies. "No rules, just so they didn't talk ugly when there were women," recalled Rebecca F. Heldreth, whose father, Johnny Frye, owned the store for some 40 years.
Mr. Frye turned the plank-floored shop at the corner of Main Street and Railroad Avenue into what is known as a "jot 'em down store": if an item was on a customer's shopping list, he probably stocked it.
Mr. Frye, who was also the town's Greyhound Bus agent, worked in the store for at least 11 hours every weekday, except for the times he took off to sing at a customer's funeral, his granddaughter, Dianne H. Jonas said
Mrs. Heldreth, who owns the building, figures that a general store opened on the ground floor around 1835. The town boomed when the railroad came through in 1856. James A. Ball, the historian for Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up Companies Inc. of Dallas, said Dr. Pepper bought the store around 1872 and turned it into a thriving pharmacy.
Today, Josie Gordon, a retired garment maker who grew up on a nearby farm, watched as workers removed the store's counters. At age 71, she fears that she will outlive not only the drug store but also her hometown. "If Williams Superette closes," she said, "we'll bury Rural Retreat and not put no flowers on it."

The beverage lives on, but the drugstore, which dispensed folksy friendliness along with prescriptions, has just closed its doors. Some townspeople fear that the closure of the Rural Retreat Drug Store will help draw to a close a fond chapter in an American way of life. (Condy Pinkston for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: U.S. Policies Under Siege

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
The latest Serb offensive against the Muslim town of Gorazde is a setback for the Clinton Administration's strategy that the limited use of NATO air power would persuade the Serbs to back down on the battlefield and make peace.
Not only have the Serbs refused to return to the bargaining table, but they have also called NATO's bluff, mounting a major new offensive against the town and daring the alliance to do something about it. 
 And the American-led peace process that had looked so promising just a few weeks ago has become complicated by a new French intiative aimed at giving the Europeans more of a voice.
In the past, credible threats of NATO military force have caused the Serbs to ease pressure on Sarajevo, but this time the pinprick air strikes by a total of four planes on Sunday and Monday were apparently not credible enough.
Mr. Clinton and his national security advisers have defined NATO's mandate very narrowly, to protect the United Nations observers and refugee officials in the town, which was declared a United Nations safe haven last year.
But the Clinton Administration also expressed confidence repeatedly throughout the week that the NATO attacks would also stop the advance by the Serbs, coax them back to the peace table and persuade them to make concessions that would produce a lasting political settlement.
Just two days ago Defense Secretary William Perry said, "My expectation is that after a pause for a few days here, which seems to be going on right now, that the Serbs and the Bosnians will come back to the negotiating table."
When asked at a news briefing today about the offensive in Gorazde, Mr. Perry seemed uninformed, saying, "That's not the information I have." He acknowledged that the Serbs had "begun a whole series of actions to harass the United Nations forces," but dismissed the attacks as a prelude to a cease-fire not only in Gorazde but all of Bosnia.
At the moment, however, that rosy scenario has not unfolded.
At the State Department, the assessment was more grim than that of the Pentagon. A senior official said the Serbs had occupied strategic locations all around the city while the Bosnian Government had withdrawn some of its forces.
Despite the death of a British peacekeeper stationed in Gorazde, senior State Department officials said tonight that Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose of Britain, the commander of the United Nations military in Bosnia, had not requested a NATO air strike. But in Sarajevo there were reports that General Rose had requested the use of air power to protect the observers and halt the Serbian advance but had been overruled by the senior United Nations official in the region, Yasushi Akashi.
 
Dutch Request Refused
 General Rose has been reluctant to call in new air strikes. This was demonstrated on Thursday, when he and Mr. Akashi, the United Nations special envoy, refused the request by Dutch peacekeepers at the airport near the Muslim town of Tuzla, another United Nations safe area, who asked for air strikes after the Serbs shelled a plane that had just landed.
In the days after the NATO attacks, President Clinton and his national security advisers lauded the air strikes as the way to advance a settlement acceptable to the Bosnian Government, and vowed to repeat them if the Serbs failed to get the message.
But in the last two days, Mr. Clinton has shifted signals, making clear that he has no appetite for increasing military action in Bosnia. He and his senior advisers remain convinced that too strong a response could result in a permanent collapse in the American-led peace initiative that was frozen by the Serbian offensive against Gorazde two weeks ago.
Softening his message in the face of continued Serbian attacks this week, Mr. Clinton said that NATO should not help promote the cause of any one of the combatants.
"I have to clarify, if there is any real doubt, that the United States has no interest in having NATO become involved in this war and trying to gain advantage for one side over the other," Mr. Clinton told reporters today.
 
No Softening, U.S. Says
 He added that the United States, which last year wanted to arm the Bosnian Muslims to help them wage a "fair fight," had no intention of rolling back the Serbs' territorial gains in the two-year-old war. NATO's role, he said, was "to be firm but not provocative and not try to change the military balance."
White House officials insisted that Mr. Clinton's message, delivered on Thursday and again today, did not reflect a softening of Washington's resolve to live up to the commitments made in various Security Council resolutions, but were merely aimed at rebutting Serbian charges that NATO had become a combatant in the war on the side of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government.
But his statements gave the impression that the United States was once again wavering on whether the Bosnian Muslims were, as Secretary of State Warren Christopher has called them, the "aggrieved party" that deserved protection.
Later in the day, the White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, tried to limit the damage of Mr. Clinton's remarks by expressing concern about Gorazde and warning the Serbs that "if they endanger the lives of U.N. personnel there, we stand ready to take the same action we took last week."
The tense situation in Bosnia has also badly shaken the Europeans.
 
'Equal Footing' Proposed
 The French Government has become so convinced that the war could spin out of control and that peace talks led by the American negotiator, Charles E. Redman, have reached a dead end that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has revived a European peace initiative that envisions the gradual lifting of economic sanctions against the Serbs.
Mr. Juppe proposed in speeches before the French National Assembly and Senate this week that the United States, Russia and the European Union work on "an equal footing" to carry out the plan, and called for an international conference to discuss it.
He said it was essential to reintroduce the idea of progressive suspension of the sanctions mandated by the United Nations against the Serbs.
In a telephone call with Mr. Juppe on Thursday, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia warmly embraced the French approach. In a phone call Tuesday, Mr. Christopher told Mr. Juppe that he found the proposal "interesting," but premature.

HEADLINE: 109 Nations Sign Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco, April 15

 BODY:
Culminating more than seven years of arduous and often bitter bargaining, ministers from 109 countries signed a far-reaching trade liberalization agreement today aimed at stimulating exports and slashing tariffs around the world.
The agreement is the eighth to be concluded since World War II but is easily the most ambitious, reducing import tariffs by an average of 40 percent and embracing for the first time such areas as agriculture, textiles and financial services. 
 The accord signed today was reached in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the latest set of talks held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. The agreement remains subject to ratification by many governments.
 
 
Costs Stymie Congress
 In the United States, the trade-liberalization measures will go to the House of Representatives and the treaty itself to the Senate for ratification. But the timing of American action is unclear because Congress cannot decide how to cover an estimated $13.9 billion decline in tariff revenue that will result.
Vice President Al Gore described the impact of the agreement as "truly momentous" and said the Clinton Administration would seek ratification this year. Mr. Gore flew here Thursday to address the meeting and underline the United States' support for the package, which is expected to stimulate American exports.
But Mr. Gore, when he addressed a meeting of ministers here on Thursday, alarmed some developing nations by announcing that Washington would seek in future negotiations to discuss the relationship between trade and both environmental protection and workers' rights.
Major exporting nations in Asia and Latin America fear that the United States, France and some other industrial countries want to link trade to the environment and labor as a means of creating nontariff barriers to reduce the competitive advantage of poor low-wage economies.
Another unresolved problem is whether China, which never joined GATT, can achieve its goal of becoming a founding member of GATT's successor, the World Trade Organization, which was created by the accord signed today. The United States and some other countries contend that China must take further measures to open up its domestic economy before becoming eligible for membership.
 
Something to Celebrate
 While potential conflicts emerged in many speeches here this week, today's final ceremony in this sunny Moroccan desert resort was intended as a celebration of an agreement that more than once seemed out of reach.
In a joint declaration today, ministers from participating governments said the Uruguay Round "will strengthen the world's economy and lead to more trade, investment, employment and income growth throughout the world" and should augur a "progressively more open world trading environment."
GATT has estimated that the accord will increase global income by $235 billion a year. Experts also hope it will stimulate an economic recovery in industrial nations.
The World Trade Organization, in replacing the 47-year-old GATT, will join the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as the main watchdogs of the global economy. The new body will have far greater authority than GATT to bring order to world commerce.
 
Perilous Course
 On many occasions, the negotiations that began in the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este in 1986 seemed headed for failure. They collapsed in 1990, and were almost torpedoed again last year by disputes between the United States and the European Union over farm and audio-visual goods. An agreement was finally thrashed out in Geneva in December, three years behind schedule.
Peter Sutherland, the Irish lawyer who heads GATT, was visibly delighted and relieved today that all the squabbling was over. "I'm tempted to do an Irish jig on this table to show what I think," Mr. Sutherland told reporters. "No one got everything they wanted, but that is the nature of these sorts of negotiations."
After a daylong ritual of signing the 22,000-page, 385-pound agreement, ministers pledged in their joint declaration "to resist protectionist pressures of all kinds." They also promised to take no trade measure that could harm the Uruguay Round before the World Trade Organization comes into being, probably next year.
Although 109 countries signed the agreement today, GATT has 125 members, so more are expected to add their endorsements.
The principal beneficiaries of the agreement are expected to be the industrialized democracies and leading third world exporters like India, Brazil, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and, eventually, China. Because of their different interests, these countries often formed different alliances at various stages of the negotiations.
In pressing the European Union to reduce subsidies and other protection of its farm products, for example, the United States had the backing of the so-called Cairns Group of agricultural exporters, including Australia, Canada, Brazil and Argentina.
The accord deals with a new area, services, in an effort to liberalize trade in banking, insurance and tourism. Audio-visual products, like television and movies, as well as shipping and airlines were excluded, largely because of continuing disagreement between the United States and the 12-nation European Union.
 
Two Crucial Areas
 Rules were tightened to prevent "dumping" of goods -- selling them at less than their production cost -- and to protect intellectual property, a term that covers everything from patents, copyrights and trademarks to the rights of performers and producers of sound recordings.
Developed countries also agreed to a 10-year phasing out of the 1974 Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which was intended to protect the textile industries of the United States, Japan and several European countries from competition from low-wage exporters, principally in Asia.
The backbone of the accord signed today is market access, the opening up of economies to more foreign products, in this case by cutting tariffs on industrial and farm goods by an average of 40 percent. The logic is that more imports mean more exports, which in turn mean more jobs and greater prosperity.
Although Mr. Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, has insisted that "there are no losers" in this accord, some development experts say that many African and Caribbean nations belonging to the "poorest of the poor" category may suffer.
 
Fears for the Poor
 In a study circulated here, Christian Aid, a London-based development group, said these poorest countries "will face higher costs to feed their people as the price of cereals increases in world markets."
For the dominant economies of the world, though, the agreement is considered good news. Mr. Gore said the gross domestic product, or value of goods and services, of developed countries should gain an additional 3.5 percent over a decade as a result of the Uruguay Round accord. "That's an extra year's worth of output for free," Mr. Gore said.

Brazil reached an agreement with its creditor banks that reduces its $49 billion foreign debt and provides the country lower interest rates and new longer-term loans. The accord with Brazil -- the biggest debtor in the developing world -- effectively ends the international debt crisis that began in 1982. [Page 1.] 
 Officials from 109 countries signed the most ambitious trade pact since World War II. The GATT agreement, signed in Morocco, reduces tariffs by an average of 40 percent and covers agriculture, textiles and financial services for the first time. Many of the participating governments, however, must still ratify it. [35.]
American and Japanese officials said they hoped to resume trade negotiations by July. But a senior U.S. official said Tokyo would first have to show progress in three areas. The so-called framework talks were suspended in February. [35.]
The Economy A proposed standard for VCR's that will use digital technology has been agreed upon by a committee representing 50 electronics companies, including Sony, Matsushita and Philips. [36.]
Industrial output gained five-tenths of 1 percent in March, the 10th consecutive monthly gain. The Government also reported that the operating rate at industrial companies, also called the plant-use rate, rose to the highest level since June 1989.[38.]
 
Companies
Digital Equipment, which seemed poised for a turnaround last summer, posted a third-quarter loss of $183 million -- three to four times higher than what many on Wall Street had expected. [35.]
Genentech said first-quarter earnings more than doubled from a year earlier. But the results were below the most optimistic estimates, and its stock price fell. [36.]
The main operating company of Jurgen Schneider, the German real estate developer whose disappearance has roiled markets and shut down construction sites, filed for bankruptcy. [36.]
Letters exchanged by two lawyers in the Macy bankruptcy case have evolved into a very rare public sideshow. The letters, filled with mutual disdain, were included in a court filing. [36.]
 
Markets
The Chicago Board of Trade said it would pull out of Globex, the 24-hour global electronic trading network for futures and options. The Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, said it would support electronic trading by listing its most widely traded contracts on Project A, its own local area network. [35.]
Stock prices seesawed before ending largely unchanged. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.78 points. [38.]
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed as investors stayed on the sidelines, awaiting the Federal Reserve's next move. [44.]
Coffee futures plunged after Brazil announced that it would sell a giant chunk of its coffee reserves. [46.]
The dollar fell against the yen after the United States and Japan were unable to resume trade negotiations. [46.]
 
Your Money
With April 15 now past, many people will resolve to try to lower their tax bills for next year. They may blunder, however, if they focus solely on the highly coveted tax break. [33.]
Investments in limited partnerships have declined because of scandals and poor performance. But equipment-leasing partnerships have shown some resilience. For a minimum of $2,000 to $5,000, investors can buy into these ventures and get quarterly payouts for 5 to 12 years, plus proceeds from the resale. [33.]
In money market mutual funds, the best yields can be found in taxable funds. Their yields have risen since the Federal Reserve Board began pushing up short-term interest rates on Feb. 4. [33.]
Women face higher costs in buying disability insurance. Saying that women have higher disability claim rates, insurance companies are gradually adopting new rate schedules that result in premiums that are higher for women than for men. [34.]

HEADLINE: Uncharted Change at the N.A.A.C.P.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Who is Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. and what in the world is he is trying to do to the venerable National Association for the Advancement of Colored People?
Is he a brash and brilliant innovator, pumping life into a sclerotic organization whose glory days are past and whose current relevance is questioned? Or is he a unrepentant radical and a peripatetic neophyte whose lack of political acumen will lead the N.A.A.C.P. to the same fate as the Black Panther Party? 
 No matter what view one takes of Mr. Chavis, it is clear that since he succeeded Benjamin L. Hooks a year ago, he has shaken up the the 85-year-old civil right organization, whose membership has declined to around 500,000 today from more than a million in the 1960's and whose finances are so precarious that some insiders say meeting its payroll sometimes is questionable.
In these 12 months, Mr. Chavis has met with black street gang leaders and defended "gangster rap" music, an action that was later repudiated by the organization's board of directors. He has called for closer ties with the Nation of Islam despite accusations that the group is anti-Semitic. His closest advisers are a longtime legal counsel to the group's leader, Louis Farrakhan, and a former official of the Marxist Government in Grenada. Last week, he invited a group of old-time radicals including Kwame Toure, who used to be known as Stokley Carmichael, to discuss ways they could increase their influence in the N.A.A.C.P.
 
Concerns From Elsewhere
 But conservatives and moderates within the N.A.A.C.P. are not the only ones who have expressed concern over some of Mr. Chavis's actions.
Trade unions were angered over his calls last fall to black lawmakers lobbying in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the N.A.A.C.P. board officially opposed.
Environmentalists are upset over his idea of shifting some of the cost of cleaning up hazardous wastes from polluting companies to a broad-based business tax.
Mr. Chavis, who argues that waste dumps are more likely to be in poor neighborhoods, asserts that such a tax would produce quicker clean-ups because it would generate more revenue and cut down on litigation. Environmentalists and lawmakers say that it is naive to believe Congress will approve another tax on businesses and that limiting polluter liability removes one of the deterrents against creating toxic wastes.
Last year, Mr. Chavis appeared to endorse efforts by the Flagstar Corporation of Spartanberg, S.C., to lure a National Football League franchise to nearby Charlotte, N.C. That brought howls from Maryland officials who wanted the franchise for Baltimore and hoped for support from the N.A.A.C.P., which renovated its national headquarters in Baltimore in 1986 with $1.1 million in city money.
But despite criticism from the right and from the left, bruising battles with his own board and a personal loss -- the death of his 26-year-old daughter last month from a liver ailment -- Mr. Chavis remains unbowed.
"I'm very proud of my first year," Mr. Chavis said in an interview on Tuesday as he left a Congressional hearing on the Superfund law. "Our membership has increased. The organizations has had more stability than it's had in a long time."
 
Unlike Predecessor
 In background and style Mr. Chavis, 46, is a marked departure from his predecessor. Unlike Mr. Hooks, who went to the N.A.A.C.P. from the chairmanship of the Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Chavis is steeped in the confrontational politics of the 1960's and 1970's.
The former head of the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, he became well known in the 1970's as one of the "Wilmington 10," a group convicted of firebombing a white-owned grocery in Wilmington, N.C., during a civil rights protest. He spent more than four years in prison before a Federal appeals court overturned the conviction, ruling that the prosecution had denied the defendants access to testimony from a crucial witness.
The son of a brick mason and a teacher, Mr. Chavis was born in Oxford, N.C. He has a master's degree from Duke University and a doctorate of divinity from Howard University. In recent years he has worked to merge the black civil rights and environmental movements and he coined the term environmental racism to describe the practice of putting polluting industries and waste dumps in poor minority communities.
He caused an uproar last week when he invited a group of radicals and leftists to a meeting, without the knowledge or approval of the N.A.A.C.P.'s board or its chairman.
Some board members, including several who support Mr. Chavis, were outraged over the secrecy and the possibility that the guest list would scare off corporate donors. Coming on the heels of Mr. Chavis's flirtation with the Nation of Islam, the meeting led to a few isolated calls for his resignation.
"The fallout that I get is very negative," said Tom Turner, a board member from Detroit. "The board members that I talked to feel that there may be a violation of N.A.A.C.P. traditional policies and procedure."
Mr. Chavis would not agree to a formal interview on the recent dispute over the meeting. But several longtime friends of Mr. Chavis say they were not surprised by the episode.
"Whether the N.A.A.C.P. board likes it or not this is the group he has operated with over the last 15 years," said Ronald Walters, head of Howard University's political science department. "That this should become a cause for criticism of Ben is reflective of the sort of ideological and behavioral framework that the organization has been operating in and part of the reason that so many young people feel it has become irrelevant."
Mr. Chavis declined to answer questions about the meeting or whether he had informed Dr. William Gibson, the chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.'s 64-member board in advance. He called his relationship with the chairman constructive. Dr. Gibson did not return repeated calls to his office in Columbia, S.C.
Mr. Chavis also scoffed at the notion put forth by the executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, Michael Myers, and a few N.A.A.C.P. board members that he should step down. "That's ridiculous," Mr. Chavis said. "For what? Because I had a meeting? Be serious."
Watching Mr. Chavis's first year, Milton Morris, vice president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research center on black issues, said that Mr. Chavis's problems would continue until the organization defined itself.
"The N.A.A.C.P. leadership seems to find it difficult to conceptionalize a vision of where they want to go," Mr. Morris said. "Until they do, you're more likely to find this kind of casting about, thrashing around in search of something."

VCR Standards Drawn Up To Use Digital Technology

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 15

 BODY:
Paving the way for the next generation of videocassette recorders, a committee representing 50 electronics companies from around the world has agreed on a proposed standard for VCR's that will use digital technology.
The new machines, which promise superior image quality, are expected on the market in the next year or two, although some industry experts say it will take a few years for costs to come down enough for such machines, which can record high-definition television signals, to become popular. Estimates of the initial cost range up to $3,000. 
 The HD Digital Conference, whose committee met in Tokyo to work out the technical standards, announced the agreement on Thursday. The conference represents companies in Asia, Europe and the United States, including big makers of consumer electronics and computers like Sony, Matsushita, Apple Computer, I.B.M. and Philips Electronics N.V.
Japan's consumer electronics companies, suffering from a recession, the strong yen and lack of new hit products, are hoping that digital VCR's will revive sales of the industry's mainstay product. But it was considered vital to agree on a standard in advance so that the industry could avoid driving up competing development costs and confusing consumers with a format war similar to the one that occurred in the early 1980's in analog VCR's between Sony's Beta and the Victor Corporation of Japan's VHS system.
Digital VCR's promise higher quality than existing analog tape units, just as digital compact disks offer music free of the hisses and pops found on analog records. Digital videotapes, which store the images in the ones and zeroes of computer code rather than in a wavelike form, could be copied many times without loss of quality. The digital VCR might also provide a method of storing data for computers.
The new machines will use tapes that are one-quarter inch wide, half the width of existing VHS tapes. The cassette itself will be a little bigger than a standard audio cassette or an 8-millimeter videocassette. Yet it would be able to record four and a half hours of conventional television. A smaller cassette with only one hour of recording time will be offerred for use in camcorders.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Up to Japan, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco, April 15

 BODY:
Senior American and Japanese officials said today that they hoped to resume crucial trade talks before the meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in July, but American officials insisted that "the ball is still in the Japanese court."
After a two-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of Japan this morning, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the two sides needed to reach "common ground" before they could return to the so-called framework talks that were suspended in February. 
 "We made it clear to Mr. Hata what this common ground is," Mr. Kantor said. "We made progress and our door remains open." He added that Washington and Tokyo would not allow their trade differences to damage their broader political and strategic alliance.
The two men were here for a four-day meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The GATT meeting ended today with the signing of the accord resulting from the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. No breakthrough had been expected in the American-Japanese talks since the Japanese Government is in an interim period after the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last week.
Mr. Hata, who is in the running to become Prime Minister, reiterated today what he told Vice President Al Gore here on Thursday -- that any new Japanese Government would continue Mr. Hosokawa's economic overhaul program, including efforts to open Japanese markets to more foreign products. Last year, Japan had a trade surplus of almost $60 billion with the United States alone.
But a senior American official said that while Japan had committed itself to increasing imports and reducing its trade surplus, Tokyo would have to show "progress of a substantive nature" in three specific areas before even informal negotiations could resume.
The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said these three areas must be part of the required "common ground":
*A commitment to "significant and sustained" expansion of the Japanese economy, most notably domestic demand.
*Agreement on the overall goal of a significant increase in Japanese imports of competitive foreign goods and services.
*Agreement on the use of objective qualitative and quantitative criteria to insure progress was being made.
The official refused to describe what progress was made today, but he added that "there was increased understanding of our differences." And he added: "The ball is still in the Japanese court. We're waiting to hear from them on these points. If there is agreement, we can resume."
He said both Mr. Kantor and Mr. Hata had expressed hope of having informal talks before the Group of Seven meets in July in Naples. "It's very clear in Japan what needs to be done to stimulate the Japanese economy," the official said.

HEADLINE: War, Blockade and Poverty 'Strangling' Armenia

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YEREVAN, Armenia

 BODY:
Two and a half years after its independence, this tiny Caucasus nation should be enjoying the excitement of new-found freedom. Instead, it is experiencing little but pain.
The capital has electricity two hours a day, shop after shop is closed, and lines form early for bread and kerosene, rationed and doled by international relief agencies. 
 Little wonder people are fleeing. By unofficial accounts, more than half a million people have abandoned Armenia in the last three years, reducing the population to three million in an area slightly larger than New Jersey.
Although the countryside is still reeling from a catastrophic earthquake in 1988, Armenia's enduring burden is a man-made plague of the post-cold-war era: deadly ethnic warfare and the resulting social, political and economic isolation.
The battlefield is a tiny mountainous area, Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by ethnic Armenians but part of Azerbaijan for 70 years. Since the collapse of the Soviet empire, Nagorno-Karabakh has been waging a war to secede, but this year has been the deadliest. And it has expanded in the last three months, as the Armenian Government, long a not-so-secret patron of the Karabakh cause, has itself sent men to fight at the front.
 
Suffering From Blockade
 But economic warfare can be equally deadly, and one of Azerbaijan's weapons in the war has been a blockade of Armenia. "It is strangling us," a man in a mountain village said, voicing a lament echoed throughout the country.
This landlocked nation has long been dependent on imports, for more than two-thirds of its food and all of its oil and natural gas. Most of it passed through Azerbaijan. Armenia's neighbor to the west is Turkey. But Turkey backs the Azerbaijanis, and has sealed its border with Armenia. Turkey will not allow even relief aid across its land to Armenia.
Wheat and oil could reach Armenia through Georgia, Armenia's northern neighbor. But Georgia is being sundered by its own ethnic wars. Trains operate infrequently in Georgia for lack of fuel or because the tracks have been blown up, often by Azerbaijani guerrillas.
Armenia is so desperate that it hopes to reactivate a nuclear power plant that was shut after the earthquake in 1988. The United States contended that the Soviet-built plant was unsafe, but Russia agreed in March to provide nuclear fuel and technicians so that the plant could be reopened.
"At this point, Armenia has no option, just no option," said Steve Tashjian, Armenia's Deputy Prime Minister for Energy. "It is unfair to tell the people of Armenia, we will not turn the lights on for you with nuclear power."
 
New Clinic Is Unused
 In the village of Shirakamut, which is midway on the rail line between Yerevan and Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, there is a sparkling medical clinic. It has a modern forced-air heating system and fluorescent light bulbs. But the clinic is cold and empty -- no heat, no light. And it has no medicines, not even bandages.
The clinic, at the base of mountains on the north side of the village, was built by Liechtenstein after the earthquake, which killed more than 300 of the 3,000 villagers and at least 25,000 people in northern Armenia.
"I lost my mother and father, and a brother, and my daughter," 25-year-old Nora Torasian said, standing in the kitchen of her home -- a metal container 10 feet wide and 30 feet long where she lives with her husband and two children.
More than half of the 700 families in Shirakamut live in such containers, which were brought in as temporary shelter after the earthquake. There is no running water, no electricity, no heat.
Throughout Armenia, industry operates at 30 percent of capacity. Almost no one in Shirakamut, which was called Nalband before independence, has a job. A textile factory, which specialized in men's handkerchiefs, was destroyed in the earthquake -- 60 women were killed -- but rebuilt. Today, the sheds comprising the factory are unused, for lack of raw materials and power.
One of the fortunate in Skirakamut is Mrs. Torasian's husband. He is one of two men working at the train station, which employed 100 a few years ago. But his salary, 170 drams a month, which is 40 drams more than a schoolteacher earns, buys little. A loaf of bread costs 25 drams, a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of butter 600 drams, and a flat of 30 eggs, the customary way they are sold, 500 drams.
Like just about everyone in Armenia, the Torasian family lives hand to mouth, scrounging a few things here, selling them there.
"We took two sacks of potatoes to the market, but the money we got was not enough to buy three kilos of sugar," Mrs. Torasian said. "I work hard to grow the potatoes, and I don't want to sell them."
The family eats potatoes for breakfast and dinner.
"I forgot what meat is," Mrs. Torasian's 72-year old mother-in-law said. "But I know what potatoes are, and they know me."
As the Torasian family talked, a parakeet chirped from a cage in the corner of the rusting container, which leaks when it rains. The bird was one of two that had belonged to Mrs. Torasian's sister-in-law, who lives in Yerevan. The other one froze to death this winter. But as soon as the weather warms, the family will release this one. They cannot afford to keep it. It eats food the family needs.
To alleviate the hardship, would the people of Armenia allow Nagorno-Karabakh to remain part of Azerbaijan? Based on interviews and conversations, from streets of the capital to villages like Shirakamut, the answer seems to be an unequivocal no.
For Armenians, the war is about memories, and fears and vows of "Never again!" In the early part of the century, word reached the West of mass killings of Armenian civilians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, through forced resettlement, starvation and shooting.
The Armenians talk of the "genocide," and in fighting for Karabakh, they say they are fighting to prevent another deportation, another genocide. This time, they say, it is at the hands of the Azerbaijanis, a Turkic people, whom the Armenians even call Turks.
 
Tide Turned in December
 At the end of last year, it seemed that Nagorno-Karabakh had won the war. It controlled virtually all of the enclave, and a wide swath of territory ringing it. Then in December, Azerbaijan started a counter-offensive. As the Azerbaijanis continued to pour men into battle, the Armenian Government began to worry. The call went out for volunteers. Many responded.
Among them was Arsen Gevorkian, who was laid to rest at the Martyrs Cemetery one afternoon in March. A 17-year-old aspiring artist, Mr. Gevorkian had gone to fight in Karabakh "to save his land, to protect his brothers and sisters from the Turks," an aunt said through tears.
The Armenian Government has long contended that the only Armenian citizens fighting in Karabakh have been volunteers like Mr. Gevorkian and that no Government troops have fought there. But the Martyrs Cemetery tells a different story.
While dirt was being shoveled over Mr. Gevorkian's coffin, soldiers in camouflage fatigues struggled under the weight of the open coffin bearing the body of Gagik Stepanian, 27, his head still bandaged from the wounds that killed him.
He died on March 16 during heavy fighting on a mountain pass in the Kelbajar region of Azerbaijan, said his commanding officer, Alik Yeghoian. Six more of his soldiers were killed in the battle, he said. All of them, Mr. Yeghoian said, were members of the Armenian Government's Internal Forces, a special military branch of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
 
Troops Called Volunteers
 In an interview, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Vano Siradeghian, said any Internal Affairs men who had fought in Azerbaijan were "volunteers," having gone to the war "on their vacation."
But there is evidence to the contrary. A few feet from Mr. Stepanian's grave a mound of dirt covers the coffin of Lieut. Karapet Deleyan. He was killed on March 3, in a firefight with Azerbaijani forces in Fuzuli, which is just outside Nagorno-Karabakh on the southeast, said his brother, Haroutun, and three friends worked on the gravesite.
The friends said Lieutenant Deleyan had been an officer in the Internal Forces for four years and had been sent to other places in Azerbaijan to fight. "He was sent from here to there when he was needed," one said.
Whether direct Armenian participation will draw in outsiders like Turkey and Russia, as some Armenians and diplomats fear, it is certain that until the war ends, the transition from Communism to capitalism will have to wait.

HEADLINE: In Greenwich, Small Is Beautiful;
A Suburban Hospital Seeks to Retain Its Independence

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
At a time when most smaller hospitals are seeking to hitch up with larger medical centers to steer them through the turbulent waters of health care overhaul, administrators at Greenwich Hospital remain determined to pilot their own ship.
Thumbing its nose at health economists who predict the demise of small, independent hospitals, Greenwich is in the middle of a $60 million fund-raising campaign to build new clinic space and a 180-bed building. Spurning the common belief that small hospitals cannot dispense good, cost-effective specialty care, it opened a comprehensive cancer center last year in this wealthy suburb, just a 40-minute train ride from one of the world's cancer giants, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
 
Spurning the Suitors
 Though it has received offers of affiliation from top-ranked hospitals from New Haven to New York, Greenwich has rejected them, a decision that in time may prove either genius or folly. 
 Although the move is a gamble, some health-policy experts say that the future could hold a place for high-quality local hospitals willing and financially able to change their ways to deliver cost-effective care.
To be successful, they said, these hospitals will have to carve out a niche for themselves, as Greenwich is trying to do by focusing on developing pleasant, efficient outpatient clinics. Having affluent patients will certainly help in the transformation.
"To the extent that people are willing to pay and maintain loyalty, there may be some that can sustain their independence," said Sylvia Boeder, director of community-based services at the American Hospital Association. She noted that President Clinton's health care proposal gives patients the right to choose any doctor, although they may have to pay extra to exercise that right.
To date, she said, many small hospitals that had tried to make it on their own have already been forced to affiliate with larger medical centers or networks, but none has made the investment that Greenwich has been able to make.
 
No Ordinary Little Town
 Greenwich is no ordinary little town, of course, and Greenwich Hospital no ordinary little hospital. Its patients have included Glenn Close, Diana Ross and Fay Vincent. Its coffee shop has tablecloths, and candy stripers still roam the halls.
And when Greenwich Hospital asks for donations, they arrive not in tens of dollars but in millions. Outside nearly every room in the institution is a brass plaque bearing the name of the person whose money built it.
That, in part, is the key to the institution's boldness: the residents of Greenwich want the best in their own backyard, and are able to buy it. When the hospital opened its cancer center in 1992, donations enabled it to get the best radiation equipment and to hire away a radiologist from Sloan-Kettering.
But in an age of fundamental changes in health care, the hospital's administrators know that philanthropy alone will not sustain it. Donations can build new clinics, but the hospital's patients still pay for medical care with insurance.
 
Changing Health Insurance
 Even in this privileged corner of southeastern Connecticut, the structure of health insurance is changing: a small but rapidly increasing number of patients at Greenwich Hospital belong to managed-care plans, and the traditional insurers that cover the bulk of the town's citizens are demanding that hospitals deliver more cost-effective care.
What is more, the bread-and-butter procedures that have long sustained community hospitals, like appendectomies and childbirth, are increasingly being done on an outpatient basis or with overnight stays, leaving beds at small hospitals like Greenwich largely empty.
So Greenwich Hospital is relying on its $60 million plan to reinvent itself as a community hospital for the 21st century.
"We've been very aggressive because we realize this facility won't survive unless it rebuilds," said Frank A. Corvino, president and chief executive of the hospital. "A community hospital will never be able to compete in the year 2000 with a facility like our current hospital, which was designed for medical care as it was delivered in '51.
"In those days there was no such thing as same-day surgery and when patients came into the hospital they stayed for 7 to 10 days," Mr. Corvino continued. "So if you couldn't get their X-ray done at 4, it would get done at 8, and if the physical therapy couldn't get done today, you could do it tomorrow."
 
Sometimes, Smaller Is Better
 Indeed, small suburban hospitals may have some advantages in trying to keep costs down and maintain a balanced budget: they do not have the overhead costs associated withhighly specialized procedures, and virtually all of their patients have insurance.
Outwardly, Greenwich Hospital displays many signs of a hospital that has outlived its time: the outdated building leaks, and although it is licensed for nearly 300 beds, usually less than half are full. On a recent afternoon, most of the plush rooms on the sixth-floor orthopedics wing were empty, the spectacular views of Long Island Sound going to waste.
Nonetheless, the hospital's staff predicts a new beginning and a new direction. They point across the street to the hospital's year-old cancer center as a microcosm of things to come, where patients can receive complicated chemotherapy, radiation treatments, intravenous antibiotics and other services during lunch hour, without having to be admitted.
Dr. Dickerman Hollister, an oncologist, said that since the center opened the number of patients he admitted to the hospital each year had dropped to 180 from more than 300, even though the total number of patients in his practice was unchanged.
"When we first talked about building the center, the community had some concerns," Dr. Hollister said. "People said, 'Gee, there's a cancer center every three blocks.' But we put it up and held our breath and it's exceeded all our projections, which makes us feel more confident that the new hospital will work."
By and large the people of Greenwich, who could easily travel to Manhattan for major medical problems, remain dedicated to Greenwich Hospital and its plans. When Carol Taney, a school psychologist, discovered she had breast cancer in the fall of 1992, she traveled to Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Massachusetts General Hospital for consultations, but decided to stay in Greenwich.
"We researched everything very carefully and cost wasn't an issue," she said in a recent telephone interview. "We were focusing on the future and where I could get the best care." She said the doctors in New York and Boston recommended the same treatments as those in her hometown and had nothing but praise for her local physicians.
"We kept coming back to the fact that this place was very fine and as good as anything I could get in the city," she said. "It seemed ridiculous to go anywhere else."
In Greenwich she was able to continue working during six months of chemotherapy and six weeks of daily radiation treatments. She was surrounded by amenities that most big academic medical centers cannot provide: the outpatient unit where she received chemotherapy has carpets, fresh flowers and friezes decorating the walls. Each leather recliner is equipped with a television set. And while most hospitals house their radiation-therapy equipment in a windowless basement, at Greenwich the room has a picture window.
"You hear all these nightmarish stories about waiting in crowded waiting rooms with people in various stages of disease," she said. "But at the hospital, people were always solicitous and kind and caring and took their time."
Chester Lasell, a retiree who has lived in Greenwich for 64 years, said: "It's a really first-class institution. When you ring a bell a nurse answers right away and they're in your room within a second.
"But it may be hard to duplicate," he continued. "Greenwich is Greenwich. When the hospital wants an M.R.I., they get a hold of a few people on the phone and just like that they can buy it."
 
Selling Efficiency
 But it will take more than medical excellence and money to sustain the hospital. Mr. Corvino said he was hoping to convince more insurers and local businesses, especially the many large corporations with headquarters in southern Connecticut, to turn to Greenwich Hospital for their health plans rather than the huge medical networks based in Manhattan or New Haven.
"A small, well-run community hospital can operate much more efficiently, so it may be cheaper for employers to contract with us," he said. "I'd love to be able to go to U.S. Tobacco, which is based in Greenwich, and say, 'If you spent $9 million on health care last year, just give it to us and we'll manage the health of your employees.' "
He estimated that the hospital could provide 98 percent of all care that patients need. Those requiring specialized services like organ transplants or open-heart surgery would be transferred elsewhere. Academic affiliations through which residents from Yale University Medical School rotate through the hospital would continue, he said.
 
Managed Care Plans
 Bowing to reality, the hospital is also participating in several commercial managed-care plans, which doctors on the medical staff considered anathema just a few years ago. Many companies in the area, like the local newspaper, now provide health insurance to employees through such arrangements. Although the number of patients at Greenwich Hospital covered by managed-care plans is still just 1 percent or 2 percent, that is up sharply compared with just two years ago.
Doctors and administrators say they hope that such arrangements will not cost them the autonomy they hold dear. Dr. Hollister said he was glad that the hospital had not affiliated with a huge medical center because he wanted to be free to refer his patients to "the best," which might be one hospital for open-heart surgery and another for a bone-marrow transplant.
"What we are doing is bucking the tide," Dr. Hollister said, "to keep referring patients based on quality rather than some package deal."

HEADLINE: Dow Off 1.78 as Trading Continues on Light Side

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
In trading distorted by the "double witching hour," the stock market zigzagged a lot yesterday but closed essentially unchanged.
The biggest news of the day, a lower-than-expected capacity-utilization report from the Federal Reserve Board, barely lifted the price of bonds. It was the fourth piece of good inflation news this week that the bond market shrugged off. The others were favorable reports on the consumer and producer price indexes and March retail sales. 
 Next week, which will have no market-moving statistic of the magnitude of this week's, may be even more listless, analysts say.
The stock market generally followed the bond market this week, but for the most part many stock traders stayed on the sidelines, as indicated by lower-than-average trading volume earlier in the week.
Yesterday's volume on the New York Stock Exchange of 309.3 million shares exceeded this year's daily average of 304 million shares. But traders may still be sitting on their hands.
Analysts noted that yesterday's volume was far less than the "triple witching hour" volume of 390 million shares in March, when three kinds of options, instead of two as yesterday, expired.
 
Little 'Witching' Urgency
 There is often a use-it-or-lose-it urgency when these options contracts expire, usually at 4 P.M., that inflates trading volume and contributes to price swings. But little of that urgency was seen yesterday.
"People are content to sit back and wait," said William R. Rothe , a managing director for Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. "The exception is if a company reports earnings that are below expectations. Then we take it out and shoot it."
When the Fed's capacity utilization index came in slightly less than expected, implying low inflation, the Dow Jones industrial average lifted for the first half-hour of trading. But in afternoon trading, the Dow rose as much as 16 points, then plunged 23 points before settling at 3,661.47, down 1.78 points. For the week, the Dow lost about 13 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 rose and fell in a similar way before closing down 0.20 point at 446.18. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 0.66 point, to 727.97.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.10, to 247.66. Declining stocks barely outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,108 to 1,029. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.97 point, to 438.29.
Philip H. Smyth, a market analyst at Birinyi Associates in Greenwich, Conn., detected a large "sell" program, which began operating at 3:35 P.M. and involved 300 stocks and some 7 million shares. But by 3:41 P.M., when the computer program stopped, normal market action began to immediately lift shares prices.
 
Nasdaq Stabilizes
 The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, stabilized in Thursday's and yesterday's trading after sharp selloffs. The chart for Nasdaq trading "looks like the cliffs in Acapulco -- straight down," said Mr. Rothe, who is in charge of Nasdaq trading for Alex. Brown.
As for what will happen next week in Nasdaq trading, no one knows for sure. Mr. Brown said. "More so than other stock groups," he said, "each O-T-C stock trades in an individual pattern."
U.S. Healthcare was the most actively traded stock yesterday at 10.8 million shares. It rose 1, to 47. Much of U.S. Healthcare's activity was probably because of the company's inclusion, starting Monday, in the S.& P. 500 index. Many mutual funds and other large investors buy shares of stocks in major indexes, like the S.& P. 500. U.S. Healthcare replaces Grumman, which is being acquired by Northrop.
Intel was the second most actively traded stock yesterday at 7.4 million shares, but managed to arrest much of its stock slide. It closed yesterday at 59 3/4, down 1/8. But for the week, it was down nearly $10.
Three companies -- I.B.M., Cyrix, and SGS-Thomson Microelectronics of France -- announced plans this week to make Intel-compatible computer chips. Analysts interpreted this as the slow but certain death of Intel's near-monopoly on the microprocessors that go into personal computers.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 177.43 points yesterday, or nine-tenths of 1 percent, at 20,164.63 points. For the week, the Nikkei was up 229.64 points.

Dollar Falls Against the Yen As Trade Talk Effort Fails

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday after United States and Japanese officials were unable to resume trade talks. The dollar rose against other major currencies.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of Japan met in Morocco yesterday. After the meeting, Mr. Kantor said the two countries needed to reach "common ground" before they could return to the talks that were suspended in February. 
 Japan has resisted United States pressure to open its markets, leading to traders bidding the yen higher.
The dollar was quoted late in Tokyo at 103.95 yen, up 0.95 from late Thursday. But the dollar fell later in the day and was quoted in New York late yesterday at 103.45 yen, down 0.84 yen from Thursday.
"A failure to restart talks will continue to pressure the dollar," said Brian Halligan, a trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. "I don't think we'll see any real activity in the dollar-yen market until a new administration takes over in Japan."
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned a week ago.
Tom O'Malley, foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data, a financial research firm in Boston, said the dollar was locked in a narrow range against the German mark and other currencies because United States economic figures had not raised expectations of "an imminent Fed tightening."
An increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve would help the value of the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
The dollar rose against the German mark a day after the Bundesbank and other European central banks lowered interest rates. The dollar was quoted at 1.7135 marks in New York, up from 1.7103 late Thursday.
Gold prices declined yesterday. The gold contract for June delivery fell 90 cents, to $379.40 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Other dollar rates in late New York trading, compared with Thursday, were: 1.4540 Swiss francs, up from 1.4470; 5.8615 French francs, up from 5.8480; 1,639 Italian lire, up from 1,632, and 1.3858 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3799.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Up 0.5%, 10th Straight Monthly Gain

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
Production at America's factories, mines and utilities advanced five-tenths of 1 percent in March, the 10th consecutive monthly gain, the Federal Reserve said today.
The Fed also reported that the operating rate at industrial companies, also called the plant-use rate, rose two-tenths of 1 percent, to 83.6 percent -- the highest since June 1989. It said that the output of several industries picked up after harsh weather in January and February but that "the overall increase was held back by a drop in production of motor vehicles and electricity." 
 Auto and truck output declined 7.1 percent in March. The auto production rate slowed to 13.0 million units in March, a seasonally adjusted annual rate, from 13.9 million in February, the Fed said. Still, this year is the first since the 1970's that the monthly auto production rate has been so high, it said.
 
Weaker Than Expected
 While showing the economy continues to expand, today's report was a bit weaker than expected. Economists had predicted a gain of six-tenths of 1 percent in industrial production and a plant-use rate of 83.7 percent, according to a Bloomberg Business News survey.
The Fed's report also suggests that investor concern about a fast-growing economy's fueling higher inflation may be overstated, at least for now. In the past, sizable gains in industrial output have led companies to raise prices as bottlenecks arose in the nation's production system.
While inflation has not vanished, the report is another sign that there is little danger of a sudden increase in prices. Still, some analysts think the report reinforces expectations that the Fed will soon raise short-term interest rates.
Stephen Gallagher, an economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York, said he believed the economy was approaching the point where prices would rise. The Labor Department reported this month that factory overtime had set a record in March.
"When you start moving up by four-tenths or even two-tenths per month" on the plant-use rate, "it won't be long before you start seeing inflation," Mr. Gallagher said. "We're probably brushing up against it soon, possibly by midyear or the end of the year."
 
84 Percent the Critical Point
 Economists consider a rate of 84 percent and higher to be the point at which inflation accelerates, diminishing the value of fixed-income investments such as bonds. And changes in Treasury yields are important to the economy because they affect rates for home mortgages and auto loans.
Overall manufacturing output rose six-tenths of 1 percent in March while mining production advanced 1.0 percent. However, utility output decreased by 1.8 percent as the weather turned mild.
In February, industrial production increased six-tenths of 1 percent; it had previously been reported as a four-tenths of 1 percent gain. February's plant-use rate rose to 83.4 percent from 83.1 percent in January.

Coffee Plunges After Brazil Sets Sale of 2.4 Million Bags

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices plunged yesterday on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange after Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, announced that beginning next month it would sell 2.4 million bags of its stock to its domestic roasters and manufacturers.
Investors dumped their positions in frenzied selling yesterday amid worry over the repercussions on international prices. Coffee for May delivery, the most active contract, fell 3.10 cents, to 80.45 cents a pound. 
 Brazil said late Thursday that it would sell the reserves to help to combat domestic inflation, which runs at more than 40 percent a month.
"It's just one more blunder where the Brazilian Government doesn't realize the impact of its actions on the international marketplace," said Judith Ganes, a coffee analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. "When all is said and done, the Government probably will be forced to rescind the decision."
Brazil's coffee growers have already said they will seek a court order to delay the sale.
 
Trying to Raise Prices
 An association of coffee-producing countries has been trying for months to raise prices under a carefully controlled program that releases only certain amounts of the beans for sale. Just a week ago, coffee futures reached their highest level in two years, with the May contract at 83.95 cents a pound.
Prices may bounce back next week, however, on an industry report that showed United States coffee stocks fell by 417,000 bags, Ms. Ganes said.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped to nearly five-month highs on mostly technical buying related to the expiration of the May options positions.
May light sweet crude oil rose 35 cents, to $16.58 a barrel; May home heating oil rose 0.70 cent, to 47.40 cents a gallon; May unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent, to 50.35 cents a gallon; May natural gas rose 0.24 cent, to $2.187 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Grain and soybean futures prices ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Wheat for May delivery rose 2.25 cents, to $3.2925 a bushel; May corn was unchanged at $2.65 a bushel; May oats rose 0.25 cent, to $1.1775 a bushel; May soybeans slipped 0.25 cent, to $6.5275 a bushel.
Near-term wheat futures rose on expectations that China would soon bid for more than one million metric tons of American wheat at subsidized prices.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rebounded in early April, indicating that rising interest rates are not curtailing people's spending plans.
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index for April rose to 94.2, from 91.5 in March, according to people with access to the survey. February's reading was 92.3. 
 "You're not seeing any debilitating effects from rising rates yet," said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "Consumers remain buoyant."
The Michigan index is now at its highest since January, when it was 94.3. The index is based on 100, set in 1966. Monthly indexes rising closer to 100 indicate that consumers are becoming more optimistic about the economy.
Since 1966, the record high is 101, set in March 1984; the record low, 51.7, was set in April 1980.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
The Biggest Yields in Money Market Funds: Where to Find Them

BYLINE: By Leonard Sloane 

 BODY:
After taking a beating in stocks and bonds in the first quarter, many investors are letting their cash idle in money market mutual funds, especially the tax-free variety. But the smart money is landing in taxable funds.
Yields on taxable money funds have risen steadily since the Federal Reserve Board began pushing up short-term interest rates on Feb. 4, while yields on tax-frees have languished.
"The two markets don't necessarily march in tandem," said Walter Frank, chief economist of the Money Fund Report. "And it's possible for them to go their own way for some period of time."
The annualized yield compounded weekly on taxable funds has risen to 3.05 percent from 2.71 percent in the week ended Feb. 4, according to IBC/ Donoghue. The average yield on tax-free funds has bobbed under the 2 percent mark during that time. It now stands at just 1.82 percent.
The result: taxable funds are yielding about 68 percent more than tax-free funds right now, up from 37 percent for all of 1993.
Several factors are at work. "Yields on municipal paper are a lot less responsive to a particular move by the Federal Reserve than yields on taxable paper," explained Jacob S. Dreyer, a Washington mutual fund consultant. "And ever since the Clinton tax hike, there has been a great demand for tax-exempt paper and not much of a supply."
IBC/Donoghue reports that cash is flowing into tax-free funds at a much faster pace than taxable funds. Thus far in 1994, assets of tax-frees have increased 12.4 percent, compared with a 3.1 percent gain for taxables. At Fidelity Investments, almost all the new money this year has gone into tax-frees, said Neal Litvack, executive vice president of marketing.
Last week, the money flowing into retail funds hit a two-year peak of $10.79 billion before falling back to $2.2 billion this week, the Investment Company Institute reported.
With short-term rates widely expected to go higher by the middle of the year, taxable money funds will probably maintain an edge for some time. And the advantage could even grow if tax-free instruments remain scarce.
Although it comes as a surprise to many, taxable funds are more lucrative now even for people in the top 39.6 percent tax bracket, said Richard Marcis, acting director of research at the Investment Company Institute.
Here's how to find whether taxable or tax-free funds are a better deal: Subtract your tax bracket as a percentage from 1. For the 39.6 percent bracket, the result is 0.604. Then multiply that number by the taxable yield, which was 3.05 percent this week, to derive the tax-adjusted yield, in this case 1.84 percent. "Since that exceeded the tax-free rate of 1.82 percent, a taxable fund is more favorable," Mr. Marcis said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
The Partnership Stigma And Equipment Leasing

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
BOB VORLOP has a plan. He wants to buy computer equipment, lease it to businesses and then resell it. He has ideas for dealing with the risks -- avoiding mainframes that can become obsolete quickly, buying mostly I.B.M. products because their maintenance policy means good resale prices. If all goes well, he will turn a handy profit -- especially if the economy continues to grow.
But Mr. Vorlop, manager of direct investments at Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond, is walking a rough road. His plan, the Commonwealth Income and Growth Fund I, is a limited partnership. "Yes, the 'P' word," he said. "Nothing has a worse reputation." 
 Plagued by scandal and sorry performance, partnerships raised only $2.14 billion last year, down from $13.54 billion in 1987, according to Robert A. Stanger & Company, an industry research firm in Shrewsbury, N.J. Partnerships in real estate and oil and gas have shrunk the most. Equipment-leasing partnerships declined from $1.3 billion in 1989 to $427 million last year -- giving them a 20 percent share of a small pie instead of their 5 percent slice of the old, larger one.
Heartened by this resilience, managers of equipment partnerships hope to put the past to rest -- and to cash in on the $130 billion business-leasing market. Some areas look very good. "Intermodal" containers, used to carry goods on ships, trucks and trains, "are doing well, maybe because they don't go obsolete and global trade is rising," said Nancy Schabel Mahon, a Stanger vice president.
For a minimum of $2,000 to $5,000, investors can buy into these equipment ventures and get quarterly payouts for 5 to 12 years, plus proceeds from the resale. The choices include high-tech computer funds; low-tech funds for planes, trucks and factory machines, and diversified funds. Currently, 17 such ventures are being offered, from the Cronos Global Income Fund XV (intermodal containers) to the Telecommunications Income Fund X (pay telephones).
For their money, investors get 6 percent to 10 percent and more -- "higher than with fixed-income investments," said John M. McDonald, a vice president at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. As partnerships, the funds also limit investor liability to the sum invested, and "they don't pay a tax bill" as companies do, he said. Given tax depreciation rules, partnership investors can also "defer taxes to later in the fund's life," he added.
These benefits may be particularly appealing now. The new, higher tax rates make partnerships' tax plays more lucrative, and the high cash yields stand out "in today's low-interest environment," Mr. McDonald said. Funds also help bondholders hedge against inflation and interest rates. "If rates rise, the investment's value rises" from higher lease and resale prices, Mr. Vorlop said.
But partnerships have problems, and selling one's stake, or units, is a big one. "You can get out, but it'll cost you," said Spencer Jefferies, editor of Partnership Profiles, an industry journal. In a 1993 study by the journal, investors in 120 real estate partnerships who sold early got only 48 percent of net asset value. "Invest with the idea of holding for the duration," Mr. Vorlop advised.
Also, given a general partner's broad powers, a partnership "is very much a 'trust me' thing," Mr. Jefferies said. That trust had better be deep, because leasing can be hazardous. Obsolete machines can lose their resale, or residual, value. The lessee may default. Leasing and resale markets may vanish in bad times. Even in good times, general partners must "buy right, lease right and sell right," Mr. Vorlop said.
Thus, although partnerships' high yields may confuse investors, these funds are "more like stocks than bonds," Mr. McDonald warned. Even buy-and-hold investors "don't get a return of capital at the end," Ms. Mahon said. Instead, they get the resale value -- whatever it is.
Also like stocks, the funds can stumble badly. Aircraft funds flew high for a while, but they were hurt by the recession, airline troubles and new noise abatement rules that made older planes unsalable.
Of course, fund risks differ. A diversified, low-tech, unleveraged fund with a creditworthy lessee is much safer than its opposite. "Each fund has different risks, with the appropriate returns," Mr. McDonald said.
Add to this mix the maze of partnership fees, and the sum may be too complex for investors to handle. "Most people won't know if they should buy or not," said John Markese of the American Association of Individual Investors. They must rely on a broker or a financial planner.
For all these reasons, many people avoid these funds. "Limited partnerships tend to be expensive and tough to evaluate, and if a good manager sells out to a bad manager you're stuck," said Harold Evensky, a planner in Coral Gables, Fla. "We used to do a lot of partnerships. But we won't touch them now."
Even for the undeterred investor, there remains the "P" word. Is the recent, execrable record of partnerships proof they should be avoided? About $11.4 billion -- the gap between the sums raised in 1987 and 1993 -- says yes, and with good reason. A 1993 Stanger survey found that buy-and-hold investors in 11 of 24 equipment partnerships did not even get their full stake back.
Others disagree. Real estate, oil and gas and the like "can be fine investments," Ms. Mahon said. "It's just that people bought those partnerships at the peak." And "there's nothing wrong with the partnership form, either," she said. "You don't blame all stocks if your stock goes bad."

HEADLINE: Justice for Jurors

 BODY:
Organized interest groups like trial lawyers and podiatrists -- and assorted professional naysayers -- are likely to resist the streamlining proposed in a new report on New York State jury reform. Which is why the jury process remains so cumbersome and jury duty so often unpleasant. And why Gov. Mario Cuomo and leaders of the Legislature must push for overdue changes.
The proposals come from an official group called The Jury Project -- 30 judges, lawyers, court officials and citizen-outsiders appointed last summer by Chief Judge Judith Kaye and Chief Administrative Judge Leo Milonas. 
 The group was told to look at jury duty with a juror's eyes, and did so with admirable fidelity. Among dozens of proposals, it calls for shorter jury duty -- ideally just one day if you do not get on a jury, or one trial for those who are empaneled. Other sensible proposals include raising the daily stipend to $40 from $15, fixing up dilapidated waiting rooms and bathrooms, and training court personnel to treat jurors better than cattle.
Those ideas accurately reflect the neglect and carelessness that infest too many New York courthouses, especially in New York City. The Jury Project's data show that city courts are overloaded with cases and under-supplied with potential jurors, more so than courts upstate and, indeed, in other major cities.
Currently, jurors are drawn from lists of taxpayers, voters and licensed drivers. Some 20 occupations are automatically exempt -- podiatrists, lawyers, the clergy and others. To broaden the pool and make it more like a cross-section of the population, the project recommends that names also be drawn from welfare and unemployment insurance rolls. It also proposes that no one be exempted automatically except judges.
In Connecticut, Illinois and a few other states, even judges are called, but New York's Legislature has rejected efforts to trim the exemption list at all. Such is the power of lobbyists protecting their clients' perks.
As for procedure, the group notes that New York is the only state with mandatory sequestration of juries in criminal trials, and recommends leaving it up to the judge. Sequesters cost $4 million a year; more than half is overtime pay for unionized court officers who, not surprisingly, resist change.
The project also assails a common practice in civil cases, where juries are frequently empaneled solely to create pressure for a settlement; the project recommends mandatory settlement conferences before juries are picked. It also recommends that judges or court-appointed officers supervise the questioning of prospective jurors in civil cases, to speed it, keep it relevant and prevent abusive prying.
Most of the panel's good work needs legislation. Anyone who has experienced an unsatisfactory tour of jury duty should enroll as an enthusiastic lobbyist for its enactment.

HEADLINE: Answers Needed on Iraq

 BODY:
"Clearly something went wrong," as Gen. John Shalikashvili put it, in the friendly-fire downing of two U.S. helicopters ferrying Turkish, British, French, Kurdish and American personnel across the exclusion zone in northern Iraq. The helicopters were reportedly en route to a meeting with Kurdish tribal elders to discuss responses to Iraqi military pressure in the area.
The only thing certain is that U.S. fighter pilots mistook the helicopters for Iraqi craft and fired missiles at them, killing all 26 on board. Beyond that there are only questions. A needed investigation has already begun. Needed as well is a reconsideration of U.S. objectives in Iraq. Risky military operations and prolonged economic sanctions are justified only when linked to explicit policy goals. 
 The profiles of Iraq's Hind helicopter and America's Blackhawk are different, but it is understandable that fighter pilots flying by at high speed might make a mistaken identification, even in daylight. Why, though, did none of the fallback safeguards against misidentification then intervene?
What about the flight plans for the helicopter mission that should have been available to the fighter pilots and the Awacs radar surveillance plane overflying the area? Why were the electronic signaling devices that identify American military aircraft to each other not operating? Why was it urgent to shoot down a slow-flying helicopter already under direct surveillance? Iraq has no history of using helicopters for combat purposes in the Kurdish exclusion zone.
That zone, like a similar one in southern Iraq, grew out of the messy sequel to the Persian Gulf war. In the weeks after the cease-fire, Iraqi Kurds and Shiites heeded allied calls to rebel against Baghdad. But the allies then stood by while Saddam Hussein used what remained of his army to suppress these rebellions. Belatedly, the U.N. Security Council passed resolutions calling on Iraq to treat its people humanely. On their own, the U.S., Britain and France established no-flight zones to keep Iraqi aircraft out of the two main rebellious regions.
But these allied air operations are no longer linked to any coherent policy goals. Independence for the two protected regions is not the goal because it is strongly opposed by many neighboring states. So the rebel regions remain in limbo, under formal Iraqi sovereignty but with no way for Baghdad to regain control. That serves a humanitarian purpose in protecting the Kurds and Shiites, but it also invites continuous confrontation, of the kind that indirectly contributed to Thursday's accident.
The United States needs a better policy, one that points toward an eventual end of military and economic confrontation. After much delay, Iraq itself has taken the first steps toward complying with the long-term arms control provisions imposed after the war. Baghdad argues that its moves entitle it to the prospect of some relief from allied pressure, especially economic pressure. The language of the relevant Security Council resolutions, drafted to U.S. specifications, supports Iraq's position. And some Security Council members are now ready at least to take note of Iraq's positive steps. But the U.S. and Britain remain adamantly opposed to any timetable for ending sanctions.
It is hard to sympathize with Iraq's brutal Government, which appears to be behind the recent attacks on aid workers, journalists and political dissidents. But it serves no American purpose to be trapped in an ugly stalemate with Iraq.
Investigating the helicopter tragedy is essential. So is revitalizing America's policy on Iraq.

HEADLINE: Turkey Battles Terrorists, Not Kurds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Tragedy in Turkey" (editorial, April 4): For more than 900 years, peoples of Kurdish background have lived on the Anatolian peninsula in peaceful coexistence with all other ethnic groups, a reality of the very basis of modern Turkey. However, certain extremists, who aim at destabilizing the region, found the turmoil after the Persian Gulf war convenient for using the Kurdish population in pursuit of their own ill agenda. The power vacuum after that war in areas bordering southeast Turkey has become fertile ground for the P.K.K. -- Kurdistan Workers Party -- to breed its campaign of terror. 
 As a Marxist-Leninist terrorist group, the P.K.K. had been stripped of its ideology with the Soviet Union's fall. Consequently, the P.K.K. claimed to represent the Kurdish population with a so-called program of extreme nationalism under the guise of free thought and expression. Its intention is to carve a separate state out of the sovereign borders of Turkey.
Unfortunately, it is easy for Western societies to confuse the terrorism P.K.K. represents with the Kurdish victims of the gulf war, whom Turkey and the United States try to help through Operation Provide Comfort.
No Government in Turkey has ever intended to solve the so-called Kurdish issue through "military means." Turkey's political leaders are wise enough to avoid the "Vietnam Syndrome." Instead, the Turkish Government has accelerated economic and social reform programs for the Southeast region. Such measures have earmarked nearly 17.5 percent of Turkey's total investment capital for enormous development projects in the Southeast, such as the Southeastern Anatolia Project. The P.K.K. realizes the huge constructive potential of such initiatives and attempts to impede them through violence.
You misunderstand the separation of powers in Turkey's democratic system when you speak of the Turkish Government's banning a Kurdish-based political party and detaining five Kurdish members of Parliament. Not the Government, but the Turkish Grand National Assembly -- including nearly 100 Parliament members of Kurdish origin -- voted to lift the immunities of the members in question through a democratic, legal and constitutional process.
They have been accused of capital crimes, but no capital punishment has been carried out in Turkey since 1984, although executions continue in other Western countries.
Turkey does not view its Kurdish citizens as a "minority," but as equal members of society. Turks of Kurdish origin have served as presidents, prime ministers, members of Parliament, governors and judges. We will not condemn these citizens to permanent minority status.
An unstable Turkey does not benefit the strategic interests of the United States nor serve peace and stability in a region already devastated by volatility.

HEADLINE: Tax Forms Are Done. Tax Traps Await.

BYLINE: By SARAH MAHONEY 

 BODY:
From the amateur's perspective, investing is like ice skating: try to add a little spin and you may take a tumble. Managing your money well and then stretching too far to minimize taxes is a case in point.
Having polished off their 1993 returns, many people will resolve to do everything they can to lower their tax bills next year. In some cases, they will jump headlong at tax-advantaged investments that are doomed to fail or are completely inappropriate in their financial situation. They may even blunder when deciding on a home or paying off debt by focusing solely on the highly coveted tax break. 
 "Tax saving is not a goal," said Carl Camp, a financial planner in Fullerton, Calif. "Increasing net worth is our goal, and tax saving may be a method we use to do that. But if I make tax saving a goal, I'm just going to make stupid mistakes."
In addition to losing their perspective, people often twist the words of a professional or take advice from the wrong one on tax matters.
"When they should have been talking to their financial planner or C.P.A., they were talking to an insurance salesperson or a stockbroker," said Terry Schonhoff, a financial planner with IDS Financial Services in Knoxville, Tenn.
He and other financial advisers described some common tax-inspired gaffes.
 
The too-big mortgage. You know the pitch: "it's the only write-off you've got left." Taxpayers have gotten used to hearing their accountants extol the virtue of the mortgage interest deduction. So much so that many take on a bigger mortgage than they can comfortably carry just for the tax break.
Technically, the accountant is right -- the big loan does save money in taxes. Still, many people spend considerably more on their monthly mortgage payments than they would on rent. As a result, mortgages suck up "discretionary income," or what's left after taxes and living expenses.
"Whenever I've done an analysis, the person without a mortgage has more discretionary income," said William C. Prewitt, a fee-only financial planner in Charleston, S.C. In other words, by buying a smaller house or by renting, you can invest in something more promising than real estate -- like cattle futures.
Of course, owning a home isn't a bad idea: it may appreciate in value, home ownership can be satisfying and block parties can be fun. But don't let taxes justify housing excesses.

The home-equity loan sucker. Because the interest paid on home-equity loans is deductible, people are quick to pounce on them. Used wisely, these loans may be money savers. But too often, people take out home-equity loans to invest, and don't earn a return big enough to justify it.
"If your new investment with mortgage money doesn't earn you more than the interest rate you're paying, you'll lose money," Mr. Camp said. Interest on the average home equity loan is 7.05 percent; that may be hard to beat in this market.
A similar foul-up: using home-equity loans to pay off credit cards and other debts. Theoretically, it is a great idea, Mr. Camp said, but practically, it is often the equivalent of going on a chocolate bender before starting a diet. "People wind up in twice as much debt because they run the credit cards back up," he said. "I don't recommend it unless somebody is extremely disciplined."

Insurance lemons. The life insurance industry knows that the tax deferral of annuities is an extraordinary sales tool. For some people, annuities may be a great choice. But annuities are a tremendous mistake for people not investing the maximum in a tax-deductible retirement plan, said Michael Chasnoff, president of Advanced Capital Strategies, a Cincinnati financial planning firm. "It's inherently more expensive to invest in an annuity," he said.
Similarly, the private pension plans that insurers sell are simply overfunded life insurance policies. "You are basically buying term insurance at a very noncompetitive rate, when you don't need it, just to get the tax-deferral," Mr. Chasnoff said. "Buying an insurance product without an insurance need is not a good idea."
To make matters worse, some investors park their annuities in low-yielding money-market funds. Bryan Schmitt, an academic associate at the National Endowment for Financial Education, in Denver, said: "The idea of an annuity is for money to grow tax-deferred at a faster rate. So if you keep it in a money market, you're defeating the purpose -- you're not even going to keep up with inflation and the annuity fees."

I.R.A. delusions. The greatest gift of an individual retirement account is that the money grows tax-deferred. Yet many investors do not fully grasp that they pay absolutely zero taxes until they withdraw money from these accounts. Instead, they plow retirement funds into a low-yielding tax-free investment, like municipal bonds, deluded about some additional tax benefit.
I.R.A.'s and similar accounts should be invested for the greatest potential return, at a risk that is acceptable to the owner, financial advisers said.

Landlord blues. Owning rental property, a strategy often bandied about by self-christened tax gurus, can save you money as the property depreciates. But only as long as you earn less than $100,000 and actively participate in the management of the property. Before making a down payment, estimate your annual earnings for the next few years.
"As your adjusted gross income moves from $100,000 to $150,000, you lose the possible deductibility of any losses from rental property." Mr. Schmitt said. "If you're over $150,000, none of your losses are deductible."
And often, people look to take advantage of the low-income housing tax credit, buying property in neighborhoods where they would be afraid to park their cars. "If the value of the property is going to be continuously deteriorating, you're going to incur an economic loss," he said.

Mistaken identities. If you are in the 15 percent Federal tax bracket and are considering municipal bonds or such bond funds, accept that the rich are different. You and Oprah Winfrey may have much in common, but it stops at tax strategy.
No matter how much you hate to pay taxes, "You're just going to be better off with a taxable investment that has a higher yield," said Isabelle V. Curtiss, a financial planner and certified public accountant in Middlebury, Conn.
A taxable bond paying 10 percent will give someone in the 40 percent bracket a 6 percent return after taxes, but for someone in the 15 percent bracket, the return is a much healthier 8.5 percent. The tax-free municipal bond may not do as well.

Timing mistakes. Consider the plight of the investor who spots a winning stock early and watches it rise. After eight months, he is pretty sure the stock has hit its peak. But holding the stock for a year would mean a long-term capital gain, with a maximum tax rate of 28 percent, rather than the short-term rate, as high as 39.6 percent. So he holds on to the stock, putting his entire investment at risk for months.
"You bought something because you thought the economics were good, and now all of a sudden, you think of the tax ramifications," said David Kahn, a tax partner at Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company, in New York. "That clouds your thinking. If you believe the stock has hit its potential, you should unload it."

THE GREAT MELODY: A Thematic Biography and
Commented Anthology of Edmund Burke
By Conor Cruise O'Brien. University of Chicago, $22.50.
This 18th-century political scholar was more than a crusty conservative. The author emphasizes Burke's stance against government tyranny, stressing his role as a champion of independence for America, Ireland and India. "Mr. O'Brien has brought back a lost treasure," John Patrick Diggins said here last year. His is "a brilliant work of narrative sweep and analytic depth." 

THE COLLECTED STORIES
By John McGahern. Vintage International, $12.
The characters in this fiction are, like the author, Irish, and they are usually bound to the rural regions of their nation by poverty and hard circumstance. But they are not without imagination, and these stories illustrate their various means of escape, whether it is comic-book fantasy or the wilds of romantic love. Last year our reviewer, Josephine Humphreys, said, "Mr. McGahern, a master of the clean, plain, powerful description, is able to convey the strange phenomenon of immanence, the presence in material things of nonmaterial significance." Ireland is also the subject of three memoirs by Alice Taylor reissued by St. Martin's Press. TO SCHOOL THROUGH THE FIELDS: An Irish Country Childhood ($8.95) re-creates the author's early years as a member of a large farming family. "Ms. Taylor's book seeks to memorialize a place utterly changed by time," Patricia Hampl said here in 1990. These girlhood experiences are continued in QUENCH THE LAMP ($8.95), in which Ms. Taylor fondly recalls rural rituals and eccentric neighbors. In 1991 one critic praised "the careful and generous eye of this gifted Irish writer." THE VILLAGE ($8.95) celebrates Ms. Taylor's life in Innishannon, County Cork, where she arrived as a bride in the 1960's and where she still lives. "What makes the story unique is Taylor's disarming style; she writes as though she were sitting next to you," one critic said last year. Contemporary Ireland is the setting of THE HEATHER BLAZING, by Colm Toibin (Penguin, $9.95). Eamon Redmond, a judge, finds that his conflicts with his son and daughter mirror the dissension within the nation, where secular social principles clash with a long religious history. Last year our reviewer, Lucy McDiarmid, said that the author "writes with the vision of an enlightened Republic of Ireland still being struggled toward in the world outside fiction." Another of Ireland's authors is seeing three of her early novels reappear in print in AN EDNA O'BRIEN READER: August Is a Wicked Month, Casualties of Peace, Johnny I Hardly Knew You (Warner, $11.99). In "August Is a Wicked Month," a London journalist separated from her husband goes to the south of France, where she takes refuge in an affair and pays dearly for it. "There is some pathos in this vacation from morals," Martin Levin said here in 1965. Another wife seeks escape in "Casualties of Peace," a novel that centers on a frail sculptor and her earthy housekeeper. In 1967 our reviewer, Eleanor Dienstag, said it "pulsates with . . . racy, exuberant, nervous prose." The last novel, originally titled "I Hardly Knew You," is about the violent end of a woman's love affair with a much younger man, her son's best friend. In 1978 our reviewer, Anatole Broyard, criticized the book but praised its "talented and worldly" author: "She has always ridden the passions as if they were a magnificent horse."
BOILING POINT: Democrats, Republicans, and the
Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity
By Kevin Phillips. Harper Perennial, $13.
The majority of Americans are still reeling from the 1980's, argues the author, who demonstrates the devastating consequences of Republican tax policies and the decline in the nation's industry. Last year our reviewer, Alan Ehrenhalt, said this book is "an impressive piece of economic analysis and a troubling moral argument."
CONTENTS UNDER PRESSURE
By Edna Buchanan. Avon, $4.99.
The author, a Miami police reporter, has created an alter ego in the form of Britt Montero, a feisty journalist who is determined to find out the truth behind the death of a retired black football player. The police claim his car crashed while they were in pursuit, but Britt has other ideas. The outcome is "undeniably vivid and disturbing," Josh Rubins said here in 1992.
AFTER TET: The Bloodiest Year in Vietnam
By Ronald H. Spector. Vintage, $13.
Written by a former marine who served in Vietnam during the 12 months following the Tet offensive of 1968, this book chronicles the many misadventures of that agonizing period. Mr. Spector shows how United States foreign-policy makers exploited the young, usually working-class Americans who were thrust into the center of the war. He has also interviewed North Vietnamese, noting that their elite were also largely absent from the conflict. Last year our reviewer, Morley Safer, said, "There is a wealth of fascinating detail in 'After Tet' that will surprise both old Vietnam hands and casual readers." He added, "This is history, at its best." The often sacrificial role of American servicemen in the war is further examined in RED THUNDER, TROPIC LIGHTNING: The World of a Combat Division in Vietnam, by Eric M. Bergerud (Penguin, $11.95). The author, writing of the 25th Infantry Division, notes that the soldiers became lures to flush out the elusive enemy. Whether such a strategy would have been tolerated if the American troops had been more middle-class "is an especially unpleasant question for the reader . . . to ponder," Russell F. Weigley said here last year.
COME TO ME: Stories
By Amy Bloom. Harper Perennial, $10.
A finalist for the National Book Award, this collection concerns families in crisis, divided by death, extramarital love affairs, mental illness or simple accident. Last year our reviewer, Anne Whitehouse, said the author's "voice is sure and brisk, her language often beautiful; the result is humorous as well as heart-rending fiction."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
New Hotels Attest To Cuba's Reawakening

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
IT often seems that the only new buildings in this majestic but badly moldering city are its hotels.
Glass and steel high-rises reach skyward on the Malecon, Havana's curving sea-wall boulevard. Proud landmarks like El Nacional strut their newly renovated fin-de-siecle elegance. Meanwhile, along the country's generously endowed coastline, beach resorts are cropping up like mushrooms. Downtown, in the elegant Prado area, the Hotel Plaza opened recently. Farther along is the nearly finished Cohiba, and in the mostly residential seaside quarter of Miramar are the Triton and Neptune hotels. The new hotels here and elsewhere in the country are being built and managed with the participation of foreign firms. Spain's Grupo Sol and Guitart have become two of the biggest players. 
 What is more, there are guests. Scheduled flights and charters from Western Europe, Canada and Mexico pour forth affluent visitors by the thousands, leaving reservations at many of the choicest hotels hard to get during recent winter seasons.
With severe shortages and unemployment blighting the lives of many of its citizens, it is painfully evident that Cuba has not yet found a reliable economic road map in the wake of Communism's demise. But the one sure thing that the Government of Fidel Castro has determined is that fast and good money is to be earned through mass tourism.
Before 1959, Cuba was the giant of the Caribbean's tourism business, then in its infancy. Then came the Castro revolution, which, seeing the industry as a source of corruption, exploitation and debasement, all but phased it out.
It is clear now that Cuba has reawakened. Nearly 600,000 foreigners came last year, rising from a small base and surpassing pre-revolutionary visitor records after only about five years of intensive efforts.
If most Cubans must spend their days seeking to "resolver," or make ends meet, it seems that no effort is being spared to keep foreign visitors comfortable and entertained. Havana's once-famed night life again throbs with music, in laser-light discos equipped with the latest in imported sounds and technology, or in restaurants, cabarets and at hotel poolsides where top salsa acts perform Cuban hits each night.
Elsewhere, beach hotels seem to have taken their cue from Club Med and other vacation packagers. For rates that compare favorably with most of the Caribbean vacations, visitors enjoy all-inclusive stays with buffet-style meals, local excursions and activities ranging from volleyball and tennis to deep sea fishing and scuba diving.
Winter rates at the Sol Palmeras, one of the nicest of a string of new hotels on the resort peninsula of Varadero, run $120 a night for a double. In low season, the rates fall to $100.
If Cuba is hopping with visitors, largely missing from the crush are Americans. Allowed to visit Cuba, but prohibited by law from spending money in the country -- one arm of a United States embargo that has been in place for three decades -- most Americans are effectively barred from visiting.
Even this segment of the business seems to be on the rise. Although Cuban officials decline to provide data, American accents are increasingly common in the country's restaurants and on its beaches.
Most curiosity-driven embargo runners are reaching the island from Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other neighboring Caribbean countries that offer cheap excursions. Eager for dollars, the Cubans play their part in the subterfuge by abstaining from stamping passports of United States tourists as they enter and leave the country.
While Americans are still only a fraction of the total number of tourists visiting Cuba, for those who come, the island's isolation and status as one of the world's last communist states seem part of the lure.
"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to come here," said an American engineer from Baltimore who was visiting with his wife. "It was always so forbidden, yet so close. We were anxious to see it before it changes."

HEADLINE: HOW DO TOBACCO EXECUTIVES LIVE WITH THEMSELVES?

 BODY:
On July 23, 1992, one day after my husband's death from lung cancer, I spent a good many hours trying to persuade people at The New York Times obituary department to include the sentence, "He died of lung cancer due to cigarettes." The legal department objected to these eight words. They said there was no way to prove it; but in my grief and anger, these eight words meant more to me than the list of credits and movies my husband had made. A few days later, The Times found a way, and my husband's obituary included the sentence, "He died of lung cancer, said his wife . . . who noted that he was a heavy smoker." I felt satisfied.
A few months later, after a period of deep solitude and mourning, I decided to venture out into the world and went to the gala opening of the Matisse exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. The first thing I saw when I entered was a large sign that said the exhibit had been underwritten by Philip Morris. It felt like a fist in the face. 
 I'd been to many cultural events underwritten by Philip Morris and it had always made me feel vaguely uncomfortable, but I'd always rationalized my discomfort by thinking, "At least they're doing some good with some of their profits." Now rationalizations didn't work anymore. Your headline said it succinctly: "They spread the amazing wealth and, with it, their grim responsibility."
Yes, my husband should have quit smoking, as millions of people have. I watched him try many times -- using hypnosis, acupuncture, electronic beepers that help you cut down, even cold turkey -- but he could never stick to it. Was he just weak? No, he wasn't. He was highly disciplined, hard working and strong willed. He was also addicted to a powerful drug that he had been using since he was 12 years old, back in the good old days when the cigarette companies were allowed to tell us how good cigarettes were for us. Did he know it was harmful? Of course he did, but like millions of others he found this drug habit very hard to break and so he rationalized, too -- until it was too late.
That night, at the museum opening, I bitterly wondered out loud if the museum would have proudly displayed a sign stating that the Matisse exhibit had been underwritten by some notorious drug lord or mafioso don. My friends gently reminded me that "drugs aren't legal and cigarettes are."
At this time, it is socially, economically and emotionally convenient to rationalize the politics of cigarettes, but only until you or someone you love is forced by circumstance to walk into a crowded oncology waiting room.

HEADLINE: Parks in the West

 BODY:
To the Editor: Southern Utah's remarkable redrock country ("Treks to Tackle in Rugged Utah," March 20) is besieged by two forms of development. The first is mainstream economic activity: grazing, mining, dam and road construction, and (very recently) plans to import hazardous waste and to test guided missiles in remote venues.
Over the last few decades, many concerned citizens have suggested tourism as a way to halt irresponsible development, both by building a political constituency that would work against it and by providing the region with an alternative, more environmentally benign, economic base. Sadly, tourism now poses a threat in its own right. In some places, tourist-related development has compromised the very qualities of solitude and beauty that people visit the desert to find. 
 Learning about the fragile ecology of the desert, and how to minimize one's impact upon it, is vital, and I was glad one of your articles contained a sidebar on that topic. Equally important, when we use, enjoy, and come to love an area, we should give something back by accepting responsibility for its future. The most efficient way to discharge this obligation is to contribute time and money to nonprofit wilderness protection groups.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/383 Madison Avenue;
New Office Tower For Midtown?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
EVER-louder whispers are sounding in the real estate community lately: Rents are up, concession packages are down, space is getting tight. Is the real estate recession really over?
Now even those who insist that money speaks louder than words may soon have tangible proof of recovery. Howard Ronson, the British developer, has contracted to buy 383 Madison Avenue, a long-vacant old building on a wonderful site at 47th Street, for about $57 million. He plans to raze it and put up a 24-story, 800,000-square-foot multitenant office tower. The scheduled completion date is the third quarter of 1996. 
 A lot can happen between now and then to throw that schedule off, and if Mr. Ronson can't get financing, it may not even get built. But after more than five years of virtually no office-building construction, even the idea of it has created ripples of excitement.
"It'll be a pleasure to see cranes in Manhattan again," said Basil Vasilkioti, a senior managing director at the real estate firm Galbreath Riverbank.
Mr. Ronson isn't the only developer talking about new buildings. Larry Silverstein owns two sites, both on 11th Avenue in the low 40's, that have progressed from mental cold storage to back burner. And Lewis Rudin is talking to two companies about joint ventures in which Rudin Management would build and run two new buildings in Manhattan and the partner would occupy them.
Still, in neither of those cases is new money changing hands until tenants are lined up. And most developers have other problems that must be addressed first.
"We have 600,000 square feet in downtown to rent, and I must say that's uppermost in my mind right now," said Mr. Rudin.
On the surface, the tentative plans sketched out for the new 383 Madison Avenue make it look like a can't-lose proposition. It has huge, virtually column-free floors that can accommodate the trading floors and computer bullpens needed by financial services firms and communications companies. It offers twice the amount of electricity typically available in older buildings, ample round-the-clock air-conditioning, and back-up power that tenants can tap into in an emergency. And its high ceilings leave room for a lot of cables and wires.
Moreover, the location, right by what will soon become Grand Central Terminal's northern exit, offers a plethora of Manhattan amenities and an absolute dearth of large blocks of high-tech space.
"By sometime next year there will be no major blocks of space in midtown that are designed for the 21st century," said Jerry L. Cohen, vice chairman of Cushman & Wakefield. Nor will new ones quickly fill the gap, added Stephen B. Siegel, the Edward S. Gordon Company's chief executive. "With the exception of this building, no new space will come on stream before 1996," he said.
HRO International, Mr. Ronson's New York company, is banking on that shortage. "We don't have to compete with anything new," said Larry J. Wyman, head of HRO. "In a sense, we have a monopoly."
THE sticking point, as usual, is money. The existing building's foundation is reusable, with some structural bracing, so construction costs will probably be lower than for most new buildings. And HRO seems to have a good shot at getting tax breaks from the city and favorable work rules from the building-trades union -- for example, an agreement to let HRO use several shifts of workers without incurring overtime charges.
"The general attitude of the unions and of this administration is that they want to see new construction in New York," said Steven Spinola, head of the Real Estate Board of New York, who has acted as intermediary between HRO, the city and the labor leaders.
Still, people close to the project say that the building will cost at least $200 million to put up and that customizing space for tenants will probably add $50 a foot to costs.
To cover those kinds of costs, HRO will have to charge at least $52 a square foot in annual rent, a figure that can cause sticker shock in a city where space in even the finest buildings rents in the $40's.
"Tenants are just not yet ready to pass the $50 mark," said David Elovitz, senior managing director of Williams Real Estate. "But then again, six months ago you couldn't get these people to think beyond $38 or $42."
If the market continues its recovery, space in prime buildings may well be going for more than $50 a foot several years from now. But HRO needs its commitments now, and Mr. Wyman concedes that no one wants to be the first tenant to write an over-$50 lease.
Thus, the race is against the clock. HRO says it expects to take title from First Boston Corporation in early autumn. G. Ware Travelstead, once First Boston's partner in the 383 Madison site, has fought a long-running legal battle involving the use of air rights from Grand Central Terminal at the site. After lower courts found against his suit, Mr. Travelstead has taken it to the United States Supreme Court. HRO is banking that the Court will refuse to hear the appeal.
Other problems are more immediate. HRO is unlikely to have signed leases any time soon. And in today's risk-averse climate, HRO is unlikely to get financing without at least 40 percent of the building preleased.
"It's a great building in a great location, but getting a tenant will be essential to its success," said Peter L. Malkin, chairman of W & M Properties, a development firm.
Of course, Mr. Ronson could take on partners. "There's so much capital out there he could get this off the ground on a high equity deal," said Mr. Siegel of Edward S. Gordon.
And HRO itself has a clean fiscal slate. By 1991 Sanwa Bank had foreclosed on Financial Square, HRO's 1.2-million-square-foot building downtown. HRO had returned title to Broad Financial Center, its 400,000-square-foot downtown building, to the Bank of Nova Scotia. And it had sold 380 Madison Avenue, across the street from the new building.
"WE were among the first to go into workouts with lenders, and it was embarrassing," Mr. Wyman said. "But by the time 1991 ended we had gone through the pain."
Still, the building's future seems to hinge on finding tenants. Mr. Wyman has made sales presentations to more than two dozen potential tenants. And he is trotting around prospective floor plans and lobby layouts to groups of brokers as well.
Despite the building's address, its lobby is planned for Vanderbilt Avenue, in part to avoid traffic problems that can be caused by the bus lane on Madison. A second lobby can still be created on Madison Avenue to serve a large tenant that wants its name on the building. For now, the building sports the geographically nonsensical but prestigious-sounding name Park Avenue Place.
In his presentations, Mr. Wyman is making a big point of the building's economies, noting how much tenants will save by having 24-hour air-conditioning, back-up generation and the like included in the base rent.
"Overtime air-conditioning alone can rack up $7 a foot extra every year," he said.
He has converted numerous brokers. Several say they have tenants almost ready to commit to space. Not surprisingly, many of those tenants are foreign-based and are paying well over $52 a foot in Tokyo, London or other overseas financial centers.
"New York is good value to outsiders," said Cushman & Wakefield's Mr. Cohen.
But timing considerations can still squelch deals. Potential tenants who are already bursting out of their current space cannot wait several years to move. Others, whose leases are running out, could probably negotiate extensions with their landlords, but that would be predicated on a firm date for Park Avenue Place, something that anyone who has had exprience with new construction is unlikely to count on.
Even at this early stage, the timetable is causing problems. Mariyon I. Robertson, executive managing director of the real estate firm of Joseph Hilton & Associates, has an Asian client whose current lease expires next year and who is very interested in taking 160,000 square feet at Park Avenue Place.
"They might extend that lease, but they'd need a definite time that they could move," Mr. Robertson said. He is prepared to negotiate contingency plans with HRO so that the client comes out whole if the building falls behind schedule, but the issue is troublesome enough that he gives it only a "50-50 chance" that the talks will result in an actual lease.
Still, despite all the possible kinks and what-ifs, most real estate insiders think that, in the end, the building will be built.
"This is a perfect location," said Larry Silverstein, head of Silverstein Properties. "I have little doubt that you can build a first-class building there and find a large enough user to get the financing."

HEADLINE: Lincoln Square: Growth and Doubts

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES these days, the developer Philip E. Aarons sits in his office at Broadway and 67th Street, gazes out his fifth-floor windows and thinks of the Eiffel Tower.
Just across Broadway, and just outside his windows, Lincoln Square, his $250 million, 47-story combination of rental apartments, condominiums, seven-level health club, movie multiplex and commercial space, is nearing completion. The building has been criticized for its height, its bulk, the increased pedestrian and vehicular traffic it will bring and, most especially, for the two-tone brick in shades of burnt sienna and burnt umber with which it is clad. 
 Even some of the building's champions, who with one breath declaim how wonderful it and neighboring development will be for the West Side, with the next declare the brickwork "hideous." And Joseph B. Rose, the new City Planning Commissioner, said in an interview that the building was "out of scale with the traditional character of the Upper West Side."
But sitting in his office, his new tower looming behind him, Mr. Aarons was quick to cite the Paris landmark in coming to the defense of his edifice. "People hated the Eiffel Tower when it was first built," he said. "Now it's considered one of the great monuments of the world."
Mr. Aarons, who is in partnership with Christopher M. Jeffries in the Millennium Partners development firm, does not put Lincoln Square in the same category as M. Eiffel's structure. "But I would warn people against judging the building before it's finished," he said. "I think it is looking better all the time. I think when the entire thing is done and the scaffolding is off people will have a much more positive view."
That, of course, remains to be seen. But what is clear is that the 545-foot-tall building, as it towers above many of its high-rise neighbors, stands as a symbol for the pluses and the minuses of the major development that is occurring on the West Side of Manhattan, and specifically in what is called the Special Lincoln Square District in the area around Lincoln Center.
The development, which is unmatched these days anywhere else in New York City, includes two other Millennium buildings on neighboring sites that are to form an "urban entertainment center."
The construction has been hailed by developers and other real-estate people as the continuation of a West Side renaissance. But it has also been strongly criticized by opponents who see the increased density and potenial strain on resources it will bring with it as a serious threat to the livability of the neighborhood. The opponents warn that further development could turn Broadway into a dark valley surrounded by faceless towers and forever change the nature of West Side.
ADDING to the concern over density is the large-scale development begun or planned for the outskirts of the Lincoln Square district, including Donald Trump's huge Riverside South development from 59th to 72d Street near the West Side Highway; Manhattan West, the million-square-foot, 1,000-apartment residential complex scheduled to be completed in the summer of 1995 between 61st and 64th Streets on the west side of West End Avenue; the remodeling by Mr. Trump and his associates of the former Gulf and Western Building at Columbus Circle into a $200 million-plus luxury apartment tower, and the plans for Columbus Center across the street on the former New York Coliseum site, which are currently the subject of negotiations involving Mortimer Zuckerman, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city.
A report prepared for Landmark West, a community organization that seeks stricter controls on development, found that 2,895 new residential units were likely to be constructed within the special district and 10,000 new residential units were likely to be built adjacent to it in the near future. "Proposed and potential development points to a massive number of units likely to be constructed at the periphery of the district," concluded the report, prepared by Buckhurst Fish Hutton Katz & Jacquemart, Manhattan urban-planning consultants.
Within the Special Lincoln Square District itself, the three projects currently under way, or about to be, are all being developed by Millennium Partners. On the Lincoln Square site, and on two neighboring ones, Mr. Aarons and his partners are putting up what he describes as an "urban entertainment center," an idea that seemed appropriate to him given the proximity to Lincoln Center and to the headquarters and studios of Capital Cities/ABC.
The three Millennium sites will contain about 540,000 square feet of commercial space, at, above and below street level, and about 600 rental or condominium apartments in the buildings' towers.
The first that will be completed, the Lincoln Square building, bounded by Broadway, Columbus Avenue, 67th and 68th Streets, will include a seven-level sports and fitness club called Reebok Gymnaseum, a Reebok store, a Coconuts music and video store, a 10-theater, five-story Loews multiplex, and the Ansonia Post Office. Mr. Aarons said the building was to open in stages, with the theaters and some apartments to be ready in early fall and the retail stores "hopefully by Christmas."
The building contains both rental and condominium apartments. The top 11 floors contain 83 condominium units, which have unobstructed park views, will be reached through a separate entrance and are to go on sale late in May. They are priced at about $700 a square foot, or more than $1 million for a 1,500-square-foot corner two-bedroom. Those apartments were sold in bulk to a partnership that includes the Zeckendorf Company, Sumitomo Real Estate Sales and Goldman, Sachs and that is to resell them as condominiums.
To enhance its looks, the Lincoln Square building will also have, on the Columbus Avenue side, a large 100- by 46-foot mural. "We are considering a number of proposals from artists," Mr. Aarons said. "It will be a commissioned fine-art piece in glass." (Mr. Aarons has denied that the artwork, which was not in the building's original plan, was a result of community complaints about the building's uninterrupted brick facade.)
The second building, one block south in what is now a large hole in the ground, will be 315 feet and about 30 stories high and will include a 60,000-square-foot Barnes and Noble superstore. It is scheduled to be completed in August 1995, with a price tag of about $100 million.
The third, on the west side of Broadway between 66th and 67th Streets, will replace the building where Mr. Aarons how has his offices and which now houses a Tower Records store and a Tower Video store. A building of 350,000 to 400,000 square feet is planned, at a cost of about $100 million, with a residential tower of no more than 30 stories above a commercial base. It is to include a new 40,000- to 50,000-square-foot Tower Records store, three times the size of the current Tower Records emporium. The building now on the site is to be demolished in early 1995, with completion of the new building scheduled for fall 1996.
THE second building is smaller than the first, and the third will be too, because of community protests over the size of the Lincoln Square building. That project is being constructed "as of right," meaning that no public hearings or special permissions were required because all aspects of it conformed to the rules of the Special Lincoln Square Zoning District.
The district, which runs from 60th to 68th Street and from Amsterdam Avenue east to the boundary of the Upper West Side-Central Park West Historic District, was created in the late 1960's specifically to encourage development in the neighborhood, with the idea that the neighborhood remain mixed-use residential, entertainment and commercial.
When some community groups realized what Millennium had wrought with the Lincoln Square building, they unsuccessfully tried to stop the project. In reaction to the community protest in an area that had seen 18 new buildings in 30 years, the city's Department of Planning earlier this year adopted new zoning regulations for the Special Lincoln Square District that limited commercial floor space and movie theaters in the northern part of the district and limited the height of buildings by requiring that 60 percent of their interior space be below 150 feet. The new rules should result in squatter new buildings about 25 to 30 stories tall.
Neighborhood organizations, however, had sought even tougher limits. Amid rhetoric comparing the ambiance of the neighborhood to the 10 plagues of Egypt, Community Board No. 7, which covers the area, voted for an outright height limit of 275 feet and a rule requiring public review of each new proposed building. That suggestion was rejected, and many neighborhood groups are still angry.
"The previous zoning led to an unexpected result," said Elizabeth Starkey, the community board chairwoman. "We woke up one day to find that the Upper West Side had become an 'urban entertainment center.' That was a great shock to everyone. It's not exactly what we had in mind. I think all of us, Lincoln Center and the various developers and owners, need to look at this together and effect some kind of change."
VICTOR CALIANDRO, an architect and a consultant to Landmark West, said the development would have an immediate impact on the sidewalks, on pedestrian congestion and on the 66th Street subway station.
"Lincoln Square, according to a Department of City Planning report, is going to be adding 41,500 person trips per day to the neighborhood," Mr. Caliandro said. "The other two Millennium buildings are going to be adding even more. You have to consider the effect of the three buildings together. And we don't even understand the impact the buildings will have on vehicle traffic in an already tremendously congested area."
Some say the problem lies in the concept of the special zoning district itself. "The thinking that created it dates from the late 1960's," said Edward C. Wallace, Landmark West's lawyer, "when there was a vision of the city as large towers and broad expanses, and a vision of unlimited growth."
"We've learned a lot since then about the nature of the city," Mr. Wallace said. "We no longer think of vast towers in superblocks and agglomerations of towers but rather buildings that are more modest, that are more known and understandable."
Mr. Wallace said that the new Millennium buildings would "overwhelm what should be the center of attention, Lincoln Center."
"It's like putting La Defense," the huge French residential and commercial high-rise complex, "in the middle of Paris rather than on the outskirts," he said.
"What's happening here is that you're compounding the errors of the past," he said. "The huge Ascap building across from Lincoln Center was never supposed to be there. There was supposed to be a mall down to Central Park. But that didn't happen, and everyone agrees that Ascap is too big in contrast to the low-rise Lincoln Center. Now it's happening again, and from a visual perspective Lincoln Center is going to be in the bottom of a valley that's darkened and closed in."
Developers and brokers, of course, disagree with Mr. Wallace's perception.
"Actually, I think it's all very positive," said Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a major brokerage and management company. "From both a residential and commercial point of view the Millennium buildings will be a very good anchor, pulling everything together. It will have a positive effect on rental, retail and commercial space in the neighborhood. Things like the Reebok health club and the Barnes and Noble are very good for the quality of life in New York and wonderful amenities for the people on the West Side."
AND Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center, expressed his delight at the development. "I think the Millennium developments are perfectly appropriate and will enhance the area," Mr. Leventhal said. "This neighborhood is one of the few in the city that is seeing an enormous amount of private investment, and I don't want to do anything to discourage that concept."
In addition, he said, he certainly was "not going to complain, having built a huge tower myself." Mr. Leventhal was referring to the center's Samuel B. and David Rose Building and the privately built 45-story 3 Lincoln Center condominium that sits atop it at 66th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and was finished in 1990. The combined structure, which includes a separate 18-story dormitory for the Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet, towers 575 feet above sidewalk level and was built despite much community opposition.
But Mr. Leventhal added that when it came to future development, he felt that "a more coherent" plan was needed. "Additional thought needs to be given as to whether there should be future rules on how much more development the area can absorb and at what further restrictions might be appropriate," he said.
Mr. Rose, the Planning Commissioner, said that as far as future construction was concerned, there were "real issues in terms of transportation capacity and sewage capacity," specifically the ability of the North River Sewage Treatment Plant to handle a large increase in load. He said he was committed to "look at the issue of whether a broader area of the Upper West Side does warrant rezoning."
But he said he suspected "there may well be the capacity for additional density" and that in terms of the special district, he was "not inclined" to "move to a further downzoning of an area that was just rezoned."
The traffic in the neighborhood, especially at 8 o'clock curtain time, has always been congested, and concern has been expressed that the new moviehouses and health club will make things worse. As part of the zoning change, the Planning Department agreed to begin a traffic study of the neighborhood this month.
Kevin Davitt, a department spokesman, said that financing had been obtained for the study and estimated it would take three to six months to complete it.
MR. AARONS of Millennium said that he did not believe the increase in pedestrian or vehicular traffic would be damaging. "I don't think we will be in a position where we will make conditions considerably worse," he said. "I think the amenities the building will provide will absolutely offset any negatives."
In addition, he said, the Transit Authority is planning to upgrade the 66th Street subway station on the Nos. 1 and 9 lines and add additional exits to help handle any increase.
Mr. Aarons added that the fact that movie theaters and not legitimate theaters were involved would help ameliorate any problems. "Unlike Lincoln Center, where everything has to start at 8, movies have a great deal of timing flexibility," he said. "And in terms of pedestrian congestion, the theaters will have the most extensive interior waiting areas of any complex in the city."
The ticket selling lines, he said, "are way inside, and the waiting areas are upstairs."
"There will be a lot to do and a lot to see, so that people won't be hanging around on the sidewalks queuing up to buy a ticket or queuing up to get in," he said. "There will be a bookstore and a music store, so even if you get there an hour and a half early you're not going to be waiting with nothing to do. You're going to go into the bookstore or the music store. It's part of our thinking to keep people inside and active."
As part of its rezoning study, the Planning Department identified other sites in the Lincoln Square zoning district it felt were "soft," or ripe for development. These included the area by the Regency Theater, on the west side of Broadway at 67th Street; an ABC site on 66th Street between Columbus and Central Park West; the Saloon restaurant site on the east side of Broadway between 64th and 65th Streets, and the Mayflower Hotel and the empty lot behind it, from Central Park West to Broadway from 61st to 62d Street.
None of these sites, brokers and developers said, are likely to be developed immediately. Mr. Aarons said he was not interested in developing any of them. "Our activities are largely finished with the three-building complex we're planning," he said. "I think that's enough for one neighborhood."
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for the Park Summit Realty Corporation, owner of the Mayflower and its empty lot, said that "there is no specific intention at this time" to develop the site, although thought was certainly being given to the idea.
Ms. de Milly said, however, that the rezoning of the district had probably increased the possibility of something's being done sooner rather than later. The architect Cesar Pelli and his office are "looking at what potentially might go there," she said, with the notion of creating "a mixed-use commercial and hotel project."
"It's really years away," she said. "Though we used to talk about 5 or 10 years and now it's closer to the five-year frame for the project to come to reality."
THE idea, she said, is to take a look at what else is happening in the immediate vicinity. "With a slow economic turnaround over the next several years, that site might be very ripe for development," she said.
The question of development on the West Side, and specifically in the Lincoln Square district, is likely to remain a contentious one.
"Over the long term," said Arlene Simon, president of Landmark West, "what it is about is the quality of life. Quality of life is worth something, and you lose so much by destroying it. And it is also about being a good neighbor. A good neighbor enhances the location, and real estate, after all, is location."
Mr. Aarons said that he understood the criticism, that it came with the mixed-use nature of the territory. "By definition, the mixed use is going to create some level of conflict between the various components," he said. "When ABC wanted to expand, the neighbors complained. When Lincoln Center wanted to put up its new building, the neighborhood complained. It's all part of the diversity, of having different people with different views. We shouldn't be surprised when the people who live on 67th Street say the Lincoln Square building's too tall. I understand that."
He understands, but he does not agree. In fact, he even said he liked the brick. "But," he added with a laugh, "we have selected a totally different type of brick for the next building."

'LA FRONTERA' EXHIBIT
The Neuberger Museum at Purchase College has turned to the Mexican border as the source of its new exhibition: "La Frontera/The Border: Art About the Mexico-United States Border Experience." It opens today and runs through June 26 for its only East Coast showing. 
 Drawn across 1,952 miles, the border has been as much a ribbon of violence and aggression as a symbol of two cultures meeting and mixing. It is that intersection of cultural, historical and political movements that this exhibition seeks to portray.
The work of 35 artists has been mounted with the cooperation of the Centro Cultural de la Raza and the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego.
It includes painting, sculpture, photography, mixed media, drawings, installations and video art. Images of Tiajuana night life, political statements on the state of border hostilities, daily life, awesome landscapes and touching portraits will find their mark.
In conjunction with the exhibition, the museum has begun assembling personal stories by people who immigrated to the United States or who can relate the experiences of others. A team consisting of the Westchester Hispanic Coalition, La Casa del Pueblo and El Centro Hispano is collecting the stories in the New York City and southern Connecticut areas.
The results will be published in English and Spanish by the college's Center for Editions and Clifton Meador and titled "Border Stories," available for purchase by June 12, when the museum will hold a Community Day celebration. Although the time for submitting stories is limited, those wishing to participate should call 948-8466.
The exhibition can be seen Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission is by donation, and the number for museum information is 251-6100.
 
'OLDER AND BETTER'
 Dr. Joyce Brothers, the psychologist whose buoyant personality has earned her a niche in the media, will be the keynote speaker at the 18th yearly Aging Awareness Day at Westchester Community College in Valhalla on Wednesday.
She will speak on "Celebrating Life: Older and Better" at 9:30 A.M. after a registration period beginning at 8:45.
Later a panel discussion with Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council, Christine Mastrangelo, chairwoman of the college's department of finance and computer information services, and other members of the college staff will deal with the subject of lifelong learning.
Afternoon workshops will focus on resources and services for caregivers, the family in dramatic literature, health and wellness, getting a center for the elderly started and other subjects of interest to older men and women.

LITERARY LUNCH
 Three notable writers will preview their latest work at the Westchester Library System's Book and Author Luncheon on Tuesday from noon to 2 P.M. at the Tarrytown Hilton.
Murray Kempton, a 1985 Pulitzer Prize winner for commentary, has spent 40 years as a newspaperman and written nearly 10,000 columns, formerly for The New York Post and now for New York Newsday. His new book, "Rebellions, Perversities and Main Events," due this month from Times Books, will be the subject of his talk.
Mary Higgins Clark's "Remember Me," a suspense novel set on Cape Cod, will be published next month by Simon & Schuster, joining the 25 million copies of her books in print in the United States alone. Her popular mystery novels, some of which have been made into movies and television dramas, include "A Stranger Is Watching" and "Where Are the Children?"
The third speaker will be Hilma Wolitzer, whose "Tunnel of Love" is being readied for publication next month by HarperCollins. Ms. Wolitzer writes about human relationships, and her books have been Literary Guild and Book-of-the-Month Club selections.
Tickets at $35 can be reserved by calling 592-8214. Tickets at $50 include a copy of "Reading Rooms," an anthology of works by prominent American writers.
 
FISHING WISELY
 Ecological preservation and the rainbow and brown trout fishing potential of the Neversink River might seem like contradictory topics, but Robert Ewald, proprietor of the fly shop on the Eosopus River, will present a slide lecture on how the two issues can be joined. Speaking before the Croton Watershed Chapter of Trout Unlimited on Tuesday at 7:30 P.M., he will discuss access to the river, little-known fishing spots and newly acquired property, which the state can use to improve and maintain water quality and fishing stock.
Trout Unlimited, a national nonprofit organization, is dedicated to the preservation of natural resources, which in turn permits ecologically sound fishing practices to flourish.
Regular monthly meetings, including this one, are held at the Fox Lane Middle School on Route 172 in Mount Kisco. Visitors are welcome free of charge. For more information about the lecture and the organization, call 666-5727.
 
A SECURITY THREAT?
 Peter G. Peterson, Secretary of Commerce during the Nixon Administration and now chairman of the Blackstone Group, a private investment bank based in Manhattan, will speak before a joint meeting of the Forum for World Affairs and the World Trade Club of Westchester on Wednesday at 7 P.M. His subject will be "Economic Weakness as a National Security Threat: Redefining the National Security Agenda."
The event will be held at the Thornwood Conference Center, at 500 Columbus Avenue, beginning with cocktails at 6:15 P.M., followed by the lecture and a question-and-answer period and ending with coffee and dessert at 8 P.M. It is open to the public for a fee of $20. Reservations can be made by calling the Forum office in Stamford at (203) 356-0340. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
In a Cliffhanger, A Junk Deal Is Finally Sold

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES one troubled deal can take on almost mythical proportions on Wall Street, as onlookers gather to see whether buyers can be found at any price. So it was in the junk bond market the last few weeks, as a big West Coast drugstore merger appeared in jeopardy as investors balked.
Finally, the deal was done last week, bringing a sigh of relief. "It says the high-yield market is still alive," said Max Holmes, the junk bond strategist at Salomon Brothers. "This was a very tough deal." 
 It was tough because Thrifty Drug Stores, which is buying the Payless chain from Kmart, is run by Leonard Green, a leveraged buyout artist with a mixed record and some resentful bond holders. And it was tough because the junk bond market has been tumbling, a victim of the general bond market selloff. Underwriters led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette had to push interest rates on the bonds as high as 12 1/4 percent and throw in stock in the company.
The Thrifty-Payless deal says a lot about the state of the junk bond market. In one way, it is reminiscent of the highly speculative deals of the late 1980's. Mr. Green and investors in his fund bought Thrifty less than two years ago for $50 million in cash from Pacific Enterprises, a California gas utility that had made a bad diversification move. As part of last week's financing Mr. Green and friends are taking out $88 million in cash, meaning they have a clear cash profit long before it is clear whether or not they have turned around the business.
On the other hand, the finances of Thrifty-Payless are not nearly as bad as in some of the old deals that gave junk a bad name in the late-1980's. That this deal was a hard sell is indicative of the fact that the rankest speculation in the 1990's, unlike the prior decade, has not been in giving credit to dubious risks.
Instead, that speculation has taken the form of bets that the bull markets in stocks and bonds will continue indefinitely. That is the significance of Procter & Gamble's embarrassment, in which the fact it used derivatives for its speculation is less significant than the fact company officials evidently saw little risk in betting that interest rates would not rise sharply either here or in Germany. And it is the significance of the fact that Northwest Airlines was able to sell stock to the public but had to withdraw its planned companion offering of junk bonds.
Mr. Green, once a partner in Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen, has a mixed record in retailing. One supermarket buyout he sponsored, of Almac's in Rhode Island, is bankrupt. Another, Kash N' Karry in Florida, is in trouble and has cut back on inventory purchases to conserve cash.
That scared off some buyers, but the biggest problem was that junk mutual funds are running out of cash due to redemptions. Fortunately, these seem to have eased. But if they resume, funds will have to start selling bonds when other funds are not buying, a decision that could push prices down sharply until other buyers appear. But for now, the market has survived Thrifty-Payless, and that is cause for relief.

COMPANIES
 
In the Great Tobacco War, The Generals Go to the Front Lines
Battles have long raged in the trenches -- in offices, restaurants and hospitals, in tirades by lobbyists and activists. And last week, the pitch rising daily, the generals themselves faced off. The subject was tobacco. Industry leaders had come to Capitol Hill to answer charges of manipulating nicotine levels to fine-tune smokers' addiction. Yes, they said, nicotine levels change, but that's to enhance flavor. Is smoking addictive? A chorus of "no"s. Does it cause lung cancer? "It may," said James Johnston of R.J. Reynolds. But Andrew Tisch of Lorillard said, "I do not believe that." At one point Mr. Johnston lashed out, "If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold, then ban them." Next to the executives, their host, Representative Henry Waxman, had placed a placard that read, "One American dies every 80 seconds from tobacco use." If so, then 270 died in the hearing's six hours. 

Small but Shocking Health Crisis
The charges leveled against National Medical Enterprises were so appalling that, by comparison, the rest of the health care system just seemed to have a bad cold: that it held psychiatric patients against their will until their insurance ran out, that it got patients by giving kickbacks to doctors. Last week the company, flooded with lawsuits, tried to get on with its life, but given the grisly nature of the charges, it cost plenty: a reported $300 million-plus. That would be the largest settlement ever between the Government and a health care provider. Now all it has to do is persuade patients that its primary concern is their bodies and minds, not their money.
 
Not Good Enough at Motorola
Sometimes investors aren't satisfied with anything short of miracles. Last week Motorola reported quarterly earnings up nearly 50 percent, but the stock market -- conditioned by analysts' even-rosier predictions -- wanted more. In what one analyst called "a crisis of expectations," the stock plunged and kept falling all week, ending at $89.875, down from $106 at the beginning of the week.
 
Storming Intel's Fortress
Intel has long dominated a lucrative market -- microprocessors that do the thinking for personal computers. It also once had a powerful ally in I.B.M., but in January I.B.M. ended the 13-year pact, deciding not to make Intel's latest chip, the Pentium. And last week Intel got another blow when I.B.M. teamed up with Cyrix to make Intel-compatible chips. This "could well be Intel's worst nightmare," one observer said, and Intel's stock took a beating, while Cyrix's shares shot up. For consumers, all this competition for the mighty Intel could well mean lower prices.
 
Ford Shares the Wealth
At least one American auto maker is sharing the spoils. Last week Ford raised its quarterly dividend to 45 cents, from 40 (it's payable June 1 to holders as of May 2). And to pound in the point that it's feeling downright jolly about the future, it also said it would split its stock, 2 for 1, in July. Ford must have been in the mood for a spring tidying-up, for it also announced the sale of First Nationwide, its troubled savings and loan, and the purchase of the last 26 percent of Hertz. So, now that Ford will be paying a 3.09 percent dividend, perhaps Chrysler (1.57 percent) and General Motors (1.37) will cough up a bit more.
 
Diapers and Finance Don't Mix
Maybe this is the true danger of those fancy financial bets. Mysterious traders with powerful computers juggle billions as if they were puzzle pieces, and eventually mere mortals want to play too. Last week Procter & Gamble said it had taken a $102 million hit on a high-risk interest-rate bet gone sour. But what was a staid corporate treasurer doing mixing diapers with exotic investing? Not clear. But the treasurer has been replaced, and P.& G. is considering legal action against Bankers Trust -- the bank it worked with -- though Bankers Trust denies being at fault.
 
ECONOMY
 
Fed Fights to Stay in 'Neutral'
The Federal Reserve doesn't want inflation any more than the rest of us. It wants an economy firmly in "neutral," which it defines as annual growth a shade under 3 percent -- no more, no less. Its message now: we had it too good with those rock-bottom interest rates -- they got things hopping a bit too fast. So, yet again, it may have to nudge short-term rates higher -- even though it spies no inflation. And, no, there's none to be seen, with the newest evidence being a report that consumer prices in March rose just 0.3 percent.
 
Mr. Soros Goes to Washington
Yes, the House panel said it wanted to talk to George Soros last week out of concern that hedge funds disrupt markets. But let's be honest: Lawmakers like to be on top of things, and they couldn't make head nor tail of these odd funds. The underpaid public servants clearly wanted a glimpse of a man who could roll the dice on global currencies, lose $600 million in a shot and live to bet a billion another day. Mr. Soros was glad to oblige. But did all become clear? Not likely. What, they asked, is a hedge fund anyway? "The term is applied so indiscriminately," Mr. Soros said, "that it covers a wide range of activities." Should we worry? "I don't think hedge funds are a matter of concern." Class dismissed.
 
Los Angeles, Back in the Saddle
California is a land of extremes -- great sun, awful air, soaring peaks, nasty disasters. And the nation's busiest freeway, the Santa Monica, which reopened last week, a remarkable 84 days after toppling in January's earthquake. But even as gleeful drivers resumed their crawl, word came that, well, the road could be safer and some patching would be done. But one thing's clear: the state's economy is bouncing back -- partly because the quake brought a boom in construction jobs.
 
Act of God, or of the L.I.R.R.?
We've got no one to blame but nature for this winter's trial by snow, right? Wrong, says a report out last week blasting the Long Island Rail Road. On Feb. 11, said the report by the M.T.A.'s Inspector General, the railroad seemed to do everything wrong as a foot of snow fell: it ignored forecasts, let trains get trapped, even told passengers there'd be buses -- but forgot to order buses. Finally, the railroad sputtered to a halt. The report raised the possibility of dismissing the railroad's president, but the M.T.A.'s head called the shutdown "an isolated incident." Metro-North, though, ran just fine during the storm.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
After 7 Years, a Trade Pact
Believe it or not, those endless GATT talks came to an official end last week when 109 nations signed a broad pact on world trade. The projections are stunning: an average 40 percent cut in tariffs, a $235 billion increase in annual global income. But even as GATT gives way to a World Trade Organization, there's unfinished business. Al Gore wants to link trade to environmental protection, and there's always the issue of where China fits in. This subject's never really closed.
 
On the Lam in Germany
When American developers overextend themselves, they tend to hire lawyers and to bully creditors into digging them out. In Germany, a big developer has found a simpler solution: disappear. When the news broke that Jurgen Schneider had vanished a week ago, his empire, with dozens of unfinished projects throughout Germany and billions in debts, ground to a halt, sending stocks down sharply. Mr. Schneider was roundly blasted, as even his father said, "My son is a coward." Where is he now? "He told me he was going to Tuscany," one colleague said. "I assume that means he is definitely not in Tuscany."
 
Tigers and Rhinos and Sanctions: Getting Tough With Taiwan
At the turn of the century, roughly 100,000 tigers roamed the world; now there are fewer than 6,000. In 1970, there were 65,000 African black rhinoceroses; now there are about 10,000 rhinos of all types. Where have they gone? For one thing, it's common in Asia to grind their bones for medicines and aphrodisiacs, and Taiwan, for one, does a thriving business in the bones. But those statistics alarmed the Clinton Administration, and last week it imposed trade sanctions on Taiwan for its deeds, though a tiny $25 million of its $25 billion trade with the United States is affected.

HEADLINE: In the New Russia, an Era of Takeovers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: VOLGOGRAD, Russia

 BODY:
BORIS ISGARCHEV does not dress the part of a corporate raider. His shirts are of flea-market quality, with stiff, cardboard-like collars. The overcoat he wears is brown polyester, and his suit, when he wears one, is shapeless and old. But in bravado and self-importance, Mr. Isgarchev would fit in well among America's takeover artists of the past decade. When he gains control of a company, he proclaims, it prospers.
"My best quality is bragging," Mr. Isgarchev said, describing himself accurately, but with just a hint of self-deprecation. "I enjoy great prestige as a businessman. People know that I am fair. And they know that when I buy into an enterprise, that enterprise will make money." 
 Mr. Isgarchev holds shares in a dozen enterprises in this metropolis 550 miles southeast of Moscow, operations that range from chemical companies to bottling plants. But the apple of his eye in recent months has been the city's largest hotel.
The hotel is in a sorry state: Rusted plumbing delivers brown water to the bathrooms and almost nothing has been refurbished since the building went up in the 1950's. But Mr. Isgarchev thinks the hotel, with its palace-like interior, has the makings of a four-star tourist mecca -- a money machine in a city once called Stalingrad. Here the Russians finally defeated Germany, in a battle that became a turning point in World War II. That victory invests Volgograd with the potential appeal for Western tourists of Normandy or Dunkirk.
Other entrepreneurial spirits around town agree, and so a fight is under way for control of the hotel. It is a fight that, because it is so typical of what is happening elsewhere in Russia, says a lot about where this nation is in its transition to a free-market system. In many ways, the battle resembles those that have shaken corporate America. There are, for example, the acquisitive investors, like Mr. Isgarchev, promising at raucous shareholder meetings that they offer the best deal. There is the soaring price of stock in companies that have become targets. There is the disruption in the lives of many employees afraid of losing their jobs and wondering which takeover artist they should trust to save them. And there is the lingering question about whether such battles really do help companies, and thus the economy, toward better times.
Mr. Isgarchev, who is 47, is one of an emerging class of newly wealthy merchants in every major Russian city. Mostly they are men who have made fortunes since the mid-1980's by purchasing Russian raw materials for very little in rubles, then reselling them abroad for dollars. Now, for all the national chaos, the corruption, the gangsterism and the political struggles that are debilitating Russia, these merchants have found an investment that is hard to resist.
They have discovered that thousands of enterprises, until recently owned by the state, can be bought today for much less than they are worth. For so little, in fact, that it would be as if the American financier Henry Kravis could buy General Motors at $3 a share instead of the nearly $60 at which the stock is trading. Even if G.M. shut down, its buildings and machinery could be sold for much more than that $3 a share.
Acting on this knowledge, the merchants are buying control or trying to buy control of hundreds of companies from their workers and managers. And they're doing it with the full support of the Yeltsin Administration, which applauds the wealthy investors as catalysts in the conversion of Russia to a market economy.
In the first step of this process, starting 18 months ago, the Government converted nearly 10,000 enterprises employing roughly half of the nation's 65 million workers into shareholder corporations. In the second step, shares in these companies were distributed free or nearly free, with the biggest blocks going to each company's workers and managers. Now, in the third step, control is passing from the employees, who are considered not particularly entrepreneurial, to the merchants who, presumably, are.
In theory, the merchants will then carry out the critical fourth step: investing in their new companies to make them more productive and more profitable. The hotel here, for example, would require more than $1 million, by some estimates, to refurbish the 165 rooms, change the pipes, put in new elevators and a modern telephone system, and buy buses and other equipment to serve foreign tourists.
"These merchants are enormously important in bringing to Russian companies aggressive management," said Andrei Shleifer, a Russian-born Harvard economist who works with the Privatization Ministry in Moscow. "They often acquire 15 or 20 percent of a company's stock, and then they gain control by making alliances with workers or, sometimes, with managers. They are moving at a faster pace in their acquisitions than American raiders ever did, even at the height of the takeover wave."
What is not clear is whether the merchants will in fact make the investments to improve their new companies, or merely turn around and sell them at a higher price -- "flip" them, in Wall Street parlance -- to other investors who think they can then repeat the process.
So far, little such investment has been made. Indeed, Mr. Isgarchev sold his shares in the hotel at a profit. But he is on the hotel's board of directors, and he has said that he is ready to buy in again, if he can get control by purchasing enough shares, inexpensively, or by allying himself with other shareholders.
Adventurous Americans have entered the takeover game, advancing money to Russian partners, including Mr. Isgarchev's rival in the battle for the hotel. More than $200 million has flowed from the United States to Russia for this purpose, Government officials estimate. But again, the accent is on ownership of valuable properties at bargain prices, not major investment.
Meanwhile, the big hotel, called the Intourist, continues to deteriorate, like so much else in this struggling nation. But things could change. "Russia is crazy now, and understandably there is a reluctance to invest," Professor Shleifer said. "Maybe it will take five years before things settle down. Then, whoever controls the hotel will undoubtedly refurbish it."
 
The Target
If You Fix It, They Will Come
 EVEN in these troubled times here, a luxury hotel seems a particularly good investment in Volgograd, a city of 1.1 million on the Volga River. Volgograd is not only an industrial city but an important tourist center, thanks to its history.
Stalin came here in 1918 to defend the city, then called Tsaritsyn, against White Russians trying to undo the Bolshevik Revolution. Later he gave Tsaritsyn his name -- Stalingrad -- and many industries. During World War II, the city was destroyed during six months of desperate fighting that ended in February 1943 with the defeat of the German Sixth Army. Half a million Russians died, and Russians cannot forget.
Every year, tens of thousands visit the city, which was renamed Volgograd in 1961, after Stalin had been downgraded. They walk through graceful plazas built around war memorials guarded by majestic poplars.
In a central park, a broad stone walkway, lined with these poplars, leads upward to a pantheon near the top of a hill where the heaviest fighting took place. On the hilltop above the pantheon is the statue of Mother Russia, standing 275 feet high. It is the tallest statue in the world, 125 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty.
The circular pantheon, with its eternal flame of life rising from a central altar and its bronze tablets inscribed with the names of some of the soldiers lost in the battle, is as moving for an older generation of Russians as the Vietnam memorial or the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Washington are for Americans.
The five-story Intourist Hotel stands in the midst of these plazas and memorials. To look inside is to see its potential. There are graceful high ceilings, broad hallways, large rooms, thick quiet walls, and a white marble staircase that descends to a palatial, columned lobby.
The dream is that once all this is modernized, American and European tourists will come for two or three days, at $250 a day, and visit the battle memorials on group tours arranged by the hotel.
Then they will board cruise ships -- also arranged by the hotel, for a fee -- and sail down the Volga to the Caspian Sea, 250 miles to the south. The hotel might even own the cruise ships.
That dream fuels the fight for control of the hotel.
 
The Investors
From a New Breed Of Empire Makers
 BORIS ISGARCHEV'S image of himself is that of a combative and resourceful man, made so in childhood as the youngest of three brothers, and the smallest and weakest. (He is 5-foot-6 and slightly built.) In college, in 1970, he made his first bundle of money, by selling telephone poles that a state company had left wastefully to rot.
Trained as a chemist and accountant, Mr. Isgarchev rose to a top job at a chemical plant here, but his brashness got him into trouble with Communist Party higher-ups and he left in the 1980's to go into trade. Soon he was buying and selling raw materials like oil, and that made him rich.
Such fortunes are beginning to throw off some sumptuous badges of wealth in a city of mostly shabby neighborhoods where concrete-slab apartment buildings intermingle with wooden or brick cottages. Showy four-story brick mansions, with cathedral windows and broad front galleries, modern kitchens and two-car garages, are appearing. But Mr. Isgarchev still lives with his wife and a daughter in the small apartment the family has occupied for years.
Most of his energy is devoted to acquiring blocks of shares in state enterprises that have been newly turned into corporations. Many of his investments are in chemical companies, the industry that once employed him. But he also owns stakes in the tire factory here, two bottling plants, and a metals factory, among others.
Last summer, after the hotel's ownership shifted from the state to a shareholder corporation, Mr. Isgarchev bought 10 percent of the shares and suggested publicly that he might try to buy control of the hotel.
Enter a rival merchant, Ivan Grigoryev. Mr. Grigoryev, 36 years old, a burly man with a thick mustache, is a former journalist who made his first big money in the late 1980's buying American computers and reselling them. Besides computers, he trades commodities and was, for a while, director of an exchange, only to lose the post in a scandal that landed him in jail briefly.
Last September, Mr. Grigoryev bought out Mr. Isgarchev's shares in the hotel. Mr. Isgarchev says he received in rubles the equivalent of $96 a share, nine times what he had paid for the stock three months earlier. The battle for the Intourist Hotel was just warming up.
 
The Employees
Workers Wonder Who's the Savior
 JOB security, a hallmark of the old command economy, has become much less of a priority than it was just a year ago, when the state still owned most of the economy. Layoffs, shortened workweeks, forced vacations at greatly reduced pay and frozen wages have become widespread -- an inevitable byproduct of the struggle over ownership or the struggle simply to keep a company alive without subsidies from the state.
The privatization process in this nation of 150 million people has resulted in the distribution of stock to millions of workers, giving them big stakes in the companies that employ them. But many of these workers are now selling their shares. Often, they are hard up for money. And often they sell in the hope that the purchaser will save their jobs.
Mr. Isgarchev played to this yearning. So did Mr. Grigoryev. When he began to bid for control of the Intourist Hotel, people like Galina Tokarena came to him for help.
She is an intense woman of 39 who had worked at the hotel for 15 years, the last five as an English-speaking guide and interpreter for foreign guests. Today she is unemployed, angry and critical of the hotel's general director, Yevgeny Konovalov.
Mr. Konovalov, who rose to general director during the final years of the centralized Soviet economy, had promised, in his cordial, sincere manner, to expand the hotel's tourist services. Ms. Tokarena had believed him, but months passed and nothing changed. Then, last August, Mr. Konovalov eliminated her guide-interpreter job. She quit rather than take a humiliating demotion.
Ms. Tokarena turned to Mr. Grigoryev. He was just beginning to accumulate Intourist shares, and to openly challenge Mr. Konovalov. She sold him 20 of her 40 shares, stock she had acquired earlier in the year at almost no cost. Some of the shares had come to her as an Intourist employee; others she obtained in exchange for vouchers the Government had distributed free to every Russian, vouchers convertible into stock.
Mr. Grigoryev paid her, in rubles, $52 a share, which meant that each share brought her more than she had earned in a month at the hotel.
She knew that by waiting a few more weeks she might have sold for a higher price. Mr. Grigoryev eventually acquired 1,085 shares, or 17.5 percent of the 6,000 outstanding shares, including Mr. Isgarchev's 10 percent stake. As he bought, borrowing some of the money from a bank to make the purchases, the price rose to $128 a share in the late fall.
But price was not Ms. Tokarena's priority. "We believed in Grigoryev," she said. "We saw that it was worthwhile to concentrate the shares in his hands. If he could become the general director, things would be better."
Even as she turned to Mr. Grigoryev, Ms. Tokarena had tried to challenge Mr. Konovalov within the system. The hotel's 216 employees owned in late August more than 40 percent of the shares, four times the number needed to petition for an emergency shareholders' meeting at which Mr. Konovalov might have been censured or ousted. As a shareholder, Ms. Tokarena signed such a petition. Mr. Konovalov ignored it.
"We had signatures representing 10 percent of the shares," she said, "and he did not call a meeting. We scheduled one anyway, but people were too scared to come and risk their jobs, and Konovalov did not show up." As owners, the workers clearly lacked influence.
That has also been the case elsewhere. The tire factory in Volgograd, for example, is now owned almost entirely by its managers.
The Volgograd Aluminum Works, one of Europe's biggest producers of aluminum, is largely in the hands of a consortium of Russian bankers and merchants in league with the plant's managers. For less than $3 million the consortium is getting control of a factory worth more than $40 million, even in its present deteriorated state.
Mr. Konovalov, who is 46, finds this whole process distasteful. He would prefer a longer transition to a market system. During this transition, the hotel would be owned neither by the state nor by shareholders but by "the entire work collective."
Shareholding employees are clearly a problem for the general director. Disaffection among them opened the door to Mr. Grigoryev. Already the shares held by employees have declined to less than 35 percent of the total from more than 40 percent in late summer. "You can compare our shareholders to kids," Mr. Konovalov said. "They have not yet perceived what they have and they can be cheated out of their shares."
 
The Showdown
Grand Promises To Shareholders
 THE FIGHT for the Intourist flared at a raucous shareholders meeting in December. Riot police were on hand at the former Young Pioneers Palace, a few blocks from the hotel, where several hundred shareholders gathered.
Mr. Isgarchev, although he had sold his shares, took the podium and announced that he was worth $33 million. If shareholders needed his help, he told them, he could make another run at the stock. The shareholders, many of them hotel employees afraid of losing their jobs, elected Mr. Isgarchev a director.
Mr. Isgarchev acknowledged that if he were to gain control of the hotel, he might have to continue to shrink the staff, which included chambermaids on every floor, around the clock. But he would find jobs for anyone laid off at his other operations, he insisted.
In return for this safety net, he wants people to be willing to sell him their shares. "The Intourist Hotel may be worth $6 million," he said. If so, then the 6,000 shares outstanding would each be worth $1,000, or roughly eight times their current trading price. "We could buy more shares tomorrow from the workers," Mr. Isgarchev said. "They trust us and they do not know the true value of their shares."
Mr. Grigoryev, the other man bidding for control, had gotten on the ballot to run against Mr. Konovalov for general director. But he did not try to get into the shareholders' meeting. There was the possibility that he would be arrested, on a disorderly conduct charge brought by Mr. Konovalov after Mr. Grigoryev shouted at him.
Mr. Konovalov won the election, but not the battle. Mr. Grigoryev remained a threat, until very recently, when he sold his stake to a Moscow bank, Apabank, presumably for much more than he paid, although the amount was not disclosed. He sold to repay money that he had borrowed.
That left Mr. Konovalov unchallenged for the moment. But if Mr. Isgarchev makes another bid for the hotel and gets control, then he too could replace Mr. Konovalov. "This is a badly managed hotel that survives only because of its good location," Mr. Isgarchev said.
Mr. Konovalov's job thus remains on the line, unless he finds a way to buy control of the hotel himself (he owned only 21 shares recently). Or he might enlist a "white knight" to buy enough shares to insure his job as general director. Apabank, having acquired Mr. Grigoryev's shares, is a potential ally, he said.
Mr. Konovalov, naturally, is not well disposed toward Mr. Grigoryev's supporters among the hotel's staff. As he put it: "Good people will remain employed at the hotel and the bad ones will have to go -- that's inevitable. But those who have sold their shares, if they are not good workers, they will be the first to be asked to leave."
 
The Outlook
Little to Show For All the Talk
WHAT is striking in all the infighting is that no one says much about renovation. By most estimates, an investment of $1 million or slightly more might well produce profits far greater than the measly $109,000 the hotel earned last year.
Mr. Konovalov barely mentioned renovation, or its cost, at the shareholders' meeting. Weeks later, he has made only small changes, mainly new television sets in many rooms and some improvements in the telephone system.
At this pace, the hotel would still be, at the turn of the century, much as it is today: a landmark with fewer than half its rooms occupied, mostly by Russians paying $20 a night, not foreign tourists at $250.
Whenever renovation comes up, Mr. Isgarchev switches the conversation to his skills as a businessman. "We have specialists in hotels and in tourism, and we know how to provide services for foreign businessmen who come to Volgograd and stay at the hotel," Mr. Isgarchev said, referring vaguely to the staff of his investment company, Tsaritsa, a name suggesting Russian royalty and the rebirth of glorious days.
Mr. Grigoryev is not much more enlightening. He has as partners an investment group of 30 or so Colorado businessmen, doctors and lawyers headed by Robert Dawson, a Denver real estate broker and developer. The Americans advanced $20,000 to Mr. Grigoryev to help him buy Intourist stock, but with permission to sell the stock, at a profit, if he could not get control, which he hasn't.
"We would not advance more money to buy, say, 21 percent of the shares, but we would have advanced funds to buy a controlling interest, and still would," Mr. Dawson said last week. "Mr. Grigoryev would have to come to us and say, 'I have these stockholders lined up.' "
If Mr. Grigoryev were to re-enter the battle and get control of the hotel, then the Coloradans would invest $400,000 to $600,000 in refurbishing -- but in stages over years, Mr. Dawson said. The Russians "want to make Rodeo Drive out of Volgograd in less than a year," he said, "and that is not going to happen."
The pressure to invest comes from the Government, not the marketplace; specifically in Volgograd it comes from Yuri M. Medvedev, the 46-year-old director of the Privatization Ministry's regional office here. Mr. Medvedev's office has supervised the conversion from state ownership to shareholder corporation of more than 900 companies, including the Intourist Hotel. He was present at the hotel shareholders' meeting in December and his office has watched over all the buying and selling of shares in recent months.
No one seems more willing than the Privatization Ministry to let the market shape the transition to private enterprise -- up to a point.
If the marketplace cannot bring forth, fairly quickly, the minimum of $1.2 million that Mr. Medvedev considers necessary to renovate the Intourist Hotel, then the ministry will hurry along the process -- invoking a sort of industrial policy.
Specifically, the law has allowed the ministry to hold back at least 15 percent of the shares in each company going private. If the owners that emerge -- the Isgarchevs or Grigoryevs or Konovalovs -- fail to invest, then the ministry can sell the held-back shares at an "investment auction."
Such an auction for the Intourist Hotel is scheduled for next month or June, Mr. Medvedev says. Bidders will soon have to submit detailed plans for spending $1.2 million. The winner would get the 15 percent of the stock immediately, and if he actually invests the $1.2 million as promised, the Privatization Ministry will print up enough new shares to give the investor ownership of the hotel.
Have any bidders appeared for the investment auction? Not yet. And indeed, none might appear, in a world of investors still more interested in buying ownership of Corporate Russia for a fraction of its value than in improving what they own.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Preaching the Gospel of Reward

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
YOU might think a man who could write a book called "1,001 Ways to Reward Employees" would have put what most people would consider the most obvious -- more money -- at the top of the list. Actually Robert Nelson thought of that, and rejected it. "Most managers think it's just money," said Mr. Nelson, a management consultant now traveling around the country promoting his book. "Most people won't start with that. They want appreciation. They want to know what's going on with their job and how they're doing."
Mr. Nelson's book, from Workman Publishing in New York, bears a family resemblance to another Workman product, the design-and-graphics-intensive Silver Palate cookbook series. It documents the ways in which companies can make their employees feel appreciated, from having a chief executive stop by to pay compliments for good work to giving everyone, including receptionists, a business card to featuring workers in commercials or giving them cars. 
 Mr. Nelson says some managers will apply the suggestions simply to pat employees on the back. But some, he hopes, will be able to take certain rewards and mold them into new management styles at their companies.
Rewards, Mr. Nelson notes, aren't meant to replace increasingly hard-to-come-by raises, and in fact they serve quite a different purpose. The continuing reorganization of corporate America has taken a toll on more than those who have lost their jobs.
It has left behind people struggling to do more with fewer resources and less time. Entire layers of middle management have been stripped away and either not replaced or replaced by technology. Managers spend even less time with employees, and yet many companies are encouraging their workers to show more initiative -- to become, as the buzzword puts it, "empowered."
What gets lost in trying to keep up with the pace of an accelerating treadmill, Mr. Nelson believes, is the civility of the workplace. Managers are more likely to take time to deliver criticism than praise. Many reserve praise for the annual performance review. "If the only feedback is when they mess up," Mr. Nelson said, "that takes a toll over time. It needs to be done every day, not once a year." Treating employees with respect is particularly important in organizations that have suddenly caught on to customer satisfaction as a strategic goal. "If you're treating employees badly, eroding their self-esteem, they'll turn around and do that to customers," he said.
Mr. Nelson, 38, a management trainer with Blanchard Training and Development in San Diego, collected the suggestions in the book by sending out questionnaires to 1,500 companies and asking some of Blanchard's clients. The companies responded with descriptions of programs that fall into several categories, from informal "no-cost recognition" to traditional cash incentive or prize awards to employee stock options. The book also includes management tips from Mr. Nelson's experience as a consultant.
SOME managers have resisted Mr. Nelson's advice, on the ground that it is simplistic. "When I ask them 'Why don't you do this,' they say, 'because it is simple; solutions to problems need to be complex,' " he said.
Mr. Nelson acknowledges that the idea of showing appreciation to employees isn't exactly rocket science. And unlike plans to re-engineer or shift a company to a total-quality management model, which require organization-wide commitments and hordes of costly consultants, incentive programs are usually inexpensive and can be introduced into a company by a single manager, who may be able to nurture it into a formal program.
The reward-and-incentive approach is not universally loved. Alfie Kohn complained in the Harvard Business Review last year that reward-and-incentive systems are manipulative and oriented toward short-term gains, that they can easily be perceived as punishment and that they encourage workers not to take risks and thus ultimately undermine creativity.
Not only is Mr. Nelson unsympathetic to that approach, he can work himself up into a positively patriotic sweat talking about the value of soliciting opinions from the employees closest to the company's front lines and rewarding them when the opinions turn out to be useful.
"No one likes hearing about the Japanese anymore," he said. "The average Japanese worker gets 167 suggestions implemented each year. The average American worker has 1.3 suggestions implemented." The numbers, he believes, provide evidence that American companies simply don't know how to inspire their employees to work an economic miracle.
"We tell workers 'Just do the job you're told to do,' " he said, warming to his subject. "It's an erosion of the American spirit of enterprise. If workers don't care about their jobs and managers don't care about their employees' contributions, we have unplugged the formula that made America great."
But can giving someone three pints of free ice cream, as Ben and Jerry's does, according to the book, help revive the American spirit? If so, the solution to America's problems may indeed be deliciously simple.
 
 
 
THE ORDER OF THE GOLDEN BANANA
SOMETIMES a cigar is just a cigar, Sigmund Freud once observed during a rare light moment. But at the Hewlett-Packard Company, the Palo Alto, Calif., electronics and computer giant, a banana is not just a banana, but a corporate symbol. The company confers the Golden Banana Award on inventive employees.
The award is so named because one day a Hewlett-Packard engineer showed up at his manager's office with the news that he had solved a longstanding problem. "I did it," he told the manager, who looked around his desk for an appropriate acknowledgment and came up with the banana from his lunch. "Well done. Congratulations," he said, according to "1,001 Ways to Reward Employees," and handed the engineer the banana, which ultimately became, less perishably, the prestigious Golden Banana.
Robert Nelson, the book's author, points out that such events do more than simply reward employees: Employees get recognition and the company gets good will. The banana story became part of Hewlett-Packard's oral tradition.
"People tell the story," Mr. Nelson said. "You get the power of a story retold."

HEADLINE: For U.S. Miners, the Rush Is On to Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
FOR Leonard Harris, a craggy veteran of mining battles in the American West, Peru offers an investment climate to warm a rock lover's heart.
"We got all our mining permits in one year here," said Mr. Harris, general manager of a new Andean gold mine operated by the Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver. "One year and 15 days after approval, we poured gold." 
 Warming the hearts of Newmont stockholders, their 10-month-old Peruvian operation is producing gold bars for as little as $120 an ounce -- roughly a third the world gold price.
Up and down South America, mining companies from the United States -- as well as from Australia, Canada and South Africa -- are stampeding into the mineral-rich Andes mountains in a copper, silver and gold rush.
"Latin America is fast becoming the world's largest mining economy," said Eul-Soo Pang, director of the Colorado School of Mines International Institute in Golden, Colo. "By the end of the decade, Latin America's export of metallic minerals could double from $25 billion to $50 billion."
Mr. Pang estimated that Latin America drew more than half the exploration dollars of United States mining companies.
Discarding decades of prickly nationalism, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru have rewritten their mining codes to encourage foreign investment. The new codes establish clear tax rules, easy repatriation of profits, protection against nationalization and low tariffs on machinery.
At the same time, North American and Australian mining companies complain of increasing "barbed wire" at home: environmental hearings and native Indian land-ownership disputes that either block new projects outright or stretch out approval times for years on end.
"It's a push-pull thing," said Gary Livingstone, president of the Mining Association of British Columbia. "These South American countries are actively seeking North American investors, while in North America there is a punitive regime against mining that is almost a repelling force."
From Colorado, Mr. Pang said: "Suppose you acquire one land position in Colorado. It takes five years to acquire the exploration license. In Latin America, it takes 45 days or even less."
Today's mining rush is wildest here in Peru. In 1965, there were 12 foreign mining companies operating in Peru. By 1990, 25 years of socialist policies and guerrilla violence had reduced that number to two.
A new, probusiness mining code, a radical privatization program and Government successes against the guerrillas have dramatically turned around the mining picture here.
In an unprecedented boom, 2,200 new mining claims were registered with the Ministry of Mines and Energy in the first nine months of 1993. New foreign investment projects totaled $2 billion.
In a cascade of foreign investment the last 18 months, a Chinese company, the Shougang Corporation, bought the state iron company for $270 million in cash and investment commitments; the Cyprus Amax Minerals Company of Englewood, Colo., bought a copper mine for $522 million in cash and investment commitments, and Mantos Blancos, the Chilean subsidiary of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, paid $12 million for another copper deposit and announced a $500 million investment program. In all, about 20 foreign mining companies are operating in the country.
With guerrilla violence waning, the mining stampede into Peru continues unabated. To sell all the state mining assets, the Government plans to privatize in the next six months a copper refinery, a zinc refinery, a gold mine and two copper mines.
On May 10, in a huge sale, Peru is set to privatize Centromin, a sprawling Andean complex that is Peru's largest producer of silver, zinc and lead. The minimum bid is $340 million, with an investment commitment of $240 million.
"I have a better chance of running into mining people I know at Lima airport than on the streets of downtown Vancouver," said Mr. Livingstone, whose group represents Western Canadian mining companies.
From Colorado, Mr. Pang said: "We used to say that you needed a geology master's in order to get a job waiting on tables in Denver. Now my graduates are learning Spanish," and are going to Latin America.
INDEED, foreign mining investors are finding welcome mats across the Andes.
After centuries of mining, geologists believe that miners have extracted only 10 percent of Bolivia's minerals -- tin, gold, silver, zinc, lead, platinum, copper and diamonds.
In 1991, a free-market mining code was adopted. In 1992, new private mining investment, overwhelmingly foreign, reached $134 million -- three times the level of two years earlier. In 1993, Bolivians elected as their new President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, a mine owner who was raised in the United States and speaks Spanish with an American accent. Today, 15 foreign mining companies are prospecting in Bolivia.
With Bolivia expected to triple its mineral exports by the end of the 1990's, Alvaro Ugalde, general manager of Inti Raymi, a gold mining venture in which Battle Mountain Gold of Houston has a big stake, predicted: "In 5 to 10 years, Bolivia will have a boom like that in Chile."
Chile, the Andean pioneer in free-market mining policies, continues to be the leader in new foreign investment. Despite occasional warnings by mining analysts that Chile is "saturated," $7 billion of mining investments are planned through 1997.
Last year, mining received half the $1.6 billion in new foreign investment in Chile. In one huge deal, Cyprus Amax Minerals and Lac Minerals of Canada are negotiating a joint $1.2 billion development of a copper and gold deposit at El Abra.
On the other side of the Andes, Argentina is quickly waking up to its long-dormant mining potential.
Attracted by a new mining code that sets uniform tax rates and allows duty-free imports of mining equipment, 30 foreign mining companies are exploring in Argentina. Of the $1 billion in private mining investment planned through the end of the decade, one of the largest projects is a $100 million development of a lithium mine by the FMC Corporation's lithium division, based in Gastonia, N.C.
Large deals are on the horizon in still another Andean country, Colombia, which has long been off the maps of most international prospectors because of security problems in the countryside.
The Colombian Government plans this year to sell its 50 percent interest in El Cerrejon, the world's largest open-pit coal mine. The Exxon Corporation owns the other half of the mine, which is near the Caribbean coast. Since 1981, Exxon has pumped $3 billion into the operation.
Nearby, the Drummond Company of Birmingham, Ala., is investing $50 million this year to develop a private port for another coal mine.
In Colombia's rough world of guerrilla armies and bandits, only big companies can afford the high security costs.
WITH so much investment flowing south, environmentalists in the United States have taken issue with the view that red tape and pollution restrictions have contributed to the exodus.
"The environmental excuse is bogus," said James S. Lyon, director of government affairs for the Mineral Policy Center, a nonprofit environmental organization based in Washington. "It is more a creaming process -- the international companies are going after the most efficient ore," he said.
Noting that in several large Latin American countries, a majority of respondents to opinion surveys values environmental protection more than economic development, Philip M. Hocker, president of the center, warned: "We may be inviting a new wave of nationalizations if the conduct of our industry conveys to these folks that they are now the victims of environmental colonialism.
"It would be a wonderful thing if the U.S. mining industry were to adopt a policy position collectively that it would operate to top environmental protection standards anywhere on the globe," he continued in a speech last February to American mining representatives in Albuquerque, N.M.
For their part, mining companies deny charges that they are using sloppy, 1960's practices to dig minerals south of the border.
"All the companies that I know of are putting in the same environmental equipment that they would in Canada," Mr. Livingstone said of investment in Latin America, noting that the Canadian rules are among the strictest in the world. "It is only a short time before these standards will be worldwide. It is better to put in the right technology at the start than to have to retrofit."
And South American countries are putting teeth in their environmental laws. Last November, for example, Exxon temporarily closed its copper smelter in Chile for fear of exceeding its annual average limit for sulfur dioxide emissions. The six-week shutdown at Chagres meant the plant passed up producing 700,000 tons of copper -- about 10 percent of its annual production.
Increasingly, the diverse international structures of mining operations require compliance with international standards. For example, Newmont's $37 million gold mining and refining operations in the Peruvian Andes follow United States standards, in part because the World Bank is a minority investor.
"If people think that you can come down here and avoid pollution controls, they are wrong," Mr. Harris of Newmont said.
 
 
 
ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION
 IN a measure of the ideological distance traveled in Latin America, Cuba last year signed its first mining contract with Western countries since the Communist takeover in 1959. In two Canadian joint ventures with Geominera S.A., a Cuban state company, Miramar Mining of Vancouver, British Columbia, is to exploit an open-pit copper mine in eastern Cuba and Joutel Resources of Toronto is to prospect for gold, lead, silver and zinc in central and eastern Cuba.
But nationalist inertia is blocking increased foreign mining investment in two of South America's richest countries, Venezuela and Brazil.
Venezuela has not changed its mining laws since 1945 and little action is expected under its new President, Rafael Caldera.
In Brazil, Latin America's largest country, delegates at a 1988 constitutional convention decided to restrict foreign mining capital to minority partnerships with Brazilian-controlled companies.
Since then, foreign investment in mining exploration has plummeted to $9 million in 1992, from $57 million. The overall investment in developing existing mining concessions has dropped by more than half, to $500 million in 1992, from $1.1 billion.
"There is almost no new American mining activity going on here," an American mining expert in Rio de Janeiro said.
Last week, Brazil's Congress abandoned a six-month effort to amend the Constitution. Although surveys of congressional representatives showed that the majority wants to reopen mining to foreign investment, the Congress, divided among 19 political parties, failed to take any action.
Meanwhile, Brazilian mining companies and engineers are scrambling to modernize after the country recently abandoned longstanding policies of restricting imports of computers and mining machinery.

Orwell - Class of 1994

BYLINE: By Lawrence M. Fisher 

 BODY:
CYBERPUNKS and Internet jockeys sometimes call Neal Stephenson's novel "Snow Crash" (Bantam Books, 1992) the "Neuromancer" of the 1990's, a reference to William Gibson's seminal work, which appeared in 1984 and coined the term "cyberspace."
"Snow Crash" posits a not-too-distant future when the Los Angeles suburbs have incorporated as semiautonomous "burbclaves," each with its own constitution and contract law enforcement. Freelance hackers upload reams of random "intel" to the Central Intelligence Corporation and scrabble a living on the fringe of the technopolis. 
 The book's prognosis for the future United States can be boiled down to a pivotal passage, which reads in part: "When it gets down to it -- talking trade balances here -- once we've brain-drained all our technology into other countries . . . there's only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), high-speed pizza delivery."
For recreation, wish-fulfillment and business meetings, the denizens of Mr. Stephenson's bleak future repair to the Metaverse. In the Metaverse, which is part on-line chat room and part virtual-reality amusement park, individuals are represented by their "avatars" -- audio-visual bodies created in software. "Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment," he writes in the book.
Mr. Stephenson, a former programmer, initially set out to make "Snow Crash" an interactive multimedia program but found text to be the most powerful virtual reality tool of all. Last Friday, Bantam Books published "Interface," a novel co-written by Mr. Stephenson and his uncle under the pseudonym Stephen Bury.
Question: You created the Metaverse several years before the "information superhighway" became the rage. What do you make of it?
Answer: At the time the artist Tony Sheeder and I created the original incarnation of "Snow Crash" as a graphic novel, we had this nice portfolio that we carried into publishers. They were all fascinated, but they would all sort of awkwardly show us the door. So when digital media became a watchword, we realized we had just been two years too early.
Q: Was the decision to do the book in text commercial or technical?
A: The two are really related in a way. We figured out that our original idea of doing it as a garage production wasn't going to work because we would have had to have mastered TV and film and sound production. In a sense it was a lot easier for me to just sit down and write the thing.
Q: The most intriguing aspect of the Metaverse is the avatars. Are they technically feasible?
A: I think I know whom to work with to make it happen. It's just a matter of finding a business plan. It's already been done in a way. There's a system called Habitat, which was created in the early 1980's at Lucas. Their system ran on Commodore 64 computers, so it goes without saying it used simpler graphics than in the book. They even used the term avatar, but I didn't find out until after the book was published.
Q: You've been quoted as saying that the information-haves will spend most of their time with text, while the have-nots will be immersed in multimedia. Were you just being arch?
A: I wasn't being arch at all. There's an information have-and-have-not theory predicated on the belief that it's an economic discrimination; I don't believe in that. I think that the have-and-have-not disparity will be based more on what people choose to do than what they're able to do. If you look at television, most people are happy looking at "Married . . . With Children" and other garbage sitcoms. The same pattern is likely on the information superhighway: would people rather download the complete works of Descartes or play some amazing three-dimensional video game?

New, for the 4-Wheel Buff: Truck Chic a la Russe

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

 BODY:
THE burly steel bodies were designed to repel small-caliber bullets. Siphon tubes are standard equipment, for those who run out of gasoline in the mountains or on the Cross Bronx Expressway. The vehicles need little maintenance and take a lot of abuse. With virtues like these, who needs a compact-disk player and fancy upholstery in the cab?
If the sales pitch doesn't grab you, maybe the price will. We're talking $13,000 or $14,000, about half the going rate for one of those insanely popular sport utility vehicles. O. K., so it's really a truck -- a Russian truck, the UAZ. A Virginia businessman hopes there's a market for this no-frills Clydesdale in the United States. 
 "The Russians believe in having very low-tech, heavy vehicles that are low-cost and easy to repair," says William R. Anderson Jr., who wants to import the four-wheel-drive vehicles. "These are real workhorses. They were the pride of the Russian military."
But will they be the pride of American drivers, who like their trucks equipped with the comfort of, well, cars? Mr. Anderson is gambling that they will. He heads UAZ of America, a joint venture between American investors and a Russian factory that produces the UAZ (pronounced OOH-ahhs) for the Russian military.
And if he is trying to make a virtue of low technology, he does seem to grasp certain cultural fundamentals. His stand at the recent New York auto show featured young women in tights, boots and epaulets.
Nostalgia is big in the industry, as companies tantalize baby boomers. Mr. Anderson's promotional literature also pushes nostalgia: "In 1941, the savagery of World War II was in full swing all along the Russian Front," it begins. "Leningrad was under a killing siege. . . . Out of the desperation of wartime, the Ulianovsk Automobile Zavod (UAZ) was born in central Russia."
The vehicles "had to perform in the world-record cold of the Siberian tundra and the Arctic north, in the searing heat of the deserts of Kazakhstan in the south, over thousands of miles of unbridged, swift-flowing streams and rivers." And so on.
Mr. Anderson is right about one thing. Light trucks -- pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles -- are the fastest-growing market for the American automobile industry. Automakers are softening rides, improving handling and adding airbags, CD players and plugs for portable computers.
 
What's to Scoff At?
 But even the newer UAZ, designed in the early 1970's, remains defiantly truck-like. "It has not benefited from startling styling or comfort advantages in the intervening years," William Jeanes, the publisher of both Car and Driver and Road & Track, observed, perhaps charitably.
Some auto enthusiasts scoffed at the clunky welds and clotted paint. But, Mr. Jeanes said, "for $13,000 or $14,000, you can buy something no one else on your block has." And if that isn't enough, he said, a buyer can "help Russia adopt a new economic system."
Mr. Anderson is seeking approval from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation for the vehicles. He is trying to find American engines so they can more quickly pass emissions tests and offer air-conditioning. He says he is negotiating with General Motors, but a G.M. spokesman said: "We decided we did not want to actively participate."
No one said the road would be smooth. "Our vehicles took more of a beating in the auto show than they'll ever take in a lifetime," said Catherine Smith, vice president for finance and communications at UAZ of America. "Every time we had the hood open, anyone with fast fingers would take another wire off the distributor cap."

Anti-Western Winds Gain Force in Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
THE UNITED STATES gave the Russian Government a sizable and unwelcome jolt last week with the bombing of the Bosnian Serbs. Because the Clinton Administration didn't bother to advise Russia in advance, another rung on the ladder of trust seems to have snapped.
The Russian reaction -- humiliated, angry, even petulant -- had a familiar ring, but from another era. It united ultranationalist politicians with the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin in a fashion that signals a revived and growing anti-Westernism. 
 It is one thing for Ivan Rybkin, the Communist who is the parliament's speaker, to "demand an immediate stop" to what he called "the unsanctioned use of NATO forces." Or for Pravda to call the NATO action "aggression in the name of peace-keeping" and ask: "Why are foreign aircraft flying over Slavic soil?" Or for the operatic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky to fulminate about bombing NATO bases in Italy, to threaten to use his "atomic pistol" against demonstrators in Strasbourg and to vow: "We won't let ourselves be Zionized, Americanized or Islamicized."
But it is quite another thing when Sergei Shakrai, a Deputy Prime Minister and a reformer, says that the NATO bombing "was not so much targeted at Serb positions as at the internal political situation in Russia."
"The unilateral way in which this decision was taken is indicative of the approach to Russia," Mr. Shakrai said. "I think this is a blow to the prestige of Russia. It is a blow to reforms in Russia." And he added that the only group to benefit is "the national patriots," whose stock rises each time the West ignores Mr. Yeltsin and the Russian position.
American officials seem to think Moscow's pique is rhetorical, strident, even childish, and that it will pass. But the perception that NATO -- read the United States -- went ahead and bombed Russia's historic allies without thinking to inform Russia (which also had peacekeeping troops on the ground) may have changed Moscow's relations with Washington in a more fundamental way.
With the bombs may have gone the chance for a smooth diplomatic draining of the Bosnian quagmire. Saturday, with the Bosnian situation complicated by the downing of a British jet over Gorazde, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev flew to Belgrade to reassert Russia's influence with the Serbs. But the bombings themselves seem to have precluded the easy integration of Russia into NATO's Partnership for Peace (assuming Washington ever really wanted Russia in such close quarters with NATO).
Already Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev and Mr. Kozyrev have given up on the possibility of signing a framework agreement for the Partnership for Peace this week, saying that a possible relationship with NATO requires more analysis and a role for Russia "appropriate to its might and size" as "a great military and nuclear power."
It was Mr. Kozyrev and General Grachev who had pushed the impulsive Mr. Yeltsin back toward signing the document this week after the Clinton Administration, in his eyes, behaved disingenuously about the Aldrich Ames spying case. But now Mr. Kozyrev, too, seems to have given up the idea for now.
His spokesman, the usually careful Grigory Karasin, said that Russia had drawn "the necessary conclusions" from the raid. "We are against the practice whereby Russia is only consulted in the expectation we will give an affirmative 'yes,' " he said.
And General Grachev said bluntly: "I don't like it when people tell me one thing and do another. It seems we have to think again about our attitude to the Partnership, how Russia would join it and the role it would play."
While nationalist language and posturing is heard from every political sector in Russia these days, the soil of disappointment in which a new anti-Westernism can flourish is already spread.
Officials in Washington say they know about Russian feelings of humiliation after the collapse of Moscow's empire, about Russia's abiding ambivalence toward the West and about the perceived need for all politicians here to make a nod to Mr. Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist noises. Yet to Russians, Washington seems to act as if the disappointment and nationalism are merely rhetorical or temporary.
 
Open Resentments
 These days, Russian officials are far more open about their resentments: They are tired of being patronized by the Americans, whose talk of "partnership" is perceived here as increasingly vapid, reactive and hypocritical. Even those officials close to the West, who share the aspirations for a Europeanized Russia that is democratic and free, are fed up with being taken for granted.
They say that they have stopped believing in Western promises of significant aid. They feel betrayed by the West's inconstancy and fatigue since it became clear that Russia's transition to stable politics and the market would be long and difficult.
In other words, the disillusionment in Washington is feeding a cycle of mutual disappointment and impatience, and Mr. Yeltsin finds it harder to defend the notion of partnership.
It is not only Mr. Zhirinovsky who argues that the West engineered the collapse of the Soviet Union and wants a weak, destabilized Russia, economically dependent on Western investment and selling its brainpower, science, oil, timber and gas on the cheap. It is not only the Communists who are offended by the explosion of Westerners and Western products in Moscow, or by the sense that a Western market has thus far brought mostly speculation, criminality and open corruption.
These are criticisms heard regularly from centrists, industrialists and even disappointed democrats like Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
And as Washington tries to argue that NATO merely works for the United Nations, and that bombing the Serbs was simply intended to protect U.N. peacekeepers -- and was not a military intervention to stop the Serbs overrunning Gorazde -- America's friends in Moscow have a difficult time defending its policy. America's enemies here have a hard time keeping a straight face.
But when Mr. Yeltsin, humiliated, goes public with his humiliation, it only strengthens his critics. And when in a lurching effort to co-opt the ultranationalists, officials like Mr. Kozyrev echo their themes, it only endorses them.
As Natalya B. Ivanova, deputy editor of the monthly Znamya, said bitterly, "These days, Zhirinovsky is just Kozyrev in caricature." In the new unity of tone on foreign policy between the Duma and the Yeltsin Government on Bosnia, she said, "I very much fear the beginning of a new state ideology."

International Investors Bet Everything On Anything

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is a memorable scene in the musical "Guys and Dolls" where Nathan Detroit wants to bet Sky Masterson on whether Mindy's Restaurant sells more cheesecake each day than strudel. As Nathan points out, Sky Masterson will bet on anything, from caterpillar races to his own body temperature, so why not cheesecake? It is a useful scene to keep in mind when trying to understand some of the exotic global cyber-investing now taking place through hedge funds, derivatives or interest rate swaps. Investors today can bet on anything.
Got a feeling that the spread between German interest rates and French interest rates is going to narrow in the next 90 days? No problem. Some investment bank will create a strategy, and buy the bonds, the currencies and the futures contracts for you to bet that hunch. Some bank might even loan you the money to expand your bet so that if you win, you win really big. If you lose, though, you could end up like Procter & Gamble last week. You thought P. & G. made toothpaste and diapers, but like so many multinational companies they are also scouring the globe for exotic currency transactions or interest-rate bets to balance out the risks of doing business in many different countries. Betting wrong on some of this exotica, though, just cost P. & G.'s shareholders $102 million. That's a lot of diapers. 
 But, one might ask, who cares? It's just one company. Or it's just a few high-rolling speculators, like the billionaire George Soros, whose hedge fund -- a deep-pocketed partnership that invests in currencies, stocks and bonds around the globe -- dropped $600 million a few weeks ago betting wrong against the Japanese yen. In fact, though, Mr. Soros and P. & G. are the most speculative tip of an iceberg that now extends deep into the American heartland. International investing is now all the rage. Banks do it, mutual funds do it, university endowments do it, even the proverbial "little guy" is now playing global monopoly through his pension fund, even if he doesn't know it. Most of them are not betting with complex, high-risk strategies, as P. & G. was, but rather plain vanilla stocks and bonds, ranging from the Shanghai Stock Exchange to Frankfurt's.
In 1993 alone, total American portfolio investment abroad -- including pension funds, banks, mutual funds and private partnerships -- was about $125 billion, which was triple the average level of the previous two years. Several forces have contributed to this phenomenon, from advances in communications and global information to a slow, steady decline of worldwide interest rates in recent years, which created an usually stable investment environment abroad for both bonds and stocks.
"Investing abroad looked like shooting fish in a barrel for the past few years," said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman Sachs & Co. "But such opportunities arrive very infrequently. The norm is more of a roller-coaster ride, like we've just come through. That doesn't mean it is not the right thing to do, but anyone interested in a fast buck should go elsewhere."
Another lesson of the recent volatility has to do with the oldest principle of investing: diversifying one's portfolio among stocks, bonds, cash, mutual funds and markets to spread the risks. Global investing is another way to diversify. But in recent months global markets, from stocks to bonds, were all off at the same time, dragged down partly by the fact that they were so intertwined that losses by big investors in the Japanese yen set off a chain reaction that eventually helped drag down European markets -- even though the levels of inflation, unemployment, interest rates and other economic fundamentals in Europe were very different from Japan.
 
Jumping Out of Windows
 "We are now so interconnected in the marketplace that the whole idea of portfolio diversification by going into many different investment instruments becomes more questionable," said the market expert Henry Kaufman. Moreover, global markets are much less liquid than the American one, meaning that when they are falling it is much more difficult to sell out because there are fewer buyers -- especially for some of the exotic financial instruments tailored for only a very small group of potential investors. It's hard enough to unload stocks and bonds when the American markets are in free fall; it can be nearly impossible in Malaysia or Paris when people there start jumping out of windows.
Also, because markets are now so global, the traditional regulatory institutions that are supposed to monitor them cannot see the whole playing field anymore. And even if they could, they don't have the authority to intervene in markets overseas. American bank regulators watch the American banks, insurance regulators watch the insurance companies, securities regulators watch the brokers, "but nobody can look over the whole field, which has become highly integrated and homogenized," said Mr. Kaufman. "Some of the excesses and dynamics can go unrecognized before it is too late."
The reason that Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, called a hearing last week was to find out if any of the regulators had a full grasp of what was going on with hedge funds; he got only a very tentative answer. "As I understand the activity now," Mr. Gonzalez said, "you have anywhere -- it's not really known or established -- from half a million to a million operators throughout the world who, with a computer and a modem and then some line of credit, perhaps as little or as much as $100,000, can enter into the speculative market."
This is not only a problem for regulators, but also investors, who often don't really understand what they are buying into or what a company they may own shares in, like Procter & Gamble, is buying into. In the old days, said a top official at the Federal Reserve, if you looked over a company's balance sheet you could quickly see how much cash it had easily available, what its risks were if interest rates suddenly went up, and how indebted it was to different banks. "You would add it all up in your head and have a pretty good idea of their risk exposure," the official said. "But now, the ability of institutions to quickly shift their foreign interest rate exposures or engage in highly sophisticated financial moves, makes it very hard to ascertain their risk exposure from just looking over their balance sheet."
Which brings us back to the wisdom of Sky Masterson, who in the end turned down Nathan Detroit's offer to bet on Mindy's cheesecake because of a lesson his father had taught him: When a bet sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Sky's father's advice, which might be useful for all international investors, goes like this:
" 'Son,' the old guy says, 'I am sorry that I am not able to bankroll you to a very large start, but not having any potatoes to give you I am now going to stake you to some very valuable advice. One of these days in your travels a guy is going to come to you and show you a nice, brand-new deck of cards on which the seal is not yet broken, and this guy is going to offer to bet you that he can make the jack of spades jump out of the deck and squirt cider in your ear. But son, do not bet this man. For as sure as you stand there you are going to wind up with an earful of cider.' "

Euphemisms Mask Fervor In Latest Attack on Poverty

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THEY came to office talking of little besides the middle class. But President Clinton and his allies then quietly embarked on the most energetic anti-poverty effort in a generation. Recently their efforts have become a little less quiet.
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros convened a conference two weeks ago that turned into a coming-out party for the Administration's anti-poverty agenda, celebrating dozens of new or expanded programs. Seven other Cabinet officers joined him at the affair, which drew 2,000 people and had a program so varied it required guides to direct traffic in the halls. 
 "Economic development here, welfare reform across the hall," barked a woman consulting a clipboard, like a gate agent at O'Hare. The competing seminars bespoke the ambition that has come to the capital: the health bill here; homelessness programs there; youth initiatives, empowerment zones and tax credits down the hall.
While the breadth of the Administration's vision is noteworthy, so too is its lexicon, for what it reveals about the constraints on public debate.
Though one in seven Americans remains poor, the word "poverty" was scarcely uttered, and Clinton officials would never propose fighting a war against it, as President Lyndon B. Johnson did. Mindful of Ronald Reagan's devastating retort -- "Poverty won" -- this generation of Democrats argues that crusading anti-poverty talk, regardless of the specifics, would inevitably conjure a discredited past.
Instead, the blue banner flanking Mr. Cisneros's stage spoke of "Building Communities Together." The seminar rooms rang with euphemistic talk of "investing in children" and "empowering communities." Throughout the conference, aides like Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant housing secretary, engaged in their own ritualistic denunciations of war-on-poverty programs. "This is different," Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Cisneros defended the use of euphemisms, arguing in an interview that "you have to use some elliptical language" or risk turning "people off to the message."
There are polls and Congressional votes that argue he is right. Consider Head Start, the poor child's preschool, which sprang from the same War on Poverty, so seemingly discredited. By presenting itself as a children's program -- or these days, a children's "investment" -- it has grown by leaps and bounds.
But if the euphemistic talk builds coalitions, it also risks obscuring the nation's explosive mix of poverty, race and violence, evident not only at Florence and Normandie in Los Angeles two years ago but also last week at the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago, where gang shootings took on the appearance of civil war.
One of Bill Clinton's challenges is to make the nation see its urban misery with less resignation and more outrage, as only a President can. That is not a task for elliptical talk.
Mr. Clinton has, at times, spoken with candor and force. He did so last November in Memphis, when he tried to imagine what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would say about the quarter-century since his death: "I did not live and and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it."
Mr. Clinton called for action by Government, but not Government alone. He talked of the full array of inner city evils, "the ravages of crime and violence," as well as "the breakdown of the family, the community, and the disappearance of jobs."
There are advisers who want Mr. Clinton to sound these themes again, louder and more often. But others worry that too much poverty talk, whatever its nuances, will be dismissed as paleoliberalism.
"His advisers believe you can't allow the Administration to be characterized as a reincarnation of the Great Society without eroding support for the very people you're trying to help," said one official, who sometimes argues for euphemism and sometimes for louder, blunter talk.
The scale of Mr. Clinton's efforts is nothing like that of the Johnson years, during which Medicare and Medicaid were created, welfare, housing and food stamps expanded, and a host of smaller programs established. But beneath Mr. Clinton's cautious words there is more anti-poverty work going on since at least the time of Richard Nixon. Budget numbers tell only part of the story, since, in an age of scarce financing, many programs are being tested on a small scale.
It is hard to tidily summarize all that is going on.
Some initiatives focus on impoverished places, such as the plan to spend $3 billion over the next five years on "empowerment zones," which will provide social services and tax breaks to 10 poor neighborhoods.
Other policies focus on poor people, regardless of where they live. The most notable example is the earned income tax credit, which gives up to $3,370 a year to low-income workers with children.
Despite severe budget pressures, the Administration is expanding the program by $21 billion over the next five years.
Noting that the tax credits go to workers, some analysts have argued that the underlying principle of the Administration's policy is to help "the worthy poor," those who seem to be trying to help themselves.
But the reality is more complicated than that. Despite the public backlash against the homeless, for instance, Mr. Cisneros has been able to double the budget for programs that serve them. Mr. Clinton has won Congressional approval to increase spending on food stamps by $2.5 billion over the next five years, though food stamps go to the "worthy" and "unworthy" alike.
And the real story of the Clinton policy cannot be written until the tumultuous debates are settled over health care and welfare, two exceedingly ambitious initiatives that remain works in progress.
If Mr. Clinton succeeds in imposing a two-year limit on welfare benefits, it will be the largest change in the program's half-century history. He hopes his welfare plan, which includes an expansion of training and child care programs, will bring less poverty and dependency.
But last month his aides sent him a confidential memorandum that acknowledged some of the risks inherent in limiting benefits.
In what they hope will be "rare circumstances," they said, some families could be left "homeless or unable to care for their children."
 
A Changed Battlefield
 In his quiet war on poverty, Mr. Clinton faces a tougher fight than Johnson did. The battlefield has undergone a dramatic change.
One casualty has been the economy, which is no longer the anti-poverty force it was once, even in seemingly good times. Economists have repeatedly found that gains at the top trickle more slowly than they once did to the unskilled workers at the bottom.
A second casualty is the two-parent family, sometimes dubbed the nation's most important anti-poverty program. When Johnson began his Presidency, only 7 percent of American children were born to single mothers. By the time Mr. Clinton took the oath, the figure had risen to 30 percent.
A third problem that Mr. Clinton faces is the legacy of Johnson's own bold talk, embodied in the very phrase "war on poverty." It remains an easy rhetorical target for those who believe that any government anti-poverty effort is bound to fail.
His oratorical caution aside, that is one notion Mr. Clinton clearly does not buy.

HEADLINE: Mission of Hope -- A special report.;
Poverty Raises Stakes for Catholic School

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
For all the risky places Brother Paul Beaudin passes each morning in East Harlem, none holds as many uncertainties, as many gambles, as his destination: a grammar school.
He could discover that crack addicts have once again pried open the windows at St. Francis de Sales & St. Lucy Academy and made off with what little audio-visual equipment remains. He could find that the boiler has given out, and stare again at the numbers in his budget. Or, as is usual a few times a week, he could be told that a teacher will be absent. 
 So Brother Paul, the principal, will again forgo hiring a substitute and go to the blackboard himself. There he faces perhaps his greatest risk: shaping the minds and values of a troubled community's youth in the hope that they will reshape their own world.
And, as he discovered during an eighth-grade religion class in a discussion of free will, the worries of this world are never too far from the promises of the next. Inside the classroom, whose windows framed a morning landscape of housing projects and vacant lots, Christina Rivera pondered a hypothetical question far removed from the logic-twisting riddles familiar to Catholics of another age. She wondered what happened when wills collided.
"If someone points a gun at your head," Christina asked, "do you still have free will?"
Brother Paul asked the two dozen students how many of them had seen a gun in their neighborhood. All raised their hands. How many had seen someone shot? Most hands stayed raised. How many of them were related to someone who had been shot?
A quizzical voice piped up from the sleepy-eyed crowd.
"A victim or a suspect?"
Brother Paul improvised a homework assignment on the spot: discuss free will and the freedom of choices that really exist in the neighborhood.
The students wrote it down and toted it home, past the brick walls occasionally painted over with the words "Rest In Peace."
Parents in many poor neighborhoods say Roman Catholic schools are the only alternative to the public schools, which may offer some novel programs but cannot give their children a sense of safety or belonging. While studies show inner-city Catholic schools have the best academic results with impoverished minority children, parents say they care just as much about the education in values.
Catholic educators admit they do not reach the poorest of the poor -- tuition exceeds $1,000 a year, and scholarships are limited -- but their students live in the same housing projects, face the same challenges and have the same problems as their public school counterparts.
Perhaps because of the similarities between both sets of families, Catholic educators find themselves struggling to keep their schools afloat. Aging buildings and shrinking diocesan subsidies have forced schools to raise funds creatively.
But some educators see the lack of money as a boon. Alicia Vazquez, a second-grade teacher, calls the school "the little house on the prairie," disciplined and no-frills, dictated as much by resources as by pedagogy. The school is its own little world, where the principal knows each child's name and family and where teachers grew up nearby.
For Brother Paul, a member of the Confraternity of Christian Brothers, which has educated generations of the area's children, recent decisions have been difficult. Over the last two years Brother Paul, whose flowing black cassock accents his slender build and stern demeanor, has merged two financially troubled schools, rearranging classes, expanding preschool and after-school programs while increasing parental accountability and developing an "academy" that stresses math and science. He says that while his school's future, and the neighborhood's, are far from assured, he would rather gamble and lose than do nothing and vanish.
So when he looks at the children who walk past blocks of drug dealers, arriving from broken homes or families struggling mightily to get by, he sees his school as an incubator of hope for them and their community.
"I encourage my teachers to expect great things of every child," he said. "Our mission in these urban schools is that we have some sense of social responsibility and invest in people and places that are there."
 
Needs
Schools and Pupils Face Hard Times
 The European immigrants who were in East Harlem decades ago, in brick walkups overflowing with children, have been replaced by black and Hispanic families facing an economy and neighborhood that are even less accommodating. Among the few constants are their churches and schools, well-trodden paths to American middle-class life.
This continuity came at a cost, as many inner-city parishes battle shrinking resources, crumbling buildings and a decline in religious vocations.
The urgency felt by many Catholic educators soon dominated Brother Paul's thinking after he was appointed principal of St. Lucy's two years ago, inheriting a school with dwindling enrollment in its early grades and the threat of being closed.
One problem, Brother Paul said, is that working parents want preschool classes and after-school programs. Hoping that a preschool would feed pupils into later grades and an after-school program would increase revenue, he asked the Archdiocese to let him take over St. Francis de Sales, a school on East 97th Street operating below capacity.
Last September, the merged school opened with 16 lay teachers and 4 members of orders, teaching some 460 students, about 60 more than before. The student body reflects the neighborhood: about two-thirds are Hispanic, with about one third black and a smattering of Asian and white children. One-third are not Catholic. More than half come from single-parent homes or are being reared by grandparents, with 60 families on welfare.
Despite the social conditions, Brother Paul said he refused to feel sorry for the children or expect any less of them.
"We're not social workers," he said during a break in classes recently. "We empathize with the plight of the kids, but we don't waste class time. We don't have encounter groups and we don't say, 'It's a shame, these poor Hispanic and black kids from the inner city,' because in the end, we'd be ignoring their education and give them nothing."
 
Methods
Few Frills Or Excuses
 Father Francis Amodio weaved through the narrow rows of desks in his fifth-grade classroom, which he and his 25 students jokingly call the penthouse, not just because it is on the top floor.
"We're high class," the students giggled, including Melissa Vega, a 10-year-old with sparkling eyes that peeked out from her dark bangs. A voracious reader, she is one of the school's two spelling bee champions.
Her day is spent in the "penthouse," where Father Francis teaches them everything from religion to mathematics during the nonstop school day. He relies on few frills, save for an overhead projector and an occasional religious videotape for sing-alongs. But he pushes his students, using sixth-grade reading texts and advanced math.
"It's a lot of fun," Melissa said one morning as her mother dropped her off at school. "A lot of work. The teacher is really nice. Father Francis is funny and creative."
Her mother, Lisa, nodded in agreement.
"You should see some of the stuff he's doing with them," Mrs. Vega said. Last year, she said, Melissa tested at a ninth-grade reading level.
 
An Eye to the Future
 Brother Paul said the emphasis on advanced material, especially in the upper grades, was done with an eye to the future. "In junior high school you set them on a track," he said. "You give them that so they go to high school a little more confident than the kids who are not from an academic background."
Compared with public school students in their area, pupils at St. Lucy's scored mostly higher on state-mandated measures of minimum competence in reading and math, with public schools outdistancing them in social studies. Similar results were found at St. Francis de Sales last year, when it was run by a different administrator.
The school's own analysis indicated that three-quarters of the students at St. Lucy's were at or above grade level in math, and that on average, students in grades 5 through 8 were one and a half to three and a half years ahead of their grade level in language skills.
"They're very educated, intelligent and motivated for learning," said Father Francis. "People think because they're Hispanic they can only learn some of it. That's racist. They can learn as much as any other kid."
Father Francis conceded that some days the pace is wearying and long. Many of his students look forward to staying late, asking him if he needs help with classroom chores.
During a mathematics class, as the children scribbled out the solutions to multiplication problems, a steady stream of students went up to him to ask a simple question or just to show their answers.
"They want you to be with them, listen to them because they have no one to listen to them," he said.
 
Alternatives
Escaping Bullying Of Public Schools
 For some students and their parents, it's what doesn't happen that matters. Jason Medina, an elfin 10-year-old who transferred from a public school two years ago, said he no longer had to worry about bullies.
"At public school, every day after school you go outside wanting to go home happy but you had to witness fights going on for no good reasons," he said. "At lunch you'd see everybody stepping into each other's face."
His mother, Helen Medina, said the chaos she saw in her son's public school was a big reason for enrolling Jason -- as well as his brother, Daniel, and sister, Diana -- in Brother Paul's school. "When they stepped out of the school there was no control," she said. "Here, you see Brother Paul outside the school, controlling it. There's a fact that you can't get away with things here that they do in public school."
Just as important to her was her opposition to the New York City Board of Education's "Rainbow Curriculum," which included teaching tolerance of alternative family types, including homosexual parents.
"What they were going to expose them to, at their age they're not ready," she said.
There is almost an obsessive orderliness to the school, where boys and girls line up separately to descend the stairs to the cafeteria in near total silence. When the murmuring reaches a certain level, a teacher will stop, stare and, with nary a word, the children will go silent.
 
'I'm a Project Girl'
 Zoraida Hernandez, an eighth-grade teacher who grew up in one of the housing projects in the neighborhood, says she makes it clear that she knows all the tricks. "I'm a project girl," she reminds them. "I didn't get away with it, and neither will you."
With a booming, rapid-fire delivery, she calms down her class with a sly joke or a quiet word, patterning her approach after the brothers and nuns who taught her as a child. So strong was their influence on her life, she keeps a few tiny snapshots of them near her desk.
"They had compassion and never made me feel like I was a poor person," she said. "You don't put them down. You tell them they can do better and are better, and that you don't expect them to act like that."
The school prohibits corporal punishment -- even the threat of it -- and stresses discipline that does not heighten tensions.
"These children have to be handled gently," said Brother Jude Catalano, the dean of discipline. "Yelling, screaming and confrontation are not going to work. We have to learn to defuse."
It doesn't always work, Brother Paul acknowledged. He has had to expel some half a dozen students this year for infractions that ranged from cursing at a teacher to being caught in school with a box cutter. All but one, who was learning disabled, were sent to other Catholic schools nearby.
"Every kid," he said, "deserves a second chance."
 
Subsidies May Run Out
 Whether his school has a chance of survival remains to be seen. At the current tuition of $1,250 per student and actual costs at $2,000 per student, he needs to raise enrollment by 90 pupils to break even. Two businessman have been enlisted as patrons, and he plans to use their donations to upgrade the dimly-lighted cafeteria. The Archdiocese makes up the rest of the shortfall, but these subsidies may be eliminated soon.
Salaries are low: he and four teachers from his religious order are paid only $15,000 annually. The 16 other teachers, all lay, receive salaries starting at $23,000 on average.
Finances and fund raising are never far from his mind. One day last year, a parent tipped him off that some crack dealers in the park were selling bookbags with the school's name. He strode to the park, realized that someone had stolen several dozen book bags and flagged down a police car.
Although riled, he grew even angrier when he learned the dealers were selling the bags for $2 apiece. "They were $8 bags," he said. "You could have made six more dollars."
 
A Difficult Choice
 While he could raise the tuition, he knows that such a move would put the school even further out of reach for parents who hold down two jobs. It is a difficult choice for someone who entered the religious life to teach the poor.
Attracting more members to his order is unlikely considering the dwindling number of vocations since the 1960's and a steady drifting away from teaching.
Crayon-colored flame-shaped cutouts dangled from the light fixtures in Brother Joseph Payne's first-grade classroom. Each one bore words like "joy" and "courage," representing each child's request for a gift of the Holy Spirit. A flame inscribed with "faithfulness" dangles near the blackboard, close to Brother Payne.
"I need to be faithful to my call," he said. "I know I want to be a brother. But there are times when I want to stop."
Nearly all the men who entered the religious life with him have since left. Some have married; others found themselves unsuited to the rigors of life among the poor. Some orders have pulled out of inner-city schools, focusing on better-off suburban parishes. Such an option is unthinkable to Brother Payne.
"I don't want us to die," he said. "But if we're going to die, we die with dignity. I don't want us to go out clawing. We die with the poor, if we're going to die."
 
Advancement
A Flat Promise: 'I'll Get You In'
 With broad smiles and nervous titters, dozens of students huddled around Brother Paul in the cafeteria one recent morning, each one clutching letters of acceptance -- or rejection -- from Catholic high schools based on the citywide Cooperative Entrance Exam. Each student is expected to apply to three schools, and most are accepted by at least one.
"I want to take it and put it on my wall," said Nicole Graham, waving her acceptance letter to St. John's Prep in Astoria. "Every night I'll look at it. I made it this far."
The students also take the test for the city's selective public high schools, and a few are accepted. But teachers discourage them from applying to most public high schools.
"We don't let them go to any old school," said Mrs. Hernandez. "There's nothing going on there. No discipline, no teaching going on. The teachers are too busy dealing with the unruly characters in class."
The eighth graders returned to their classrooms, and Brother Paul sat in the empty cafeteria and scanned his notes. In neat script he kept a list of acceptances and rejections, noting which high schools to call later to plead a special case. Each child, he insisted, will get into a Catholic high school.
Quietly, a sad-faced girl trudged into the cafeteria, her eyes moist. She had been rejected by her three schools.
"Don't cry," Brother Paul softly counseled. "It's one of those things; you don't test well. How's your mother feeling? She still going through chemo?"
He read the rejection letters.
"Keep this to yourself," he said, writing down the school names. "If your friends ask you, you were accepted to all three schools. What's your first choice?"
She told him.
"I'll get you in," he said. "I don't want you to be upset."
She walked away.
Brother Paul soon followed, slipping into his office with his list.
There were calls to be made.

 In poorer school districts, students at Catholic schools typically outperform those at public schools. Some attribute this to differences among students who choose to attend Catholic school, others to differeces in the schools themselves. In wealthier districts, public school students do as well or better than those in Catholic schools.

HEADLINE: Connecticut: Testing Ground For Communications Future

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, April 15

 BODY:
Connecticut, home of the nation's first telephone switchboard 116 years ago, is about to become a laboratory again for innovation and competition in communications.
A combination of forces is at work, some driven by technology, some by the politics of economic development and some by the odd quirks of how the old Bell system broke up 10 years ago. Everything points, communications experts say, to a call to battle between the old telephone companies, the new cable television companies and the even newer wireless empires of the cellular era. The one certainty is that thousands of Connecticut residents will have communications choices -- from the availability of interactive television to the source of their local dial tone -- sooner than their neighbors. 
 "For whatever reason, maybe karma, Connecticut seems to the place where competition is coming to a focal point," said Tad Diesel, a spokesman for TCI Connecticut, the state's largest cable television company, which is building a system that could provide combined video, voice and data services within two years.
The capstone is a bill in the state legislature, supported by both political parties and expected to pass shortly, that would open all types of telephone service to competition beginning July 1.
Southern New England Telecommunications, which serves the vast majority of homes and businesses in Connecticut, would lose its 80-year monopoly. That means any enterprise could apply to bring a telephone line or a wireless link into homes or offices. In exchange, SNET, as it is known, would be regulated under a new formula the company believes will be fairer than the system now in place.
"This will give Connecticut a more liberal and enlightened regulatory climate than any state in the region and any state we know of," said Paul Karoff, a spokesman for A.T. & T. "We would expect to take advantage of it to the maximum extent."
 
Unanswered Questions
 What all this means for consumers is extremely fuzzy. Dozens of fundamental questions are still unanswered, not least what will happen to telephone rates. Industry officials generally predict that business telephone costs will go down (because of price competition) and that residential rates will go up (because of price deregulation).
The next battlefield -- assuming that the competition bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., as expected -- will be how much, how soon. That would be played out over the next 18 months before the state Department of Public Utility Control.
"The question is not whether rates will go up, but whether they will go up fairly or unfairly," said John F. Merchant, the state's Consumer Counsel, who represents rate payers before the utility commission. Mr. Merchant said his goal in the new era was to get the best out of what he feared could otherwise be a bad new deal for small businesses and homeowners. "This gives a shot at fairness," he said of the competition legislation.
Many other states, New York and New Jersey among them, have authorized some competition for phone service. This is mostly in urban business districts, where big-volume dialers like stock brokerage houses already can bypass the old local telephone companies and connect directly to the long-distance carriers.
 
An Aggressive Agenda
 New York also has an aggressive agenda in development to foster greater competition, proposed last year by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In New Jersey, Bell Atlantic is building a fiber-optic system that is to be completed in about 2010.
But Connecticut would be the first state in the region, and one of only a handful in the country, to make open competition -- from the home telephone to the biggest multi-line corporate system -- the official state policy. And communications experts say the peculiarities of this market, including Connecticut's compact size, will hasten and compound that change.
 
Video, Voice and Data
 SNET, in anticipation of deregulation, announced earlier this year that it would completely rewire Connecticut over the next decade with $4.5 billion of fiber-optic cable. That will allow video, voice and data to move in and out of homes and businesses with a scale and quality now impossible.
Interactive television, including movie rentals over the television set, is already being tested in Hartford's suburbs. By next year, residents in West Hartford are expected to be among the first in the nation to have not only access to 300 or more channels but also a choice of which carrier to bring them into the home. Three cable systems, including one operated by SNET, will be in contention.
SNET, unlike other big communications companies in the region, such as Bell Atlantic in New Jersey and Nynex in New York, was never part of the old American Telephone and and Telegraph Company. It was never barred -- as the Baby Bells were -- from competing directly with companies like A.T. & T. and Sprint to provide long-distance service. This week SNET made the leap, gaining approval from regulators. It is apparently the first local telephone company in the nation to offer long-distance dialing anywhere in the world.
 
Every Bet Is a Guess
 Telephone experts also say that competition will probably first seek the markets where the best profits loom: in the business centers like Stamford and Hartford. MFS Communications of Omaha has already signed a contract to wire 23 buildings in Hartford and West Hartford this summer. Smaller business and home telephone competition would probably follow, but with the technology changing so rapidly, every bet is a guess.
A spokeswoman for MCI, for example, which has announced its intentions to fight for a share of the local telephone market nationally, said that Connecticut would become a "friendly," state, but that no plans could be announced. Mr. Karoff at A. T. & T. said his company had ruled out competing for local service here, but predicted that competition for long distance -- the company's core business -- would heat up dramatically. Nynex, the dominant player in New York, also applauded the legislation, but a spokesman declined to declare any new goals.
Some questions echo the days of telephone competition before 1913, before telephone service became a monopoly.
Will you need a phone book for every telephone provider? If you change your telephone company, can you keep your number? If telephone companies still have to provide basic service to poor households and in rural areas -- as the new legislation requires -- does basic service mean what it does now? Will the more sophisticated technologies available in fought-over markets become the new level of basic service required to be available for all?
And what happens to today's regulated monopolies? The tiny Woodbury Telephone Company, for instance, has lived under the shadow of SNET for decades in quiet obscurity, serving 17,400 customers, most of them rural, in Woodbury, Southbury and Bethlehem.
"We may need to apply more energy toward being competitive, because we never have had to be competitive before," said Brian D. Ward, Woodbury's commercial and regulatory manager. "The only thing for sure is that it will encourage competition."
SNET now serves nearly every Connecticut resident except Woodbury's customers and the 23,000 that Nynex serves in Fairfield County. Company officials said they had long since concluded that the growth of cable and wireless phone systems made competition for their old base inevitable.
 
Predictions? Impossible
 "It became a matter of whether you fight it in the state of Connecticut, or whether you recognize the reality and ask yourself, 'are we in a position to compete?' " said Michael P. Phelan, the company's director of public policy and regulatory planning. "We decided we were."
Mr. Phelan said he believed that with the market, the regulatory structure and the technology all changing so rapidly, predicting the future was impossible. He believes that some services and areas that now lose money, could, with the right creativity, be repackaged and become profitable, while other areas that look so tempting now could wither.
"Open your mind up," he said. "Anything is possible."

HEADLINE: Trump to Seek Federal Help to Get Riverside South Under Way

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Though the financing for most of Riverside South, Donald J. Trump's long-delayed residential and commercial complex on Manhattan's West Side, has not yet been fully arranged, the developer will seek Federal help for at least the first stage of the $1.9 billion project.
Within 90 days, the Trump Organization will apply to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development for Federal mortgage insurance, said Michelle de Milly, a spokeswoman for the developer. 
 If the application is approved, Ms. de Milly said, Mr. Trump would be allowed to sell tax-exempt bonds -- through the city or the state -- that are insured by the Federal Housing Authority. The money from the bonds would be used to build the first four of Riverside South's 16 residential buildings. Riverside South would then also become eligible for the state's 421(a) program, which provides tax abatements for 20 years to developers who build low-income housing.
Mr. Trump would be required to make 20 percent of the 1,600 units in those first four buildings low-income rental housing. That is already part of his agreement with the city that calls for him to build affordable housing at the site, the former Penn Yards between 65th and 69th Streets.
A decision is expected to take about a year. The department will also set the rents and the means test for qualifying for the units.
 
Occupancy in 1997
 Ms. de Milly said that construction of the four Riverside South buildings would take about two years, with occupancy expected to start in 1997. Ms. de Milly did release final estimates for the cost of constructing the buildings.
City Councilwoman Ronnie Eldridge, an opponent of Riverside South, has introduced legislation that would require applications for the state's 421(a) program to be subject to case-by-case approval by the city. She said she was angered that the Riverside South buildings would be required to have low-income housing only for the life of the abatements.
"The 80-20 program is the only program available to generate affordable housing in the city," said Ms. de Milly. "And, most importantly, it is consistent with one of Riverside South's principal goals, which is to create an economically integrated development."
Riverside South is a scaled-down version of Mr. Trump's earlier proposal for the site: Trump City, which was to have been a 14.5 million-square-foot development that was to include the world's tallest building. The plan was abandoned in 1990, after complaints from nearby residents.
Plans, which have been approved by the city, include 5,700 apartments, 375,000 square feet of retail and office space and 25 acres of parkland and open space. Philip Johnson will be the architect.
Mr. Trump bought the property, which stretches along the Hudson River on land from 59th to 72d Streets, in 1985.
The approximate $250 million mortgage on the property came due last June, but the bank that holds it, Chase Manhattan, has held back from foreclosing while Mr. Trump looks for someone to buy the mortgage at a discount from Chase in exchange for an equity stake in the project.
In January, Mr. Trump said that he was close to securing financing for the mortgage with a new backer, whom he declined to identify.

HEADLINE: Brazil Reaches Accord With Large Banks to Cut Debt

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Brazil, the largest debtor in the developing world, completed an agreement last night with its creditor banks that reduces its $49 billion foreign debt and provides the country with lower interest rates and new longer-term loans.
Although a number of new debtor countries, most notably Russia, still need to reach agreement with commercial banks on restructuring their foreign debts, the Brazilian agreement effectively ends the international debt crisis that began in 1982. 
 The crisis started with Mexico's announcement that it was no longer able to make interest or principal payments on its foreign debt, and grew as other countries followed. The problems severely strained the world's financial system and curbed economic growth in Latin America.
But since the late 1980's, when the United States led a new effort to resolve the crisis, big debtor nations inside and outside Latin America have received a reduction in their financial burdens in exchange for changes that both opened their economies and helped curb rampant inflation.
The foreign investment that has been attracted in the wake of earlier debt-reduction agreements, like that in Mexico, has played a large role in the economic revival of these countries.
Approval of the Brazilian agreement came last night in New York, bringing to an end the tortuous negotiations that began in October 1990. The agreement was announced by Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's Minister of Finance, and William R. Rhodes, vice chairman of Citibank, Brazil's biggest bank creditor.
Mr. Rhodes, who has worked with Latin America's largest debtor nations since the crisis began, was clearly pleased to declare it over.
"It's been 11, and three and a half on this one," he said, in reference to Brazil and the number of years involved. "Now we can finally say this is over."
For Brazil, the agreement will cut its outstanding foreign bank debt to commercial banks by $4 billion, to $45 billion, and reduce interest owed by another $4 billion. The agreement is crucial to Brazil's efforts to liberalize its economy, attract foreign investment and stabilize prices.
Brazil's total debt burden, including loans from banks and from other governments, totaled $121.1 billion at the end of 1992, according to the World Bank. Mexico was second with $113.4 billion, Argentina third with $67.6 billion and Poland, which reached a debt-reduction agreement with its banks in March, fourth with $48.5 billion.
The 750 creditor banks in the Brazilian agreement include some of the largest in the United States. For the banks, the incentives for an agreement were the guarantees they receive on payments of debt and interest. In addition, the accord could provide profits for some banks by increasing the value of the debt they have on their books.
The agreement may also serve as a stabilizing force in Latin America. Since the beginning of the year, rising interest rates have hammered prices of the region's outstanding debt securities, raising questions among investors about the outlook.
"Closing this agreement will favorably affect the emerging debt markets by removing a major uncertainty," Mr. Rhodes said.
The Brazilian agreement caps five years of successful negotiations with Mexico, Argentina and other debtors that began after the Bush Administration outlined a new debt policy known as the Brady Plan, named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
Under the plan, bankers were encouraged to help debtor nations reduce their burdens, while the foreign governments were required to reduce inflation and open their economies to foreign investment. Unlike other agreements, however, the accord between Brazil and its banks was completed without an approved economic program from the International Monetary Fund.

HEADLINE: Sexual Harassment Thrives In the New Russian Climate

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 16

 BODY:
The advertisement for a secretary in a Moscow newspaper listed computer skills, typing, English and German as necessary qualifications. It also specified that applicants should be 18 to 25, 5 foot 7 and have long hair. "There will be a contest," it said.
The advertisement was just one of scores placed every day that list youth and sex appeal as job requirements. It was also among the more courtly. Some Russian employers include another prerequisite in their advertisements: "bez kompleksov," or "without inhibitions." Everyone in Russia knows what that means. 
 In Moscow's bustling new business community, it is usually not frowned upon to grope the secretary, to require that the new office manager be single, long-legged and blond, or to offer to discuss a filing clerk's raise after work in a hotel room -- and dismiss her if she refuses.
Sexual harassment in the workplace is rampant in today's Russia, and the sexism that thrived under the Communists is growing worse, aggravated, feminists say, by the new lawlessness that rules the business world.
The new Russia is known for its violence. There is also a heady sense of permissiveness fed by pornographic videos, sexy advertising, nightclubs, casinos, beauty contests, nude pinups and open prostitution. This has helped spawn a workplace climate of sexual swaggering and bullying that is no longer imaginable in the United States after figures like Anita Hill and Robert Packwood made the term "sexual harassment" part of the national lexicon.
"Women view their bodies as a way of furthering their careers -- that's just the way it is," said Igor M. Bunin, the author of a study on the "new Russian businessmen" published this month. "Sexual harassment is absolutely not a real problem in Russia."
"I assure you," he added, "there is no opposition on the part of women to this."
Many women do not see it his way. Irina, 23, a graphic designer who did not want her last name used, said she quit her job at a Moscow publishing house after her boss kept grabbing her and pressuring her to sleep with him. "I can understand that men want to look," she said. "But they shouldn't be allowed to do something to me that I don't want."
A gradual awakening is occurring in some parts of the country.
Without publicity or fanfare, the first known sexual harassment case went to court in Russia this year in Barnaul, a city in southern Siberia.
Sexual harassment, which in Russian law is defined as a boss demanding sexual favors from subordinates, is a criminal offense, as it was in the former Soviet Union. But the statute was so rarely enforced that prosecutors in Barnaul and Moscow could not cite a single precedent.
Tatyana L. Smyshlayeva, 35, a general practitioner at a municipal clinic, complained that her boss, the 62-year-old chief physician, repeatedly grabbed and groped her in his office, threatening to dismiss her if she resisted his advances. He had previously dismissed two other women for the same reason, she said.
Even though she had tapes and witnesses, the city's health care administrators ignored her. Russian newspapers did not cover the case. Most in her community told her she was crazy.
 
The Case Is Dropped
 "Unfortunately," Dr. Smyshlayeva said, "around here even husbands think this kind of behavior is normal." But her husband supported her, as did the district prosecutor, who opened an investigation in January. The case against the doctor was dropped before trial, however, under the general amnesty in February that freed Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, a leader of the October insurrection against President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Dr. Smyshlayeva remains employed by the clinic, as does her former supervisor, although he was suspended from his position as chief.
The feminist movement in Russia remains small, and if anything, it is in decline; its few active members complain that the status of women has only deteriorated since the demise of Communism.
On average, women in 1991 earned 75 percent as much as men, according to the Center for Gender Studies in Moscow, but now that figure has dropped to 40 percent. Unemployment is three times higher among women than among men. Though there are no reliable statistics, women's groups say domestic violence is soaring. The first registered rape recovery center and a crisis hot line for abused women recently opened in Moscow.
Most Russian men dismiss the issue of sexual harassment as yet another silly Western hang-up. Most women say the problem exists, but shrug it off as just another unpleasant fact of life. The demeaning jokes and salacious remarks that are increasingly considered a form of harassment in the United States are so commonplace in Russia that they do not register as harassment.
 
'That Macho Feeling'
 Valentina Konstantinova, a researcher at the Center for Gender Studies, noted that while in Communist times, bosses preyed on employees with impunity, democracy has mainly freed the male libido. "Before the view of Russian men were as creatures without willpower who drink too much. Now they have the ability to make money, they want everything in this life. They have that macho feeling."
One of the few Russians to take up the battle against sexual harassment is a man. Valery V. Vikulov, 31, says he set up an underground organization, the Diana Fund, to assist women who have lost their jobs as a result of sexual harassment. He said that in the last year and a half he has quietly collected money or helped find work for 117 women and compiled a black list of 95 companies where he contends sexual harassment is severe and widespread.
While most of the cases he has handled involve the loss of promotions, bonuses or jobs by women, a few are more extreme. Mr. Vikulov said he had helped one 19-year-old woman, a part-time worker selling advertisements for a Moscow radio station, who said she was gang-raped by her employers after a dinner they held to celebrate her promotion.
He noted that he had heard of some American businessmen who behaved toward Russian employees in a way they dared not treat their American counterparts. But he had not received many formal complaints. "The pay at Western companies is so much higher," he said, "that most women just smile and bear it."
 
No Feminist Newspapers
 There are no feminist newspapers, and only one women's magazine, the monthly, distinctly unglossy "Female Worker." But a Russian edition of Cosmopolitan, a magazine known more for advising women on the arts of seduction than on how to fight off an amorous boss, is scheduled to hit the stands at the end of the month.
Its publisher, Derk Sauer, who also owns The Moscow Times, described his project as a service to newly prosperous Russian women. "The magazine will not just be about fashion," he said. "It's about relationships and careers and sex."
And sexual mores have changed.More and more women, feminists say, freely trade sexual favors for salary and perks because good jobs are scarce and employers can more easily replace recalcitrant or older employees than they could under Communism. Job seekers who do not wish to sleep with their employers attach a postscript to their advertisements, "intim nye predlagat," "no intimate relations."
The current hedonism repels Dmitri O. Babich, a young reporter for the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He was so appalled by a recent television advertisement for office equipment that depicted a secretary leaning over her leering boss, her breasts exposed, that he put his phone number in an article and asked women who had experienced sexual harassment to call. "A fourth of the calls were from men thinking it was an ad for phone sex," he said.
His editors were equally confused about the article he planned. "They scheduled it for an erotic supplement," he said. He dissuaded them. His article ran last week under the heading, "School of Survival."
 
A Gallery Owner's Way
 Such articles are extremely rare in the Russian press.
"When I first heard Americans using the expression 'sexual harassment' I was utterly baffled -- I thought it was some kind of custom, like karaoke." said Larisa M. Manotkina, 35, who started her own travel business, Charisma Travel. Now, she said, she sees the term everywhere.
Her best friend, Natalya E. Bykona, who owns her own chic art gallery, the NB Gallery in downtown Moscow, revealed her own way of handling sexism. She said that her own businesslike demeanor is off-putting to Russian men. To put them at ease, she takes her sexy and flirtatious assistant with her to business meetings as a decoy.
"Everyone knows the flirting and seduction is a game," Ms. Bykona said, "but it is the rule."
The Moscow Women's Bank is not quite a bank, and not exactly a feminist enterprise. Alla G. Udalova, the deputy director, said the company does some banking and also other kinds of business, including hiring waitresses for a nightclub. She said sexual harassment and discrimination were not issues at the company.
Her boss, Yaroslav A. Angelyuk, agreed. "If a woman working for me gets married," he explained cheerfully, "I fire her."

Bykona, left, a Moscow art dealer, of the workplace climate of sexual swaggering and bullying that now prevails in Russia. She talked with a friend, Larisa M.

HEADLINE: Out of the Ashes;
More Derelict Factories Are Returning to Productive Use

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
From the outside, it looks like one more decrepit multi-story brick factory building left for dead. The inside, however, is alive with the sound of screaming band saws and the smell of fresh sawdust. The former 19th-century rope factory on the Brooklyn waterfront in Greenpoint has been broken up into dozens of smaller spaces for woodworking shops and artisans.
"It would be much easier for me to operate in Pennsylvania," said Eric Seibel, a cabinet maker with five employees. "So if a place like this didn't exist, I definitely wouldn't be in New York." 
 Mr. Seibel and his crew are part of the ambitiously named Greenpoint Manufacturing and Design Center. The venerable building was acquired from the city last month by a nonprofit enterprise that plans extensive renovation.
Twenty miles west, in depressed Paterson, N.J., a defunct textile plant has found new life as well. The bottom two floors of the factory, started in 1919 and finally shut down three years ago, reopened in January as a community health center. The top two levels of the building, in the Great Falls Historic District, now contain apartments for low- and moderate-income people.
For decades cities across the Northeast have witnessed an unending industrial exodus. Thousands of manufacturing firms have gone out of business. Thousands more have left for less expensive locations in the outlying suburbs and in other regions, leaving abandoned industrial shells behind them.
Despite costly government attempts to stimulate economic development in urban industrial wastelands, only a few such buildings have been recycled. That usually happened where a popular location and striking architecture allowed developers to create trendy shopping arcades like the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan. Indeed, probably the region's most successful revival of an old factory district -- the rebirth long ago of SoHo -- was done largely in flagrant violation of land-use laws.
But today -- even with such daunting obstacles as waste contamination, rigid zoning laws and byzantine financing barriers -- more such relics of the region's industrial heyday are being returned to productive uses.
"Paterson isn't stylish like Philadelphia or Boston," George McLoof Jr., president of the Longstreet Development Corporation, said. His organization managed the renovation of the Cooke Mill Complex, the first new project in Paterson's old factory district since revitalization efforts stalled a decade ago. "This is a gritty, grimy meat-and-potatoes industrial city," he said. "But don't write it off."
So far, these salvage operations are mostly isolated enterprises. Many rely on quirky individuals, often driven more by zeal than by a desire to make money. There is nothing like the massive government-sponsored efforts to reclaim derelict industrial lands that are under way in London, Tokyo, Paris, Toronto and elsewhere. Several factors underlie the growing potential for redeveloping industrial sites. The collapse of the 1980's building boom in suburban offices and shopping malls has forced many real-estate developers to turn elsewhere. Much of the cheapest, most accessible land in the region now lies in run-down manufacturing zones and along industrial waterfronts. For instance, space in an inner-city factory in New York City can run as low as $3 to $5 a square foot, while new factory space in the outlying suburbs is at least twice that.
Restrictions that once discouraged developers are being relaxed. Harsh liability and environmental standards once made the cleanup of old industrial sites so risky and expensive that they actively encouraged abandonment, contributing to urban sprawl. That, in turn, raised even greater threats to the surrounding environment. In reaction, New Jersey was one of the first among several governments to make cleanup regulations less onerous.
And local politicians -- who once trusted in urban planning projects that imposed strict separation between industrial, commercial, and residential districts -- are prodding zoning officials to relax the rules so that more mixed-use redevelopments can take place.
 
In With the New
 In some cases, the only viable choice for abandoned or underused sites will probably be to replace their lost industries with expanding service businesses like health care organizations or big retailers like Home Depot. Along the water, upscale housing is another option favored by many developers and planners. Whatever happens, many industrial areas, if not most, will never again hum as they once did with traditional factory activity.
Yet cities may still be able to save a lot of the remaining jobs in production and other kinds of hands-on, blue-collar work that have long been considered to be on their way to oblivion, regional planners say. Last year New York City officially lost just 2,000 manufacturing jobs, by far the smallest decline in the last decade. Almost 300,000 remain on the books, and many more survive in the underground economy.
"We all know that the traditional manufacturing firms have moved out of our cities," said Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association in New York. "But what is harder to see is that there is still a strong demand for a different type of business: smaller, more trend-oriented makers capable of quick turnaround on customized products. With some creative adaptation, many of them can fit well into our older industrial locations."
That trend is reflected in the breakup of industrial establishments once filled by one big employer into those containing many smaller firms. In New Haven, for example, where the sprawling Winchester gun works once employed more than 2,000 workers, owners of the bleak inner-city site near Yale University had been working for more than a decade to remake it as an incubator for new businesses.
Today, with fresh funds from its original public and private sponsors, the complex known as Science Park is home to some of the most promising industrial ventures in Connecticut. One company, started by an engineering graduate fresh from Yale, is working to create a less expensive, pollution-free process for spraying thin films on metals and other surfaces. A rapidly expanding biotechnology company is testing new drugs for immunological disorders. And yet another company is doing research on catalytic combustion to reduce engine emissions while improving efficiency.
In all, almost 1,000 people now work at roughly 100 companies within the complex. Moreover, after threatening to pull up stakes entirely, the Olin Corporation is building an up-to-date Winchester rifle factory on the grounds. It will employ more than 500 people, many from the poor neighborhood around the plant.
 
Redevelopment in Red Hook
 In New York City, there are signs of activity in even some of the most dilapidated districts.
Without any help from the New York City government, Gregory O'Connell, a Brooklyn developer, is renovating two red-brick warehouses, dating from the Civil War, along the Red Hook waterfront. He started 10 years ago with one empty building, Pier 41 at the end of Van Dyke Street in one of the city's poorest and most isolated areas. Its strongest asset may be the stunning view of the Statue of Liberty and the Wall Street skyline. It is now 75 percent occupied.
Last year, Mr. O'Connell bought another nearby pier from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which he is also painstakingly restoring, installing lines for sewage, gas and electricity, replacing structural beams and preserving the black steel shutters that cover most of the windows.
Between his two buildings, of two stories each, is a four-story city-owned warehouse that is largely going to waste. On a nearby pier is a rusting sugar refinery that closed in the early 1980's.
"This is a labor of love," said Mr. O'Connell, "but we're also here because I think this is a great business opportunity. There is a tremendous need for niche-type businesses to find low-cost work space."
Today roughly 20 businesses are operating there, ranging from Flickinger Glassworks, a maker of custom glass that plans to open a retail shop in the front of its workshop, to VIP Yachts, which caters meals for the Royal Princess, a harbor cruise ship.
 
Change of Heart
 The city's recently adopted waterfront zoning plan envisioned replacing much of the Red Hook industrial district with housing. But community groups believe that ventures like Pier 41 are more likely to help revitalize the area than grandiose planning documents, so they are preparing their own alternative that calls for allowing residential, light manufacturing and commercial activities to coexist.
In striking contrast to the past, city officials say they welcome the community effort.
"Our zoning has clearly been overly rigid," said Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "There are many areas like Red Hook where we shouldn't have to make these either-or choices in some government office downtown."
The private market alone cannot support most such ventures, but government officials are learning that they often have more success when they apply a lighter touch.
 
Uncommon Devotion
 David Sweeny and Daniel Dray, who both used to work for city economic development offices, are the prime force behind the Greenpoint project. With 360,000 square feet of space on six floors in eight inter-connected buildings, they are planning to invest up to $6 million over the next five years to bring the manufacturing center up to code.
If the city had tried to do the project itself, Mr. Sweeny said, it would have cost at least $12 million. Instead, the city's Economic Development Corporation provided a $1 million grant to start reconstruction, leaving the Greenpoint operators to raise the rest from other sources.
"Together, we can do a lot of things that couldn't be done separately," Mr. Dray said.
Still, keeping the center alive requires uncommon devotion. Mr. Sweeny -- who is married to Isabel Hill, a maker of documentary films whose "Made in Brooklyn" is an impassioned plea to retain manufacturing in New York City -- acknowledges that it has been an uphill battle.
"It is very tough to put a deal like this together," he said. "If I knew then what I know now, I doubt that I would have tried it in the first place."

HEADLINE: Sheriff Faces Off Vigilante Group in Montana

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JORDAN, Mont., April 16

 BODY:
Amid the sagebrush and jack rabbits of rural Montana, a sheriff and his posse are in a showdown with their vigilante neighbors over whose law will prevail.
The Garfield County Freemen, vigilantes who hold that established government is illegitimate, are dismissed as "kooks" by some residents of this town of 500 people. But Sheriff Charles Phipps takes the vigilantes' threats seriously. 
 "They have threatened to come into town and shoot seven of us and retreat," said Sheriff Phipps. While he said he thought the threat was just for show, he now carries a gun when he used to go unarmed.
The vigilantes are led by Ralph Clark, who says his constitutional rights were violated when a bank foreclosed on his 960-acre wheat farm north of town.
The sheriff said he was told he would be hanged from a bridge if convicted by a vigilante jury of "common law crimes" in the foreclosure.
Sheriff Phipps is not the only villain in the eyes of Mr. Clark, who is accused of posting a bounty for the "arrest" of the sheriff, a prosecutor and a judge who processed the paperwork to foreclose on the farm where he was born.
 
Clark Fleeing Arrest
 Mr. Clark was ordered to appear in court last Thursday to face charges of solicitation of kidnapping. He defied the order, and Judge Joe L. Hegel of District Court issued a warrant for his arrest. On the same day, Mr. Clark's farm was auctioned to settle $37,864 in arrears on $710,000 in mortgages.
The courtroom was almost deserted at the five-minute hearing. Adjacent offices of the county treasurer and court clerk were filled with members of a posse the sheriff had recruited to keep order in case of trouble.
Several of Mr. Clark's supporters face misdemeanor charges of impersonating public officials for claiming to be a justice of the peace or a constable. The vigilantes are friends, even relatives, of many of the county's nearly 1,600 residents.
"I grew up on a ranch 10 miles from the Clarks," the sheriff said. "We were neighbors."
Here in town, where a handful of businesses line the few paved streets and modest houses and mobile homes are on dirt roads, few take the vigilantes seriously.
"People think they're a bunch of kooks," said JoDe Watson, a tax preparer.
 
'Just Went too Far'
 Lynn Olson, eating a pizza at the Rancher's Bar and Cafe, said he belonged to a related group for about a year, but quit. "I think they're doing something that needed doing, but they just went too far with that bounty deal," he said. "I've got friends on both sides."
The Garfield County Freemen are part of a movement active in pockets of Montana whose members are known generally as "constitutionalists." Based on vague interpretations of the Constitution, they believe established government is illegitimate because they say it has violated their rights.
"These people are essentially defying the system," said Lance Tonn, a lawyer who made the their bounty list by representing the bank that foreclosed on Mr. Clark.
"I think it started out with everyone thinking it was a bit humorous," Mr. Tonn said. "But when you have someone about to suffer an economic loss, as they are, and some who seem to have lost touch with reality, you have a bad combination."

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Opportunity: Western Suspicions of Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine

 BODY:
Ukraine, barely de-Sovietized and economically unreformed, is hoping to take advantage of new strains in the American-Russian relationship by promoting itself as a bulwark against any potential Russian imperialism.
Ukrainian officials and senior Western diplomats here discern growing mistrust and disillusionment between Moscow and Washington, where the Clinton Administration is being pushed to regard the Russians as rivals instead of partners, as Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican, recently put it. 
 In Moscow, it is increasingly fashionable to speak in nationalist terms and to regard Western promises of aid as derisory or even subversive. In Washington, where policy toward the former Soviet Union is no longer bipartisan, all Russian behavior now seems to be viewed through the prism of neo-imperialism.
The Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, the former chief ideologist of Soviet Ukraine and a noted survivor, is happy to take advantage of the altered mood as he seeks more Western aid, greater executive powers and the cancellation of presidential elections scheduled for June.
Despite its lack of any real economic reform, its high inflation and a steadily ambivalent attitude toward nuclear disarmament, Ukraine is now regarded as a bulwark of Western policy toward Russia, senior Western diplomats and Ukrainian officials say.
 
Nuclear Issue Cited
 So the West is considered less likely to criticize Mr. Kravchuk than before or to wish to see him out of office, particularly since he is considered the crucial guarantor of Ukraine's incompletely ratified promise to become a non-nuclear state. Now that elections have produced a regionalized legislature with a big leftist and neo-Communist bloc, Mr. Kravchuk seems even more important.
After nearly two years of isolating Ukraine over its nuclear inheritance, President Clinton has met Mr. Kravchuk twice, the last time in early March in Washington. There, American aid to Ukraine was increased sharply from $175 million in denuclearization funds and $155 million in economic aid to $350 million in each category. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, on a much-publicized trip here two weeks ago, signed three agreements on dismantling missiles and military conversion that covers some $100 million of the new aid.
[An agreement announced in Washington that the United States will help Ukraine replace the 1,700 megawatts of energy produced from the Chernobyl power plants, so the remaining reactors may be shut down, is another example of a more varied relationship.]
Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, seemed to summarize Ukraine's new importance in a recent article in Foreign Affairs when he wrote, "Russia can be either an empire or a democracy, but it cannot be both." And how to define empire? Mr. Brzezinski was nearly as categorical: "Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire."
 
Even-Handed Policy Urged
 Mr. Brzezinski urged a more "even-handed treatment" of Russia and Ukraine, including more aid and assurances about Ukraine's security. Whether Mr. Brzezinksi is right or wrong about Russia, his words carry weight in Washington, especially among Republicans looking for cracks in the Clinton White House.
As Mr. Kravchuk contemplates asking a new Parliament for increased presidential powers in the name of efficiency, stability and "reform," he can be confident that Washington and the West will be slower to criticize him now than in the days when a democratic, Westernized, free-market Russia seemed to some just a short and relatively painless interval away.
"Washington's in a real bind," a senior Western diplomat said. "For its own reasons, and for regional stability, it has to support Ukraine. Yet it needs to push them toward denuclearization and more Western-style reform, and even pay them for it. The question is how much? Certainly Kravchuk knows this."
Mr. Kravchuk sees himself as a chess player and tactician in a difficult time, his advisers emphasize. But he is said to understand Ukraine's new importance to Washington. "He sees that Ukraine's value to the world is so clear in the long run that the West will cave in," a diplomat said. "I fully expect him to try to use the nuclear card again to try to get more economic aid."
 
Neglect of Economy Charged
 But some officials concede that Mr. Kravchuk has offered no clear vision of what an independent Ukraine should be, concentrating instead on the symbols of statehood -- the flag, the army, the summit meetings -- while the economy burns.
Some officials worry that the increasing regional strains in Ukraine, between the more nationalist west and the Russified east, apparent in recent elections, will increase the country's larger ambivalence about where its future lies: with a Slavic, Moscow-dominated alliance or a Western-oriented Eastern and Central Europe eager to join the European Union and NATO.
"Independent Ukraine is in the midst of an identity crisis," a senior Western diplomat said. "Is Ukraine the border between Orthodox Russia and Europe, or is that border somewhere in the middle of Ukraine itself?"
This choice between Russia and Europe, which fewer Russians these days would regard as a false choice, has been made more complicated, the diplomat said, "by a fitful, uncertain and less than welcoming West," which concentrated for two years on Ukraine's nuclear weapons to the exclusion of a broader relationship.
 
A Broader Relationship
 That relationship has now begun to broaden, American officials and Kravchuk advisers say. But it is almost sure to be tested further if Mr. Kravchuk takes more presidential powers, fails to begin reform and tries to use the nuclear card again to win more aid from Washington.
Mr. Kravchuk, well aware of the growing nationalism within Russia, is increasingly concerned about the fissures it creates in Ukraine, too, especially as the unreformed economy wallows in devalued money.
Ian J. Brzezinski, a Kiev-based security official with Parliament's Council of Advisers, says Mr. Kravchuk is torn, believing in the need for market reform but fearing its consequences.
"Real reform would tear away the old elite's control over the economy," he said. "And Kravchuk sees major security problems with economic reform. The potential of Russian pressure combined with internal strains in eastern Ukraine, which would bear the weight of economic reform, is a real concern."
Mr. Brzezinski, Zbigniew's son, sees much of Kiev's weakness as home-grown, but agrees with his father about Ukraine's importance to the West.
"Ukraine is in a downward spiral, and its leadership is unwilling to grit its teeth and take the risks associated with consolidating statehood," he said. But he added, "As Moscow seems more threatening, Ukraine looks more attractive," so more varied Western aid has begun to flow despite the lack of economic reform.
As for the United States Congress, he and the diplomats said, there seems to be a new understanding that a Russia policy is not a satisfactory substitute for a European policy.
That gives Mr. Kravchuk more breathing room, the diplomats agreed. "But he must be careful, even so," one said. "He may buy off Washington with only promises of reform. But he's unpopular now, and even Ukrainians have a limit to their patience."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Paying More Low-Earners for Working, I.R.S. Survey Finds

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
Perhaps enticed by news of expanded benefits to come, lower-income workers flocked this year to claim the earned income tax credit, which can bring Government checks of more than $2,000 to married parents who work and rear children.
Unlike most other credits, which are limited to reducing tax liabilities, this one generally brings money to supplement the wages of the working poor. 
 According to an unpublished survey by the Internal Revenue Service, claims for the credit through March were 20 percent higher than in the comparable period last year, suggesting that more than 2.5 million Americans will become new participants in the program this year.
It has been one of the few social policies that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on, and it will be expanded next year by the budget enacted last year. The program's broad political appeal is based on its incentive for people to work, and its name makes it more politically palatable than welfare. Most economist think it is better policy than raising the minimum wage, which they say discourages employers from hiring marginal workers.
 
'Proponents Are Encouraged'
 But officials have long worried about the failure of large numbers of eligible Americans to claim the credit, which involves filling out what a former Tax Commissioner has called one of the most "obscenely complex" parts of the tax forms.
"Proponents are encouraged by what they're hearing," said an aide to Representative Timothy J. Penny, a Minnesota Democrat and longtime backer of the program, speaking of the rising number of Americans filing for the credit.
New York, with 800,000 beneficiaries for the 1992 tax year, ranks fourth behind California, Texas and Florida.
While the credit was raised substantially in the legislation signed by President Clinton last August, the improvements do not take effect until the 1994 tax year. That could mean that some claimants will get less than they expected or might not be eligible for the program.
The new law will give most eligible families significantly larger benefits, and workers with very low incomes and no children will become eligible for the tax credit for the first time. The maximum a family can receive for 1993 -- payment starts to shrink when income exceeds $12,000 -- is $2,364. For those with two or more children, this rises to $2,528 in 1994, $3,033 in 1995 and $3,370 in 1996.
Working single people and couples without children can receive a maximum of 7.65 percent of the first $4,000 earned or $306.
 
Retroactive Claims Possible
 Claims may be filed retroactively for the past three years, provided that no income tax returns were filed for those years.
While the proportion of returns claiming the credit rose this year to 19.3 percent from 16.1 percent, the I.R.S. has had very little success in promoting an advance payment option on the tax credit. Under the option, workers can arrange with employers to receive part of the credit throughout the year on their paychecks. Less than one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers are using it, according to the I.R.S. survey.
The survey and other data supplied by the agency also indicated that for the first time this year more Americans paid somebody to fill out their forms than did it themselves.
Through March this year, with tens of millions of the more difficult tax returns still to be filed, paid preparers had signed 46.7 percent of the returns, the I.R.S. said. But of the more difficult Form 1040's, paid prepares had filed 62.6 percent, with millions more of these forms to be filed.
Paid preparation passed 45 percent in 1984, 48 percent in 1991 and reached an estimated 50 percent for the 1992 tax year.
 
Pay for Preparations
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a group active on behalf of the poor, estimated that people claiming the earned income credit paid at least $345 million for tax preparation last year.
Other trends and practices disclosed by the survey showed:
*Support continues to dwindle for the Presidential Election Campaign Funds, with only 17.7 percent of returns having at least one "yes" box checked, (one for the wife and husband, with each box designating $3) down from 20.5 percent through March last year. This implied slightly more than $25 million in campaign money, down from $41 million in the peak year of 1981.
*Just over 3 percent of returns this year reflected contributions to an individual retirement account, compared with 15.9 percent in 1985 when these were deductible for people of all incomes.
*Use of the I.R.S. mailing labels dropped to about 40 percent, reflecting the rise in electronic filing and professional preparation as well as the persistent notion that the label invites an audit.
*About 2 percent of filers through March managed to come out even, neither owing as much as $1 nor seeking a refund. Most of them were thought to have achieved this precision through their final quarterly payment of estimated tax, which was due Jan. 15.
But one thing changes little: The overwhelming number of taxpayers are willing to make costly interest-free loans to the Government to make sure they receive refunds. Of all returns filed through March, 89.9 percent claimed a refund.
The average size of the refunds through April 9, the I.R.S. calculated, is $1,025, up from $972 in the comparable period last year.

HEADLINE: Fudging the Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 16

 BODY:
When asked why the state budget for the fiscal year that began April 1 is now more than two weeks late and not close to final passage, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders point to ideological disputes over school aid, health care and tax cuts.
But the coarser reality about the budget fight is this: it's mostly about protecting incumbents. 
 "The issues that keep this budget from closing have less to do with good public policy than what's good for an individual lawmaker's election," said Cynthia B. Green, deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit fiscal watchdog group.
This is, after all, an election year when Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and many of the Legislature's 211 members face challenges. But it is also the first year since 1991 that the state's economy has been sufficiently robust to justify significant new spending or tax cuts -- as much as $1 billion worth.
That potent combination has created a negotiating atmosphere that Mr. Cuomo has likened, in effect, to an all-you-can-eat buffet for the starving. "They're working with two hands to feed themselves from the trough and they're bumping into one another and they're getting a little greedy," he said of the Legislature last week.
 
Waiting for Best Deal
 Within that setting, lawmakers seem more compelled to wait for the best deal rather than to reach quick agreement. The result: wrapped inside almost every policy debate is a raw political fight over money for some constituency.
"A surplus is politically more difficult to deal with than a deficit," explained Assemblyman John J. McEneny, an Albany Democrat. "With a deficit, people can accept no new spending. But when people hear about a large surplus, everybody feels a sense of entitlement."
Nowhere is the haggling over state dollars more bare-knuckled than in the school aid arena. The issue stirs large blocs of voters because state aid to local schools can relieve property taxes. Not surprisingly, the Legislature has increased its contribution to local school budgets every year since 1945 except once: in 1991, during a grinding recession.
This year school aid will increase by about $400 million to $9.5 billion, the largest increase in four years. But while that might seem reason for celebration, negotiators have been locked in a testy battle over how much of the pot New York City should receive.
Mr. Cuomo and the Democrats who control the Assembly, both dependent on urban voters, say the city should get 35.2 percent. But the Republican-led Senate, whose leaders represent rural upstate towns and Long Island, says the city's share should be 34.7 percent. That might sound close, but the difference is worth about $50 million.
 
Medicaid Aid Fight
 "We disagree on the shares," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Nassau County Republican. "Under the Democrats' configuration, the upstate would get shortchanged."
A fight over "shares" has also blocked agreement on a plan to have the state assume part of the Medicaid costs now borne by county governments.
Medicaid represents the fastest growing portion of most county governments' budgets, and there is bipartisan agreement in Albany that the state should relieve some of that burden. But while the Democrats favor a plan that would give almost three of every four Medicaid takeover dollars to New York City, the Republicans have advanced a proposal that would require the state also to assume some of county governments' share of pre-kindergarten special education services.
Where are those special education costs rising the fastest? Not by coincidence, on Long Island, home of the Senate's leadership.
Name the issue and similar battles are under way in closed-door negotiations. Capital construction? Senate Republicans want to build minor league baseball stadiums upstate and an Olympic-quality swimming pool and soccer stadium on Long Island. Assembly Democrats want that money used for repairing schools in and around New York City. Mr. Cuomo wants a portion for opening a special school for gifted high school students.
 
Budget 'Solvable'
 Tax cuts? The Senate Republicans want more for businesses; the Assembly Democrats want more for low-income families. Mr. Cuomo wants some of both.
"This budget is eminently solvable," said Mary Ann Crotty, Mr. Cuomo's director of policy management. "But having more money is making it more difficult."
The lawmakers have also lost what was once their most compelling reason to pass the budget quickly: an annual rite known as spring borrowing in which the state sold short-term bonds to pay for the previous year's school aid. Those bonds could not be sold without a final budget, so pressure from school districts often cajoled lawmakers to settle their differences.
But in hopes of improving the state's low bond ratings, the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo ended spring borrowing this year. Now, most school districts will not feel a budget pinch until mid-June.
The Legislature has also passed the portion of the budget that pays the salaries of most state workers, so that the government can continue operating.
The legislative leaders advance their own theories on why the other side will not close. Mr. Marino contends that Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, is blocking the Senate's efforts to cut taxes. Mr. Silver argues that Mr. Marino wants to make the budget as late as possible to embarrass Mr. Cuomo, perhaps by discouraging Wall Street investment rating firms from upgrading the state's bonds.
Except for a few barbed outbursts, Mr. Cuomo has refrained from attacking the Legislature, perhaps because he, too, needs some of the "goodies" in the $33 billion budget for his re-election effort.
Among those goodies are $68 million in Liberty Scholarships for needy college students. Mr. Cuomo championed the program in 1988 only to cut it from his 1991 budget because of the recession, calling it a painful sacrifice to fiscal responsibility. Now Mr. Cuomo is poised to unveil the scholarships in time for election, offering a firm rebuttal to critics who say he has not done enough for poor children.
The very lateness of the budget has offered its own political opportunities to those willing to seize them.
H. Carl McCall, the State Comptroller, has issued repeated statements sharply criticizing Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature for their tardiness. Having been appointed to fill a vacancy last year with Mr. Cuomo's help, Mr. McCall is now running for a full term, and his closeness to Mr. Cuomo has become a campaign issue. To many, his budget statements have been viewed as an effort to distance himself from Mr. Cuomo.

HEADLINE: Democrats Need Money and a Message to Rebuild

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 14

 BODY:
The last time the New Jersey Democratic Party lost the governorship and both chambers of the Legislature, the telephone company threatened to pull out the phones and the party's headquarters building had to be sold.
Things are not quite that bad now, only the second time since the adoption of the State Constitution in 1947 that the Democrats have been more spectators than players around the Capitol. 
 But the Democrats have their work cut out if they hope to return to power. Not only must their party rebuild its finances, Democrats and Republicans agree, but it also must find a new message in the wake of voter rebellion against defeated Gov. Jim Florio's record tax increases and voter support for Ross Perot's anti-government campaign.
After Republicans won control of both legislative houses three years ago and followed by electing Christine Todd Whitman Governor last November, the Democratic Party chose as its new chairman a 39-year-old financial consultant with a limited political background but a familiar New Jersey name. He is Brendan Thomas Byrne 2d, the son of the former Democratic Governor who served two terms between 1974 and 1982 and whose name graces the basketball arena at the Meadowlands.
 
'We're Not There Yet'
 The younger Mr. Byrne, who is known as Tom, is aware of the financial troubles that dogged the party after William T. Cahill, a Republican, won the governorship in 1969 in the biggest landslide in a governor's race up to that time. Mr. Cahill also pulled Republican majorities into the State Senate and Assembly with him.
"We're not there yet," Mr. Byrne said, referring to the nearly bankrupt condition of the party before his father recaptured the governorship and restored Democrats to legislative control four years later. "But if we aren't successful raising money, the staff will be spending a few weeks on the beach in August."
Mr. Byrne estimated that he would need $300,000 to run the party for a year, including staff salaries, rent and money to support candidates in important local races.
The party in power in Trenton can easily raise $1 million annually, but nothing turns piles of cash into small change more quickly than a statewide campaign that includes the governorship and all 120 seats in the Legislature. And when there is a change in party control, especially in the governor's office, there is a sharp decrease in political contributions to the deposed party.
Thomas V. O'Neil was executive director of the party during the early 1970's when bills were piling up and the building on Willow Street had to be sold to whittle away at the debt.
"In those days when things got really tough, Sal Bontempo, the chairman, would call about 20 institutional party loyalists and get the money to keep us going," he said. "Today, that would be much more difficult with all the personal PAC's siphoning off the money that would have gone to the party."
Mr. Byrne tends to his money management business in his Princeton Township home in the mornings and then goes on the road, often meeting with local party officials through dinner and into the evening.
 
'Following the Hughes Model'
 "He's doing things we've needed to do for a long time," said Thomas G. Hartmann, a Rutgers University journalism professor and an adviser to Democratic leaders. "He tells people he is following the Hughes model, when former Governor Hughes [Richard J. Hughes], and Thorn Lord, the Mercer County Democratic chairman, went to living rooms all around the county to revive the party by asking people what had to be done and requesting their help."
Mr. Byrne, a former Princeton Township Democratic chairman, said the party must be recast "in a slightly more fiscally conservative image" without revising its traditional positions on social issues. "We have to show that we can be as careful with a buck as the Republicans, and we can do that," he said.
At a recent meeting with municipal and county Democratic leaders in Union County, Mr. Byrne said he found some lingering animosity toward former Governor Florio. "They think he hurt the party, and that's understandable," Mr. Byrne said. There is no question that the election reverses in 1991 through 1993 flowed from the enactment of Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax program, he said.
"But we not only have to overcome that, we must reverse a 10-year slide in our fortunes," Mr. Byrne said, referring to the years when a booming economy helped Thomas H. Kean become one of the state's most popular governors and enabled him to pull in a Republican State Assembly. "And that job won't be done until the term 'Reagan Democrats' is no longer part of the political lexicon."
Mr. Byrne has abandoned his idea of forming a "shadow government," complete with its own cabinet, to monitor the performance of the Whitman administration. That, he said, would be too cumbersome. Instead, he plans to release periodic position papers -- dressed up with Ross Perot-style graphics -- on state issues to define the party and invite comparison with the policies of the Republican administration.
Mr. Byrne did not seek it, but interviews with Republicans brought some words of advice. Dean R. Armandroff, executive director of the Republican State Committee, said that if the Democratic Party hoped to rebuild, it "must focus on local races that were lost in 1990-91 in town council, mayoral and freeholder races."
"Just as there was a Watergate class of Democrats elected to Congress in the 1970's, there was very much a Florio class of Republican candidates swept into office in 1991 and 1992 when we began to win control of town councils," he said.
Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, a Democrat turned Republican, said that when most Americans believed that big government could solve their problems, the Democratic Party was in good shape. "But that policy has clearly failed," he said, "and people are now mad at both parties, but more so at Democrats.
"The traditional Republican notion of lower taxes and less government is the wave of the future," he said. "The Democrats have got to fight for people again and have got to learn to keep the special interests at bay."

Lena Williams wrote a fascinating article on the success of Madison Square Garden. Of course, I could do a lot better myself if I could get the type of favorable tax breaks the Garden has received. I have a great idea! Why don't you do a story on how much in taxes Madison Square Garden hasn't paid and then find out how much that money could have helped New York City and its people -- especially those who are soon to be unemployed, left without medical care or suffer from the downgrading of services, like park maintenance and street cleaning, because of the city's huge budget gap.

HEADLINE: Is U.S. Really Taking a Wrong Turn?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "As Capitalism Wins, the U.S. Drops Out" (Viewpoints, March 27), Theodore J. Forstmann sets up a number of strawmen, then proceeds to knock them down to prove the United States is slipping away from capitalism while many other countries are embracing it. 
 He has a particular dislike for President Clinton's proposed health care reform package. But even here he is disingenuous, arguing that he travels to countries everywhere that "are privatizing industry" only to return home "to a country that is about to nationalize health care."
There are no bills in Congress to nationalize health care. Even the single-payer bill wouldn't do this, and it is, perhaps, the most sweeping proposal. It would only nationalize the collection of revenues to pay for care, negotiate regional rates for health services and pay the bills.
Had Mr. Forstmann traveled to Western Europe, he would have found each country with either national health insurance or a national health service. In Southeast Asia, he must have bypassed China and Japan because they also have national health systems dominated by national governments.WILLIAM ARTIS Manhattan, March 28
The writer is assistant to the president of the National Union of Hospital and Healthcare Employees.

HEADLINE: Is U.S. Really Taking a Wrong Turn?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his passionate defense of laissez-faire capitalism, Theodore J. Forstmann seems unaware of how ahistorical his views are. How someone who ignores so much American history can hope to predict the future is a mystery. 
 The Government has always intervened to help capitalism, from Alexander Hamilton's "Report on Manufactures," through land grants to railroads to 20th century support for all businesses inherent in massive Federal and state outlays for highways, shipping, railroads and air transportation. Have such governmental interventions in the free market made the United States the statist society Mr. Forstmann so fears?
Finally, the dialectical absolutism of his article might make good copy for an opinion editorial, but it does not reflect reality. He ignores the reality of "individuals acting on their own interests" and polluting our air, our waterways, our land and all the while exploiting labor -- children included.
If businessmen had been more ethical and socially responsible much of the government intervention Mr. Forstmann rues would not have been necessary. While praising democracy, he implicitly criticizes the United States for its response to cupidity and excess. The irony here is that the government response usually came after many years of abuse and after persistent democratic pressure.

To the Editor:
Theodore J. Forstmann points out that American statism has "increased ignorance while spending more on education" and "increased racial tensions while trying to engineer equality." How true. 
 Free of the stifling egalitarianism of government, the private sector could educate deserving students with superb efficiency, wasting no resources on unworthy children, who could be used as inexpensive manual laborers.
And before the Government, starting with Lincoln, began meddling in race relations, the "genius of the marketplace" had produced the lucrative slavery system under which racial tension as we know it was minimal.
And Mr. Forstmann need not fret about health care under Bill Clinton being given over to "probing government hands." It seems far move likely that it will be given over to the largest insurance companies, which will doubtless enable Mr. Forstmann and other "risk takers" to turn a tidy profit.

HEADLINE: Banks of New York: What They Offer, What It Costs

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Here is a look at the types of accounts and services offered by a selection of local banks.
Most banks offer free checking if requirements for a minimum balance are met. The requirements are based either on an average of the daily balances during the statement period (generally about a month) or on a minimum daily balance (in which there is a charge if the balance drops below the required level at any time during the statement period). 
 In some cases, free checking also means free use of automatic teller machines -- locally and in worldwide networks. And in many cases, balances in checking accounts can be linked to, or combined with, savings, C.D.'s and other deposit accounts to meet the requirements.
When averages aren't met and banks charge, they charge a monthly fee as well as a fee for each transaction (for a withdrawal or deposit through a teller or A.T.M., for example, or for a check paid). Some banks charge for use of their own A.T.M.'s, and almost all charge for use of those of other banks.
Many banks offer budget checking accounts, in which they charge low fees for minimum monthly activity. Starting July 1, state law will require all banks to offer this service.
Some banks also offer accounts for large-balance customers, providing special packages of services.
