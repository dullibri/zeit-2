HEADLINE: Borrowing by Consumers Up Further in November 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Consumers borrowed at the fastest pace in three months in November as a surge in personal loans outweighed slower growth in credit card purchases, Federal Reserve statistics showed today.
 An increase of $12.9 billion in consumer credit in November, to $1.523 trillion, came after a revised increase of $17.3 billion in October. Analysts had expected November borrowing to increase $8 billion. 
 Figures for both months included adjustments for previously unreported debt in October. Excluding adjustments, borrowing rose at a 10.2 percent annual rate in November after rising 7.5 percent annually in October. August borrowing had been greater yet, at 10.9 percent.
Increased borrowing amid signs of slower retail and auto sales suggests that Americans may be turning more to debt to maintain their standards of living, some analysts said.
Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a speech today that "the lower pace of consumption growth over the next year ought to help ensure that consumer balance sheets remain healthy." 
The report was issued as economists try to pinpoint how much the economy has slowed. At Morgan Stanley Dean Witter today, the firm's chief economist, Stephen Roach, and the chief United States economist, Richard Berner, told clients that the gross domestic product would contract by an annualized 1.25 percent in the first half of this year. For all of 2001, the economy will grow 1.1 percent, down from their previous forecast of 2.5 percent. 
Mr. Guynn said growth would cool to 3 percent this year without big increases in unemployment or inflation. The Fed's half-point cut last week in its benchmark interest rate will keep expansion alive, he said.
Revolving loans, which include credit cards, rose $4.8 billion in November after gaining $7.9 billion in October. Personal loans -- including financing for autos, education, vacations and other big expenses -- rose $8.1 billion in November after rising $9.4 billion in October.
The interest rate on new-car loans through auto finance companies increased to 5.44 percent from 4.74 percent. While the report does not include home equity loans, mortgages or other debt secured by real estate, analysts use it as a gauge of consumer spending. Most expectations are for a decline.

HEADLINE: China Says Protest Papers Are Distorted 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Tuesday, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
The Chinese Government today defended the crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989 as "highly necessary to the stability and development of China."
 In the first official response to the "Tiananmen papers," reportedly internal documents newly published in the United States that portray divisions among China's leaders at the time, a government spokesman also suggested that they were fake. 
 "Any attempt to play up the matter again and disrupt China by the despicable means of fabricating materials and distorting facts will be futile," a spokesman for the foreign ministry, Zhu Bangzao, said in a statement issued early this morning by the New China News Agency. 
The documents were reportedly brought out of China by a man who told scholars that he was a Communist Party member who hoped to influence the debate over political change. The American experts who translated and edited the materials said they were convinced that the papers were authentic, though they could not be positive.
The violent suppression of the movement and the branding of its leaders as enemies of the state remain a source of bitter division in China, but no public discussion is allowed.
Copies of the documents are circulating on the Internet and are being avidly read by intellectuals, who say they have found no big surprises. There is no sign yet of any major effects on the political scene, where jockeying has begun for the top party and government positions in the next few years.
The documents depict sharp divisions among China's leaders at the time, pitting a faction led by the party chief, Zhao Ziyang, that sought compromise with the students, against hard-liners led by Prime Minister Li Peng, who feared that the party could be toppled. 
The papers also confirm that the ultimate power lay with party "elders" led by Deng Xiaoping, who decided to take forceful action against the democracy movement, which had drawn in millions of people in hundreds of cities. In the documents, Mr. Deng expresses concern that the country could fall into chaos and that his plans for economic change could be destroyed.
On the night of June 3 and 4, after Mr. Deng's decision to crack down, troops poured into Beijing, shooting at crowds and killing hundreds. Mr. Zhao was placed under house arrest, where he remains.

Amazon Meets Sales Goal For 4th Quarter, but Barely
Amazon.com said that it just barely made its sales targets for the fourth quarter, but it sacrificed its profit margins to do so. As the largest online merchant, Amazon is the most significant bellwether of e-commerce. Its announcement was consistent with other indicators that showed that online sales were up sharply but grew more slowly than expected.
 Amazon said its fourth-quarter sales were above $960 million, up 42 percent from a year earlier. Amazon met its sales goal of $950 million to $1.05 billion. But many analysts had been expecting $1 billion. Page C4.

HEADLINE: Ford Plans to Give Explorers' Engines an Electric Assist 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company will announce plans on Tuesday to install electrically assisted gasoline engines to sharply increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions in a large proportion of the Ford Explorers it sells in 2004, company executives said.
 The plans are the broadest yet in the auto industry to introduce electric technology -- specifically, starters that turn a vehicle's engine on and off automatically, eliminating idling -- into the mass market. 
 The new technology will help Ford raise the fuel efficiency of the Explorer, the nation's best-selling family vehicle in recent years, by 42 percent, to 27 miles per gallon from 19, the executives said. 
Ford also plans at Detroit's auto show, under way this week, to announce many safety improvements to all of its sport utilities, intended to make them less dangerous to their occupants and other motorists.
The announcements coincide with a stepped-up effort by Ford to settle lawsuits filed by the families of people killed or crippled in Explorers that rolled over after their Firestone tires failed. This morning, the company settled, for a sum said to be in the tens of millions of dollars, one such high-profile lawsuit scheduled for trial on Tuesday in Corpus Christi, Tex. 
Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president for North American automotive operations, said the timing of the settlement and the fuel-efficiency and safety improvements was a coincidence. He noted that Ford had made safety and environmental announcements at the Detroit auto show every year since 1998, in anticipation that these issues will become more important to consumers, especially in the sport utility market.
"They don't really care at this time," Mr. Inglis said. "We believe over time more and more customers will care, and we want to be there before them." 
After introducing the new starters as an option on Explorers in three years, Ford plans to add them to a wide range of other sport utilities, cars and minivans, company executives and engineers said. The new electric technology will allow Ford to meet its goal of improving the average gas mileage of all its sport utilities by 25 percent by 2005, and make further gains thereafter, said Gurminder Bedi, Ford's vice president for light trucks.
The new device automatically shuts down a gasoline engine when the vehicle stops and then restarts it immediately when the driver's foot touches the accelerator. The quick start-up is possible because Ford will also upgrade the Explorer's electrical system to 42 volts, from 12 volts now. With the higher voltage, Ford will also introduce other technology that will allow air and gasoline to be mixed more precisely in engines -- further improving fuel efficiency and emissions.
"It's going to be as dramatic as the change going from carburetors to direct injection," said John Miller, a Ford engine design manager.
Many automakers are developing 42-volt technology, working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but Ford is the first to commit to it on a large scale.
The General Motors Corporation plans to use 42-volt electrical systems in 2004, but on so-called hybrid vehicles with both gasoline engines and electric motors. Hybrid vehicles like the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius are already on the market, and they stop and start automatically without idling, as will the Explorer. But the Insight and Prius have been niche vehicles because they are expensive to produce and can be hard to repair except at dealerships.
Explorers and later vehicles with the high-voltage system will have a 42-volt battery in addition to the 12-volt battery found in cars today. The Explorers will have a new brake system that will slow the vehicle partly by using the system to recharge the high-voltage battery, as well as by conventional friction with the brake pads. The entire electrical system will be an option probably costing less than $1,000 on Explorers, a Ford official said.
Taken together, Ford's plans represent the broadest commitment so far by any automaker to address the safety and environmental drawbacks of sport utilities. The backdrop for the announcements is not just the uproar over fatalities involving Explorers that flip when their Firestone tires tear apart, but the rise in gasoline prices over the last year that has eaten into consumer confidence and helped slow the American economy.
Currently, sport utilities are the biggest gas-guzzlers in the nation's passenger fleet, partly because they qualify for more lenient federal regulations than cars. They are also allowed to emit up to five and a half times as much smog-causing gases as cars. Ford voluntarily builds its models to pollute as little as cars, a policy announced at the 1998 auto show here, but few automakers have followed suit; President Clinton a year ago ordered that all sport utilities meet the same pollution standards as cars by 2009.
A few of the safety measures to be announced on Tuesday have been previously disclosed for one or two models, like anti-rollover devices and front-end designs that reduce damage to cars during collisions. These will now be used on all Ford sport utilities and pickups.
Other measures involve broader, more sophisticated applications of technology now found on a few competitors' models. For example, Ford plans to install air-pressure sensors inside the tires of all sport utilities and pickups, a step General Motors took several years ago on some of its cars. Still other changes involve a shift in corporate philosophy, like making sport utility brakes as effective as car brakes -- a sharp change for Ford, which strongly argued three years ago that there was no need to improve sport utility brakes.
Brian O'Neill, the president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an insurer-financed group that seeks to reduce the cost of crash claims, said that Ford's plans were the clearest sign yet that the auto industry accepted that sport utilities posed different safety issues from cars. 
"There's no question that there has been, belatedly, a recognition that there are safety issues with S.U.V.'s, both for their own occupants and for the occupants of the vehicles they hit," he said when told of Ford's plans.
Mr. Bedi and three other Ford managers said that the automaker planned to do the following:
*Lower the steel beams inside the front ends of all Ford sport utilities and pickups to the same height as in cars over the next several years. 
*Install matchbox-sized electronic pressure monitors inside all sport utility and pickup tires.
*Adopt a sophisticated version of antilock brake technology on all sport utilities, and make other brake changes so as to reduce the vehicles' stopping distances to that of cars.
*Make available on all sport utilities a kind of ceiling-mounted air bag that covers the side windows during a rollover, to prevent occupants' heads from going through the windows and striking the pavement when a vehicle starts flipping over.
*Include an electronic vehicle stability system on all sport utilities and pickups that will automatically pull the vehicle out of most skids with tiny applications of the brakes to one wheel at a time, reducing the frequency of rollovers.
*Equip sport utilities and pickups with high-technology air bags and seat belts that take different actions depending on the severity of the crash, including seat belts that automatically tighten much faster during a high-speed crash.
All of the safety systems will be available for all sport utilities and pickups by 2005, usually as standard equipment. Exceptions are the tire-pressure sensors, which will become standard equipment by 2003, and the ceiling-mounted air bags, which will be installed only on sport utilities, Ford engineers said. 
The new systems will be available by the end of this year on Explorers; several -- including the electronic stability system and high-technology seat belts -- will not be ready when a completely redesigned 2002 Explorer goes on sale next month, said Stephanie Sweeney, Ford's crash safety supervisor for Explorers. 
Priya Prasad, Ford's top safety researcher, said that the lower steel beams in the front ends of sport utilities and pickups, together with similar changes planned by other automakers, should save the lives of 1,000 motorists a year struck by these vehicles.
Federal regulators say that the designs of sport utilities and pickups are causing 2,000 extra deaths a year. Mr. O'Neill cautioned that all such estimates rely on many assumptions, but said that the insurance industry's crash tests showed that lowering steel beams was the best remedy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans on Tuesday to issue its first ratings of vehicles' tendency to roll over -- a calculation on which sport utilities will compare poorly with cars and minivans. Automakers and their allies had blocked regulatory action on rollovers for 27 years, until the Firestone controversy last autumn broke the logjam.

HEADLINE: California Governor Offers a Plan To Save State From Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Calling California's two-year experiment in electricity deregulation a "colossal and dangerous failure," Gov. Gray Davis proposed several major steps today to reassert the state's control over its power market.
 In his annual address to the California Legislature, Mr. Davis, a Democrat, called for the creation of a state energy authority that could buy generating plants from private utilities and build new plants. He also promised he would not allow California's two largest private utilities to continue their recent slide toward bankruptcy, saying he would use all the state's powers, including taking control of power plants and transmission grids if necessary, to keep the system working. 
 "We will regain control over the power that's generated in California and commit it to the public good," he said in his speech this evening in the Assembly chambers here. 
Mr. Davis's proposals will now be debated by a legislature that is already considering even stronger measures to tame soaring wholesale electricity prices and power shortages in many parts of the state.
The governor's plans represent a startling turnaround from the mood that existed four years ago when the deregulation plan passed the Legislature unanimously on promises that market forces would bring power costs down -- a drastic miscalculation, as it turned out. 
Mr. Davis's proposals are bolder than many political experts had anticipated from a centrist governor who critics say did not move quickly or decisively enough even when California's energy problems first surfaced last summer. He has made his mark as a cautious pragmatist more likely to believe in market forces than state control. 
Some members of the state's heavily Democratic Legislature said today they were inclined to move further than the creation of a state power authority. 
"That's something we've already been pushing and we'll consider other measures, too," said John Burton, president of the State Senate. "Drastic times call for bold measures. But I'm more interested in what you do, not what you say. We'll see what comes from this."
Governor Davis suggested that, if necessary, he would consider far stronger action.
"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to," he said.
In his speech, the governor left unstated precisely what he would do in the short term to prop up the state's two largest utilities, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International.
But, as he has in the past, he focused most of his venom on the out-of-state companies that sell power into the deregulated market here, as well as the federal government, which last month lifted the cap on wholesale prices for electricity. 
"I reject the irresponsible notion that we can afford to allow our major utilities to go bankrupt," he said. "Our fate is tied to their fate."
The power utilities have been caught in a dangerous vise because under terms of this first phase of deregulation, they must pay market rates for power on the wholesale market while maintaining, until March 2002, caps on the rates they charge consumers.
Wholesale prices have surged far above consumer rates in the last six months, and the utilities have said they have lost more than $11 billion already because of this situation. The gap, they said, will drive them into bankruptcy if they do not receive some government relief.
Governor Davis and other state officials are scheduled to meet with top federal energy and economic officials at the White House Tuesday in an effort to win help in creating a new cap on wholesale power prices. 
In his speech, the governor said he would push for new laws under which power generators that withheld supplies from the market to force prices up could be criminally prosecuted.
He also said he would seek to offer low-cost loans to finance the refurbishment of old power plants and the construction of new ones. In return, he said, producers would guarantee that the power would be sold within the state. He even said all state universities and community colleges would build co-generating facilities, becoming energy independent. 
One measure not in the governor's speech was a proposal sought by the utilities to have the state sell bonds and use the proceeds to help finance the losses the power companies have been sustaining. The governor's aides said that the measure might still be considered but that it was not near the top of his agenda.
In the $1 billion overall energy plan, Governor Davis suggested two possible paths for a new state power authority. One would create a joint authority with the 30 municipal power authorities already operating around California; the other would create a stand-alone state authority. That agency would sell electricity only in the state and at a small margin above the production costs. 
He also proposed spending $250 million for a conservation program aimed at consumers that would, among other things, offer rebates to encourage replacing old refrigerators, air-conditioners and washers with energy-efficient models. 
The details of most of these issues are to be worked out in a special session of the Legislature that the governor called several days ago.
Fred Keeley, a Democrat and the No. 2 official in the Assembly, said that lawmakers have a two-to-three-week window of opportunity to fashion a solution that calms the financial markets, brings some greater long-term order to the power business and pulls the utilities back from the brink of bankruptcy.
The power crisis comes as the state's fiscal health is already affected by a slowing economy, somewhat limiting Mr. Davis's options.
Because of the vibrant economy of the past year, the state is expected to produce a surplus in the fiscal year that ends June 30 of roughly $12 billion, an unprecedented windfall. The roughly $100 billion budget that Mr. Davis is scheduled to deliver on Wednesday is expected to include a surplus of perhaps $5 billion. 
Still, the governor today proposed new spending on his signature issue, education, and said he would push to improve middle schools by extending the school year for sixth, seventh and eighth grades to 210 days, from 180.
He is also proposing a big increase in the amount of special training teachers receive every year, programs to raise the number of algebra teachers, an initiative focused on the demands of the high-tech economy, and more training for principals and vice principals. 
The energy crisis has created enormous risks for Mr. Davis, a politician who has built his long career in public service largely on risk-aversion. Since being elected governor two years ago, he has worked hard to construct an image as a roll-up-the-sleeves new Democrat and has shrewdly avoided steps that would permit Republicans to brand him a liberal, much like the tactic President Clinton employed.
In fact, Bill Campbell, the Republican leader in the Assembly, said, Governor Davis had co-opted part of his party's agenda, similar to the way President Clinton had, by taking the lead on issues like law and order. "He ran as a centrist and he's very much tried to stay that way," said Mr. Campbell. "When his opponents have tried to tag him with some label, it doesn't work."
Before tonight's speech, however, Mr. Campbell said that if Mr. Davis did advocate strong state intervention in the energy market Republicans would probably criticize the move as a liberal initiative. "Oh, absolutely you'll hear that," he said.
The Democrats, though, control both the Assembly and the Senate and, given the growing public anger over energy prices, political experts said at least some Republicans were bound to follow Mr. Davis's lead.
There were other signs that the crisis could be taking a political toll on the governor, who has been frequently mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2004. 
A recent poll by The Los Angeles Times showed the governor's approval rating had slipped to 49 percent now from 67 percent in February, apparently in large part because of the power crisis.
Mark Baldassare, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California who regularly surveys voter attitudes, said that Governor Davis's approval rating in his polls was at 66 percent as recently as September but that there were signs of a decline because of concerns over the rising prices and power shortages.
Two years into his term, the power crisis could thus have a deep impact on Mr. Davis's reputation and prospects. He has been perceived as largely reactive, as well as exceptionally deliberate and slow. 
"It would be hard to find someone better prepared, if you look at his resume," Mr. Keeley, of the Assembly, said, referring to the fact that Governor Davis has spent virtually his entire career in public service, as everything from Gov. Jerry Brown's chief of staff to the state controller to lieutenant governor. 
"But," he added, "this is a governor who doesn't expend political capital without a great deal of deliberation and anguish. Until this crisis, that has been fine. He has focused on issues that were best dealt with that way. But this is a genuine crisis and it will test his leadership skills as nothing before has."
The rapid pace of events has also exposed holes in government policy and given other politicians an opportunity to take the lead. For instance, late last week, Philip Angelides, the state's ambitious treasurer, proposed the creation of a state authority to buy power generators and intercede in the marketplace.
"This is on one level a complicated issue and on another a simple issue," said Mr. Angelides, who stressed bold action in an interview today. "It would be fair to characterize the state's energy policy until now as hoping for mild weather. That isn't going to work."
What other lawmakers here stressed was that the crisis was going to require close cooperation between the Legislature and the governor. While Mr. Davis has proven a strong-willed but effective partner, some lawmakers complain that he has been difficult to reach face to face and can thus appear remote.
"He's done a really good job of addressing the needs of the schools," said Virginia Strom-Martin, a former teacher who is the incoming chairman of the Assembly's education committee. "But I would say that that's one area he really needs to improve: his accessibility. To be real blunt, if you call up and ask for an appointment, you don't get one."

HEADLINE: Italian Concern Is Acquiring French Internet Business 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 8 

 BODY:
Accelerating a trend toward consolidation among embattled European Internet service providers, Tiscali of Italy agreed today to buy its French rival Liberty Surf for $615 million in cash and stock.
 The deal was the second in recent months for Tiscali, which is run by the Sardinian businessman Renato Soru. In September, Tiscali agreed to acquire the troubled Dutch Internet company World Online in a deal worth $5 billion. 
 The Internet-access business has been fragmented in Europe, in contrast to the United States where America Online has dominated. But today's deal is seen as indicative of a move toward reducing the number of European players to a handful of market leaders. 
Peter Bradshaw, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the deal "is part of the shakeout and consolidation in the industry, and the pace has accelerated since the end of last year."
The shift has come not in the least as a result of collapsed stock market values, notably for new-economy stocks like Tiscali and Liberty Surf.
Tiscali said it would buy shares in Liberty Surf that are now held by the British retailer Kingfisher and Europ@Web, the Internet group controlled by the French investor Bernard Arnault, offering 0.365 Tiscali share and 2.13 euros ($2.04) for each share of Liberty Surf.
Mr. Soru, the 43-year-old founder and chairman of Tiscali, said it would continue its acquisition drive. "We're interested in consolidation in Europe," he told a news conference here. Tiscali's two latest acquisitions will give it 4.9 million active Internet users, making it the second-largest Internet access provider in Europe after T-Online, a unit of Deutsche Telekom, with 7 million.
The consolidation in the European industry has come as Internet providers compete to draw Europeans to the Internet by offering lower access rates. The industry was revolutionized several years ago, when companies in Britain skirted the obstacle of traditionally high European phone rates by offering unlimited free Internet access. Many now offer free access, or unlimited access for a fixed monthly fee, though they must pay phone companies by the minute for the time their clients use, putting profits under extreme pressure.
Battered by this pressure, Liberty Surf, despite being the second-largest Internet-access provider in France, with more than a million active users, had its cash reserves drop to 260 million euros ($248.9 million) from 363 million euros ($347.6 million) in the last six months.
Not surprising, the three current European leaders are the Internet units of national phone companies, with national phone networks at the their disposal: Deutsche Telekom's T-Online; Wanadoo, a unit of France Telecom; and Terra Lycos, which is controlled by the Spanish phone giant Telefonica. But these giants in turn are caught up in a struggle with America Online, which has introduced its strategy in Europe of offering unlimited access to subscribers for a flat monthly fee.
To counter AOL, the European phone giants have been on acquisition sprees. Last month, France Telecom agreed to buy Britain's largest provider, Freeserve, for $2.4 billion. Earlier last year, Telefonica acquired Lycos for $12.5 billion, in a bid to create a global Internet company.
But while most of the phone giants have the bulk of their customers in the countries where they were once the national monopolies, Tiscali has pursued a strategy of acquiring lesser-ranked Internet companies, gradually assembling a European network without ranking at the top in any single national market. Mr. Soru said the latest acquisition would make Tiscali No. 2 or No. 3 in major markets like France and Italy and in smaller countries like Belgium and the Netherlands. The goal is to reach larger markets for online shopping and increase advertising revenue.
James Kinsella, a former chief executive of MSNBC.com and later World Online, who now holds that position at Tiscali, said he expected it to report a positive cash flow by the end of the year and a net profit for 2002.
But not everyone is convinced that Tiscali's latest deal puts it among the leaders. Tarek Robbiati, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said Tiscali was getting a company with negative gross margins whose operations would need substantial investment to yield a profit. He added that France was a very competitive market, with Wanadoo and AOL, both with deep pockets, fighting for dominance.
"At this stage, rather than making new acquisitions, Tiscali should be strengthening what they already have," Mr. Robbiati said.
Investors appeared to agree. In Milan, Tiscali shares dropped 9 percent; in Paris, shares in Liberty Surf fell almost 6 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow and Nasdaq Drop as Investors Wait for Earnings

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Bargain hunters saved the market from another big technology sell-off yesterday, rescuing the Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq composite index from losses of more than 100 points each.
 Stocks still closed lower, because Wall Street is waiting to see how much of a negative effect the slowing economy has had on earnings. 
 "It's probably going to be a bit better than the market has priced in," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company, of the earnings season, which begins this week. "I think we have overdone the selling a bit." 
The Dow Jones industrial average declined 40.66 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,621.35. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.73 points, or half a percent, to 2,395.92. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended down 2.49 points, at 1,295.86.
Investors already know profits will be disappointing, but they are uneasy about the size of the damage and how long it will take for results to improve.
"It is clear that there is going to be no real improvement in earnings or the economy until the second half of the year," said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategists for Legg Mason of Baltimore. "So, we'll have an ugly first quarter and the second quarter will be difficult, as well."
Since the new year began, the market has continued to slide on Wall Street's fears about falling profits and the slowing economy. The one exception was Wednesday, when the Dow and Nasdaq soared more than 300 points each after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a point.
Investors quickly realized it will take a while for earnings and the economy to benefit from lower interest rates and they resumed selling.
Stocks could rally if coming earnings beat analysts' expectations, or if the market can shake off disappointing results, said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst for Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
After nearly five months of trending downward, "that could be a key change in character in the market," Mr. Harrington said.
The first big day of technology earnings comes tomorrow when Motorola and Yahoo are scheduled to report results.
But investors yesterday seemed pessimistic, sending Yahoo skidding $1.31, to $27.19. But Motorola, which had fallen earlier, closed up 56 cents at $21.75.
Before turning into bargain hunters, investors directed their ire at technology in general, because the sector stands to have the weakest profits.
Dell Computer recovered late in the day, picking up 13 cents, to close at $19.13. Earlier in the day, Bear, Stearns lowered its earnings estimates for the company. I.B.M., a Dow stock, fell 44 cents, to $93.56, after losing more than $2 earlier in the session.
Companies that supply the PC industry also were hurt but rebounded somewhat. Microsoft lost 19 cents, to finish at $48.94, while Intel was down 13 cents, to $31.94.
Blue-chip advances were spread across sectors with no clear leader. Coca-Cola rose 94 cents, to $58.63, and Procter & Gamble climbed $1.63, to $76.56.
Shares of retailers, many of which reported they had the bleakest holiday shopping season in years, were also down. Best Buy fell sharply, down $2.38, to $37.56.
 --------------------

10-Year Note Falls
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Demand for $15 billion in corporate and agency bonds selling this week, including yesterday's $5 billion sale from Citigroup, helped depress the most-active 10-year Treasury security whose yield neared a 2-year low.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32 , to a price of 1063/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.94 percent from 4.92 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32 , to 11129/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.43 percent from 5.40 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Working, But Not 'Employed' 

BYLINE:  By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former secretary of labor, is the author of "The Future of Success."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Linda Chavez, George W. Bush's pick for labor secretary, is facing a blizzard of questions concerning Marta Mercado, a Guatemalan woman who, as an undocumented alien, lived in Ms. Chavez's home during the early 1990's and did some work for the family. Ms. Chavez didn't pay Social Security taxes on Ms. Mercado's labors. 
 Have we been here before? 
 No, says Ms. Chavez. She never actually employed Ms. Mercado. The entire transaction between them amounted to nothing more than the woman's doing a few chores around the house and getting in return some "spending money" -- no more than a couple of thousand dollars. A spokesman for Ms. Chavez said it was just a matter of helping someone "down on her luck." Ms. Chavez remembers the situation as lasting about a year. 
The distinction Ms. Chavez appears to be making turns on a definition -- as do so many other pertinent legal distinctions these days. Is someone who receives free rent and a few thousand dollars for doing chores around your home an "employee" under the labor laws -- entitling that person not only to Social Security but also to a minimum wage, time-and-a-half for putting in more than 40 hours a week and a reasonably safe workplace, among other things? 
It's not a simple matter. These days, who works for whom is one of the most complicated questions in the emerging economy. Tens of millions of temporary workers, part-timers, freelancers, e-lancers, independent contractors and free agents -- already estimated to constitute one-tenth to one-third of America's civilian labor force -- are not technically "employees," under many labor laws that impose legal obligations on employers.
Most labor laws were enacted at a time when "employees" and "employers" were easily recognizable. Organizations were shaped like pyramids with a few executives at the top, a wider layer of middle-level managers and staff and a large number of workers at the bottom. You were either an employee or you weren't. And if you were, you were either a manager or an hourly worker.
Now, bureaucratic structures and definitions no longer apply to large numbers of workers. Broad constellations of designers, suppliers, marketers, financial specialists, contractors and shippers function as employees in a single enterprise at one point, only to split off separately afterwards to join new constellations of employees. Giant companies can operate from single floors leased in office buildings and contract out for everything they do. 
In a few years, a company may be best defined by who has access to what data and who gets what portion of a particular stream of revenues, over what period of time. There may be no "employees" at all, strictly speaking. 
Meanwhile, overworked two-earner couples are madly subcontracting to other people much of what families used to do for themselves. Here too, it's getting harder to discern traditional employer-employee relationships because the people who are hired also tend to work for many others.
Some take care of children, others come into the home to cook, clean or even assemble bookshelves and entertainment centers. Increasing numbers of people provide coaching, counseling, and personal training. The do-it-yourself trend of the 1950's has been all but replaced by the hire-someone-to-do-it trend of the 2000's -- although the hired person may not be an employee.
Courts are brimming with lawsuits over who works for whom, and who's entitled to legal protections as a result. Microsoft just settled a big case with a large fleet of temps who claimed they were, in fact, regular Microsoft employees. But it's also occurring on a smaller scale, as people who have provided specific services turn around and sue their putative employers for the back pay or health care they say they are due or for injuries they claim occurred because of employer negligence. 
The law is muddled because the economic ground is shifting so fast. These days, someone who hires someone else to do a job has been interpreted by some courts to be an "employer" if he or she owns the equipment used on the job and the place where the work is done and provides a significant portion of the hired person's income (including an in-kind benefit like a place to sleep). But these criteria aren't definitive, nor are they the only ones the courts are using.
Did Linda Chavez "employ" her Guatemalan guest? I don't know.
This is precisely the problem. The labor laws that were enacted many decades ago when the economy was different are in the process of being adapted to a new economy -- not only through new laws but, far more frequently, through rules, advisory opinions and administrative orders issued by the Labor Department, as well as through the informal pronouncements of the secretary. 
A secretary of labor has to make a lot of decisions about what policies to advance, which cases to bring, and whom to protect. But the bottom line is that the labor secretary has to look out for the rights of people who are working -- regardless of technical definitions or of which way the labor markets are moving. And that may mean erring on the side of declaring people "employees" so that they can get the protection they need.
Linda Chavez might have a defensible legal claim that she did not employ Ms. Mercado. But the disconcerting reality is that Ms. Chavez is the one who has been nominated to enforce and interpret workplace laws in the future. If she doesn't believe that the person working for her was an employee, how vigorously will she protect employees in general?

HEADLINE: Adults Sidestep Serious Talks With Teenagers, Survey Finds 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Adults avoid talking to youngsters about budgeting, saving and giving to charity in much the same way that they recoil from advising them about sex, according to a survey released yesterday.
 Their reticence stems partly from a failure to practice what they preach and from a fear of being found out, according to the survey, which was commissioned by Lutheran Brotherhood, a financial services organization that serves Lutheran families, and the Search Institute, a social science research firm. 
 The survey of 1,425 adults, which was conducted last spring by the Gallup organization, suggests that a host of other meaningful subjects make adults tongue-tied in front of adolescents and young adults, including personal values, cultural differences and community service.
"The consistent theme I get from parents is, 'I know I haven't done well in this myself,' " said Nathan Dungan, the vice president of stewardship and brand development for Lutheran Brotherhood, which is based in Minneapolis. "They're afraid of owning up to their own shortcomings." 
The survey suggests that the only serious subjects that most adults are comfortable broaching with young people concern being successful in school and having respect for adults.
The survey leaves no doubt that adults consider the very issues they avoid to be of critical importance. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed said they felt a duty to provide financial guidance to young adults; 77 percent put a premium on "teaching respect for cultural differences"; and 73 percent said that they had a responsibility to discuss personal values with young people.
But when it comes to having these conversations, most adults say that they, and other adults they know, do not follow through. Only 36 percent said that they or their acquaintances had tutored young people about money, a similar percentage to those who had counseled children about personal values or instructed them about respecting the qualities that make various cultures unique.
The figures are largely consistent no matter a person's income, education or racial or ethnic background, the survey found.
The authors of a study based on the survey, "Grading Grown-Ups: American Adults Report on Their Real Relationships with Kids," say that one reason underlying adults' shyness is age-old and rooted in the disconnect between the generations.
"There is some discomfort in being in dialogue with young people, because it makes us feel vulnerable," said Peter L. Benson, the president of the Search Institute, which is also in Minneapolis. "There are gaps in language and image and interest."
Deborah Harvill-Ash, 43, a part-time actress and humor writer from Coronado, Calif., said that raising issues of money with her 11- and 14-year-old daughters induces as many butterflies in her stomach as talking to them about the "nuts and bolts" of conception.
"I don't know why money would seem as personal as sex, but it does," said Ms. Harvill-Ash, who is married to a naval officer. "I was brought up to believe that you took care of your money, but it was tacky to talk about it. My parents figured they should handle everything."
Though she has yet to take the plunge in engaging her daughters on money, Ms. Harvill-Ash said she knew that her advice would be essential at a time of such prosperity, when "the outside world keeps telling them, 'Buy this, buy this, buy this.' "
In contrast, Rich Mahler, 41, a life insurance salesman for Lutheran Brotherhood on Staten Island, said he had forced himself to wade into waters that his parents would not, telling his 15- and 17-year-old sons that they were not too young to engage in financial planning.
"I talk to them about every penny that they earn," Mr. Mahler said. "I say, 'Give 10 percent to the church, and put away the next 10 percent for savings.' The rest is for expenses, gas money, and if there's anything left over, put that away, too. They practice that, as do I."
The authors of the study believe that the key to breaking through to young people on such critical issues is for Americans to grapple with those topics as neighborhoods and communities, with various adults taking on particular issues with groups of young people in a way that sounds almost utopian.
The study's author's pointed to Mr. Mahler as a role model who has staged free seminars in local churches for 40 or 50 adolescents and their parents on such subjects as the value of a dollar and the many things that can be done with $100.
"Parents love them," Mr. Mahler said. "A lot of times when kids hear advice from another adult, they listen."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton and Governor, in Unity Mode 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
George E. Pataki and Hillary Rodham Clinton met today for the first time as governor and United States senator, in a stage-managed display of cordiality meant to show that they had put the vitriol of the campaign season behind them.
 The meeting was brief, but it underscored an enduring fact of life for New York's governors and its representatives in Washington: political adversaries or not, they need one another to get things done for New York, particularly these days, with the state's influence waning in the nation's capital. 
 Exactly 60 days after Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Pataki's preferred choice for the Senate, former Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Pataki emerged publicly, pledging to work together and making every attempt to signal that they are on good terms. 
Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Clinton smiled, although stiffly, and even offered warm praise for each other before going into their meeting -- though it was far from clear whether they will actually be able to forge a productive working relationship, let alone a friendly one.
"It's an honor to be meeting the senator," Mr. Pataki told reporters as he and Mrs. Clinton appeared for photographers in the Red Room outside his office here in the Capitol. "I'm confident we have one goal in mind, and that is serving the best interests of the state."
Mrs. Clinton nodded with approval, suddenly adding -- to the surprise of many, since she is a Democrat and he is a Republican -- that some of the governor's policy proposals "certainly mirror the kind of ideas that I think will be effective." 
The moment stood in marked contrast to the turbulent days of the campaign, when Mr. Pataki used his considerable influence to try to defeat Mrs. Clinton and sought to portray her as an outsider unfamiliar with the concerns of average New Yorkers. (His fellow Republicans went even further, deriding her as a carpetbagger.)
The meeting came as Mrs. Clinton made her first official trip to Albany as a senator. From the moment she arrived, Mrs. Clinton was engulfed in a whirl of meetings, news conferences and tight security. She responded with many of the themes she campaigned for office on: lifting the sagging economy upstate, increasing the state's share of federal aid and improving education.
She made the rounds here in the Capitol, meeting with leaders of both parties in the Legislature, including Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, as well as State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
Mrs. Clinton did not exactly try to keep a low profile today -- certainly not to the degree she has on her recent visits to Capitol Hill, where she seemed, at times, eager not to stand out and upstage her new colleagues. Rather, she made herself available to reporters several times today, and she appeared on the dais of the Assembly, where she received a standing ovation during the chamber's opening day ceremony.
But she did manage to steer clear of one potentially explosive matter, a possible primary between two major New York Democrats who are considering a run against Mr. Pataki in 2002: Mr. McCall, the only black elected to statewide office, and Andrew M. Cuomo, the son of the former governor and President Clinton's housing secretary.
Mrs. Clinton ducked, somewhat awkwardly, a question about whom she would support in such a contest, saying: "I am a good Democrat. I believe that if we have a primary for any position it's important to be supportive of those who are running in the primary, but not to take sides."
It was not the first meeting ever between Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Clinton. The two had met before -- on Mr. Pataki's visits to the White House and during a show held last year by the Albany press corps.
Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Clinton met privately for about 40 minutes in his office on the second floor of the Capitol building. With her seated on a couch and him in an upholstered chair alongside her, aides said, the two reviewed a number of issues, mainly federal aid to New York, health care and education spending. On a personal level, aides said, the two talked about their children.
It seemed that almost everything came up, except Mr. Pataki's campaign barbs against Mrs. Clinton and the genuine differences the two have; neither would say anything remotely critical of the other.
At one point, for example, Mr. Pataki was asked whether he would be able to work with a person whom he had been so critical of during the election. "Oh, sure," he said. "No question about it. The elections are over. It's time for governing."

HEADLINE: THE MAYOR'S ADDRESS: HOUSING; 
Lowering Costs Seen as Crucial To Building Plan

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The mayor's new proposals to cut building costs could be just as important in tackling the city's housing crisis as his plans for spending more money on construction, some experts say.
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed yesterday that the city curb costs by rezoning vacant industrial land for housing, eliminating organized crime from the construction industry, modernizing the building code, revamping the Buildings Department and reducing red tape. 
 His plan to increase the money the city spends on construction generally drew praise from housing groups, but it was tempered with criticism that his program falls far short of the need and does not make up for prior cuts. The mayor called for $600 million in city financing and an equal amount from the private sector to build or renovate about 10,000 apartments and houses over the next four years. 
"It certainly signals a sea change in this administration, but we remain concerned about the ground that has been lost," said Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit group. "The city was spending $600 million to $700 million annually during the Koch and early Dinkins years, adjusted for inflation, and under Giuliani that dropped precipitously to $100 million to $200 million. So even with the new investment, we're just inching our way back up to the halfway mark."
During his speech, the mayor held up a book on reducing construction costs, saying it was the basis of his proposals. A co-author of the book, Prof. Michael H. Schill of New York University, applauded Mr. Giuliani's two-pronged approach.
"Additional spending is important, but we can stretch those dollars so much further if we can get a hold on costs," Professor Schill said. "Every dollar of subsidy can go so much further." Lower costs would also spur private developers to build more and to do so at lower prices for consumers, he said.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
For New York, Hope in an Era Of 'Nerdistans'

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE state of the city is good, Rudolph W. Giuliani reported at great length yesterday. But then he says that every January. For a fresh point of view, you might consider a report from Joel Kotkin, an urban scholar in California. 
 Mr. Kotkin, in the past a nicely caustic skeptic of Gotham boosterism, was sounding surprisingly optimistic the other day as he led a tour along Hudson Street, the stretch of the Village celebrated by Jane Jacobs. In her 1961 classic, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," she wrote about the "intricate sidewalk ballet" of printers, meatpackers, warehouse workers, merchants and others who lived and worked near her home. 
 Mr. Kotkin led the way into one of the old factories, at Hudson near Leroy Street, now filled by what you could call black-collar workers: video producers, copywriters, graphic artists and designers. In one office with high ceilings and spectacular views of the Empire State Building, executives of a production company, @radical.media, were screening a television commercial in a spot where printing presses once stood.
"These are the artisans that can save New York when the stock market goes bad," said Mr. Kotkin, who grew up in Brooklyn and on Long Island. He is now a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University in Southern California.
"The Wall Street guys will leave when the going gets tough," he said, "but there's now a critical mass of artisans working with information who will stay. There's a new sidewalk ballet here of people living near their workplaces and being on the streets all the time."
These postindustrial artisans, like the preindustrial glassmakers in Renaissance Venice, need a city in order to learn and practice and sell their crafts.
Workers in today's economy, no longer bound to mass-production factories in the hinterland, are drawn to New York, Boston, San Francisco, Santa Monica, Seattle and other "boutique cities," as Mr. Kotkin calls them in his book, "The New Geography: How the Digital Revolution Is Reshaping the American Landscape" (Random House).
His geography includes other places flourishing in the new economy. Telecommuting entrepreneurs are fleeing to valhallas in the Rockies, and high-tech workers are clustering in new suburban "nerdistans" like Silicon Valley and the northern Virginia suburbs. But he sees trouble for old industrial cities and some older suburbs, like parts of Nassau County, that he calls "midopolises" because they don't appeal to either urban artisans or the techies looking for nerdistans.
Most families still want to live outside cities, but there's a growing number of childless people moving back in.
"The postindustrial city is like the preindustrial city: a niche for a minority lifestyle," Mr. Kotkin said. "In the Italian Renaissance, most people didn't live in Florence or Venice. They lived in the countryside. Today most people want to live in the suburbs. Techies want to be in nerdistans where they can work without being hassled. The man in the gray flannel suit would just as soon be in an office park in upper Westchester or Connecticut."
BUT certain creative people need to be around other people like themselves, and they gravitate to the most interesting cities.
"The cities doing best, like New York, are the ones that developed in the preindustrial age," Mr. Kotkin said. 
"These cities were always commercial centers, which made them culturally interesting. They have human-scale architecture and a sense of history. They offer something special, and it's not a convention center or a sports stadium. Those are the only attractions that some smaller cities have -- they're kind of Potemkin cities, like St. Louis or Cleveland. What makes New York and San Francisco and Santa Monica attractive is their uniqueness and spontaneity. You're always running into something surprising."
Mr. Kotkin, though, has not lost all his reservations about New York.
"New York still has a lot of long-term competitive problems," he said. "It has already lost battles with Los Angeles, which now has the biggest port and the entertainment media and a better manufacturing base. New York's next big fight is with the Bay Area. It's way ahead of New York in technology and also attracts the same kind of people to ad agencies, media, finance and venture capital firms. It's a perfect boutique city. New York should watch out."

HEADLINE: Time and AOL Plan Internet Life Magazine 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In an example of the potential advantages, and drawbacks, of the expected merger of Time Warner and America Online, Time Inc. will begin to publish On, a magazine about life on the Internet.
 The new magazine will have AOL's help in marketing, but its editors agree that they must work to persuade readers that the publication is not just an AOL house organ. 
 On's managing editor, Joshua Quittner, said the first issue would be released in March. Strictly speaking, he said, On is a redesign and renaming of Time Digital, a monthly magazine about the digital world that began life packaged with Time magazine. Its circulation of one million readers consists of newsstand sales, paid subscriptions and free controlled circulation -- meaning that it is sent free to some consumers. 
But On will focus less on products and appliances and more on Internet lifestyle and culture.
"This is not your father's technology magazine," Mr. Quittner said. "You are not going to find hard-core articles in this magazine. This is a magazine not about the stuff, but about how people use the stuff."
America Online subscribers will be able to buy subscriptions on AOL Web sites, and some first-time AOL subscribers will be offered free subscriptions.
The magazine is being introduced amid an economic pullback in the world of electronic commerce. Discussions about such a magazine began long before the combination of America Online and Time Warner "was a glint in Steve Case's eye," Mr. Quittner said, referring to Stephen M. Case, AOL's chairman.
Several months before the plans for the merger were announced, Mr. Quittner and Walter Isaacson, then the managing editor of Time and now the editorial director of Time Inc., visited AOL headquarters to try to persuade the company to team up on a print magazine. 
"We thought it would be cool to have a magazine that looked through the eyes of the average AOL-er," Mr. Quittner said. "A magazine that covered the world through that person's eyes and covered that world critically."
After the merger was announced, the editorial approach to the magazine grew more complex, Mr. Quittner said, adding that the deal's announcement made him more aware that readers might not trust the coverage of America Online in the magazine and that he would have to make every effort to convince readers that his editorial content was fair.
"It is one thing to do this magazine if you are totally outside AOL," he said, "and it's another thing to do it if you are owned by AOL. Will readers be suspicious? Will they be confused?"
One cause for confusion, Mr. Quittner continued, might be the America Online program guide that is bound into every copy of On. When the magazine was titled Time Digital, AOL also provided such an insert. 
"So we decided to put that entirely in the hands of AOL," he said. "We have nothing to do with it. Our magazine itself is completely independent, and we will write about the world in any way we want to. I have complete editorial independence. That said, more than half of all people who go online go through AOL."
The AOL insert is printed and produced by Time Inc. Custom Publishing, a division of Time Inc. that publishes magazines on a for-hire basis.
Jesse Kornbluth, the editorial director of America Online Interactive Services, said that the guide should be considered "superior advertorial content," and that its cover clearly indicates it is not produced by Time Inc. He noted that its cover carries the line, "This guide comes to you from the editors at AOL and is produced under their direction by Time Custom Publishing."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Into the Mouths of Babes

BYLINE:  By William Grimes 

 BODY:
THERE is a specter haunting American cuisine. It comes in many guises. It bears many names. If it were human, it would have a terrible time getting a date, for it is bland, boring and overweight. Yet, with the ease of a practiced Don Juan, it seduces chefs, restaurateurs and, especially, culinary journalists. I speak of comfort food.
 It is everywhere. It's a fad that turned into a trend that now threatens to become an unassailable institution, a mashed-potato mountain so large that a hundred backhoes working around the clock could not make a dent in it. Its warm, smothering embrace now extends to nearly every kind of restaurant, from downtown hot spots to ambitious culinary temples that can't resist the playful urge to sneak in a little slob food for dramatic effect. 
 At a time when the cuisines of the world are pouring into New York, and American chefs have risen to heights undreamed of merely 20 years ago, it is impossible to avoid culinary clunkers like franks and beans, pot pies, rice pudding, macaroni and cheese, and meatloaf.
Some restaurants, like Hudson Cafeteria, devote a special section of their menu to comfort food. Others make do with a single dish, often giving it an unexpected spin. At District, for example, the pot pie is filled with lobster instead of chicken or turkey. In the ultimate retrograde gesture, Ike, a downtown restaurant, will heat up Swanson TV dinners for $6. I thought Salisbury steak was nothing more than a bad memory. Now, it's back.
The actual food is not what bothers me. There's a place -- a small place -- for insipid old favorites, just as there is for beach novels and syrupy pop songs. But the all-out effort to raise the status of comfort food is a sentimental fraud, swaddled in a thick layer of pretense and nostalgia, a very bad combination.
Worst of all is the name itself, a damp, sticky, therapy-derived, feel-good term that should be resisted, like elevator music and television evangelists and holidays created by greeting-card companies. It contains, within its squishy-soft soul, a multitude of disturbing assumptions about Americans and what they really want to eat. 
"Comfort food" first appeared in print in 1977, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, in the Washington Post Magazine. The reference was to grits. By the 1980's, the term and the concept had taken off, gaining a second life with the stock market crash of 1987, when many restaurants took their $30 pastas off the menu and replaced them with mashed potatoes, which took on the status of a leading indicator.
Cultural analysts had a field day. Stock market warriors, now weak and defenseless, were desperate for soothing foods, they argued. The reasoning was seductive. It's now received wisdom that complex, turbulent times demand simple "taste experiences." Adults, under pressure, crave the foods of their childhood. That's why you can find milk and cookies on the menu at Moomba, along with pretend Popsicles at Sea Grill and lollipops at Alain Ducasse.
It's no accident that the rise of comfort food coincides with the demographics of the baby boom. Just as the children of postwar America were starting to have their own children, they became seized with an intense nostalgia for the cultural signs and symbols that surrounded them in the 1950's. 
Who can blame them? The 1950's were an era of peace, stability and low inflation. But it was also a time of bad food. In fact, it was the worst time for food in American history. Whatever fragile culinary roots America had put down had been torn out by the industrialization of food production and packaging. Fine dining had been destroyed by Prohibition and put on hold by the Depression and war. The counter-reaction, symbolized by Alice Waters's innovations at Chez Panisse, lay a generation away.
Dazzled by the Eisenhower-era American kitchen on display in Moscow in 1956, Nikita Khrushchev missed a golden opportunity to turn the tables on Richard Nixon in their famous kitchen debate. Yes, America had the hardware. But what was coming out of those Amana Radar Ranges? 
What came out is what we are now asked to cherish as comfort food. It should not be confused with good, simple food that is carefully prepared. In France, this would be called la cuisine grandmere. It is the heart and soul of nearly all Italian cuisine.
Comfort food is not that. Nor is it the inventory of classic American dishes, regional or otherwise -- old favorites that reappear in everyone's dreams, like North Carolina barbecue, Maryland crab cakes or banana cream pie.
The stars of the comfort food parade tend to be profoundly regressive, the dishes that recall the tastes and textures of infancy. What do macaroni and cheese, rice pudding, and mashed potatoes have in common? Milk. And the soft texture that toothless mouths can handle. They're baby food.
Taken by itself, comfort food is harmless enough. But cheering it on encourages cultural backsliding. In evolutionary terms, it has not been that long since American cuisine learned to walk upright. It's been a struggle to stay there, a constant fight against the national impulse to slouch down over a sirloin and a baked potato laden with sour cream. The current explosion of steakhouses is a counterblast against the proliferation of ambitious, sophisticated restaurants in the past decade, a big fat no to sea-urchin custard, wasabi granite and microgreens. 
Steak is fine. But throwing it on a grill is just about the least imaginative way to engage a piece of meat that the human mind can devise. Macaroni and cheese, no matter how well it is prepared, ranks very low on the food chain. Summon up the taste of the finest meatloaf you've ever eaten. Imagine something twice as good. Still not that good, is it?
Learning to eat is a kind of education. It rewards the adventurous. It pays double dividends to thrill seekers who dare to taste a sea urchin; who do not flinch in the face of an andouillette; who, instead of sniffing and picking and probing when something odd turns up on the plate, dive right in, sending off sparks with their forks. We have a name for such people. We call them adults. And when they go out to a restaurant, they are not looking for solace, they're looking for a good meal.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 17, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A Critic's Notebook article last Wednesday about comfort food and its connection to the culture of the 1950's misstated the year of the kitchen debate between Richard M. Nixon and Nikita S. Khrushchev. It was 1959, not 1956. 
The article also referred erroneously to the stove at the home appliance exhibition where the debate took place, and misspelled the brand name that was cited. The brand mentioned -- the first commercially produced microwave oven -- is Amana Radarange, not Radar Range. But it was not on display; although it was used in restaurant kitchens in the late 50's, it was not produced for home use until 1967.

HEADLINE: Roughnecks Wrangle for More Money 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Workers trying to force a reluctant employer to give them a raise, generally have to threaten to strike or to leave. Now, though, a group of Texas offshore oil workers has come up with a novel strategy for wringing more money out of their bosses: antitrust litigation.
 According to a complaint filed in federal court in Galveston, the rig hands contend their employers have been meeting secretly the last 10 years or longer to set ceilings on wages and police the agreement. Such activity constitutes price fixing, the complaint asserts, a felony. 
 "It would be a very rare case, but I see no reason why the theory wouldn't work," said Gary V. McGowan, a former antitrust lawyer in Houston and now a workplace mediator. "Conspiracy to set prices can involve services as well as goods."
Price-fixing cases more typically involve sellers of goods like vitamins, chemicals or art objects, and can land offending managers and executives in prison. But the Texas case is a civil action, and the oil workers are seeking not criminal convictions but more money.
Damages suffered in lost wages over 10 years "will easily exceed $5 billion," the complaint states. As lead plaintiff, Thomas Bryant, a former electrician, says he represents a class of 100,000 fellow workers, and seeks triple damages.
Mr. Bryant has chosen to match wits with a veritable pantheon of major drilling contractors, independent oil companies and well-heeled corporate defense lawyers. One defendant, Ensco International, was founded by the Texas financier, Richard Rainwater, the friend and one-time investment partner of President-elect George W. Bush.
In their responses, the 20 named defendant companies denied that any secret meetings occurred. Their lawyers say there is no huge "class" of aggrieved workers, only Mr. Bryant and his creative lawyers.
Legal experts say that any price-fixing charge is difficult to prove. Mr. Bryant's lawsuit mostly involves suspicions, not hard evidence of collusion, and asks the court for broad latitude to discover evidence.
Even so, those suspicions are grounded in an economic puzzle: why wages for oil-rig workers barely budged during labor shortages in 1997 and in 2000 after oil prices rose and drilling companies rushed to put idled rigs into production.
In a free market, such shortages are supposed to push wages high enough to lure departed workers. Instead, rig hands stayed away, and desperate employers wound up trying to recruit parolees at prison gates or flying in foreign oil workers. Texas radio stations even broadcast a tune whose lyrics pleaded, "roughnecks come home."
Many managers blamed the abundance of retailing jobs at places like Wal-Mart for their absence, but Mr. Bryant smelled a conspiracy. "Wages paid offshore workers didn't rise even enough to keep up with inflation," said his lawyer, Anthony Buzbee, formerly of Susman Godfrey L.L.P., a Houston firm known for its antitrust work. Mr. Buzbee left two years ago to start a plaintiffs' practice.
It is a long way from these suspicions to a smoking gun, however. The most clear-cut antitrust cases usually come to light in geographically limited markets, said Jim Mutchnik, a former Justice Department prosecutor, and in sectors where margins are thin and competition fierce.
Under such conditions, plant managers may decide they cannot undercut the competition's price -- that would wipe out their profit -- so they approach their crosstown rivals and propose to divide the market, Mr. Mutchnik said. Dairies have been found guilty of fixing milk prices in school districts, and gas station owners in Iowa were once caught rigging the price of gas along a stretch of the Interstate highway system.
Mr. Mutchnik, now an antitrust and white-collar criminal defense lawyer with the Chicago firm of Kirkland & Ellis, said the Justice Department had also investigated wage fixing, in a case in which several hospitals appeared to have colluded to fix the pay of health professionals.
The hospital case was a strong one, Mr. Mutchnik said, because all the hospitals were in a single city and the aggrieved workers had skills they could not easily sell elsewhere. He predicted the oil workers would have a harder time proving a secret drillers' cabal because they were so numerous and so spread out.
But that is not to say compensation experts do not think Mr. Bryant is not onto something. Peter Capelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said he thought gentlemen's agreements to suppress wages were "remarkably commonplace."
Large companies routinely hire consultants to survey one another's pay scales, he said, and while that does not constitute price fixing, he has seen employers cross the line. Corporate recruiters have long swapped entry-level salary information before descending on college campuses, he said. And in his own field, he recalled that the American Economic Association for years held an annual "chairman's breakfast," at which "the best universities all agreed on what they were going to pay" faculty members.
"Finally, someone pointed out to them that this was violating the law and they'd better put an end to it," said Mr. Capelli, author of "The New Deal at Work" (1999, Harvard Business School Press), a study of the way market forces are shaping compensation practices in the new economy.
"It wouldn't surprise me that this went on in virtually every small town in the United States," he said. "Particularly in mill towns, where there's more than one employer looking for people to do the same type of work. The problem is getting anybody to talk about it."

HEADLINE: When the Golf Is Good, Zambia Is Doing Better 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: CHINGOLA, Zambia 

 BODY:
If copper is what keeps businessmen busy here, then golf is what keeps them happy, and until recently, no one here was very busy or very happy, and most definitely not at the Nchanga Golf Club.
 Long the social center of this mining town, the club was where deals were sealed over porterhouse steaks and friendships were struck on fairways that count cobras among the hazards. 
 Little more than two decades ago, Golf Digest ranked Nchanga 14th in an article rating the 50 finest courses outside the United States, one spot ahead of the Walton Heath Golf Club in Surrey, England. A laminated, yellowing copy of the September 1979 article still hangs on a wall near the bar. "You have never heard of it," the survey says of Nchanga. "Sadly, few can ever see it, for this jungle course built by copper miners is rated by Bobby Locke as the finest course south of the Equator." 
And then the copper industry, the lifeblood of this poor country's economy, began to crumble. Depressed prices worldwide and inadequate investment at home devastated the entire country, particularly big mining centers like Chingola, situated just south of the Congo, along the string of central Zambian cities that form the country's Copper Belt.
So now, as the recently privatized copper mines begin to claw their way back toward efficiency and profitability, few places, outside the huge mines themselves, reflect the changing fortunes of this town better than this faded golf club.
Caddies long left idling beside blank scoreboards and cooks left standing over cold stoves are busy again, catering to the weekend corporate tournaments and midweek business lunches that in recent years have been all too rare here.
"They are playing, and they are giving us money," said Christopher Majuda, 23, who started caddying when he was still in grade school. "Now we can afford a bag of mealie meal," he said referring to corn meal, a staple in the region.
Indeed for people like Mr. Majuda, much more is at stake than the profits of the Konkola Copper Mines, the local company set up last year by Anglo American P.L.C. to manage its newly acquired operations in Zambia. The young caddie is one of the thousands of people who depend in one way or another on the mines.
If the mines fail, the foreign businessmen can depart, disappointed but otherwise none the worse. The ordinary people of Chingola cannot, and the last few years have given them a hint of the hardship that would almost certainly settle over the town.
"Things were really bad," Webby Musonda, 26, who has caddied on and off since he was about 11 years old, said as he and several of his colleagues waited by the scoreboard for arriving players. During the lean years, caddies who were accustomed to working once or twice a day were lucky to be caddying once or twice a week, Mr. Musonda said. Earning only 4,000 kwacha a round, or about $1.43, plus the occasional tip, meant that men often had to look for other ways to make money in a town where nearly everyone was struggling to subsist. 
Once the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, Zambia was one of the first countries in the region to achieve independence, and the white-controlled copper industry was an early target of the new black government. The mines were nationalized in the late 1960's, but by the 1990's, the mines had fallen into horrible disrepair, after years of insufficient capital investment, inefficient production and overstaffing.
No one here is under the illusion that Nchanga will soon rejoin the ranks of the world's finest golf courses or that the country's mining industry will return to its heyday, when it was the world's third-biggest miner of copper. Yet they are optimistic.
"We're beginning to see daylight," said Margaret Allan, who has worked at the club for 40 years and now runs the restaurant. "Everything was just in limbo. Now we're looking forward, not to boom times, but for things to improve."
The trunk full of groceries that she and her staff were unloading as she talked was evidence, she said, of the trickle-down effect of the new investment in the copper industry, benefiting not only her restaurant, but the supermarket, too.
"It's a whole spinoff," the club's competition secretary, Gary Chadwick, said. "Everyone is getting involved, and everyone is happy."
Lunch hour at the club is bustling again. Even breakfast and dinner are busy, as new employees waiting for housing to open up and families to arrive opt to take their meals at the club. Around town, new guest houses are springing up and old homes are being renovated.
And with the arrival of new executives and managers, stalwarts like Paul Speedie are having far less trouble fielding foursomes.
"We've found a lot of these Konkola Copper guys are keen golfers," Mr. Speedie said as he made his way to the seventh hole during a recent Sunday afternoon tournament sponsored by Sulzer South Africa, the regional subsidiary of the Swiss industrial machinery concern. 
Mr. Speedie, the regional service manager for Komatsu Mining Systems, an international manufacturer of heavy machinery, is an avid golfer. During the slump of the last several years, he kept swinging, hoping that interest would pick up. Now that it has, he knows that it is not just about golf. 
"Everyone's outlook, particularly the white people who've lived here all their lives, is a lot more optimistic," he said. "People are more cheerful. They seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
And indeed the club is steadily recapturing its singular place at the nexus of the town's social and business lives, as novices like Dr. Sixtus C. Mulenga take up the game. A squash player by choice, Dr. Mulenga, Konkola Copper's vice president for safety and health, has become a golfer by necessity.
Anyone who doubts big changes are afoot in Chingola, Dr. Mulenga said, need look no farther than his own presence at Nchanga. "Look at me," he said cheerfully as he marched toward the sixth hole. "I'm playing golf."

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
In Chile, a Dream Unrealized

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
IT seemed too good to be true -- and it was.
 I first visited Chile's vineyards in 1990. It was an exciting time, after years of political and economic turmoil in the country, the future, especially for wine, appeared bright with promise. 
 Chile seemed to have everything: vast tracts of inexpensive land, an almost perfect climate for wine grapes, low production costs, a long winemaking tradition, no phylloxera (the aphid fatal to vines elsewhere) and South America's only stable, export-oriented economy at that time. Then, too, there was the advantage of reverse seasons. Winter in the Northern Hemisphere is summer in Chile. Winemakers from California and Europe could finish the harvest at home, work a full vintage in Chile and be back up north in time for spring. By 1990, the Chilean wine boom was well under way. 
But something was wrong. The first vintages of the new epoch, beginning in the mid-80's, showed promise but little more. "Wait until the vines are mature," the growers said. "Wait until the new wineries are in operation. Wait until we get our new barrels from France."
Patience was asked, but not rewarded. The wines were bargains. Cabernets with ostensibly good pedigrees sold for $6 to $8; chardonnays often for less. But they were mostly bland innocuous wines, rarely a match for the "fighting varietals" from California wineries in the late 80's and early 90's. Even today, most low-price Chilean wines are second rate: chardonnays like overoaked sugar water, flabby reds devoid of tannins, sauvignon blancs that are put to shame by low-price counterparts from New Zealand and the Touraine region of France.
The picture is not entirely bleak. There are a few excellent wines coming from Chile now, but they cost as much as good wines from anywhere else, sometimes $70 a bottle. How many of us are prepared to pay $70 for a bottle of Chilean wine? 
It is not as if the game were being played by amateurs. For almost a quarter of a century, the world's wine experts have been flocking to Chile like migratory birds. In 1979, Miguel Torres, one of Spain's most innovative and successful vintners, became the first foreign winemaker in the post-World War II wine boom to plant vineyards and build a winery in Chile. That year, fewer than 75,000 cases of Chilean wine were exported to the United States.
Shortly thereafter, Agustin Huneeus -- then the president of Franciscan Vineyards in California and a former president of Concha y Toro, Chile's largest wine producer -- was making Caliterra, a wine specifically for the North American market, at the Errazuriz winery in the Aconcagua Valley, north of Santiago. 
In 1988, Chateau Lafite-Rothschild took a half-interest in Los Vascos, a large wine estate in the Colchagua Valley, three hours south of Santiago. Two years later, Paul Pontallier of Chateau Margaux and Bruno Prats, then an owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel, both in Bordeaux, created the Domaine Paul Bruno in the Maipo Valley near Santiago, and in 1994, the owners of Grand Marnier started Casa Lapostolle.
Chateau Mouton Rothschild teamed up with Concha y Toro. Robert Mondavi joined forces with Errazuriz after Mr. Huneeus started his own venture, called Veramonte. Kendall-Jackson, the big California winery, has its own facilities in Chile and makes a wine called Vina Calina.
Chile has become a major player in the world wine market. But there are some things that cannot be hurried, by bigtime producers from the Napa Valley, by the famous chateaus of Bordeaux or even by superstar consultants, the so-called flying winemakers whose counsel is sought wherever grapes are grown.
What went wrong? Overproduction, for one thing. There seems to have been an early decision to put quantity ahead of quality. Certainly, export figures appeared to support that position; the Chileans had no reason to think they were doing anything wrong. 
Exports to the United States alone climbed from less than 100,000 cases in 1980 to almost three million cases last year. Prices remained low, mostly under $8, but the promises of the early 80's -- truly fine wines at moderate prices -- were mostly unfulfilled. 
At the same time, winemakers in southern Italy, in Spain, in the south of France and to a lesser extent in the United States were proving that it was possible to produce a bottle of wine with character and individuality for $10.
It is not impossible to make good wine in Chile. Far from it. In the last five years, a succession of remarkable Chilean wines, all of them red, have made their appearance. They display all the characteristics of fine wines made anywhere else: intensely flavored, almost overripe grapes, deep colors and good tannic structure.
Unfortunately for most wine drinkers, they are expensive, some costing up to $70 a bottle. Among these wines are the powerful Sena, from Robert Mondavi and Eduardo Chadwick at Errazuriz, and Almaviva Puento Alto, the combined effort of Chateau Mouton Rothschild in Bordeaux and Concha y Toro. Both are cabernet-based wines and sell for about $70. Casa Lapostolle makes a mostly merlot blend from its Clos Apalta vineyard in the Rapel Valley, for about $40, and Cousino Macul offers Finis Terrae, a cabernet-merlot blend from the Maipo Valley for around $35. Also from the Maipo Valley is Santa Rita's $40 cabernet under the Casa Real label. 
These wines are all superior to the bland $7 and $8 cabernets, merlots and chardonnays that make up the bulk of Chilean wines coming into the United States. But they are not in the same class as many wines from more traditional sources in the same price range. Like some of the highly praised new Bordeaux, they seem to favor power over finesse. And one wonders, do their prices reflect the actual production costs, which we were told were so low, or are they meant to attract the same buyers who seem eager to pay inflated prices for well-known Northern Hemisphere wines? In any case, it would not be difficult to produce a list of California, Washington or Bordeaux wines in the same price range to give these wines serious competition.
Curiosity will surely lure more than a few adventurers to these wines, but after the first sampling, how many will go back for another $35 or $70 bottle? 
Actually, it is becoming possible to get the Chilean experience for considerably less. A few producers -- still very few -- are beginning to make high-quality wines that are reasonably priced. Primus, the top-of-the-line wine from Veramonte, sells for under $20. Santa Carolina's Gran Reserva cabernet sauvignon from the Maipo Valley and Gran Reserva merlot from the Maule Valley, each at about $15, are also above average. Primus, by the way, is made from 15 percent cabernet sauvignon and 85 percent carmenere, a grape now obsolete in Bordeaux, where it was well thought of in the early part of the 19th century. Not a generous producer, carmenere was virtually forgotten after the phylloxera epidemic wiped out most of Europe's vinifera vines in the 1880's.
But settlers carried it in the 1850's to Chile, where it has thrived ever since, masquerading as a clone of merlot or cabernet franc. Today, Chile appears to be the only place in the world where the vine grows. One day, its sponsors hope, it will produce a distinctly Chilean red wine. Let us all share that hope.

CHILE: PINOCHET CHANGES MIND -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet reversed course and agreed to undergo psychological and neurological examinations as well as an interrogation by an investigative judge that could lead to formal kidnapping and murder charges. The former dictator, 85, had refused to appear for the examinations but has now agreed to submit to the tests beginning today. Judge Juan Guzman, above, said the interrogation would take place early next week. Clifford Krauss (NYT)

PERU: EX-PRESIDENT BACK IN RING -- Former President Alan Garcia, who governed Peru during the tumultuous 1980's, a time of war and hyperinflation, officially filed his candidacy for the April 8 presidential balloting, one of 17 to enter the contest. Mr. Garcia tried but failed to nationalize the banking business and was forced to flee Peru after he was charged with corruption. He has been living in exile in Colombia since 1992.

HEADLINE: Facing Slump and Big Debts, Xerox Hires Consulting Firm 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation, which has $2.7 billion in debt coming due this year, said yesterday that it had hired the Blackstone Group to advise it on how best to shore up its balance sheet in the face of an economic turndown. 
 Although the company hired Blackstone, a private investment bank and buyout firm, several months ago, it publicized the fact yesterday morning after fresh concerns about a possible bankruptcy sent Xerox shares plummeting in early trading. The shares of Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., recovered somewhat later in the day, closing at $5.88, down 50 cents. 
 Analysts said the investor jitters were set off by an article in The New York Post that said Xerox had hired Blackstone as a bankruptcy adviser. 
"We have no plans to file for bankruptcy," said William A. McKee, a Xerox spokesman. "Blackstone is one of a number of financial advisers Xerox has hired to offer counsel on its turnaround plan."
John A. Ford, a Blackstone spokesman, confirmed the statement. "Xerox hired us a few months back, but not to advise them on bankruptcy," he said. "We are helping them with cash flow management and with their liquidity situation."
Xerox can certainly use the help. Although the company has $1.4 billion in cash on hand, it faces a crushing debt load. Xerox has exhausted a $7 billion line of credit and must start repaying that debt next year. Mr. McKee would not discuss other debt coming due in 2002, but an analyst who follows Xerox said the company had $1.9 billion more due next year. 
Xerox, which has promised to cut $1 billion in costs, has already eliminated 400 manufacturing jobs in Rochester and plans to cut 800 more this year. Moreover, in October, Xerox promised investors that it would soon raise $2 billion to $4 billion by selling assets. 
So far, though, it has made only one major divestiture, selling its operations in China to the Fuji Xerox joint venture for $550 million in December. 
Xerox is negotiating to sell half its stake in Fuji Xerox to Fuji Photo Film, leaving Xerox with just 25 percent. Xerox is also talking to prospective buyers about its European paper business, parts of its inkjet-printer business and its Palo Alto Research Center in California. 
Mr. McKee insisted that the divestiture program was still on track and that there would be some major announcements soon. But investors are becoming impatient. 
"The dribs and drabs of good news we keep getting from them just aren't enough," said one money manager who sold all of his fund's Xerox shares in late December. "Someone may buy Xerox's assets, or Xerox may make a slow, grinding return to profitability on its own. But for us, it made more sense to take the tax loss than to keep waiting."
Still, that former investor, and many analysts, expect that Xerox will easily avert bankruptcy. "I don't see any way they'll declare bankruptcy," said James W. Lundy, a research director at the market research firm Gartner. "This is the year they'll work out the kinks of getting back into profitability."
In fact, many see the company's hiring of Blackstone as a positive sign, in that Blackstone can help Xerox find buyers for its assets. 
"Blackstone has a considerable Rolodex of leveraged buyers," said Daniel Kunstler, who follows Xerox for J. P. Morgan H&Q.
Like Mr. Lundy, Mr. Kunstler sees the chance of bankruptcy as remote. "Xerox has refinancing issues, but it's not like they're burning cash like crazy," he said. "It's stretching it to suggest that they don't have the money to remain in operation for the foreseeable future."

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Trips to Cuba for commercial reasons are increasingly becoming a reality for Americans.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LAST year, about 3,400 business travelers went to Cuba from the United States," said John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a nonpartisan business group based in New York. 
 "The biggest contingent was in January of last year during the U.S. Health Care Exhibition, which was a United States-government-sanctioned event that drew 97 companies and 300 participants" to Havana, he added. "The last time that many adults from the United States visited Cuba at one time was the Bay of Pigs in 1961. But this time, instead of guns, the Americans carried pieces of paper saying they could sell things. They were far more successful." 
 Mr. Kavulich was being sardonic to illustrate the reality that many businesses, and more than a few business travelers, are beginning to appreciate. Despite four decades of an American trade embargo that goes back to darkest days of the cold war, global business is being done at an increasing clip in Cuba, which is rapidly modernizing its communications and service industries to accommodate it. And more Americans are getting in on the boom. 
For detailed, timely financial and trade information about current conditions in Cuba, I recommend consulting www.cubatrade.org. This is the Web site of Mr. Kavulich's group, whose members include major corporations that are among the 115 United States-based businesses now operating in Cuba under various special licenses, and other companies contemplating connections to the expanding Cuban market. 
Some business analysts estimate that trade between Cuba and the United States could reach $5 billion annually -- about 70 percent of it from American exports -- within five years of normalization of political and economic relations between the two countries. Which helps to explain why business travel, while still modest, is growing sharply. In 1994, about 500 Americans visited Cuba on business, the trade group said, compared with last year's estimated 3,400.
Some business travelers return after having visited on leisure trips, which have been growing more rapidly. For the last five years, tourism to Cuba has been expanding about 10 percent annually, as more American-based airlines obtain licenses to transport passengers and cargo on charter flights from Miami and New York. Last year, an estimated 140,000 Americans visited Cuba, some of them participating in the growing number of culturally oriented group tours sponsored by museums and schools. 
Of course, foreign companies are not hamstrung by the Miami-exile-based blood feud that keeps the embargo in place. While American companies gingerly explore openings, careful not to be too public about it for fear of retribution, foreign companies are moving rapidly to exploit opportunities in telecommunications, tourism, retail sales and other growing areas of the long-stalled Cuban economy, which is still tightly monitored by custodians of the revolution wary of any drift back toward the pre-Castro days when the island's economy was under foreign corporate domination. There are currently 370 foreign companies involved in joint ventures with Cuban concerns, according to the trade council.
Because of the embargo, which is occasionally modified as political pressures ebb and flow, American businesses need special licenses for commercial activity in Cuba. By and large, purely American-owned business activity in Cuba doesn't go beyond trade shows, exhibitions and a range of allowable projects to identify and explore investment opportunities in agriculture, medical supplies, telecommunications, and other fields defined by the United States Treasure Department. The department has a Web site (www.treas.gov/ofac) that provides a detailed overview of the current regulations under the embargo.
"There are groups of U.S. businessmen who are coming here quite regularly, but they are not able to close any deals; they're basically able to explore opportunities," said Philip Agee, a former agent for the Central Intelligence Agency who spends his time between Germany and Cuba, where he runs a Havana-based Web site, www.cubalinda.com, that provides tourism information about Cuba and allows potential visitors to book hotels and arrange package deals.
"They're coming in groups all the time, but they're not able to do any business for well-known reasons," Mr. Agee said in a telephone conversation from Havana.
"Cuba, as an island, has always depended on trade, and the tradition hasn't been lost" since the revolution, said Mr. Agee, whose name, like so much else connected to Cuba, evokes strong associations with cold war controversy. He quit the C.I.A. after 12 years as an agent in Latin America and in 1975 wrote a book, "Inside the Company: C.I.A. Diary," that made allegations of C.I.A. misdeeds and included a 22-page list of names he said were C.I.A. operatives. That led the United States to revoke his passport. 
Today, Mr. Agee said he was happy to promote Cuba as a thriving tourist and business destination. Last year, the Cuban government began a campaign to rejuvenate Havana's tourist spots. The number of hotel rooms has grown to more than 35,000 in five years, and many hotels are rapidly adding high-speed Internet service and other amenities intended to appeal to corporate travelers.
"There is no question they're targeting the traveling business community," Mr. Agee said. "At the Nacional, the grand dame of hotels in Havana, the 6th floor is now an executive floor dedicated for business travelers, with a business center and excellent phone and Internet connections."
Mr. Kavulich, meanwhile, agreed that communications improvements had been remarkable in Havana, which was once a shabby backwater where getting a phone call out was a matter of good luck or good influence. 
Asked to explain the difference between the first time he visited Havana on business in 1986 and the most recent visit last year, he summed it up in nine words: "First trip, no cell phones. Now, great cell phones."

HEADLINE: U.S. Preparing to End Ban and Approve Sale of F-16's to Chile 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
In its final days, the Clinton administration is prepared to approve the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Chile, ending a ban of more than two decades against selling sophisticated American weapons in Latin America, officials said.
 The administration first signaled in 1997 that it would ease the Carter-era moratorium when it said it would allow high-tech arms sales case by case and gave American businesses permission to bid on the Chilean sales. 
 But Chile, roiled by economic troubles stemming from low demand for its exports, did not select a winner until late last month. The government of President Ricardo Lagos announced its choice of Lockheed Martin to renovate the air force with 10 to 12 planes, each costing $24 million, in a deal valued at $600 million after including spare parts and weapons systems. 
Negotiations began this week in Santiago between the American military contractor and Chilean officials. After receiving a formal request from Chile -- specifying the model and number of planes, as well as the weapons system it seeks -- administration officials said they are prepared to submit the terms for Congressional review and clear the way for the transfer.
Chilean officials said the talks were expected to take two to six months. That would leave final control over the sale to the Bush administration. Advisers to President-elect George W. Bush said they expected him to support the sale.
Critics accused the United States of helping foment an arms race in the Southern Cone of South America. The administration already faces considerable skepticism in the Andean region over its decision to send $1.3 billion in mostly military aid in an antinarcotics campaign known as Plan Colombia.
Robert A. Pastor, President Carter's top aide for Latin America, said the F-16 sale would put new pressure on Chile's neighbors to placate their respective armed forces with new equipment. In a time of peace, with budgets already strained, that money would be better spent on social issues like education, Mr. Pastor said. 
"The militaries in each of the countries will put increasing pressure on civilian governments to match what the Chileans did," said Mr. Pastor, a professor at Emory University.
Administration officials disputed that, saying they were confident that the armed forces of Chile, as well as most of the region, were firmly under civilian control. They noted that Mr. Lagos, Chile's first Socialist president since the military coup in 1973, backed the sale, and the officials predicted that the action would strengthen bilateral ties.
"We don't feel this is going to lead to a regional arms race," said a spokesman for the State Department, T. Philip Reeker. "Chile's armed forces' modernization project is long overdue. What has changed in the region is that democracy has strengthened, and the militaries aren't running the governments on the continent."
The neighbors' reaction has been mixed. Argentina, a traditional rival that once opposed the sale, now has no objections, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said. 
But Bolivia, another adversary of Chile, is "extremely disturbed" by the sale, said Foreign Minister Javier Murillo de la Rocha.
Despite their expressions of confidence in Chile, administration officials said they would not allow the transfer of sophisticated air-to-air missiles that Chile seeks to arm the F-16's. They cited a United States policy that forbids introducing new weapons technology into a region where similar arms do not already exist.
As a hedge, administration officials said, they would quite likely approve the sale to Chile of the latest-generation missile system, known as Amraam, but would store the missiles in the United States until a similar technology was acquired by one of Chile's neighbors.
Chilean officials have warned that withholding the Amraam technology, which lets pilots track and shoot targets they cannot see, may be a deal breaker in the negotiations.
A spokesman for Lockheed in Fort Worth, Joseph W. Stout, said he did not expect the dispute to ruin the deal. "We don't expect it to be a showstopper," Mr. Stout said.
For more than two decades, the United States refused to sell supersonic jets and other sophisticated weapons to Latin America. President Carter instituted the ban largely in reaction to former support for military governments in Chile and elsewhere that violated human rights. The Reagan administration broke the moratorium once in the early 1980's, allowing the sale of F-16's to Venezuela, in response to a threat posed by Cuba's acquisition of Soviet MIG fighters.

HEADLINE: Chief Executive Is Selected For Barneys 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Barneys New York, the debt-laden luxury retailer famous for catering to Manhattan's waif-thin fashion set at its Madison Avenue flagship store, has named Howard Socol, an experienced retail executive, to be chief executive and president effective immediately.
 The announcement ends a five-month-plus search to find a new chief executive. Mr. Socol's predecessor, Allen L. Questrom, announced that he was resigning last July to head J. C. Penney. Since then, Barneys has been run by three of its executive vice presidents, who will now continue with their regular duties, the company said. Mr. Socol will succeed Mr. Questrom as chairman, but Mr. Questrom will stay on as a director. 
 Mr. Socol's last executive position was with J. Crew, where he was chief executive from February 1998 to January 1999. J. Crew said his swift departure was attributable not to any unhappiness with financial results, but rather to differences in "vision" between Mr. Socol and Emily Woods, the company's chairwoman at that time and the daughter of its founder. 
The new Barneys boss made his reputation primarily at Burdines, a division of Federated Department Stores, where after 12 years rising through the ranks he became president, and later chairman and chief executive. During his 13-year tenure at the helm of Burdines, he expanded it from 17 stores, to 45, and increased sales from $475 million, to $1.4 billion. He was "very capable," recalled Richard L. Church, a retail stock analyst who follows Federated for Salomon Smith Barney. 
Barneys said that Mr. Socol's skills were well suited to the retailer's goal of expansion. He will "further the growth phase of the company, including continued growth and improvement in our flagship stores and the expansion of our Barneys co-op business," Douglas P. Teitelbaum, managing principal of Bay Harbour Management, and David A. Strumwasser, a principal of Whippoorwill Associates, the two majority stockholders of Barneys, said.
While Burdines is slightly more upscale than the average department store, it does not cater to the elite clientele of Barneys. The lack of luxury experience does not necessarily make him a mismatch, however, said Walter Loeb, publisher of the Loeb Retail Letter. "Howard is a fashion merchant, very open to new ideas and new vendors," he said.
Getting the clothes right is only part of the challenge for Mr. Socol. Barneys emerged from Chapter 11 in January 1999 loaded with debt, and its long-term survival depends on meeting aggressive sales targets. 
Through October, blessed with an ebullient economy that has been a boon to luxury retailers everywhere, revenue growth was strong. During the first 9 months of this fiscal year, the company said sales were $291.1 million, up 10 percent from the period a year earlier. 
The net loss for the nine months ending Oct. 28 was $1.2 million, substantially less than the $8.6 million lost in the corresponding period the previous year.

HEADLINE: Justices Bar Wide U.S. Role Under the Clean Water Act 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Overturning a 15-year-old environmental regulation, the Supreme Court ruled today that the Clean Water Act does not authorize the federal government to regulate the dredging and filling of isolated ponds and wetlands.
 Depending on how future rulings define "isolated," the 5-to-4 decision could remove 20 percent of the country's waters from federal protection. It leaves in place federal regulation of wetlands that, while not actually navigable themselves, abut navigable rivers or their tributaries, an interpretation of the Clean Water Act the Supreme Court upheld in 1985. 
 The decision was based on an interpretation of Congressional intent rather than on a conclusion about constitutional limits on Congressional power. But the ruling was nonetheless very much a part of the court's ongoing federalism debate, with the majority observing that the authority that the Army Corps of Engineers claimed over isolated waters would, if upheld, "result in a significant impingement of the states' traditional and primary power over land and water use." 
For that reason, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in his opinion for the court, Congress should not be understood to have granted the agency this degree of authority in the absence of a "clear statement" to that effect. He said there was no such statement in the Clear Water Act, a 1972 law that gives the Army Corps jurisdiction over dredging and filling of "navigable waters." 
In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the regulation was a "manifestly reasonable" interpretation of the Clean Water Act and was therefore entitled to the deference the Court usually gives to executive branch agencies' interpretations of their statutory authority. There was no reason to inject "the specter of federalism," he said.
The division on the court was a familiar one: Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion, while Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined the dissent.
Environmental advocates said that because few states protect isolated waters and wetlands, the decision today had removed an important tool from regulators. Timothy Searchinger, senior attorney with the group Environmental Defense, which filed a brief in the case, said that while the ruling "sounds modest and procedural," it actually offered a road map for the court to "strike down environmental rules it doesn't like," because Congress often uses broad language that the court could find insufficiently specific.
Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean Water Act with the Army Corps of Engineers, said the ruling would "make it even more difficult to effectively protect against the loss of wetlands," which she said were important for flood control and as natural filters as well as for wildlife habitat.
The regulation the court invalidated was known as the migratory bird rule, because it asserted jurisdiction over waters that were or could be used by birds that cross state lines or that are protected by international treaties. The Army Corps of Engineers, which issued the regulation in 1986, invoked it in 1994 to block a landfill project on an abandoned strip mine in northeastern Illinois. 
The old strip mine had partly returned to forest, with the depressions left by the mining operations having turned into ponds that became a breeding ground for great blue herons. More than 100 species of birds had been seen at the site, which was bought in 1990 by a consortium of 23 municipalities, to use for disposing of solid waste. The project was approved by local and state agencies before the Army Corps, deciding that the migratory bird rule gave it jurisdiction, denied a permit.
The Illinois consortium sued in Federal District Court in Chicago on the ground that the Army Corps lacked jurisdiction over isolated waters. The consortium lost in the district court in 1998 and the next year in the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which rejected the argument that the exercise of authority over isolated, intrastate waters exceeded Congress's authority to regulate interstate commerce. In the aggregate, the money that millions of people spend every year viewing or hunting migratory birds has a sufficiently substantial effect on commerce, the Chicago-based appeals court said.
But that constitutional theory looked doubtful after the Supreme Court last year struck down the Violence Against Women Act that rejected the argument that the aggregate economic effect of acts of violence against women had a substantial effect on commerce. 
The court's decision last May to hear the Illinois consortium's appeal in this case, Solid Waste Agency v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 99-1178, offered the prospect of a broad constitutional ruling that could cast doubt on an array of federal regulations. From the majority's point of view, that did not prove necessary. Chief Justice Rehnquist said the court interpreted the Clean Water Act "to avoid the significant constitutional and federalism questions raised" by the government's defense of the regulation.
The decision more than satisfied opponents of the migratory bird rule. George Van Dusen, the mayor of Skokie, Ill., and chairman of the consortium, said today that an opposite ruling "would have transformed the Army Corps of Engineers into a super zoning agency with land use authority over vast tracts with the power to block any projects approved by local or state agencies."
The current Supreme Court term offers several additional opportunities for the court to scrutinize federal environmental regulations. A pending petition, Gibbs v. Babbitt, No. 00-844, challenges the constitutionality of a regulation issued under the Endangered Species Act that prohibits people from harassing, capturing or killing red wolves, currently being reintroduced into a federal wildlife refuge in North Carolina, that wander onto private property.
In another action today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the constitutionality of a federal immigration law that makes it easier for illegitimate children born overseas to American mothers to be deemed United States citizens than for children whose American parent is the father. The law requires American fathers to acknowledge paternity and promise support before the child is 18 in order for the child to be deemed a citizen, while those requirements are not placed on American mothers.
In a similar case three years ago, a majority of the court indicated that the different treatment violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection, but several found a procedural problem in that case. The case today, Nguyen v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, No. 99-2071, was brought by a Vietnamese-born man and the American father who raised him but did not formally acknowledge paternity until the son was in his 20's and facing deportation after a criminal conviction.

Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, a German politician, has tried, but she just cannot say it. The phrase will not come out of her mouth. "Not even over my dead body," she explains, "could I say that I am proud to be a German. I even have great difficulty singing the national anthem." 
 She is not alone. After World War II, generations of Germans, at least in the western part of the country, learned that Hitler's acts and German pride were incompatible. Americans could raise the Stars and Stripes in their yards and sing "The Star-Spangled Banner" on the slightest pretext, but Germans had forfeited such patriotism at Auschwitz. 
 Many Germans even relished being post-patriotic, finding solace in a new European identity, dismissing American patriotism as a quaint relic of values the 20th century had undermined. But now, various factors have brought about a resurgence of German pride and a new discussion of whether it is legitimate to be a patriot. 
In his year-end speech, President Johannes Rau, a Social Democrat, gave his own positive verdict. "We can be very happy about a lot of things in Germany," he declared, "and rightfully proud about some." 
Coming from a man who has scant power but acts as a kind of moral arbiter, that little word "stolz" (proud) had a particular resonance. For one thing, it was new. For another, it showed that the slogan of the extreme right -- "I am proud to be a German" -- would no longer cow mainstream politicians into avoiding allusions to German pride.
Mr. Rau's reference to pride came a few weeks after Laurenz Meyer, the secretary general of the opposition Christian Democrats, signaled a new tone for the party by declaring, "I am proud to be a German." In this way, the two main parties here -- the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats -- appear to have legitimized the notion of German pride.
Several developments explain the shift, which could be worrying to Germany's European partners, always restive over any whiff of nationalism in the continent's most powerful state, always watching, in the words of one German official, "to see that we do not raise our chins as much as an inch."
The first is the absorption of 17 million former inhabitants of East Germany, a state that was intensely patriotic and taught its citizens they had been the good socialist Germans opposed to Hitler and his capitalist cronies. That pride, in what is now a unified Germany, is still searching for expression.
The second is the changing political architecture of a Europe no longer divided by the Berlin Wall. With Poland, Hungary and other central European states set to join the European Union in the next few years, Berlin finds itself at the center of a "new Europe." Germans are building a capital, including a new chancellery, that expresses ambition and pride rather than the modest discretion of its former capital, Bonn.
The third development is the growing thirst of Germans for normality, that is, for escape from the status of eternal villain that the mass murder of European Jewry and the other crimes of Hitler's lost war conferred on the state. Part of this normality, as many Germans see it, is the rediscovered right to patriotic pride. "A central part of the normalization we now seek is the recovery of our pride," said Jorg Schonbohm, a leading Christian Democrat and interior minister of Brandenburg state.
At a recent European Union summit meeting in Nice, France effectively argued that Germany's special status could not be changed by insisting that -- even though the country has a far larger population and economy than any other in Europe -- Germany should not be entitled to more votes than any other in European Union decision-making. The German government grumbled but acquiesced -- for now. 
Mr. Schonbohm recalled one of his sons returning from a visit to the United States and asking him, "Dad, why can't we be proud like that?" Mr. Schonbohm said he believes that national pride is normal and that a stable, democratic Germany has earned the right to it, more than a half-century after the end of World War II. 
But for the likes of Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen, a member of the Free Democratic party and formerly a senior official in Helmut Kohl's government, German pride still sticks in the throat, lodged there by bitter memory.
It was 1941, Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen was 6, and her mother took her aside as she went to school for the first time. "You will hear a lot of things in school that we don't agree with and don't approve of," her mother said. "But keep your mouth shut."
Sure enough, Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen said, she heard those things. "It was all about wonderful Hitler, wonderful Germany, wonderful army, horrible Jews," she recalled. "But soon we learned that behind all the national celebration, the reality was grim." 
As the course of the war turned, children were told to collect "old material" -- discarded papers, leftover bones, scraps of metal -- and bring them to school. Then each child's name was read aloud, along with the weight of the material brought. Because her parents -- opponents of Hitler -- refused to join the exercise, the young Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen never had anything to present. She was humiliated. 
Finally, she begged her mother to give her something to take to school -- and found herself one day with the bones of two chickens. Her name was read aloud and then, scathingly, her belated contribution to the war effort was recorded: "Two hundred grams of chicken bones."
After this further humiliation, her mother was called in and asked to explain the family's paltry offering. "So," Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen said, "my mother asked what she was supposed to think when her daughter was told all the time about the wonders of Germany, the superiority of Aryan kids, and the greatness of the nation -- and then asked to collect garbage." 
For Ms. Schmalz-Jacobsen, even today, beneath talk of German pride or patriotism there lurks just that: garbage. In it lie the dregs of revanchist nationalism and the scraps of revisionist history, summed up in the badges of the xenophobic National Democratic Party: "I am proud to be a German." 
Many of her compatriots feel the same way, even identifying themselves as Europeans rather than as Germans -- an unusual attitude in Europe. But the country is now more divided than ever between a growing number of advocates of a new German pride and its eternal opponents. 
"German pride is a special problem," said Micha Brumlik, a sociologist. "In the west, we tried at best for a sophisticated patriotism -- in the Constitution, in the good Germany has done since the war. But in the east, the patriotism was of the blunter, nationalist kind. We need to be very careful about what pride, if any, we now embrace."

HEADLINE: As Russia Demurs Over Payment of Debt, Creditors Warn Against Shirking 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Russia's official creditors issued a stern warning today, telling the government that it had no economic basis for putting off payments on $48 billion in debt.
 The creditors said that, given Russia's favorable economic situation nowadays, they expected it to pay both the interest and the principal. 
 The statement is the latest step in a tussle over Soviet-era debts that Russia inherited but now says it cannot pay in full. The payments are due to a group of governments, including the United States, known as the Paris Club. 
The warning follows a weekend visit to Moscow by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, during which President Vladimir V. Putin spoke optimistically of paying all the debt. Despite the amicable atmosphere of the weekend, Western creditors, including Germany, the government that has lent the most to Moscow, appear to be laying down a marker for negotiations.
Russia has a spotty history with paying its debts. It has defaulted on debt to the Paris Club twice since the fall of the Soviet Union, and is now asking creditors to recast the terms of repayment once again.
Talks with the Paris Club can begin officially only after the country secures an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which would take place in March at the earliest.
Until then, the government will conduct informal talks.
Russia announced today that it could not meet all payments this year. Only certain interest payments will be made, while principal payments will be skipped entirely, said Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, as quoted by the Russian news agency Interfax.
The government has been sending conflicting signals about its intentions to pay its Soviet-era debts, and the statement today further muddied Russia's position.
Russia's negotiating strategy has been to draw fine distinctions between types of debt, some of which it agrees to pay, some not.
The government now says it will make selective payments before an agreement is reached, while creditors are insisting on full payment until then.
That might be difficult, because only a small portion of what the government owes the Paris Club is included in the budget this year. Of the $1.5 billion owed in the first quarter, Russia made allowances for only $307 million. 
Russia missed a payment to Germany last week. Though Russian officials announced today that a $10.5 million payment would be transferred on Wednesday, it was unclear if that would cover the missed payment. Another debt falls due this week.
"I don't know what the outcome of the negotiations will be, but it's very clear that Russia will apply a high degree of pressure to get something," said Jean Lemierre, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and former chairman of the Paris Club, as quoted by Reuters.
With about $3 billion in additional revenue last year and benefiting from the high price of oil, which is Russia's main export and cash earner, creditors argue that Russia has more than enough money to meet its debt payments.

HEADLINE: Texas Learns in California How Not to Deregulate 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Nearly three years ago, Texas lawmakers and regulators preparing for electricity deregulation visited California to study its first-in-the-nation experiment. For two Texas legislators, Steven D. Wolens, a Democrat, and David Sibley, a Republican, it was a memorable trip.
 "I remember saying to Sibley, 'If this is what deregulation is, we don't want it,' " said Mr. Wolens, a state representative from Dallas. 
 Neither, it appears, does California anymore. On Monday night, Gov. Gray Davis deemed the state's experiment a "colossal and dangerous failure" and proposed government intervention to meet the state's energy demands, stabilize rising prices and help ensure that the two largest private utilities avoid bankruptcy. Then today, Mr. Davis was in Washington for a White House meeting with top federal officials to discuss California's energy crisis. 
Yet even as deregulation is collapsing in the largest state, the second-most-populous state, Texas, is moving forward with its own plan, one intended, in part, to avoid California's problems. In March, Texas will begin a marketing campaign, followed in June by a pilot program involving 5 percent of the state's customers, then culminating with full deregulation in January 2002.
"The more I see out there," Mr. Sibley, a state senator from Waco, said of California, "the more I like what we did."
The Texas law, signed in 1999 by Gov. George W. Bush, remains untested, but the crisis in California has not yet prompted any official second-guessing. The Texas Legislature convened today, and Mr. Sibley predicted that the law would remain intact. The prevailing view among many officials, and one shared by some energy analysts, is that California simply had a bad plan.
"California's deregulation program may have been sound in concept but was clearly flawed in execution and in many ways a victim of circumstances," said Steven Taub, associate director with Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm based in Massachusetts. "We should not fear deregulation." 
The fundamental difference between Texas and California boils down to simple supply. Karl Stahlkopf, a vice president at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research organization funded by the utility industry and based in California, said California had a surplus of electricity until recent years. But as demand gradually outstripped supply, California did not respond by building new power plants. Partly because of tough environmental regulations, Mr. Stahlkopf said, California has not built a major plant in more than a decade. A new plant is scheduled to begin operating in June.
Texas, by contrast, has a power surplus. Since 1995, the state has built 22 new plants, with 15 more scheduled to come on-line by 2002. Texas is also unique among the contiguous 48 states in having its own power grid and thus falls outside federal regulation. 
As a result, Texas is self-sufficient, while California must buy electricity from neighboring states. Texas officials also say it takes far less time to build a plant here than in California. 
"It's easier to do business in Texas than in California," Mr. Stahlkopf said. "You've got a much simpler regulatory climate and much fewer hoops to jump through." 
Environmentalists are far less powerful in Texas than in California, but they did win concessions when the deregulation bill was being debated in 1999. The new generation of plants, fueled by natural gas, are cleaner. But the law also includes a mandate that existing plants reduce emissions as much as 50 percent. 
When the delegation of Texas officials made its fact-finding trip to California in early 1998, the primary focus was on the structure of the state's deregulation plan. Texas had already deregulated its wholesale market in 1995 but officials were moving slowly in the retail market. Besides California, they visited New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Britain, to study deregulation.
In California, Mr. Wolens recalled meeting with Steve Peace, a suburban San Diego state senator who played a large role in crafting the deregulation bill. At the time, California officials remained enthusiastic about their program but were apparently not blind to the possibility that unforeseen problems could arise.
"He advised us that it was an experiment," Mr. Wolens said. "He had the prescience to tell us to learn from their mistakes." Patrick Wood, chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, said several aspects of the California plan raised concerns, notably the requirement that utilities must buy power on the wholesale market through a centrally controlled bidding process. The plan also mandated that utilities buy power only through short-term contracts, leaving them vulnerable to upturns in wholesale prices.
"Everybody on the Texas side of the table was mystified by that," Mr. Wood recalled. "It didn't sound like a deregulated marketplace to us." 
In response, Texas has set up a very different system. There is no central bidding pool and companies can enter into long and medium-term contracts to hedge against price inflation. The law also established a "price to beat" system, modeled partly after Pennsylvania's, that will automatically reduce by 6 percent the prices that existing utilities can charge. This rate is essentially locked in for five years, and is intended to invite competition from new providers. Texas officials consider this crucial since a problem in California was that most customers did not switch providers and create a competitive market.
Texas officials and energy analysts are confident their plan will work, particularly since supply is not a problem. Mr. Wood said that the transition would not be painless but that the regulated system already had its own problems. 
"Look, there will be things that don't work," Mr. Wood said. "But they really don't work under regulation. What we've got today isn't great." 
Jim Marston, head of Environmental Defense in Austin, helped negotiate the Texas plan and the provision mandating the pollution reduction. He believes the law will generally result in lower prices but that fluctuations brought on by harsh weather or spikes in natural gas prices may be greater. Because of that, he cautions about any premature celebration.
"I'm sure the people in California really thought they had thought of everything," he said. "I know they did. What we haven't necessarily done is think about the problems we don't know about yet."

HEADLINE: Mississippi House Wants Voters to Decide Fate of Confederate Emblem on State Flag 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Throwing one of the most contentious issues in the South to the voters for the first time, the Mississippi House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly today to call a statewide referendum for April 17 on whether to replace the Confederate emblem in the corner of the old state flag with a neutral circle of white stars.
 The decision, which is expected to be approved by the State Senate in a few days, means that for the first time in memory, there will be a full-fledged political campaign and vote on a symbolic but deeply emotional issue that has riven several states in the South. Last year, a divided South Carolina Legislature removed the Confederate battle flag that had flown above the Statehouse for 38 years, and even now, the Georgia Legislature is engaged in a dispute over whether to replace the Confederate symbol in its state flag. 
 But only in Mississippi will the voters themselves be asked to decide the issue, and it is far from clear what they will do. Supporters of the Confederate symbol on the flag, which the state flies even though it is not the official one, sounded confident that in the privacy of polling booths, voters would keep the old flag, an action that even a majority of like-minded legislators was unwilling to take. Opponents of the flag, including many of the state's black leaders, said they believed that the state was ready to move beyond the old divisions and create a symbol of consensus.
"The voters of Mississippi want to move forward and do great things," said Robert G. Clark Jr., the speaker pro tempore of the Mississippi House and a leader of its black caucus. "I have a feeling enough Mississippians will want to cherish the past but move to the future, and I'm hoping that the present flag will become a historical flag."
Mr. Clark acknowledged that had the issue been put to a vote in the Legislature, the Confederate symbol would have stayed on the flag. As a result, he said, opponents of the symbol decided to take their chances with a referendum. Today's vote in the House was 120 to 1. Supporters of the referendum included all but one of the 34 black caucus members. The opposing vote was cast by State Representative Omeria M. Scott, of Laurel, who objected to wording in the legislation that would allow the old flag to become an official historical flag, instead of being discarded.
Many state residents had objected over the years to the flag, with its familiar red-and-blue St. Andrew's cross in the upper left corner, but last May the issue moved to the top of the state's agenda after the State Supreme Court ruled that the flag adopted in 1894 was not really the official flag. In 1906, the Legislature forgot to readopt the flag in a full codification of the state laws, the court said, and it had flown unofficially since then.
After the ruling, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove appointed a commission to design a new flag, and last month, in the wake of heated public hearings, the panel came out with its proposal: a flag with three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue, and in the corner, or canton, a circular pattern of 20 stars on a blue background, representing the order of the state's admission to the union. The stars would replace the Confederate cross that now sits in the canton. 
Aware that the new design would be unlikely to pass in the Legislature, the commission recommended the referendum, a cause that was taken up enthusiastically by Confederate supporters and reluctantly by opponents. Greg Stewart, a Tunica lawyer who has helped organize support for the Confederate symbol, predicted that the old flag would be preserved by an overwhelming margin.
"It won't even be close," said Mr. Stewart, a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. "This is the only way we can save our Southern symbols -- by taking the matter away from the politicians and giving it to the voters, who are pure and can't be bought. It should have gone to the voters in South Carolina, too."
Several large religious denominations, along with business groups, have come out in favor of the new design, and the state's political establishment is expected to do the same. Proponents of the new flag are likely to emphasize its importance for the state's business community, and black leaders like Mr. Clark are already hinting that they may call for economic pressure on the state if voters retain the old flag.
An economic boycott of South Carolina by the N.A.A.C.P. was instrumental in bringing attention to that state's flag issue, and the possibility is now being raised in Georgia. Several civil rights groups have said they will work to begin a boycott of the state if the Confederate battle symbol that now dominates the Georgia flag -- placed there in 1956 at the height of the conflict over desegregation -- is not removed in this session of the State Legislature.
While Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia has tried to remain neutral on the matter, legislators in both houses have introduced bills to redesign the flag, and a vote could come in the next week or so. United States Representative John Lewis, an Atlanta Democrat and a veteran civil rights figure, has said he will join a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the flag, while Andrew J. Young, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a former mayor of Atlanta, said recently that changing the flag was not as important as issues like education.

HEADLINE: Ads Now Seek Recruits for 'An Army of One' 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
 In the most sweeping revision of its marketing practices in two decades, the Army this week will scrap its memorable advertising slogan, "Be all you can be," and replace it with one intended to appeal to the individualism and independence of today's youth: "An Army of one." 
 Based on research showing that young people view military life as dehumanizing, the motto will be the centerpiece of a $150 million campaign that uses slick commercials, a new logo and an interactive Web site, goarmy.com, to bolster the Army's recruiting programs, which have missed their goals two of the last three years.
It all kicks off when the Army premieres the first of its new commercials not during a Sunday football game, as might have been the case in the past, but during the popular NBC sitcom "Friends" this Thursday night. The Army has been criticized for broadcasting too many advertisements during televised sporting events, and the choice of "Friends" is intended to help broaden its audience and shake off its stodgy, male-only image. The commercial will also appear during "The Simpsons" on Fox and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" on WB, among other programs, and on MTV, Comedy Central and Channel 1, which is broadcast in high schools. 
The 60-second spot, produced by the Army's new advertising agency, Leo Burnett U.S.A. of Chicago, tries to counter what Army officials said was the widespread perception among young men and women that soldiers were faceless, nameless cogs in an impersonal military machine.
The commercial features a lone corporal running across the barren terrain of the Mojave Desert at dawn. At one point, a squad of soldiers runs past in the opposite direction; later, a Blackhawk helicopter flies by overhead. But the corporal never veers from his solitary path, panting under the weight of his 35-pound pack as his polished dog tags glint brilliantly in the rising sun.
"Even though there are 1,045,690 soldiers just like me, I am my own force," the corporal, Richard P. Lovett, says. "With technology, with training, with support, who I am has become better than who I was."
"And I'll be the first to tell you, the might of the U.S. Army doesn't lie in numbers," Corporal Lovett continues. "It lies in me. I am an Army of one."
It might seem incongruous for the Army, which for two centuries has trained its recruits in the art of selflessness and unit cohesion, to promote itself as an incubator of self-actualization. Indeed, in recent decades many military officials have come to view the armed forces as a redoubt against unbridled individualism. 
But Louis Caldera, the departing secretary of the Army, who initiated and championed the marketing makeover, said that no one should be worried that the Army is advocating self-centered behavior.
"They are going to get the ethic of selfless service, duty, honor and country in basic training and in every unit they are assigned to," Mr. Caldera said. "But you've got to get them in the door to try selfless service. And you've got to let them know that even though it is about selfless service, they are still individuals."
Mr. Caldera said the campaign would de-emphasize benefits the Army has long promoted in its recruiting literature, including college tuition and signing bonuses, because its marketing research showed that many young people were already aware of those benefits.
The research also showed that many adults of prime recruiting age, 18 to 24, wanted swifter gratification from signing up.
"It's a me-now group," Mr. Caldera said. Partly for that reason, the Army coined a second slogan for the campaign, which is intended to promote the possibilities of eventually marketing military training to the private sector: "212 different ways to be a soldier." The number refers to training specialties.
Mr. Caldera, 44, who has a master's degree from Harvard Business School, made revamping recruiting and marketing a priority when he became secretary in July 1998.
That year, the Army fell short of its goal of 72,550 enlistees by 801; in 1999, it missed its target of 74,500 enlistees by 6,290. In 2000, however, the Army barely surpassed its goal of 80,000 enlistees, by 113. The goal for 2001 is 78,950.
Pentagon officials have attributed their recruiting problems, which have hit all the services except the Marine Corps, to several factors: more high school graduates attending college, a booming economy and a decline in the number of people of prime recruiting age.
But a study commissioned last year by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen suggested that some of the blame lay with the Pentagon itself. The study recommended that the Army, Navy and Air Force articulate clearer images to potential recruits, do more research into currentattitudes and rely less on advertising during sporting events. 
Under Mr. Caldera, the Army created a four-person marketing office at the Pentagon. It hired McKinsey & Company and RAND to review marketing practices and conduct an extensive survey of potential recruits. And it ended its 13-year relationship with Young & Rubicam, hiring Leo Burnett last summer to be its lead advertising agency. Leo Burnett's clients include McDonald's, Walt Disney and Coca-Cola.
Army officials said the marketing data showed many young people wanted to be part of "something bigger." But many also held negative perceptions of the military, including that soldiers cannot date, have no free time and spend most of their time in the mud.
And the research suggested a cultural divide, with many saying they did not know or could not identify with anyone in the armed forces.
Patrick Lafferty, a vice president with Leo Burnett, described one typical view of the Army this way: "It's people unlike me. And if they're not like me, I don't want to be part of it."
In part to address those perceptions, the Army has tried to personalize its advertising by using real soldiers instead of actors. On its Web site, potential recruits will be able to click on photographs of soldiers and hear them talk about themselves and Army life. Future commercials will also depict soldiers confronting problems, and challenge viewers to solve those problems, with the answers to be posted on goarmy.com.
Army officials said their market research also suggested that the Army needed stronger "brand-name" identification. The result was a new logo, a white star with gold and black edging. Army officials said that there were no plans to incorporate the logo into uniforms but that it would probably be woven into running gear and other Army products.
Mr. Caldera said it was unlikely that "Be all you can be," which was created 20 years ago this month and remains one of the most identifiable slogans in advertising history, would be completely dropped. 
Leo Burnett's one-year contract, which can be renewed annually for three additional years, calls for the firm to receive bonuses if the Army exceeds its recruiting goals. The Army has budgeted $150 million for the entire campaign in the current fiscal year, which ends in September. But it has declined to disclose the size of Leo Burnett's fees.
When Leo Burnett was first hired, the Army was accused by some critics of not doing enough to recruit minority-owned advertising firms. Forty percent of soldiers belong to minority groups. 
In part to address that concern, Leo Burnett hired two minority-owned subcontractors, Cartel Creativo, a Hispanic-owned agency, and IMAGE USA, which specializes in marketing to African-Americans. 
Some of the new material will also be tailored to minority communities, with, for instance, certain commercials appearing on Univision and Telemundo, the Spanish-language television networks.
The Army also made a point of featuring mixed-race soldiers in some of the advertisements. Corporal Lovett is of Panamanian and Native American descent.
Mr. Caldera said he had no plans to brief advisers to President-elect George W. Bush about the marketing campaign, saying he was confident they would like it. 
"It would be capricious to come in and say, gee, I've got to change it just because there is a change in administration," he said.

Nokia Sales Report Rattles Communications Shares
Shares of telecommunication equipment makers plummeted after Nokia released figures that pointed to a slowdown in global demand for mobile handsets, raising the possibility that the ultimate size of the market could be smaller than analysts had originally predicted.
 Nokia estimated that 405 million handsets were sold worldwide last year, a 45 percent increase from the previous year but short of analysts' expectations for sales of 420 million. The American depository receipts of Nokia fell $3.81, to $39.31. The A.D.R.'s of Ericsson, another mobile-phone maker, declined 56 cents, to $10.81, while shares of Motorola dropped $1.06, to $20.69.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL: ON THE GIANTS; 
Mister Rogers? He's Over and Out

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
All of pro football is dazzled that Jim Fassel has remade himself and resurrected the Giants' season. If they only knew how annoyed it makes Fassel that they think he has changed at all.
 Well, it used to annoy Fassel. For weeks after making the Nov. 22 playoff guarantee, Fassel has vehemently, repeatedly tried to convince everyone that he was a fiery, courageous, risk-taking guy all along. 
 The more he was called Mister Rogers, the more his face grew red. One day last month, in a very un-Mister Rogers tone of voice, Fassel turned and said, "You know, I hate that."
But in the time since he has been transformed from a desperate soon-to-be-unemployed coach to some enigmatic combination of John Wayne at the Alamo and Joe Willie Namath at Super Bowl III -- with a neat haircut and preppy clothes -- Fassel has been an interesting study in self-analysis, image-making and how it can motivate players.
One other thing: he has changed. And it's not what he has been saying, it's a quantifiable change in coaching leadership. He will hate this, too, but Mister Rogers became a little mean.
It's been a couple of weeks now since Fassel stopped trying to convince everyone he was acting in character when he took the bold, perilous gamble of guaranteeing a berth in the playoffs for the Giants. As Fassel found himself feeding off the self-imposed pressure, he coached differently. He attacked in games and snapped at his players in practice.
"It's not that this is a new me," he said. "But maybe I was guarded about some things publicly. I represent a big organization. I try to be responsible. But maybe I should have let more of me out sooner. Maybe I finally listened to myself more. That's what my gut said I had to do."
Some people would call that a survivalist instinct. Fassel could have been fired in five games. He decided he wasn't going down timidly, or for that matter, alone.
And that's where the changed man's storyline has its meat. Because two days before Fassel made his guarantee, he did something that may have had as big an effect on the Giants' turnaround as his now famous playoff promise.
He cut Bashir Levingston. Big deal? Levingston was a kick returner, a reserve cornerback and a gunner on the punt team. But when Levingston made three pivotal special-teams mistakes in the Giants' dreary game with Detroit -- the Giants' last loss -- Fassel had Levingston clean out his locker the next day.
The locker room is a players' sanctuary. Coaches don't spend much time there. In baseball, they call this room a clubhouse, and that's a good term for it in any sport.
So when one member of the club arrives one day and starts throwing his things in a big garbage bag and heads out the door, the shudder is felt from locker to locker. The message in this case was made stronger two days later when Fassel got the rest of the special-teams players together in a room and angrily informed them that they could all be joining Levingston in the ex-Giants club with one more bad game.
"Coach Fassel made it very clear he meant that," said linebacker Jessie Armstead, who isn't even on special teams. "You saw those young guys on special teams get kind of wide-eyed."
Fassel as the bad guy had other ramifications. Emboldened by the coach's tough talk, Armstead stepped up his own motivational message to his teammates. Fassel threatened some jobs. Armstead, in so many words, just threatened.
"The whole thing started to snowball," defensive end Michael Strahan said. "We all started taking more control."
When some of the wide receivers were jabbering in the offensive huddle during the next game, quarterback Kerry Collins told them to shut up. When there was more talk in the huddle a few plays later, Collins screamed in his teammates' faces.
"You don't talk in Kerry's huddle," running back Tiki Barber said last week. "That's the way it is. It's not allowed."
Week by week, the Giants took on a roguish attitude and demeanor. The atmosphere around the team began to change noticeably. And Fassel started to relish his growing reputation as a guy losing his marbles. Teetering on the top floor of a skyscraper, with one foot dangling over the edge, Fassel was asking for somebody to give him a push.
Pressure? "I love it," he said.
When people asked about how he had changed, he would smile and say that tomorrow he planned to show up wearing an eye patch and riding a Harley. When someone referred to his Namath-like guarantee, Fassel said, "I left my fur coat outside."
Now, seven weeks ago today, could there have been any more incongruous comparison possible than Jim Fassel and Joe Namath?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mister Rogers has left the building.

HEADLINE: Deportation, and Family Ruin; 
Immigrant Breadwinners Are Held Far Away for Years

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
When Congress passed sweeping legislation in 1996 mandating that all immigrants who had been convicted of crimes be deported, it said it intended to rid the country of even legal immigrants who had committed crimes. 
 The implications for those immigrants were straightforward, but as the laws have been enforced, the consequences for their families in this country have begun to sink in, often with painful results. 
 Tens of thousands of the immigrants have been deported, and many others have been sent to federal prisons or some 225 remote jails around the country used by the Immigration and Naturalization Service because of low costs and available bed space. They had been convicted of crimes both minor and major, some of which had been committed long before 1996. 
Many of those awaiting deportation do so without basic legal representation. Before 1996, almost all the immigrants now in custody would have been allowed to remain in the country. 
Some families recognize that it is appropriate that their relatives are punished for their crimes, while others maintain their innocence. But nearly all of them say that the circumstances of their detention -- held in jails hundreds of miles away and often without regular communication -- make the challenge of holding a family together all the more difficult.
The effects of the laws on immigrant families have perhaps been felt most acutely in New York, which has more immigrant residents than anywhere else in the country.
In Brooklyn, Min Wen Zheng has been trying to hold her family together since her husband was arrested in August 1997. Without the $2,000 a month her husband earned as a kitchen worker in a Chinese restaurant, she has had to rent out one of the rooms in her three-room apartment in Sunset Park to a boarder to help pay the rent. She has borrowed cash from relatives over the last two weeks as she waits impatiently for the garment factory where she earns $5 an hour to call her back to work. 
"Our life has collapsed," she said.
Her husband, Wei Yeung, 38, was convicted of helping to smuggle Chinese immigrants into the country and served 12 months in prison. Since then, he has been held nearly two years by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Oakdale, La., in deportation proceedings.
Although Ms. Zheng and Mr. Yeung are able to talk on the telephone, the last time she saw him was in August 1999 when she traveled to Louisiana with their sons.
During the visit in prison, Ms. Zheng and her husband told their two boys that he was working in a factory. "They are young, only 6 and 7," said Ms. Zheng, 34. "I tell them their father is working far away. When they grow up I will try and explain." 
Alone and unemployed, she worries most now that her husband will be deported. Deportation, she said, will destroy her family completely, since China imposes lengthy prison sentences on smugglers.
"If Mr. Yeung is sent back to China, he will be scooped up and sent to a labor camp where he will bust rocks for years," said his lawyer, Craig Wilson.
The accounts of immigrants who have had their lives turned upside down by this legislation are many. Antoni Runierc, an immigrant from Poland who arrived in the United States in 1980, watched from a jail cell as all he had built -- a stable home, a job and a place in American society -- vanished because of his 1995 arrest for driving a car with stolen plates. Mr. Runierc, 48, says the car belonged to a customer of the auto body shop where he worked in Amherst, Mass. But because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony, he faces deportation. 
After his conviction, the bank foreclosed on his house. His wife filed for divorce so she could receive public assistance. And his children have spent the last five years without him.
He has shuttled between six I.N.S. detention centers and, when he last called a reporter collect, was in the Hudson County Correctional Center in South Kearny, N.J. 
His wife supports their three children as a nurse's aide in Massachusetts, he said. After spending $3,000 for a lawyer, he could not keep paying those fees and lost representation. He is still awaiting a ruling.
"In the meantime," he said in an interview, "everything my wife and I built for ourselves in this country has been taken away from us. We are ruined. My oldest daughter is being treated for depression. My two younger children, at this point, do not even know their father." 
The immigration agency has asked Congress to amend the law. I.N.S. agents have also begun to back away from a strict interpretation of the statutes in an effort to temper the impact of the law on some of those convicted and their families.
Russell A. Bergeron Jr., the director of media relations for the I.N.S., said the agency's field offices would begin "exercising prosecutorial discretion" in certain cases where longtime legal residents have been deemed deportable and where they can no longer expect relief in the immigration courts.
"While we hope the exercise of this discretion will reduce the incidents of families' being separated under these circumstances," Mr. Bergeron said, "we still believe that the best remedy is to amend the law so immigration judges can once again review the cases of those individuals who are deserving of a possible second chance." 
An effort to rescind some of the harsher provisions of the laws collapsed when the Republican leadership in the Senate decided to adjourn for the year without passing the legislation, which unanimously passed in the House in September. The new bill would have halted the deportation of immigrants who had committed crimes in the years before the act was passed. The decision was a body blow to many immigrant families.
"We have documented beyond any refutation the terrible harm that this bill has done to people who, having once committed offenses, turned their lives around and became responsible residents," Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a fierce critic of the 1996 laws, said in a statement. 
Many of the families have lost not only their primary wage earners, but also the vital anchors that two-parent families provide to their children, who are especially vulnerable because of financial, linguistic and cultural difficulties.
The strain on the immigrant families left to make their way after their relatives have been detained for prior offenses has not been eased by the fact that there have been widespread complaints about the conditions in which their relatives are imprisoned.
For years, there have been complaints and lawsuits alleging abuse and deprivation at the often small county jails in which their relatives are kept. Lawyers and other advocates for the detainees have asserted that many immigrants held in the jails have been beaten, forced to live in unsanitary conditions or denied access to lawyers.
Late last year, the I.N.S. said it was going to start to enforce uniform basic standards at the institutions that hold the detainees, who number as many as 20,000 on any given day. The new standards cover everything from visitation rights to grievance procedures.

HEADLINE: Whitman Keeps It Personal in Trenton Farewell 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
She came to this city in 1994 with no reputation, no record and no experience in elective office beyond two terms on the Somerset County Board of Freeholders.
 But her annual address to lawmakers here today bore the indelible stamp that Christie Whitman has put on the governorship in the years since then: She made the afternoon both rather grand and rather personal. 
 The grandiosity was lent by about 10 minutes of video clips, costing $8,900 and paid for by the state, showing the governor in a montage of photo opportunities set to uplifting music: Mrs. Whitman taking her first oath of office in 1994, shaking hands with players at a ball park and flashing her big, lopsided grin and cheerful thumbs-up from the cab of a locomotive. 
At the same time, Mrs. Whitman showed her knack for personal contact with people not only by having her daughter, Kate, introduce her, but also by saluting particular citizens for work they had done for the state during her two terms. There was Harry Kels Swan, who has lent his vast collection of Revolutionary War artifacts to Washington Crossing State Park, representing the governor's proposals to spend more on parks. There was Andrea Baden, a former welfare recipient who is now employed and independent, symbolizing the cuts in welfare rolls during her administration. 
And there was Dana Christmas, the student at Seton Hall University who was badly burned helping others escape the dormitory fire there a year ago. Mrs. Whitman's critics have poked fun at the governor over the years for seeming to let the aloof manners of her privileged life show through her public persona. But when Ms. Christmas climbed stiffly to the stage, the marks of her burns on her face, the hugs and kisses the two women exchanged seemed heartfelt enough to produce one of the relatively few standing ovations of the afternoon.
The longest and loudest applause erupted not when Mrs. Whitman itemized her triumphs or saluted heroic New Jerseyans in the audience, but when she turned to thank the man who would succeed her if she leaves to join the Bush administration, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the State Senate president.
Mr. DiFrancesco blessed the applause with a pontifical wag of his upturned hand.
Even before Mrs. Whitman began to speak, the focus of attention and ambition under the pink domed ceiling of the War Memorial auditorium had shifted to Mr. DiFrancesco, who will become acting governor if Mrs. Whitman is confirmed as President-elect George W. Bush's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency later this month.
Mr. DiFrancesco, who hopes to be elected in his own right in November, took pains to say this afternoon that he would not begin making his own proposals for running the state "until we move to the other side of the Capitol," where the governor's offices are. But the legislators and lobbyists who packed the hall were already watching and talking about him. 
"Donnie would have been a better governor seven years ago than she is now," Dan Tauriello, a banker, said loyally.
Mr. Tauriello said he was worried about the debt the state has assumed since Mrs. Whitman came to office seven years ago, a theme the opposition Democrats sounded as well today.
But Mrs. Whitman focused on the positive today. She said she was leaving with a catalog of accomplishments, from increasing prescription services to the elderly to preserving hundreds of thousands of acres of open space. As usual, she used numbers to drive her points -- the number of children lifted from poverty, the number of dollars saved from tax cuts, the number of new jobs created during the long economic boom that eased so many of her administration's economic programs into being.
"We are the home state of Nobel laureates and innovative geniuses, of electrifying performers, inspiring teachers and gifted writers," Mrs. Whitman said, speaking from a text on the teleprompter. "We are the crossroads of the American Revolution and the proving grounds of the high-tech revolution." 
She had plenty of friends in the hall. William E. Best, the director of the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority and a Whitman appointee, praised the governor for the work she did for the cities, both in providing seed money for new investment and by making it easier to develop old, often polluted industrial sites.
"I think the governor has made New Jersey a national leader in urban policy," Mr. Best said.
Yet the divide that remains between city and suburb in New Jersey was also on display today, in two school choirs that performed at each end of the program. The student choir from Public School 26 in Paterson, an old textile city, did not have a white face in it as it sang the national anthem. The choir from the Upper Freehold Elementary and Middle School, in suburban Monmouth County, did not have a black one.
The singers from Upper Freehold were responsible for leading the audience in a tribute to Mrs. Whitman, written by Paul Solyok, a teacher a their school and sung to George M. Cohan's "It's a Grand Old Flag."
"By some chance of fate, in this great Garden State, we are run by someone who's first rate," the children set out, singing the song through twice. 
Although the spectators had the sheet music handed to them by ushers as they entered, no one joined in.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
M.I.T. Performs A Hat Trick In Recruiting

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
The dance begins in hotel suites and at cocktail parties. It continues by phone and e-mail messages. And it finishes, for a lucky few, with an exhausting few weeks of cross-country travel, with stops in Cambridge, Chicago and Palo Alto, Calif.
 All the while, the nation's top business schools and the most sought-after doctoral students in finance, management and a host of other subjects are sizing one another up. By spring, the schools converge on a handful of young stars with job offers. Some schools go bust, unable to fill an opening with a prized candidate. Now and then, though, a school hits the jackpot. This is precisely what the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did last year. 
 In arguably the most competitive field -- finance, where Wall Street firms also try to woo Ph.D. students -- M.I.T. landed three of the top students. It beat out Harvard, New York University, Stanford, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania and about a dozen others. "For any school to get three of the top candidates in one field in one year is a real coup," said Bill Broesamle, the director of M.B.A. programs at the University of California at Los Angeles.
The achievement even came with an unusual bonus: all three of their new finance teachers were women. At a time when business schools are struggling to catch up with law and medical schools in increasing their female enrollments, the feat gave M.I.T. a nice recruiting tool.
It also coincided with a resurgence of female appointments to male-dominated finance departments after a decade-long slowdown. "It was the year of the woman," said Kenneth French, an M.I.T. finance professor who helped recruit the three. 
In the past, Professor French added, "there have been top women, but never this number." At the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, for example, two of the three new junior faculty members in finance are also women.
Still, across the country, only 23 percent of business school teachers are women, up from 18 percent a decade ago and 10 percent two decades ago, according to the International Association for Management Education. The numbers are lower among full professors and at top schools like the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., where 16 percent of the faculty is female.
M.I.T.'s new finance teachers are Jun Pan, a native of China who has doctorates in physics and finance; Anna Pavlova, a native of Russia, who received a Ph.D. in economics from Wharton; and Antoinette Schoar, a native of Germany, who wrote her dissertation at Chicago about the decline in productivity at companies that diversify.
They chose M.I.T., they said, because of its faculty and its location. And they chose offices on the same drab hallway in Building E53 so none would find herself isolated. "We're all economists," Ms. Pavlova said. "We colluded."
The job market that the three found waiting for them bears little resemblance to most overcrowded academic fields. Business schools are flush with money after the long bull market, and openings outnumber qualified candidates at many of them.
That disparity has helped drive up starting salaries. For finance professors, the biggest beneficiaries, these have risen to about $150,000 from $110,000 five years ago, professors said.
In the mid-1990's, said David M. Kreps, the senior associate dean of academic affairs at Stanford Business School, "Wall Street was paying a lot of money for rocket-science finance; to keep the people we wanted to keep, we had to pay more."
The recruiting season begins in the fall, when Ph.D. students who are nearing the end of their dissertation send out recommendations and transcripts to potential employers. "Then you wait," Ms. Pan said.
It was particularly bumpy for Ms. Pan, who had already been rejected by M.I.T. -- her first choice -- in 1995 when, as a disaffected graduate student in physics at N.Y.U., she began applying to finance programs. Last year, she applied again -- and never got a response.
So when she heard that a friend had received a call from M.I.T. to schedule an interview during the annual meeting for finance experts, Ms. Pan recalled, "I called and said, 'Maybe you forgot my name.' They said, 'No, you're not on the interview list.' "
The next day, however, she got an e-mail message from M.I.T. that spelled out the happy reason: the school was so impressed with Ms. Pan and her dissertation on risk aversion among options investors that it decided to invite her to give a talk to the M.I.T. faculty without going through the traditional interview first.
For most strong candidates, the interview schedule at the annual finance meeting -- which was held in Boston a year ago -- is grueling. Ms. Schoar, for example, sent out 18 applications in the fall of 1999, and every one of the schools wanted to interview her in Boston. So she sat down for a rapid-fire series of half-hour interviews during the 72-hour conference. 
She returned to Chicago, where she was then a student, with the flu, which her boyfriend said came from all the hands she shook. But it seemed to be worth it: Ms. Schoar received invitations from all 18 schools to visit their campuses. She said no to two foreign schools and then spent much of the winter bouncing around the country, presenting her paper on productivity.
"You basically don't do anything else for two months," said Ms. Schoar, who received a job offer from all 16 schools she visited.
It seems exotic. Famous institutions buy expensive plane tickets for graduate students, and long-revered professors practically plead with them to accept jobs. Indeed, Ms. Pan, Ms. Pavlova and Ms. Schoar all said they were grateful simply for the chance to meet so many leading people in their field.
But the driven, highly focused minds that gravitate to academia rarely treat the trips as miniature vacations. When Ms. Pavlova flew to France for interviews at Insead, a business school in Fontainebleau, for example, she turned down the chance to spend a Saturday night in Paris, opting instead to stay in the suburbs and work on a paper on import quotas.
"They asked for clarification several times," Ms. Pavlova said. "They kept saying, 'Are you sure you don't want a hotel room in Paris?' "

HEADLINE: Proposal Could Leave Only a Little Bit of the Sky for the Also-Rans 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Since May, when United Airlines announced its $4.3 billion bid to take over US Airways, the conventional wisdom in the airline business has been that if regulators approve the deal, the domestic airline industry, now dominated by six airlines, would shrink to three mega-carriers.
 But the American Airlines plan to buy some of the US Airways' assets and take over the faltering Trans World Airlines has convinced many experts that the chance of a third airline's challenging United and American will be slim if the complicated set of deals is consummated. 
 The very antitrust authorities that American and United have designed their deals to placate will have difficulty approving agreements among Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines, analysts said. 
"There is no question that American and United want to form a Big Two," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive and an architect of deregulation who now teaches at Harvard Law School. "Both have had the ambition to be, if possible, numero uno, but realize that if they can compete with each other on equal terms and everyone else on unequal terms, they are still better off." 
After days of speculation since news of the transaction emerged over the weekend, American intends to announce its plans at a news conference in New York today. The boards of the UAL Corporation, United's parent; T.W.A.; and the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, all met yesterday to approve the moves. 
American has agreed to pay United $1.5 billion to buy 86 jets and 15 gates at six East Coast airports and to jointly operate the lucrative Boston-New York-Washington shuttle.
It has also agreed to buy a 49 percent stake in DC Air, a carrier created to operate many of US Airways' assets at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. 
American will also take over most of T.W.A.'s assets for $500 million after the 75-year-old carrier declares bankruptcy today for the third time in less than a decade. "What this flurry of activity does," Mr. Levine said, "is present a question of public policy that hasn't been addressed before. Deregulation was about getting government out of questions of industry structure. The idea was you would use the antitrust laws as an interventionist tool when monopoly was threatened. This is more subtle because it is really about competitive advantage without monopoly."
The deals are meant to address competition concerns raised by Justice Department officials reviewing United's bid for US Airways. But it would also leave the archrivals United and American roughly the same size, with each carrying about one-quarter of all domestic passengers.
And each would be much larger than Delta, Northwest and Continental, which together carry about 35 percent of domestic passengers. United and American would compete with each other for lucrative corporate contracts but would have a major advantage over the three other major airlines. 
"In the airline industry, he who has the biggest network wins," said Steven A. Morrison, an economics professor at Northeastern University who has written widely about the industry, "because passengers and the firms that business travelers work for would prefer to deal with a carrier that goes to all the places they go."
As the third-largest airline behind United and American, Delta is eager to keep up and has said that it has not ruled out making a deal of its own. But investment bankers and analysts said it had few places to turn. It could pursue America West or Alaska Airlines, but those much smaller carriers would not add that much to Delta's existing route network.
Its most attractive partner is Houston-based Continental, which it tried to buy in 1998. But according to a recent agreement, Northwest has the power to block a takeover of Continental unless it is involved in some deal first. 
"The only way Delta can make a major counterresponse right now is to buy Northwest," said one investment banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. But that would get strong opposition in Washington, he added. 
Delta might be able to figure out a way to get Northwest's permission to bid on Continental, but that deal, too, would face opposition from regulators. Delta, Northwest and Continental are all healthy airlines, but T.W.A. and US Airways are seen as weak competitors that might fail unless they are taken over.
Gaining a long-term competitive advantage is the only rationale that some analysts can see behind United's and American's moves. Mergers in the heavily unionized airline industry have often been highly disruptive. Few of the dozens of deals since deregulation have ended up being profitable. 
Every airline in the industry has taken at least one hard look, and some two or three, at T.W.A. over the last decade as the once venerable airline declined. All passed because T.W.A. was seen as a lot more trouble than it was worth. 
Its unions are well entrenched and unwilling to permit the kind of wage and job cuts needed to make T.W.A. a profitable low-cost carrier, said several airline executives. The airline's major asset, its hub in St. Louis, is shared with Southwest Airlines, the country's largest and most successful low-fare airline. That has kept fares down, robbing T.W.A. of the premiums rival airlines receive at hubs where Southwest does not fly.
Since investors got wind of the proposed deal, AMR stock has fallen 11 percent. Yesterday, it closed at $38.94 a share, down $2.56. UAL stock has fallen nearly 7 percent over the same period, closing yesterday at $42 a share, down $1.06. US Airways stock is up slightly, closing yesterday at $42.69, up $1.31, but it is still trading far below UAL's offering price of $60 a share.
T.W.A. shareholders are expected to receive nothing out of the deal because of the bankruptcy. The airline's shares have been suspended on the American Stock Exchange since Friday. 
American thinks it can make money in St. Louis by connecting T.W.A. with American's larger route network and using it to relieve congestion at O'Hare International in Chicago, a hub it shares with United. 
"They've got a structure that makes sense," said one person close to American's plans. "T.W.A. has a hub in St. Louis that is looking for a network."
But critics fear that United and American will use their increased size to pry customers away from Delta, Northwest and Continental and to bully low-fare competitors, even one as large and successful as Southwest. 
"The problem with industry consolidation is that the number of monopoly markets increases," said Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies for large corporate buyers of air transportation. The big airlines then threaten to revoke discounts in markets where they have a monopoly unless the company signs a contract to fly with them in markets where they compete against smaller rivals. 
"That is how these two mega-carriers are going to siphon business away from Northwest and Delta in Minneapolis, Detroit and Atlanta," Mr. Mitchell said. 
Yesterday, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, wrote to the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, expressing concern over the dominance American would have at Kennedy Airport if its planned deals were approved. 
He said that together, United, American and Delta would control more than 83 percent of the airport's domestic traffic. American alone would control more than half the traffic and three of the airport's nine terminals, posing a threat to low-fare competitors like ATA and JetBlue Airways. 
"Without the ability to expand and compete at J.F.K.," Mr. Schumer wrote, "these low-cost carriers's operations in the New York City market will be harmed and their survival could be jeopardized."

HEADLINE: Bush Is Pressed to Keep Trade Negotiator in His Cabinet 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush has come under pressure to maintain cabinet rank for his top trade official, with lawmakers and business leaders arguing in unusually strong language that any downgrading of the position might cripple the nation's chief trade negotiator at a critical time.
 The idea of stripping the trade representative of cabinet rank, a status the position has carried since the mid-1970's, was floated by senior Bush advisers last week and was effectively confirmed by Mr. Bush on Saturday. Bush aides said today that the president-elect had not made up his mind on the matter. 
 The change in status is seen as a way to give Donald L. Evans, Mr. Bush's choice for commerce secretary, greater purview over foreign trade. Officials involved in the Bush transition had said that the president-elect wanted to keep his cabinet relatively small and to concentrate decision-making authority in fewer top administration officials than was the case in the Clinton administration.
But the idea was quickly and vigorously attacked by lawmakers and business lobbyists who said that a demotion would undercut the trade representative in negotiations with foreign partners and might cause other nations to think that the new administration considered trade a relatively low priority. The top trade officer in many other countries and regions, including the European Union and Japan, is a minister with cabinet-equivalent rank.
The office of the United States trade representative is a White House agency, not formally a part of the cabinet. But Congress has endowed the office with statutory authority over trade matters and treats the trade representative as the most senior trade official other than the president. In recognition, every president since Jimmy Carter has invited the top trade official to sit with the cabinet.
Representative Bill Thomas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said through a spokesman that he had been assured that the president-elect did not intend to downgrade the post.
"Chairman Thomas spoke with high-level officials on the team and was given assurances that it would not happen," said Trent Duffy, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee. But Mr. Duffy declined to say who made those assurances, and people involved in the Bush transition said the president-elect had yet to rule on whether he would keep the trade representative in his cabinet.
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, also said today that "no decision has been made" about the trade representative -- either the person who will hold the post or the position's status. But he suggested that concerns about a possible downgrading had been heard.
"It's a position that will have to fight throughout the world for the president-elect's free trade positions," Mr. Fleischer said. "And the president-elect has every intention of moving on that position to afford it the priority it deserves."
As recently as Saturday, Mr. Bush appeared to confirm that he was considering a downgrade, though he emphasized that the position would remain a vital one.
"Whether or not the person is called cabinet or not, it will not in one way or another diminish the position," Mr. Bush said.
The reaction against such a move has been furious and bipartisan. Mr. Thomas weighed in strongly on the issue, his spokesman said. Senator Max Baucus, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said through a spokesman that he was "100 percent, absolutely opposed to the idea" and would "go to the mat" to fight it.
Thomas Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said he had called several senior people in the Bush camp to express his alarm. "I told them that there is just no reason to fight on this issue," he said. "Diluting the power of this person is just a tremendous mistake."
Charlene Barshefsky, Mr. Clinton's trade representative, called any such move "absolute folly." She said the top trade officials of America's leading economic partners would be "dumbfounded" if asked to negotiate with a United States official who held lesser rank, especially because the United States is often viewed as the power most eager to expand trade between nations.
It is unclear how closely tied the decision about the job's status is to Mr. Bush's thinking about whom to choose to fill the trade slot, the only senior economic member of his team the president-elect has yet to name.

Advising on the Transition
 ROBERT L. KING, the chancellor of the State University of New York, has been named by President-elect George W. Bush as one of 31 members of the education advisory team for the presidential transition. The team will work with RODERICK R. PAIGE, the superintendent of schools in Houston, who has been nominated as secretary of education. Other members of the group are LAMAR ALEXANDER, a former education secretary and presidential contender; the education scholars DIANE RAVITCH and CHESTER FINN; and the Rev. FLOYD H. FLAKE. Chancellor King said, "Serving on this panel will provide the opportunity to share our views on the importance of higher education to the growth of the national economy." 

For Clean, Safe Schools
The Healthy Schools Network, a coalition of environmental, health and educational organizations, and Cornell University's workplace health and safety program have released the second edition of a guide that provides parents with information about a variety of health hazards that are potentially present in schools, including poor air quality, toxic chemicals, structural dangers and fire hazards. The publication, the Environmental Action Guide for New York State Schools, calls for new standards to protect schoolchildren's health and provides instructions in recognizing symptoms of illnesses caused by environmental hazards. The guide is available through the network's Web site, www.hsnet.org.

CUNY Officer Is Leaving
The City University of New York is losing its chief operating officer, DAVID H. FREED, who is leaving to become president of Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. A former president of Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J., Mr. Freed was part of the new senior management team at City University assembled last summer by Chancellor MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN. The university has begun a national search for a replacement.

Internships With a Developer
The Durst Organization, a major New York City developer, awarded nine students from eight Manhattan public high schools 18-month internships on Monday. The students will work in various disciplines in the development of the company's $100 million six-story, 500,000-square-foot NYCyberCenter building on 57th and 58th Streets between 11th and 12th Avenues. The building will house not people, but machinery, including computer servers and routers. The students will be learning from contractors and other professionals in areas like information technology, mechanical engineering, architecture and design, structural engineering, leasing and marketing and corporate communications. The internships will begin in March, and students are to work 10 hours a week during the school year and 30 hours over the summer. KATE ZERNIKE, EDWARD WYATT, KAREN W. ARENSON and LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

Getting Fiscal

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
If Milton Friedman weren't still alive, he'd be spinning in his grave. His legacy has been betrayed -- not by big-government liberals, but by the conservatives about to take power. 
 Nowadays Mr. Friedman is mainly famous as an apostle of free markets. But through much of his career he was best known as the champion of the conservative doctrine known as monetarism. Basically, monetarists wanted to get the government out of the business of short-term economic management. First and foremost this meant rejecting the use of fiscal policy -- discretionary tax cuts or spending increases -- to fight recessions. 
 By and large this was an argument that the monetarists won on the evidence. Few economists now accept Mr. Friedman's further view that even monetary policy should be placed on cruise control. Alas, it turns out that a stable money supply is no guarantee of a stable economy. But almost all economists now agree with the position that monetary policy, not fiscal policy, is the tool of choice for fighting recessions. 
Almost all economists, that is, except those who have been or hope to be tapped for jobs in the new administration. Indeed, it's remarkable how thoroughly George W. Bush's people seem to have been converted to a crude Keynesian view of economic policy -- a view that, it just so happens, offers them another justification for a tax cut that even moderate Republicans think is excessive.
The latest exposition of that view came from Mr. Bush's choice as chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, who last weekend stood Milton Friedman on his head, declaring that monetary policy is ineffective and fiscal policy reigns supreme. Here's what he said: "Let's contrast the typical credit card borrower on monetary policy versus fiscal policy. The interest rate cut of last week helps the typical credit card borrower about two bucks a month, two dollars a month, whereas Mr. Bush's tax cut for a family making $40,000, gets a $1,600-a-year tax cut, 32 bucks a week. That's a much bigger heft." 
You have to admire Mr. Lindsey. It's not often that an economist manages a triple play. But he did it: his statement was specious on three distinct levels. 
First, he exaggerated the impact of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut on ordinary families. Most families would get far less than he suggested; independent estimates indicate that on average even families with an income of $50,000 would get only half as much tax relief.
Second, he loaded the comparison by comparing the full impact of tax cuts with only one minor effect of interest rate reductions. Won't lower rates (which can, incidentally, be reduced much further) also reduce mortgage payments -- not to mention the burden of debt on corporations? 
Finally, and most important, he misrepresented the way interest rate cuts work. Their main effect on demand isn't via a reduction in the payments people make on the debt they already have; lower interest rates work by stimulating investment, that is, by inducing businesses and individuals to borrow more, or to put their money into real assets instead of parking it in bonds. That's how rate cuts led to recovery from the last recession even while Bill Clinton was raising taxes.
It was a remarkable display of bogus economic analysis. It would be alarming if the new chief economist believed any of the things he said. But we needn't worry; this was merely a cynical attempt by someone who knows better to build support for that tax cut. After all, Mr. Lindsey would have defended that cut even if the economy were still booming. 
Still, Mr. Lindsey's remarks were not a good omen.
One little-noticed but important virtue of the Clinton administration was its honesty in economic analysis and reporting. In general -- and in contrast to some of their predecessors -- Mr. Clinton's economists avoided misrepresenting the facts, using convenient but specious arguments, or employing scare tactics to sell their policy ideas. 
But it's already clear that henceforth things will be different. It seems that the incoming administration regards it as perfectly acceptable to say things that are demonstrably untrue, and even to abandon conservative economic principles, if by so doing it can sell its preferred policy.

HEADLINE: Mr. Giuliani's Last Opus 

 BODY:
In his final address on the state of New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani compared himself to Giuseppe Verdi writing "Falstaff," in which the maestro included every theme he could imagine. It was an apt comparison. In his rambling but entertaining two-hour speech, the mayor covered lots of territory, both emotional and otherwise. He made a pitch to burnish his record in fighting crime and boosting the city's economy. But he also tried to take some of the hard edges off his mayoral legacy before it is too late. In contrast to previous years, Mr. Giuliani praised others, talked about progress being a team effort and worked to defuse some of his more explosive past criticisms. 
 His most compelling proposals came in the areas of education and housing. He promised to continue his valuable battle to give the next mayor control over schools, thereby ensuring political accountability for education. He proposed adding weekend schooling, a concept that could be especially helpful to those children who can use all the time they can get with skilled educators. He ladled out a series of inviting promises from enhanced school libraries and athletic fields to speedier construction of 12 schools in unnamed areas. But he also vowed to promote vouchers, a more troubling concept that is not supported by most of the city's political leaders or educators. 
 Mr. Giuliani's plan to expand low-income housing, an area in which he has previously done very little, looks like a promising step toward relieving a growing housing gap. He proposes to spend $600 million over the next four years in order to leverage another $600 million in private investment for housing. The proposal came with ambitious plans to reform the city's building code and rid the construction industry of organized crime.
Mr. Giuliani also offered a nicely tailored reworking of last year's plan to sell off the Board of Education offices in Brooklyn and build something smaller and more stylish. He promised an important early start to the Brooklyn Bridge Park, which now has money and crucial political support from Gov. George Pataki as well. The mayor also gave a nudge to a promising proposal for Manhattan's West Side, with a football stadium for the Jets that converts into an expansion of the Jacob Javits Convention Center. So far, however, neither the mayor nor the Jets has come forward with a financing plan that spares taxpayers the bill.
The mayor's long speech, oddly, made no mention of some critical tasks he must face. Although his housing and education proposals will help minorities, he still needs to cultivate better relations with minority communities. He should also consider peace negotiations with Governor Pataki, his fellow Republican. Completing labor negotiations with teachers, police and other city workers now toiling without a contract would present the next mayor with an easier passage. Mr. Giuliani also needs to revamp the city's voting system and provide extra protections for the watershed. He has promised to be "very aggressive" in his last year, but he has only a few short months to push through the last pieces of his agenda.

HEADLINE: CALLS FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHEDULING OF THE SCHOOL DAY 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
The newest educational mantra may as well be: Never let them leave the building.
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York wants Saturday classes. The state's governor, George E. Pataki, says students should stay in school until after dark. And in California, Gov. Gray Davis plans to tack 30 days onto the academic year -- stretching it by 17 percent -- for middle school students who have fallen behind in an era of mounting expectations. 
 The proposals, made in recent days during the annual parade of politicians' speeches on the state of their respective domains, add to a mounting sense that America's school schedule -- which was based not on educational needs but on those of an agrarian economy -- should be ripped up and redrawn. 
"Our traditional school calendar has simply outlived its usefulness," said Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a public policy research group based in Washington that published a paper last summer on the concept of all-day, all-year schools.
"This ideological limit on what schools can do and when they can be open is so clearly a remnant of the past," Mr. Teixeira added. "Twenty years from now, we're going to look back on the way schools are today and have been for a long time and think, 'How could anyone possibly believe that system would work?' "
In the last four years, federal financing for after-school programs has skyrocketed to $846 million from $1 million. At the same time, millions of schoolchildren have been sent to summer school: nearly one in five in the nation's large urban districts were in class last July. Year-round schools, which sprinkle vacations throughout the year rather than have a long summer break, now serve about 2 million of the nation's 52 million students. And many of the 2,000 charter schools that have sprouted across the country since 1990 are luring families in part by offering longer hours.
Meanwhile, Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, has called for a fifth year of high school for those who are struggling, and Richard W. Riley, the secretary of education, has suggested making teaching a 12-month job, largely to make more time for professional development. Teachers' unions generally support this idea.
The trend is powered by a troika of sociological forces: more parents working outside the home; research showing that children get into trouble during the late afternoon and lose educational ground during summer breaks; and the higher standards that have been embraced from coast to coast over the last decade.
Support for the more-time movement is broad and bipartisan, but considerable obstacles include the enormous price tag and the gaping teacher shortage. Educators and politicians also caution that more of the same is not necessarily better, and that expanded calendars must be filled with creative curriculum overseen by qualified personnel.
The Knowledge Is Power Program in Houston and the South Bronx, which has won national recognition for high test scores and has been showcased by President-elect George W. Bush, requires attendance from 7:25 a.m. until 5 p.m., two or three Saturdays a month, and several weeks in summer.
"When we started, everyone thought we were nuts -- now everyone wants to do it," said David Levin, principal of the program's New York outlet. "Excellence requires sacrifice. That's a value that's essential to be successful in any endeavor. When you put in all this extra time with kids, they don't get the sense that you're just punching the clock."
The call for increased time in school began in 1983 with the landmark "Nation at Risk" report, but the volume was turned up in 1994 with a pair of papers, by the Department of Education and the Carnegie Corporation, that focused specifically on the calendar. "Time should be adjusted to meet the individual needs of learners," the federal report said, "rather than the administrative convenience of adults."
Since then, the pressure has only mounted, as virtually every state has adopted more rigorous curriculums, and many have introduced tough exit exams. With teachers and principals being held accountable for results on standardized tests, many have complained that they cannot cram more into already crowded days.
"We have asked more of our students and schools than ever before," Governor Davis said in his speech Monday night. "Educators tell me that for all the new investments we've made, the main thing they need is more time to teach."
In part, the motivation is international competition: a 1990-91 study showed that the average number of required school days in the United States, 178, fell behind that of 16 European and Asian countries, many of whose students outperform Americans: Italy, Israel, Germany, Japan, Taiwan and Korea all had more than 200 days; China had 250.
"If we want American kids to catch up with kids who learn more in other countries, American kids might need to spend more time learning like kids in other countries do," said Chester E. Finn Jr., an education official in the Reagan administration.
Noting that most juvenile crime and teenage pregnancies occur between 3 and 6 p.m., and that thousands of children spend those hours parked in front of TV sets, Mr. Finn added, "For an awful lot of kids, school is a more salubrious environment than where else they're likely to be spending their time."
But time is money.
Many state legislatures have rejected proposals to add days after considering the bottom line. The California plan would cost at least $770 per student per year -- or $900 million annually once it was fully implemented in three grades. Mayor Giuliani's proposals, to send 45,000 students to weekend science classes, and 45,000 new immigrants to English immersion workshops, would cost an estimated $34 million a year -- for only 8 percent of the city's students. Governor Pataki wants to double his $15 million allocation for after-school programs, but that would bring the total number of children served to just 40,000.
"It's going to be very expensive, and we have to be prepared to pay for it," said Diane Ravitch, a pre-eminent educational historian.
Many politicians and educators believe that now is the time to try, since states are swimming in surpluses and the public's interest in education is at an all-time high. But a parallel problem comes in finding people to fill the classrooms for all those extra hours. The nation needs 2.5 million teachers by 2010 as it is.
"Whatever you do, you're going to need the committed, trained and talented people to execute these reforms," said Mr. Levin of the Knowledge Is Power Program, KIPP. "The danger is that the reforms themselves could be devalued."
Another debate is over content. Researchers say the longer day and year should be used to address students' varied learning styles, and to add enrichment activities, like theater.
"We don't believe in repeating what teachers are doing during the day," said Lenore Neier of the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, which runs school-based programs for 11,000 children, featuring plays and journal writing, among other activities. "It's literacy made fun."
Jose Hernandez, a KIPP eighth grader, said he appreciated the Saturday and summer sessions because "you get more opportunities to learn." As for the politician's proposals, 13-year-old Jose said added time should not be used for recreational activities that children could do on their own, but for productive ones. "If," he explained, "it's like anything that could help us in the future."

HEADLINE: A Teacher's Gift 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 At a time of unrelenting criticism of the public schools in this country, it is refreshing to read Thomas L. Friedman's moving, though belated, tribute to his high school journalism teacher, who died last year ("My Favorite Teacher," column, Jan. 9). 
 If others gave proper credit for the life-changing or life-enhancing contributions of their public school teachers, it might help refocus the education debate from the politically and economically motivated diatribes to matters of more substance, like the relationship between student and teacher. 
It is time for others who understand the value and purpose of public education to speak of its importance for creating effective citizens in a democratic society.

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Leader Calls for Hastening Bush's Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader, called today for a rapid reduction in income tax rates to help head off a recession, giving a lift to President-elect George W. Bush's proposal for a broad package of tax cuts.
 In a memorandum to Republicans in the House, Mr. Armey said the party's priorities should be a reduction in all income tax rates -- the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's plan -- and expanding individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement savings plans, a measure that overwhelmingly passed the House last year only to die in the Senate. 
 The cuts, he said, should be enacted promptly and should be retroactive to the start of this year. Mr. Bush's aides are considering accelerating their $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan, which as first formulated would not take effect until 2002. 
Though they have made a big tax cut a primary goal, Republican leaders in Congress have been lukewarm until now in their support for an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates, in part because most benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers. Many Republicans have indicated a preference for measures like repealing the federal estate tax and giving a tax cut to married couples. 
But the bad economic news in recent weeks has provided Mr. Bush with an argument in favor of rate cuts, one that Mr. Armey expanded on today.
"It is vitally important that Congress move quickly to enact a pro-growth tax cut that could help avert a recession," he wrote. "Some are arguing that we should put off the income tax rate cut until later in the year. I disagree. The income tax rate cut must move first, whether alone or as part of a larger tax-cut package."
Democrats have blocked most Republican tax-cutting efforts over the past few years. Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the party's leader in the Senate, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, signaled today that they remained opposed to the approach advocated by Mr. Armey.
But with the economy slowing and the federal budget surplus continuing to grow, opposition to tax cuts among Democrats is softening, and Democratic leaders are considering offering their own tax-relief packages, possibly built around a reduction in the bottom income tax rate of 15 percent.
"There is a growing sentiment that a tax cut may very well be necessary," said Michael Siegel, a spokesman for Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee. 
But, he added, Democrats would insist that any tax cuts be "reasonable, equitable and not interfere with our ability to pay down the debt, shore up Social Security and Medicare and provide a prescription-drug benefit to seniors."
In one indication of changing attitudes among Democrats toward tax cuts, Felix G. Rohatyn, the financier and former ambassador to France, said last week he believed a substantial tax reduction now would be good economic policy.
"It would not be a bad thing to have a reasonable tax reduction now," he said, "not so much because it will stimulate the economy overnight, but because taxes are relatively high and we can afford a tax cut of one kind or another."

HEADLINE: School Officials See Tough Task In Creating Sixth Class Day 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Board of Education officials said yesterday that they were scrambling to meet the February deadline set by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to add a sixth day of school for nearly 84,000 struggling New York City schoolchildren.
 Even so, the officials said, the board will probably be able to get the program only partly under way. 
 The mayor's proposal, unveiled in his address Monday on the state of the city, would bring about the biggest mobilization of teachers, students and resources since the board instituted mandatory summer school in 1999. Several officials said that although the plans for a sixth day of extra English, science and mathematics classes had been discussed with Mr. Giuliani over the last few weeks, they were stunned to hear that the mayor wanted to carry them out by sometime next month. 
The weekend program would provide remedial instruction on either Saturday or Sunday to 45,300 8th through 12th graders who are lagging in science and math and to 38,600 immigrant students who are failing to learn English.
Education advocates, while enthusiastic about the concept, warned yesterday that the scheduling presents a logistical nightmare. Within a few weeks, the board will have to recruit about 5,600 teachers qualified to teach math, science and English as a foreign language; provide a strong curriculum; and notify students that they have been selected to attend. Just opening a building requires the presence of custodians, security guards and principals. The plan calls for the use of 503 school buildings, about half the citywide total.
One school district official, who spoke yesterday on the condition of anonymity, said the board had not yet sent out any directives telling local officials how to proceed. "Telling everybody to come to work on Saturday is not going to be easy," the official said. "It's too much, too soon. This could be a disaster."
Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor for education, said that Mr. Giuliani and his staff had had conversations with Chancellor Harold O. Levy and his staff about the proposals for several weeks, and that the mayor expected the chancellor to have the program "up and running by February."
But Mr. Levy, in an interview yesterday, said that while he expected to begin the weekend sessions sometime next month, he was not committing to opening the full program all at once. "It was announced yesterday," Mr. Levy said. "It isn't as though we started working on it yesterday. On the other hand, it's not going to be done overnight. The goal here is to have a quality program as soon as possible."
Of opening the 503 schools, he said, "We will do as many of them as is feasible and sensible."
Although the Giuliani administration said a sixth day could be added without any contract negotiations, Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, hinted yesterday that she would make an issue of it. Ms. Weingarten, who is now in labor negotiations with the city and the board, said she had sent a letter yesterday to Mr. Levy and to James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, demanding details of the sixth-day plan.
"If you want to do the same old same old, then there's no bargaining issue here," Ms. Weingarten said. "If you want to do something that really tries to create value-added course work for children on weekends, then there are bargaining issues."
Ms. Weingarten predicted that it would be hard to attract first-rate teachers, noting that for years, the biggest shortage of licensed teachers has been in math, science and bilingual education.
She noted that in proposing his program for math and science, Mr. Giuliani had cited international studies showing that students in the United States lag behind those in many other countries.
A closer look, she said, would show that the difference is not in the time spent on instruction, but in the quality of instruction, including how well teachers prepare, polish and master their lessons.
Mr. Coles said the National Academy of Sciences had agreed to advise the city on the math and science program. Board of Education officials said students would be urged to attend if they had scored in Levels 1 or 2, the bottom of four levels, on the state's eighth-grade math test, or if they had failed the math and science requirements for high school graduation.
At Mr. Levy's urging, Mr. Coles said, the mayor agreed to open the program to some students who wanted enrichment, rather than remedial education.
The science and math program is expected to cost $25 million a year, and the English-language program $9 million, including an additional summer session for 10,000 students struggling to learn English.
Raymond Domanico, senior education adviser for the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a network of churches and civic groups, said the three hours a week of English instruction proposed by Mr. Giuliani was a significant addition to the 45 minutes a day of English now required by bilingual-education programs in city schools. Often, he said, children get as little as 15 minutes a day of instruction in English.
For his final year in office, Mr. Giuliani, in his annual address, also promised to spend $31.5 million to create libraries in 21,000 classrooms in kindergarten through eighth grade; to open a high school military academy in the Bronx; to create in-school suspension centers for 45,000 students, so they could continue their studies even while suspended for bad behavior; and to accelerate the construction of 12 schools.
Meyer S. Frucher, a former trustee of the School Construction Authority, said the system needed repairs and maintenance to aging and rapidly deteriorating buildings more than new construction.
"If you really look at all the underlying capital needs of the system, we are barely keeping pace with the number of seats that we lose versus the number of seats that we gain," Mr. Frucher said. "New York City has 50 percent of its schools that are 50 years old or older. So while it is a question of increasing the number of seats, it is also a question of replacing seats that are falling off line because of leaks and other issues."
Mr. Giuliani expanded yesterday on his proposal for a military high school, saying it would turn students into prime candidates for West Point, Annapolis or other military academies. "Maybe it could bring some real distinction to the New York City school system the way some of the great high schools do," he said. "The intent here is not for troubled youngsters. The intent is for highly motivated youngsters who want to be in a military academy and who want to consider the military as a long-term career as officers."
He said he hoped that the United States Military Academy would help.
But Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx said he was puzzled by the plan, which the Giuliani administration had described as an economic development initiative for the Bronx, rather than an educational one. "That isn't even 25th on my list for the borough," Mr. Ferrer said. "I don't want to appear unkind. But I don't get it." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 18, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 10 about the Board of Education's reaction to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal for a sixth day of extra English, science and mathematics classes misidentified the organization that will advise the city on the program. It is the New York Academy of Sciences, not the National Academy of Sciences.

HEADLINE: White House Acted On Global Warming 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Bill McKibben is right that global warming is our greatest environmental challenge, but he is wrong to suggest that the Clinton administration has done "nothing" about it ("Too Hot to Handle," Op-Ed, Jan. 5). 
 When we took office, economic growth in the United States was low, and growth in greenhouse gas emissions was high. 
This administration believed, however, that we could have economic growth while reducing emissions. In both 1998 and 1999, the economy grew by more than 4 percent while carbon dioxide emissions grew by less than 1 percent.
Despite strong resistance in Congress, we secured record financing to develop the clean, efficient energy technologies that can help us fight climate change. Acting without Congress, this administration started more than 50 major initiatives to improve energy efficiency and develop clean energy sources.
Our new efficiency standards for home appliances will save consumers $50 billion and avoid 225 million metric tons of greenhouse gases over the next 10 years. We also made the federal government more efficient; in 1999 alone, we reduced our yearly energy bill by $800 million. 
Eight years ago, few politicians dared take this issue on. President Clinton defied conventional wisdom and forced global warming to the center of our public dialogue. More remains to be done, but the momentum is more easily sustained if we acknowledge, rather than denigrate, the progress achieved.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton: The French Years 

BYLINE:  By Patrick Weil; Patrick Weil is a senior research fellow at the French National Center for Scientific Research, University of Paris 1-Sorbonne.

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Dear President Clinton:
 As you prepare to move out of the White House, you are no doubt wondering what you will do next. Perhaps you assume that your time as a president has come to an end, that you must now move on to other, less attractive, alternatives. I have good news for you: You may have the opportunity to be president of France. 
 Under Section 5 of Article 21-19 of the French civil code, citizens of states or territories over which France has ever exercised sovereignty or extended a mandate or protectorate may apply immediately for naturalization, without the normal five-year residency requirement. 
Arkansas, where you were born, was once part of French Louisiana. And as a naturalized French citizen, you would have the same full rights as all other French citizens. That includes running for the presidency.
Our next election is scheduled to take place in May 2002. The front runners, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac, have been obvious candidates for such a long time that many French citizens are looking for a promising outsider. The media have been asking about a likely "third man" in recent opinion polls; your name didn't come up, but that's only because almost nobody knows that you could soon be eligible.
Of course, to become a citizen, you must fulfill a few legal requirements. You will need an official residence in France. (Paris is probably less expensive than Chappaqua.) And you will need to speak French. (Pas de probleme: Political French is filled with words that are familiar to you. "Election." "Globalisation." "Recession.") But you will be happy to know that France will not require you to renounce your American citizenship.
Mr. President, if elected, you would find the French presidency affords many advantages. Should you have a majority in the Parliament, you would enjoy much more power than as an American president. Should your opposition win a majority in the Parliament and make your life difficult, you would not have to tolerate it for long. At a time of your choosing, you could dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections. I bet you would have liked to do that with the last United States Congress. And you could be reelected every five years without end. There are no term limits for the French presidency.
You should know that as head of the French state, you would be required, now and again, to utter rather harsh words about America. The United States is a close ally of France and Europe, but also the main economic rival. Like most politicians, however, you will not have to mean what you say. You need only appear to be standing up to the Americans.
There remains only one problem: You will have to apply soon. The time-lag for processing a naturalization application is almost as long in France as it is in the United States. Of course, the French naturalization service could choose to honor you with an expedited processing of your application -- just as they do with top soccer players or other athletes before important international championships.
If you do end up facing delays, I suggest you remind French officials of the words of Marcel Prelot, the French senator who introduced the law that now enables you to become France's next president: "I pray that the Senate make a generous gesture, that it tell those who come from a land which was once French, that France their mother considers them as having been her children, and that at the instant they want to return to the fold, they will be entirely welcome."
President Clinton, welcome to Paris!

HEADLINE: A Welcoming Midwest Bids Clinton Goodbye 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
President Clinton hit the road today in a farewell tour of the Midwest that retraced some of his steps from the 1992 campaign and sought to highlight how far the country had come over the course of his presidency.
 "When I came here -- unbelievably almost nine years ago now -- our economy was profoundly troubled and our society was divided," Mr. Clinton told a spirited crowd of 12,000 packed inside the basketball arena at Michigan State University. "Think about where we are now and where we were eight years ago." 
 Mr. Clinton first rolled past East Lansing, Mich., in the bus tour in 1992 that campaign strategists considered key to his victory that November. Michigan State was also the site of the third of his presidential debates in 1992, a town-hall encounter in which he outshone his two opponents, President George Bush and Ross Perot.
Just 11 days from the end of his presidency, Mr. Clinton acted very much like a candidate today, shaking every hand he could and soaking in the applause. At Michigan State, he posed on stage with the men's basketball team and likened the players' competitive spirit to his own.
"If you play any game in life long enough, once in a while somebody will sink a three-point shot, falling backwards with your hand in their face," Mr. Clinton said. "It will happen if you play any game long enough -- the equivalent will happen to you. It is not fatal. The only thing that's fatal is quitting."
Mr. Clinton reminded students that college graduates were earning less than $26,000 when he took office, compared with more than $36,000 today. And he recited a litany of economic indicators that he said had moved in the right direction since he left the governor's mansion for the White House.
"This is about more than the statistics," he added. "It's about more than money. I think there is a new feeling in America of possibility."
Instead of a single farewell address, Mr. Clinton has opted to deliver numerous goodbyes. He heads to New Hampshire on Thursday to acknowledge that state's key role in reviving his flagging campaign in 1992.
Before he leaves office on Jan. 20, he will also drop by Little Rock, Ark., where he first entered politics as attorney general.
Mr. Clinton tonight returned to the same hotel ballroom in Chicago where he celebrated his clinching of the Democratic presidential nomination on St. Patrick's Day in 1992. Hundreds of his supporters turned out for a rally at the Palmer House Hilton that was heavy on nostalgia.
"I remember marching in the St. Patrick's Day parade in Chicago," Mr. Clinton said. "Most people were waving all five fingers. A majority of people gave me their votes and I knew then it was just a matter of time."
Earlier, the president stopped at a Chicago elementary school to promote his administration's education record. With a multiracial cast of schoolchildren behind him, Mr. Clinton said he hoped future politicians would continue his proposals to renovate schools, recruit teachers and improve student performance. "As I leave office I don't want America to let its concern about education reform and improvement to abate," he said.
Then, Mr. Clinton offered one more sentimental goodbye.
"It's doubtful I could have become president without the support I received from the people of Chicago and Illinois," he said. "We began way back in 1991, nine years ago, when only my mother thought I could be elected president."

HEADLINE: Consumers Holding Off On Buying Computers 

BYLINE:  By CATHERINE GREENMAN 

 BODY:
CATHERINE DAWKINS had visions of bulky computer boxes dancing in her head when the holidays rolled around last year. Planning to surprise her husband, Peter, with a shiny new 600-megahertz, Pentium-chip desktop, Ms. Dawkins, of East Northport, N.Y., spent part of an early December weekend configuring different hardware setups at the Dell Computer Web site. 
 On Christmas Day, however, Mr. Dawkins unwrapped only a few books and some miniature toy trains from his wife. Although Ms. Dawkins had found a desktop she liked at the Dell site with an attractive payment plan, she ultimately decided to forgo the big purchase. 
 "My husband said, 'That would have been great, but I'm glad you didn't,' " Ms. Dawkins said. "Our computer runs, though not as fast as we'd like, but it felt better to save our pennies rather than go into debt for faster Internet service." 
Unless you are a Tom Hanks character stranded on a Pacific island, it would be pretty hard to miss the rumblings about slagging sales in the personal computer industry -- especially over this past holiday season. Whether because of a sense of economic uncertainty or the fact that so many people already have PC's and don't feel the need to upgrade, Ms. Dawkins was far from alone in her decision. 
"People just aren't buying PC's," said Stephen Baker, vice president of technology products at PC Data, a research firm in Reston, Va. In early January, PC Data released a report saying that retail revenue from PC sales last month had declined almost 30 percent compared with December 1999 revenue. "A lot of PC's were sold over the last couple of years, and there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to buy right now," Mr. Baker said. 
But does the slowdown mean anything for consumers? Does the fact that people have steered clear of the computer aisles mean exciting deals for those who venture into them? The answer varies, depending on whom you ask. 
As spring spring approaches, computer manufacturers and retailers typically clear their shelves of older inventory to make room for new models, and some analysts say the slow holiday season has resulted in inventory levels that are higher than usual. 
"Inventory rates were much higher than in past holiday seasons because demand was overaccounted for by manufacturers and retailers," said Matt Sargent, senior industry analyst at ARS Inc., a research company in La Jolla, Calif., that tracks retail inventory. "This will prompt a need to clear out a lot of stuff."
PC manufacturers and retailers have been slow to commit to significant price reductions. "We have no price cuts planned at the moment, but we're going to continue to do everything we can to stay competitive," said Brad Williams, a spokesman for Gateway. 
Mr. Williams said that Gateway had lowered prices on its Essential line of entry-level desktops in September and that it would continue to offer a variety of configurations and peripheral bundles. 
Chris Bates, senior marketing manager in the consumer business division at Dell, said the company is offering $100 off its Inspiron notebook line. In December, Dell also cut prices on its Latitude notebooks by as much as 20 percent. 
"We don't speculate beyond that," Mr. Bates said, "but we'll continue to provide the best value and run specials like these. One thing about selling computers directly is that it allows us to be very aggressive with pricing." 
Many computer analysts say shoppers can expect significant price reductions. "Come February, there will probably be some very good deals," said Roger Kay, an analyst at IDC, a technology research company in San Jose, Calif. "The big consumer manufacturers will need to get their 2001 lines out, and they'll get more desperate as they get closer to launch dates." 
But even price cuts of several hundred dollars might not be enough to entice consumers who have purchased computers within the last two or three years. IDC released a report early last month predicting that worldwide PC shipments would grow by only 16.6 percent in 2001, well below the 20 percent and higher averages the industry has seen in the last several years. 
"People are buying accessories for PC's instead of PC's," Mr. Kay said. "I don't think it's a matter of people waiting for the better model or price. It's a matter of not feeling that rich." 
Although consumers may see price cuts in the coming weeks, they are likely to be disguised by rebates and other offers. Peter Christy, research director at Jupiter Communications in New York, said that as in many industries, computer manufacturers are loath to advertise price reductions for fear of starting pricing wars with competitors. 
"Once an advertised price war starts, everyone can lose money," Mr. Christy said. "If they can find things that seem like a call to action to consumers while keeping the prices from going down, then they'll do it." 
One company that is advertising significant price cuts is Apple. On New Year's Day, the company lowered prices on its high-end 500-MHz G4 Server by $1,100, to $3,099 from $4,199. The company also lowered prices by several hundred dollars on its Cube and 500-MHz PowerBook. The cuts don't surprise some Mac users, who say they have come to expect lower prices before the release of newer models. 
Some retailers are hoping that the availability of broadband Internet access will lure computer users back to the stores. Laura Conover, a spokeswoman for The Wiz, said PC sales were strong over the holidays because of the high-speed Internet service The Wiz offered in conjunction with CableVision, its parent company. Circuit City, which offers cable modem access with the computers it sells in 186 stores and D.S.L. access in 141 stores, is planning to expand its high-speed offerings. 
"We are seeing that when people increase the performance of their Internet connection that they look to increase the performance of their computer," said Bill Cimino, a spokesman for Circuit City. "Broadband at retail is just starting to come into its own and this year you'll see it in much greater availability." 
Consumers who did buy computers over the holidays noticed that they got more for their money than in recent years, a trend that manufacturers say will continue. "The price of an average entry-level system in 2000 was sort of equivalent to an intermediate level computer in 1999," said Tom Kehoe, a spokesman for Dell. "As time passes, performance increases and prices decrease." 
David Lown, an investment banker in Manhattan, said, for example, that the 600-MHz Pentium computer system he bought his sister in December was both more powerful and about $450 cheaper than the 500-MHz system he bought his parents in December 1999. 
"I think the values increased at a higher percentage than they normally have over the years," Mr. Lown said, adding that he might have waited longer to buy his sister's computer because he believed prices would drop further this winter. "But when it comes to your sister or your parents and Christmas, you end up doing what's right."

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Book Clubs With a Mission

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
In a book of essays that he compiled and edited and that will go on sale next week, Tavis Smiley, the black television and radio talk show host and commentator, admonished blacks to tell themselves: "I must find someone Black for this job. I must find someplace Black to spend this money." This being a column about books, the question is, How does this challenge relate to books?
 Well, more than 150,000 people have joined a new black book club in just over a year, an almost colossal example of people responding quickly when someone meets a perceived need, in this case the desire to read fiction and nonfiction books relevant to their experiences. Clearly Mr. Smiley is onto something with his new book, "How to Make Black America Better" (Doubleday). 
 Looking through publishing's retrospective scope, this is probably not as surprising as it appears, for one of the more invigorating happenings in the industry in recent years has been the emergence of black readers as an economic force. Or, more precisely, the recognition that blacks are such a power. There are, for instance, five new or relatively new imprints in major publishing houses devoted to fiction and nonfiction by black writers on black subjects.
As important, in the fall of 1999, Bookspan, the largest book club organization in North America, started the Black Expressions Book Club. Expecting an initial 5,000 applications, it received 15,000, and now the club has grown to 150,000 members, according to Seth Radwell, president of BooksOnline.com, the Bookspan subsidiary in charge of all its online operations and its new book clubs. (Bookspan is owned jointly by Time Warner and Bertelsmann and has more than 40 book clubs, including the Literary Guild and Book-of-the-Month Club.)
Black Expressions also has a Web site, www.blackexpressions.com, which attracts about 150,000 visitors a month. The book club publishes 17 catalogs a year, one each month plus special issues. It is a traditional "negative option" club; its members automatically receive a selection each month, which they can decline, although they must buy four books every two years, at discounts from 20 to 50 percent.
The club's editor, Monica Harris, said, "We were serving an underserved market. We've made known to readers the existence of books they may not have heard about through traditional media or through normal publishing advertising." Each catalog has 24 pages.
"We are trying to make it more like a magazine," Ms. Harris said, "with author interviews, excerpts from books and guest editors and contributors." Unfortunately, as strong as Black Expressions is, the appeal of black book clubs has not yet been wide enough to allow for much diversity.
Thus the Black Literary Club, founded in 1994 to promote more serious nonfiction and literary fiction, is in search of a partner to keep it in business. It publishes a catalog four times a year, and members, about 2,000, are under no obligation to buy. Its president, Annette Leach, said the club needed 10,000 to 20,000 members to survive.
"The numbers are out there," she said, "but we probably need to become part of a publishing group to reach our target audience, especially for writers of histories and serious fiction." Which shows, if nothing else, that for the middle class, black or white, commercial and mass market sell better than literary.
There are some online services that specialize in books for blacks, in addition to the one operated by Black Expressions. The most successful is the African American Literature Book Club (www.aalbc.com), which was started in 1997 and now gets between 1 million and 1.3 million visits a month, said its founder, Troy Johnson. "We sell books, build Web sites for authors, run author interviews," he said. "We promote books because we like them, not just because they're best sellers." The club is affiliated with the Barnes & Noble Web site.
Is there a downside to these clubs and Web sites specializing in black writing? Mostly no, although one literary agent had a reservation. "I'm not sure it wouldn't take customers out of black bookstores," said Denise Stinson, who is also founder of a new black imprint for Warner Books, Walk Worthy Books, specializing in Christian fiction and nonfiction. "There's substantially fewer possibilities to sell black books. I'm not sure too many people will shop in both, clubs and stores, and if a quarter of the people who buy through clubs went to black bookstores, that would be very nice." She was, she said, just raising the question. Black Expressions was, after all, the first outside supporter for her publishing venture, she said.
Max Rodriguez, the publisher and editor of QBR: the Black Book Review, said that "a book club validates the strength of the reading public it serves; it means there's a sufficient and active buying power, and it's a very big push toward establishing African-American readers as a viable market for publishers."
Janet Hill, an editor who acquires and edits hardcover African-American books for Doubleday and heads Harlem Moon, a new black imprint at Random House Inc., said, "It's too early to tell if black bookstores will be hurt, but the clubs are really great for blacks who don't live near a black bookstore."
Mainstream book clubs feature only one or two black books in each catalog; the black clubs give more of a choice, covering small presses, university presses and self-published books, said Anita Diggs, the director of One World Books, a Random House Inc. imprint.
Of course black bookstores, like other independent and specialty bookstores, offer services like community meeting centers, book signings and space for readers' groups. Book clubs, on or off the Web, are not apt to change that.
There's little doubt that in the last several years many positive things have taken place in book publishing for black Americans. The next leap forward, of course, will be the appointment of a black publisher -- the person who actually writes the checks -- to head a mainstream publishing house. But that's the subject for another column.

HEADLINE: To Be Vulnerable, Gay and Gray 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "As Hard to Grow Old as It Was to Be Young," by Dudley Clendinen (Editorial Observer, Jan. 6): 
 As Mr. 
Clendinen notes, most elderly gay people live alone, and those who have lost a partner do not receive their partner's Social Security benefits, pension plans or other inheritance rights -- creating a serious economic vulnerability for them.
Senior Action in a Gay Environment is currently the only nonprofit organization providing comprehensive services and advocacy to elderly lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgendered people. In 2030, according to the Policy Institute of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, there will be four million of us in the United States! 
We must secure the long-needed changes in public policy, social services and health care that will ensure us equal and nondiscriminatory access to the same services and support that all elderly people deserve.

California Power Failure

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
In the past decade, California has become the most Democratic state in the nation. It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democratic senators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands. Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast. 
 Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubled in the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike; worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stack of chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that is making the state's hair stand on end. 
 The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities are threatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame? 
The chosen villain: deregulation. As soon as cruel market forces were allowed to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices. Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under government control. 
But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as in Russia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do. 
California's politicians deregulated halfway, which is the worst way: wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not. Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- which foolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled to buy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumers forbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden price fluctuations.
This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand. The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. But all sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of that power.
Result: upward pressure on prices, calls for rationing, utilities going broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and the danger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of the nation's product.
The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is "nimby" -- the real villain in the current supply crisis, that says "not in my backyard" to power plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain on electric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facility that offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric are the reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years.
Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in the wall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convert energy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop, air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up and produced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes out of the wall.
Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now a safe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lower the price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly is laudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without telling constituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity's household convenience. 
The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout. When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask for wholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalem to mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer only palliatives, with photo op to follow. 
Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On the moon?) and his threat to seize the assets of "price gougers" may please some new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys private incentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopeful professing to be a centrist. 
After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and present political-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressing into more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way of stimulating supply. 
Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixon speech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Inventories Grew 0.4% in November 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Inventories at wholesalers grew in November as unsold autos, paper goods and computer parts accumulated on docks and in warehouses, government figures showed today.
 Wholesale stockpiles rose 0.4 percent, matching the October increase, the Commerce Department reported. Sales were unchanged after a 0.1 percent decline in October. 
 Slower consumer demand, which is causing inventories to grow and leading to sluggish manufacturing, signals that the economy's expansion is limping toward its 10th anniversary in April. Automakers have cut output as stockpiles of vehicles on dealer lots have risen. Altera, the computer chip maker, and Bowater, the biggest United States newsprint maker, recently announced cuts in production.
Slower growth prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark overnight interest rate earlier this month to give the economy a boost.
As sales slumped and stockpiles rose, the inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures the time goods sit at wholesalers, held at 1.31 months in November, the government reported. That is the highest since 1.32 month in April 1999, figures showed.
Wholesale stockpiles of electrical equipment rose 1 percent in November after October's 2.7 percent increase. Those inventories are 15.7 percent higher than they were in November 1999, government figures showed.
Wholesale inventories of all durable goods like imported automobiles and electrical equipment rose 0.3 percent, the same as October. Sales of durable goods rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.3 percent the previous month.
Inventories of nondurable goods like food and paper rose 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent increase in October. Sales of nondurable goods fell 0.1 percent after a 0.2 percent increase in October.
Wholesale stockpiles of petroleum products rose 5.9 percent after a 2.5 percent increase in October. Inventories of food were up 1.5 percent in November after rising 0.7 percent in October. Drug inventories at wholesalers increased 1.8 percent after rising 1.3 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
New Interest in Technology Lifts Nasdaq in Late Rally

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks rallied yesterday as investors shifted out of defensive old-economy shares in a bet that cuts in interest rates would revitalize the high-technology sector.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 82.88 points, or 3.4 percent, to 2,524.18, as late buying sent the index up about 2.2 percent year to date.
 "There is the feeling that techs suffered a great deal, and you take your profits in the old economy and move into the new economy," said Milton Ezrati, a senior economist and strategist at Lord Abbett. "There is a feeling that because these stocks are down so much, valuations are more reasonable than people have seen in years and that is a tremendous temptation." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.72 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,604.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 12.47 points, nearly 1 percent, to 1,313.27. 
J. P. Morgan Chase, up $2.25, to $50.94, offered support to the blue-chips after Merrill Lynch called its stock "deeply undervalued." But capping the Dow's rally was a decline in defensive sectors like drugs, energy, retailing and manufacturing.
Investors snatched up what they saw as bargains in the beleaguered high-technology sector, including the shares of software companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Veritas Software.
Telecommunications issues, including WorldCom and Nextel Communications, and computer makers like Dell Computer, also gained, as did fiber optics companies, including JDS Uniphase.
"Some on Wall Street believe that you have to look at the glass half full, and take a positive outlook," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist for Weatherly Securities. "Clearly there could be some concern as we go through the earnings season, but you have to look forward to what will happen 6 or 12 months from now," he said.
But Nasdaq's advance, which came on heavy trading of 2.4 billion issues, was far from smooth. Cisco Systems, one of Nasdaq's most highly valued companies, fell more than 8 percent, to an intraday low of $33.64, but recovered late in the day, to finish down 88 cents, at $36.25. Traders said Cisco's stock gyrated after comments from its chief executive, John Chambers, who told a technology conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., that the current quarter was "a little bit more challenging" than expected six weeks ago because of a slowdown in capital spending. --------------------

HEADLINE: Uruguay's Chief Is Frank (and Frankly Insulting) 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay Jan. 9 

 BODY:
At 73, President Jorge Batlle likes to say he is in the Carnelli Station of life -- that is the second to last stop on the railroad tracks into Montevideo. So he has nothing to lose by speaking his mind. 
 And speak his mind he does, challenging all the taboos and sacred cows of Uruguayan politics in an impetuous style that can be charming but also shocking and insulting. 
 Eleven months into the first year of his five-year term, Mr. Batlle (pronounced BAH-zhay) is the first civilian president since the military gave up power 15 years ago to promise to search for the remains of dissidents who disappeared in the 1970's and 1980's in the wake of a nasty urban guerrilla war. He stunned the army by publicly saluting the mother of a disappeared dissident in the presidential office and pledging to take her orders. 
When Gen. Manuel Fernandez, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, suggested in a newspaper interview last year that the armed forces might eventually have to intervene in political affairs again to combat leftist extremists, Mr. Batlle fired him immediately. 
The Uruguayan president has tackled the cumbersome welfare state with plans to infuse private capital into the government telephone company and allow private imports of natural gas while using his bully pulpit to challenge Uruguayans to begin to rely more on themselves and embrace the new global economy. Defying reported death threats, he has begun to challenge powerful smugglers by overhauling the customs service.
And in recent months, Mr. Batlle has taken his audaciousness onto the world stage by becoming the first leader of a Latin American country to call for the legalization of drugs.
"I don't know if drugs kill more than alcohol or tobacco but I know they kill thousands on the battlefields of Colombia," he said in an interview in which he argued that legalization would lower drug prices and cut into the profits of the cartels. Asked what his solution for the long-drawn out Colombian civil war was, he answered, "Legalize drugs and bring Colombia into Nafta," the North American Free Trade Agreement that includes the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
Coming from a tiny cattle-producing country of 3.2 million people, Mr. Batlle's ideas are not likely to carry much weight beyond Uruguay. But he stands out in a continent where weak, uncreative leadership has become the rule in most countries over the last few years.
And at a time when Latin Americans are increasingly cynical about their governments, Mr. Batlle has a habit of driving his own car and, at red lights, shocking fellow drivers by rolling down his window and asking for their opinions. Despite a deep recession, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and a severe drought, his popularity ratings are better than 50 percent in a country known to be hypercritical of its leaders.
"I am the way I am and I am not about to change," Mr. Batlle said in an interview in which he seemed to bask in his idiosyncrasies by banging his fist on the desk, tossing a cigar across the room to a friend and occasionally making points by switching from Spanish to English in a playfully exaggerated British accent. (He speaks four foreign languages fluently, and a smattering of Yiddish learned from his childhood nanny.) 
Mr. Batlle, whose ancestors came from the Catalonia region of Spain, can get away with a lot not only because of his age, but because of his pedigree. His great-grandfather was president, as were his great-uncle, who founded Latin America's first and most expansive social welfare state, and his father. He was groomed to be president as a teenager, when his father, President Luis Batlle Berres, dispatched him to meet foreign ambassadors and represent him in other official functions in the late 1940's. His mother, who is still alive, picked out the presidential residence that he lives in today. 
Four times Mr. Batlle ran for president and lost in large part because of his habit of shooting off his mouth. But he finally eked out a victory in a runoff in November 1999.
His first major initiative was to help track down a granddaughter of the Argentine poet Juan Gelman who was born in captivity after her pregnant mother was abducted by the Argentine military and was then adopted by an Uruguayan family. Mr. Gelman did the detective work to find his granddaughter, and then Mr. Battle helped out by personally pleading with her to take a blood test for DNA identification, which showed that she is in all probability related to Mr. Gelman. 
Mr. Batlle appointed a peace commission to locate about 160 disappeared people, and has promised to take the results personally to their families. "I felt this was something the country had to confront with a clear voice," he said, comparing the issue of the disappeared to "a splinter in your foot that won't kill you but impedes your ability to walk."
Luz Ibarburu de Recagno, 76, a leader of the Group of Mothers and Family Members of the Detained-Disappeared whose son went missing in Argentina in 1976, gave Mr. Batlle cautious praise. "You don't need to do much to be better than our previous presidents, who would not even meet with us," she said. 
Congresswoman Margarita Percovich, a member of the leftist Frente Amplio opposition, said, "He's opening doors on subjects that were taboo in the past and that is good for the country." But she added, "He sometimes acts and speaks too fast and impulsively without reaching consensus first."
Mr. Batlle can also get carried away with his own glibness and say things that can be hurtful. While talking about his family history, and how his ancestors came from the Spanish fishing town and resort of Sitges, he said: "It was a better place when they lived there. Now it is full of gay Germans." 
Challenged to explain his remark, he said: "I prefer normality. I say what I believe and I am not a hypocrite. In a few words, I like women."
Told that he would certainly receive a lot of mail for his remarks, he answered: "And I will respond. I don't hide my opinions."

HEADLINE: Fort McMurray Journal; 
For a Big Job, Big Trucks and Women to Use Them

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: FORT McMURRAY, Alberta 

 BODY:
Driving the world's biggest dump truck to and from the world's biggest electric shovel might be a dream job for little boys the world over. But here was Valerie A. Wagar, gold earrings and fingernail polish in place, gripping the wheel of her Caterpillar 797B one recent afternoon as each shovel scoop dumped 100 tons of sand laced with oil into her load box.
 From her gently swaying cab, she checked her three-foot-tall side mirrors and her rear television camera, then eased her load of nearly a million pounds through an open pit mine here, controlling 3,400 horsepower with a tap on the accelerator. 
 "Heavy haulers are the best," she shouted as her 12-foot-high tires left tracks streaked with oozing oil. "You get to see a little scenery, you have wheels." 
Asked if it was a bit odd for a 46-year-old mother of two to be driving a monster dump truck that rises five stories above the ground, Ms. Wagar, a former legal secretary, replied: "If it was in another city, people would be fascinated. But this is normal for Fort McMurray."
Increasingly, 21st-century Rosie the Riveters are commonplace here, working for Syncrude Canada Ltd., the world's largest producer of oil from oil sands. Left behind by a vast inland sea, northern Alberta's oil sands here typically contain about 12 percent oil. The sands are mined and the oil is separated with hot water.
With a new oil boom convulsing this northern frontier city, women now make up a quarter of Syncrude's heavy equipment operators.
With mining becoming increasingly high tech -- as evidenced by Ms. Wagar's air-conditioned truck cab with classical piano music on the CD player -- brains are taking precedence over brawn, said Jim E. Carter, the company president. Reflecting the transformation in the work force here, a 15-minute documentary film on oil production shown at the Oil Sands Discovery Center, a regional museum, does not show a single woman's face. 
What is behind the change is an acute labor shortage as Alberta, Canada's energy province, throws itself in high gear to meet the growing American demand for oil and gas. Long the largest supplier of natural gas to the United States, Canada supplanted Saudi Arabia in the first 10 months of 2000 as its largest supplier of oil and petroleum products.
The boom is greatest in Fort McMurray, one of Canada's fastest growing cities, with a population most recently clocked at 42,000. In this frozen wilderness, a five-hour drive north of Edmonton, the provincial capital, workers arriving here confront the nation's third-most-expensive housing market -- after Vancouver and Toronto.
In a reversal of Canada's chronic south-flowing brain drain, Alberta has attracted 80,000 migrants over the last three years, some from as far away as Texas and Chile. Since the newcomers are not coming for low-paying service jobs, Fort McMurray's city pools were on shortened hours last summer for lack of lifeguards. Every eatery, from the Oil Can Tavern to the Boomtown, has posted help-wanted signs. 
To house workers, Suncor Energy Inc., an oil producer in the throes of a $1.8 billion expansion, opened the Borealis Lodge last spring, a 1,500-room labor camp that the company bills as "Canada's largest hotel." Last summer, parked buses stretched in milelong lines, waiting to shuttle shift workers to the camp. Traffic jams became so great that the oil companies helped pay to build another 25-mile access highway from town to the oil-sand production plants.
In 2000, Alberta's economy expanded by about 6 percent, and the energy-based boom has prompted grumbling in the rest of Canada about the province's "blue-eyed sheiks." 
Energy companies, flush with record revenues from last year's increases in oil and gas prices, have announced exploration and production budgets for this year running into the billions of dollars.
But the labor shortage threatens to keep drilling contractors from meeting their goal of increasing the number of gas wells drilled in Western Canada this year by 44 percent, to almost 10,000. Desperate for 3,000 apprentice roughnecks, contractors have advertised in 250 rural newspapers across Canada, posting their new toll-free number: 1-800-RIG-WORK.
Contractors prefer rural workers who know how to weld, fix machinery, and work outside in the cold. Here in Canada's northernmost city of substantial size, winters regularly record temperatures of 40 degrees below zero. But, working against employers, modern Canada now is more urbanized than the United States. So the companies are turning to previously overlooked groups, luring elderly workers out of retirement and setting goals to double aboriginal employment. 
In Fort McMurray, the boom is fueled by technological advances that have lowered extraction costs from the vast oil-sands deposits to around $10 a barrel, slightly above local costs for discovering and producing oil the conventional way, with wells. 
"You have to mine two tons of material to make a barrel of oil," Mr. Carter, Syncrude's president, explained in an interview here. "Because we have economies of scale, we use the largest scale equipment you can get."
By working with Caterpillar, Syncrude and Suncor dreamed up what some people here call "Franken-trucks" -- $3 million dump trucks that can carry 380 tons, or six times the loads of the wimpy mining trucks of the 1970's. 
Fully loaded, Syncrude officials say, a Caterpillar 797 weighs as much as two DC-10 jets. Last August, when Syncrude opened its new Aurora mine here, part of a $5.3 billion expansion, a 797 drove past a reviewing stand with a hand-painted "Just Opened" sign on the back. In a flash of mining humor, the truck dragged empty oil drums behind instead of newlyweds' traditional cans.
As if Gulliver had been transported to the Canadian North, Ms. Wagar barely ducks her head to walk below an axle of her idling truck, checking the oil and brakes. With each tire weighing six tons, a new set of six costs $140,000. Tire changing takes place in the garage, a building that looks like an aircraft hangar.
Hoping to make truck drivers behave like gentle giants, the mining companies teach new recruits to scan terrain with their two external television cameras before engaging the automatic transmission. In a safety video, a 797 crushes a passenger car like a bug.
"For the girls here, the opportunity to operate a heavy hauler means money, excitement," Ms. Wagar said before driving off in what she calls "a small house on wheels." Noting that one of her sons operates heavy equipment for Syncrude while the other cooks in a restaurant, she said, "I know it's not for everyone, but I wanted to have the opportunity."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Judge's Ruling on School Financing 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from yesterday's ruling by Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court requiring the state to change its formula for financing schools: 
 The court holds that the education provided New York City students is so deficient that it falls below the constitutional floor set by the education article of the New York State Constitution. The court also finds that the state's actions are a substantial cause of this constitutional violation. 
 With respect to plaintiffs' claim under Title VI's implementing regulations, the court finds that the state school funding system has an adverse and disparate impact on minority public school children and that this disparate impact is not adequately justified by any reason related to education. . . . 
A capable and productive citizen doesn't simply show up for jury service. Rather she is capable of serving impartially on trials that may require learning unfamiliar facts and concepts and new ways to communicate and reach decisions with her fellow jurors. To be sure, the jury is in some respects an anti-elitist institution where life experience and practical intelligence can be more important than formal education. Nonetheless, jurors may be called on to decide complex matters that require the verbal, reasoning, math, science and socialization skills that should be imparted in public schools. Jurors today must determine questions of fact concerning DNA evidence, statistical analyses and convoluted financial fraud, to name only three topics.
Defendants argue that passage of the Regents Competency Tests -- which measure the reading, writing and mathematic competency required of eighth to ninth graders -- is a sufficient indicator that a student is capable of voting or serving on a jury. . . . The court was not persuaded by this testimony. . . . Beyond voting and jury service, productive citizenship implies engagement and contribution in the economy as well as in public life. . . . An emphasis on the economic needs of society requires that this court look at the current and projected labor needs of the state of New York in general and the needs of New York City in particular. However, the labor needs of the city and state must be balanced with the needs of high school graduates. For example, while the greatest expansion in the local labor market might be composed of low-level service jobs, such jobs frequently do not pay a living wage. A sound basic education would give New York City's high school graduates the opportunity to move beyond such work. 
Poverty, race, ethnicity and immigration status are not in themselves determinative of student achievement. Demography is not destiny. The amount of melanin in a student's skin, the home country of her antecedents, the amount of money in the family bank account, are not the inexorable determinants of academic success. The evidence introduced at trial demonstrates that these negative life experiences can be overcome by public schools with sufficient resources well deployed. It is the clear policy of the state, as formulated by the Regents and S.E.D. State Education Department , that all children can attain the substantive knowledge and master the skills expected of high school graduates. The court finds that the city's at-risk children are capable of seizing the opportunity for a sound basic education if they are given sufficient resources. 
Even if the state aid formulas were designed to allocate education aid more fairly, it would be difficult to change the orientation of state education funding because any annual increase in state aid has historically been divided without reference to the formulas. The evidence at trial demonstrated that the formulas and grant categories are not allowed to operate neutrally, but rather are manipulated during the state's annual budget negotiations by state officials to produce consistent funding allocations of aid increases among school districts around the state. 
Focusing then entirely on the state component of education funding, the court finds that from 1994-95 to 1999-2000, New York City has consistently received less total state aid than its percentage share of enrolled students. In those years, New York has approximately 37 percent of the state's enrolled students and has received a percentage of total state aid ranging from 33.98 percent to 35.65 percent. This is evidence of disparate impact. 
That said, the court's deference to the coordinate branches of state government is contingent on these branches taking effective and timely action to address the problems set forth in this opinion. The parlous state of the city's schools demands no less. The court will not hesitate to intervene if it finds that the legislative and/or executive branches fail to devise and implement necessary reform.

HEADLINE: THE RULING ON THE SCHOOLS: THE PLAINTIFF; 
Eight Years and a Lawsuit Later, Better News to Report

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Eight years ago, Robert Jackson, father of three, product of New York City public schools, president of Community School Board 6 and lifelong renegade, simply got fed up.
 Every year, he said, school board members would meet with the schools chancellor and his representatives, who would tell them their share of the latest budget cut. "One year it was $1.5 million, the next $1.8 million," he recalled. "As school board president, I was always the bearer of bad news. One year, I just said, 'Enough.' " 
 Mr. Jackson went to Michael A. Rebell, then the lawyer for Board 6, in Washington Heights, and asked him to file a lawsuit that would stanch the hemorrhaging and turn the public schools into places where Mr. Jackson could ask his neighbors to send their children without feeling guilty.
Mr. Rebell was reluctant, but "this man would not take no for an answer," he said of Mr. Jackson yesterday.
Mr. Rebell took the case in 1992, and they sought out Norman Fruchter, then an outspoken member of School Board 15 in Brooklyn Heights, and Noreen Connell, head of the Educational Priorities Panel, a watchdog group, and formed Campaign for Fiscal Equity. With grant money, they hired a small staff and another lawyer, Robert Hughes. In 1993, they went to court.
Yesterday, Mr. Jackson was the bearer of good news, as Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court ruled that the state's financing system for public education violated New York's Constitution by failing to provide children with a sound, basic education.
The victory probably comes too late for Mr. Jackson's three daughters. After attending public schools, Saadiya, 25, is a medical student at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, and Asmahan, 20, is a junior at the State University at Buffalo. The youngest, Sumaya, 14, went to Public School and Intermediate School 187, in Washington Heights, but switched to the Dwight School, a private school on the Upper West Side, this year, in the ninth grade. She is a dancer with Alvin Ailey's company, "but my wife and I believe in academics," Mr. Jackson said, and wanted a school that offered things public schools did not, like Latin and small classes.
Mr. Jackson, 50, a slender, bespectacled man with a salt-and-pepper mustache, was born in Harlem and raised in Harlem and the Bronx. He attended P.S. 86 in Washington Heights, then P.S. 146 and Junior High School 120 in the Bronx. 
His mother, Zelma Jackson, was African-American. His father, Eddie Chu, was a Chinese immigrant who commuted home on weekends from his job as a waiter on Long Island. 
As a child, Mr. Jackson hawked papers in Harlem. If he brought back unsold papers, he said, the newsstand owner would tear off a piece and make him eat it.
He followed his older brother, Raymond, to Benjamin Franklin High School in the Bronx, where Raymond was a track star. Mr. Jackson was a mediocre runner. But the coach, Irving Goldberg, thrust an application for Upward Bound into his hand and told him to return it the next day. Upward Bound, a federal program, helped him get to the State University of New York College at New Paltz, where he met his wife, Faika, a student from Tanzania. After college, he investigated unemployment fraud for the State Labor Department, then took a job with the Public Employees Federation. He is now director of field services for the union.
His foray into education began when his wife volunteered him for the Parents Association at P.S./I.S. 187. He was elected in 1986 to the school board, on which he still serves.
At a Midtown news conference yesterday at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the law firm that eventually stepped in on the case pro bono, the lawyers, Mr. Rebell and Joseph F. Wayland, a partner at Simpson Thacher, took the spotlight while Mr. Jackson stood off in the crowd, sipping a soft drink. 
When it was over, he picked up his daughter from school. "Did we win?" Sumaya asked. "Yeah, we won," Mr. Jackson said. "We won big."

HEADLINE: State Officials Are Faulted On Anti-Tobacco Programs 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Only six states spend even the minimum amount on programs to prevent and stop smoking that is recommended by the Centers for Dsease Control and Prevention, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group in Washington, says in a report to be released today.
 A majority of states spend less than half of what the centers advises, the report says, while at least two, Michigan and North Dakota, support no antismoking programs at all with their money from a $206 billion national tobacco settlement. 
 The surgeon general has sharply criticized state lawmakers for neglecting prevention and spending too much on programs unrelated to smoking. 
"We're going to pay sooner or later if we allow children to start smoking," said the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher. "The tobacco settlement funds represent an opportunity that we've never had before to save lives, and we're missing it."
Dr. Satcher and numerous tobacco opponents worry that as the economy slows, lawmakers may use settlement money to offset reductions in tax revenue. Montana and Maine have already begun cutting back on efforts to prevent smoking and applying the money elsewhere. Virginia may use part of its settlement money to help phase out a property tax on cars.
"This is definitely something we're going to see played out through all of the states as the economic downturn affects state revenues," said Lee Dixon, health policy director for the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Under the 1998 agreement with tobacco companies, states are free to spend their settlement money as they see fit. Most use it to offset Medicaid expenses, support children's programs or improve education, but the payments have also gone to run boot camps for juvenile offenders in Alabama, build levees in North Dakota and provide tax cuts in Illinois and Connecticut.
Over all, less than 10 percent of the nearly $8.2 billion in settlement money allocated by states in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 has gone to combat smoking, less than half of the percentage that the disease control centers recommends. 
Dr. Satcher predicted that if all states had aggressive antismoking programs like those in California and Massachusetts, smoking rates could be halved in a decade.
Cigarette sales have been falling by 1 percent to 2 percent a year since the mid-1990's and dropped sharply in 1999 when tobacco companies raised prices to an average of $3 a pack. But sales have since returned to their old rate of decline.
The centers estimates the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses at more than $50 billion a year, and states bear at least $6 billion of that in Medicaid expenses alone.
A 1999 study by M.I.T. found that antismoking campaigns cut health care costs in Massachusetts by $85 million a year.
But in some states, money for to fight smoking is increasingly scarce.
The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that state revenues are increasing 3.5 percent this year on average, down from the 5 percent growth many states expected just months ago and the smallest increase in at least three years.

HEADLINE: It's Buying Time Again; 
With Rivals Regrouping, Forstmann Prepares to Pounce

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Theodore J. Forstmann was planning to spend the winter in Los Angeles as usual, avoiding the New York weather and relaxing away from the Fifth Avenue office of the leveraged buyout firm bearing his name.
 He just canceled his vacation plans. 
 "I told my partners, 'I'm going to be here. I want to see every memo. I'm going to be back running this thing,' " Mr. Forstmann said at the end of a long day recently, his necktie loosened as he slouched in a chair surrounded by memorabilia of one of his biggest deals, the turnaround of the Gulfstream Corporation. From his corner office on the 44th floor of the General Motors building in Midtown Manhattan, he has a striking view of Central Park. 
"When you're not seeing anything interesting, there's nothing to run on a day-to-day basis," he shrugged. "Now, there's a lot going on."
Indeed, for most leveraged buyout firms on the make there is almost too much going on, most of it bad: the stock market is falling, a recession may be looming and the junk bond market has nearly evaporated. But for Mr. Forstmann, the billionaire chairman of Forstmann Little, now is prime time.
The credit market, which usually provides the debt that most of the big leveraged buyout firms need to finance their takeovers of public companies and some that are already private, has all but dried up. Except for Mr. Forstmann's special kitty.
While most of his competitors, like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, were buying into many highly leveraged telecommunication and technology investments that went bad, Mr. Forstmann was squirreling away his money -- over $4 billion -- in a special subordinated-debt fund and his more traditional equity fund, waiting for a moment like this to pounce. While just about everybody else is down, he is feeling up.
"There's a lot of shots on goal," he said gleefully. "Lots of meetings to have, things to investigate." He demurs, though, when asked exactly what he plans to buy. "There are a couple of deals in here right now," is about all he is willing to say.
Not talking comes hard for Mr. Forstmann. Indeed, he is known for rarely missing an opportunity to trumpet his own successes or take a dig at his rivals. And there, at least, he remains in character. "I can only surmise that these other guys are shut down," he said. "Investment bankers, when they call here," he adds, "they say, 'You're the only one we're calling.' "
This is familiar territory for Mr. Forstmann. A decade ago, junk bonds were all but unavailable, bank debt was tight, the prices of companies were falling, and almost no one could put together a leveraged buyout -- except Mr. Forstmann. As recession loomed, he bought the General Instrument Corporation and the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation for a combined $2.6 billion; less than 10 years later, he sold them both for a total profit of $10 billion. 
Not all of Mr. Forstmann's investments have been home runs, but his slugging average seems to be higher than his rivals'. He boasts that his firm has had an annual average rate of return of 55 percent a year on its equity funds and in excess of 20 percent on its debt funds since he founded the firm in 1978. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a much bigger firm that has invested much more capital over the years, has averaged an annual return of 24 percent over its 24-year lifetime.
Mr. Forstmann may be ready to count his rivals out, but they are not. Henry Kravis, a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis, while acknowledging that last year was not a particularly good one, sees himself as on the prowl as well.
Last year "was a dismal year for many private equity firms, and the reason for that was they had the wrong focus," Mr. Kravis told a group of investors last week at a conference sponsored by Goldman, Sachs.
"Everybody," he added, "got excited about the whole Internet mania, the technology mania. Having said all that, I really believe that today we, K.K.R., and some others in the business of private equity, are absolutely in a gold mine."
But mining gold requires capital, and it is not as easy for firms like Kohlberg Kravis to raise money as it once was. 
Buyout firms pay for their takeovers mostly with debt, a lot of it from the sale of junk bonds. But in a slowing economy, investors are reluctant to buy such below-investment-grade debt, forcing borrowers to offer yields so high that many takeovers do not make sense. Moreover, leveraged buyout funds are typically backed by pension funds and endowments, which can be counted on to be much more cautious as the economy sours.
Not only are leveraged buyout firms having a hard time raising money from pension managers and other institutional investors -- Kohlberg Kravis hired Merrill Lynch to help court foreign investors for the first time this year -- they are having a rough time structuring the buyouts themselves. Hicks, Muse was recently forced to abandon its deal to acquire the Johns Manville Corporation because it would have been forced to pay too much to borrow in the junk bond market.
The credit shortage comes at the worst time for most of these leveraged buyout specialists because so many takeover targets are ripe for the plucking as the stock market has weakened.
"If you rolled back the clock to the 1980's, it should be like -- bam! -- L.B.O.'s would be doing deals everywhere," said Deane Dray, research analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "They're ready to go, but with the markets the way they are, they are stuck on the runway."
Mr. Forstmann's approach -- using his own special subordinated debt fund rather than high-yield debt to finance his deals -- limits his dependence on the junk bond market. Forstmann Little is one of a handful of leveraged buyout firms with such debt funds. 
If he were to buy a company for, say, $1 billion, Mr. Forstmann said he might invest $300 million from his equity fund and $400 million from his debt fund and borrow the rest from a bank. "On our $300 million, there are no interest payments," he said, referring to the equity fund investment. "And on our total $700 million, there is no amortization.
"So all the money that the other guys have to be paying people off with, we are using to grow."
Without having to pay terribly high interest rates, he is able to make his money go further, though it also could potentially lower his total returns. Mr. Forstmann has used his capital structure to his advantage. Most notably, he bought Gulfstream, the leading maker of corporate jets, in 1990 for $850 million from Chrysler, improved its profits and then sold it to General Dynamics in 1999, making $5 billion for his investors.
Most recently, he bought a big share of McLeodUSA and XO Communications, two telecommunications companies, along with substantial chunks in Yankee Candle and Community Health Systems, an operator of hospitals in the Southeast and Southwest.
"We interviewed six different private equity companies before choosing Teddy. We were looking for more than capital," said Clark McLeod, the founder of McLeodUSA. "He's not trying to be a bank."
And though Mr. Forstmann typically eschews Internet investments, he did make a $80 million investment in Metiom, a software developer of business-to-business e-commerce sites.
"The dot-com thing was really just so stupid," he said, blithely waving his hand.
By avoiding running with the crowd, he has never had any flameouts in the class of the 90 percent-plus plunges in the values of a host of dot-coms. Nonetheless, his stakes in the Pullman Company and in Lear Siegler in the late 1980's turned out to be duds.
But he has avoided other disasters that lured big-time investors, like the widespread collapse of the movie theater business because of overbuilding. "Don't make the mistake of thinking we didn't see every single one of those things," he said. "We saw them all and passed."
"Teddy would die if one of his investments died; he's that intense" explained Eli Broad, the home builder and insurance company owner who worked for the fund in 1978.
Mr. Forstmann has also invested in an e-learning company called Capella Education. The investment is probably less about business than it is a vehicle for advancing his pet project of remaking the world of public education so that it runs more like a business. Toward that goal, he was a founder of the Children's Scholarship Fund, with John T. Walton, the son of the Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, and has offered more than $50 million in scholarships for underprivileged children to attend private schools.
For much of the 1990's, while his fortune was rising even as the climate for his kind of deal making cooled, Mr. Forstmann spent a lot of time raising his political profile. He is one of the top fund-raisers for the Republican Party, and a major supporter of George W. Bush. And he is not shy about suggesting that his fund-raising prowess might give him an inside track to Washington.
"If the president of the United States asked me to do something," he said, "I'd give it very serious thought."
For now, he plans to keep up his busy business schedule. While he will not say who he is in talks with, he hinted that the deals would most likely be in technology, medical products or education.
And after lying low for a long time, he hopes to take advantage of the many opportunities he now sees as others lick their wounds.
"It is like the hunt," he said. "When that fox is out there, and they're all in the hunt, it's a good time to be playing Ping-Pong." Now, he says, it is time to stop playing and start prowling.

No Secrets, Just the Shock Of the Familiar

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
ONLY after you've read through the book-size decision that so thoroughly condemns the New York City public schools and everyone responsible for them does it hit you.
 Guess what, folks? Nothing new here. No shocks, surprises or deep, dark secrets. What is most stunning about yesterday's decision by Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan is that he orders what amounts to an education revolution in New York based on the blatantly familiar. In detached but passionate language, Justice DeGrasse indicts a society for choosing to ignore the known and knowable, at the expense of mostly poor and minority students. 
 As Joseph F. Wayland, the tenacious chief lawyer on the winning side, said yesterday, "There is absolutely nothing new that anyone with a passing knowledge of New York City's schools doesn't already know."
Mr. Wayland is with the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the nonprofit corporation that brought a lawsuit in 1993, contending that the state deprives New York City of enough financing to give students the sound, basic education required under the State Constitution, and disproportionately hurts minority students.
Justice DeGrasse agreed, saying that the state's system of financing schools is unconstitutional, does have a discriminatory impact and has to be revised.
In his 189-page decision, he takes on all the arguments, making unsparing judgments about matters more often subject to political spin. One stands out in particular, for a city whose minority students account for almost three-quarters of the state's minority public school population. 
To those who say that poor ethnic and racial minorities cannot succeed no matter what government spends on them because of economic and other disadvantages, the judge, who is African-American, acknowledged the problems and the impact they have. But, he concluded:
"Demography is not destiny. The amount of melanin in a student's skin, the home country of her antecedents, the amount of money in the family bank account, are not the inexorable determinants of academic success."
Justice DeGrasse proceeds to take the air out of many common assertions about the success of public education, particularly about the value of diplomas. He notes that about 30 percent of ninth graders fail to get a high school diploma by the time they are 21, and 10 percent get general equivalency degrees, which require only "marginal skills." Forty-eight percent get local diplomas, which require skills of a sixth- to ninth-grade student. 
That leaves only 12 percent getting diplomas that actually demonstrate that they've received a sound education. "This evidence," he wrote, "depicts a public school system that is foundering."
A few of the judge's other blunt findings were these:
*That "the quality of New York City's public school teachers -- in the aggregate -- is inadequate" and that the city generally attracts the least qualified teachers in the region.
*That teacher salaries are not competitive in New York City and that problems in recruiting are likely to get worse as teacher shortages grow.
*That "decaying and decrepit" schools hurt student performance.
*That to compare Catholic schools with public schools -- as politicians, especially Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, love to do -- is "not apt" because the Catholic schools have few special-education students, can expel disruptive students and have fewer students who are poor or limited in English.
HE rejects outright the idea that the city has enough money for education if it doesn't waste or misspend it. And he debunks the state's contention that the state education formula is diligently negotiated with students in mind. Instead, he writes, "the formulas are manipulated" during contentious budget negotiations between the governor and the Assembly and Senate leaders.
In other words, as the plaintiffs argued, they are a sham.
If the judge's ruling stands -- the state hasn't said if it will appeal -- the Legislature will have to revamp the formula by Sept. 15. That would be nothing short of cataclysmic in Albany, where the school formula has always been Albany's souk.
It is hard to believe that one judicial decision can change habits of decades. But other states have changed. Maybe Justice DeGrasse's decision -- by implicitly humiliating scores of New York's public officials with their own records -- has a chance of doing the seemingly impossible.

SEND.COM FOLDS ITS TENT

BYLINE:  By Catherine Greenman 

 BODY:
 Citing economic uncertainty and the inability to generate additional financing, Send.com, the online gift-giving service, said it would cease operations and close. 
The company, which had raised almost $45 million during its four years of operation, said it would honor all orders received before Monday. Ken Cassar, senior retail analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said many companies have struggled in the online specialty gift market. "One reason for Send.com's failure would be its exaggerated sense of potential when the reality was they didn't have the capability to become anything more than a niche business," he said.

BROOKLYN: HOLTZMAN ROBBED -- Elizabeth Holtzman, the former Brooklyn district attorney, was robbed in front of her home in Boerum Hill on Tuesday as she left a taxi, the police said yesterday. Ms. Holtzman, 59, told the police that as she approached the gate to her brownstone she was confronted by a man with a silver-colored gun who demanded her wallet. She said she gave the man $100 and he ran away. Ms. Holtzman was also robbed at gunpoint in 1995 at an automated teller machine in Manhattan. Ms. Holtzman, who served as city comptroller as well as a congresswoman representing Brooklyn, is a lawyer with the firm of Herrick, Feinstein.

ROCHESTER: WOMAN CLAIMS POLICE RAPE -- A 20-year-old woman says she was chained to a chair and raped by three sheriff's deputies while in custody six weeks ago. The woman's lawyer, Johnnie Cochran Jr., notified the authorities yesterday that she planned to sue. Mr. Cochran filed a notice of claim in which the woman, who is black but not otherwise identified in court papers, maintained that she was falsely detained Nov. 30 and then assaulted by the deputies, who are white. No criminal charges have been filed, and the officers remain on the job at the Monroe County Sheriff's Department. (AP)

MANHATTAN: LAWYER SENTENCED FOR FRAUD -- A Manhattan lawyer was sentenced on Tuesday to 7 to 21 years in prison for eight counts of grand larceny. The lawyer, Domenick Crispino, was convicted of stealing more than $2 million from 14 clients whom he represented in a lawsuit. Among his clients were accident victims who had received financial settlements, and in the course of representing them, Mr. Crispino stole some of their settlement, according to indictments.

BROOKLYN: MOTHER CHARGED IN DEATH -- A Brooklyn mother was charged on Tuesday with killing her 15-month-old baby, said the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes. The woman, Nicole Hamilton, 23, is accused of repeatedly striking the baby, Kyron Hamilton, with her hand and fist. The infant, who had multiple injuries, died on Dec. 3. Ms. Hamilton was charged with murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child. She faces a maximum prison term of 25 years to life. Her 3-year-old son, who the authorities said had also been beaten, was placed in foster care.

MANHATTAN: APARTMENT BURGLARIZED -- A burglar tied up a cleaning woman and ransacked an apartment yesterday in one of the Upper West Side's most elegant apartment buildings, the police said. The burglar had entered an apartment in the Apthorp, a Renaissance Revival landmark at Broadway and West 79th Street, when the cleaning woman walked in about 5 p.m. and surprised him, said Officer Gary Cillo, a police spokesman. The burglar bound the 45-year-old woman, finished ransacking the apartment and left with an undetermined amount of jewelry, Officer Cillo said. The woman was not injured, he said. Residents of the gated, four-building complex, which is home to celebrities like Nora Ephron and where rent-decontrolled apartments go for as much as $20,000, said the police told them that the burglar was on the loose inside the complex. The police searched the building in vain, Officer Cillo said. Andy Newman (NYT)

MANHATTAN: FIRE CLOSES POST OFFICE -- An underground electrical fire yesterday forced the shutdown of the Peck Slip post office, near the Brooklyn Bridge, the authorities said. Consolidated Edison was still working on the cables in the building early this morning and postal officials said they did not know when the post office, which serves the northern part of the financial district, would reopen. The fire started in an underground secondary cable leading to the post office about 4:30 p.m, said Michael Clendenin, a Con Edison spokesman. The smoke from the fire forced the evacuation of the 30 employees inside, and a small explosion from the fire damaged a wall inside the post office, said Lt. Kevin Ganun, a Fire Department spokesman.

MANHATTAN: PESTICIDE USE -- Even before the 1999 discovery of West Nile virus forced the city to spray for mosquitoes, New York City used nearly a third of the pesticides applied in the state, according to a report released yesterday. In 1998, the city reported 1.6 million gallons and 7.8 million pounds of pesticides, according to the report by Environmental Advocates and the New York Public Interest Research Group. The figures do not include pesticides bought by individuals. Statewide in 1998, 4.5 million gallons and 29.4 million pounds of pesticides were reported used by commercial applicators or sold to farmers. (AP)

Mr. Lawrence is scheduled to return to court Feb. 5. If convicted, he could receive up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. (NYT)

HARTFORD: FIRST HOMICIDE OF 2001 -- This city's first homicide of the year occurred on Monday night. Marvin Blunt, 30, was shot and killed in the city's North End at 10:30 p.m, said Lt. Mark Pawlina. Mr. Blunt drove up to a convenience store, got out of his vehicle and had a brief conversation with a man in a ski mask. When he turned to go back to the vehicle, the masked man fired several shots at Mr. Blunt, who was pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical Center at 11:13 p.m. (NYT)

MONTVILLE: PRISON SCUFFLE -- Three corrections officers were injured yesterday during a scuffle with two inmates at Corrigan Correctional Institution, the state police said. An inmate reportedly attacked a corrections officer at the high-security prison about 9:45 a.m. The officers were not seriously injured, and the reason for the attack was not given. (AP)

NEW JERSEY

NEWARK: BLACK REPRESENTATION -- New Jersey gained 7 black elected officials from 1998 to 1999, a 3 percent increase that put the total at 239. New Jersey's increase outpaced a national rise of less than 1 percent, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. According to representation in the state legislatures, New Jersey ranks better than most states in racially proportionate representation, the group said. The Legislature is 12.5 percent black, nearly equal to the black voting-age population in the state of 13.6 percent. (AP)

MORRIS TOWNSHIP: DEER BIRTH CONTROL -- A three-year project to reduce the growing deer population with birth-control inoculations has ended in futility at a Morris County park. Of 12 does injected since 1997 with a vaccine preventing fertilization, some disappeared from the 127-acre park and others were hit by cars on a nearby highway, said Carl Zafonte, director of park maintenance. The two does still in the park have been seen with fawns, he said. Still, scientists believe that the birth-control method shows promise. On Fire Island, N.Y., 80 percent of 200 does treated in the last seven years have not given birth, said Nina Austenberg, regional director of the Humane Society of the United States, which sponsored both tests.

HEADLINE: FleetBoston Sells Package Of Bad Loans 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The FleetBoston Financial Corporation said today that it had sold $1.35 billion of troubled loans to Patriarch Partners, ridding itself of some customers who have had trouble paying back debt.
 Patriarch, founded in April by the investors Dennis Dolan and Lynn Tilton, paid about $1 billion for the loans, about 26 percent less than their face value. The sale shrinks FleetBoston's nonperforming loans to about $925 million from $1.03 billion in September, said a spokesman, James Mahoney. 
 FleetBoston, which had about $115 billion in loans at the end of December, is selling at a time when defaults are up because a slowing economy has made it harder for corporate borrowers to make debt payments. The bank said it hopes the move, which was reported by The Wall Street Journal, will convince investors that bad loans will not pull down profits, analysts said.
"Fleet is getting out in front of it," said Lanny Thorndike, a portfolio manager at Century Capital Management in Boston. "Fleet's thinking, 'By selling at a 30 percent discount, I now get everyone off my back.' "
Shares of FleetBoston rose $1.61, to $42.69.
Rising levels of bad loans have dragged down banks' earnings in recent months. Analysts expect bank earnings per share to fall by an average of 14 percent in the fourth quarter, in large part because banks are setting aside more money to cover possible losses from loans.
FleetBoston said the sale to Patriarch, completed on Dec. 28, would not affect fourth-quarter earnings. Mr. Mahoney said the company endorsed analysts' forecasts of 84 cents a share. Patriarch paid $725 million in cash, plus zero-coupon bonds with a face value of $275 million for the loans. FleetBoston's nonperforming assets are higher than those of most large banks. While the percentage of nonperformers to total loans will fall to about 0.8 percent from the 0.92 percent of September, the bank will still be in the bottom third in terms of asset quality among the top 50 banks, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Say Time for Bush Decision on Speeding Tax Cut Is Becoming Crucial 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Faced with political and economic risks on both sides of the argument, President-elect George W. Bush will have to make a critical decision in the next few weeks about whether to seek quick action in Congress on a tax cut, Republican leaders said today.
 Aides to Mr. Bush said they had not yet decided how to proceed. But they said they were considering whether the apparent deterioration of the economy required pushing a tax cut through the House and Senate on an accelerated schedule, and whether the tax cut should take effect this year, rather than next year as they had originally proposed. 
 "That is all under review right now," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. Mr. Bush said last weekend that he would make a decision after taking office on Jan. 20.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said he had discussed the issue this week with officials from the incoming administration, and had pointed out to them the pros and cons of moving quickly on tax cuts.
"It's going to have to be under active consideration, and quick," Mr. Lott said.
On the plus side, Mr. Lott said, speedy action could provide a boost to the economy just when it needed it most, and Democrats might be reluctant to oppose Mr. Bush's first big initiative. 
But moving on tax cuts right away would create procedural problems in the Senate that could subject the legislation to delaying tactics and a flood of amendments, Mr. Lott said. And depending on the size and composition of the tax cut, he said, it could strain the ability of the Senate, which is divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, to maintain any semblance of bipartisanship.
"But we're going to make this new situation work," Mr. Lott said. "Maybe this could be a mighty test of whether it could work."
In the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush proposed a package of tax cuts that would be worth about $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Its centerpiece was a reduction in all income tax rates, a provision that accounted for more than half the value of the package.
Mr. Bush's team has been discussing whether to accelerate the income tax cut, and Republicans in Congress have been pressing for any plan to include additional provisions like expansions of individual retirement accounts and the 401(k) retirement savings program.
Democrats said they were open to a substantial tax cut, and clearly do not want to be blamed for blocking action that could help forestall a recession. But they said they would be unlikely to support a plan as big as the one Mr. Bush has proposed, and that they would like to see the benefits of any reduction directed mostly to low- and middle-income people. Most of the benefits of Mr. Bush's plan would go to people at the high end of the income scale, those who pay the most in taxes.
"This may very well be the first true test of what bipartisanship means in the new Congress," said Michael Siegel, spokesman for Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. 
"There is certainly a sense that the Bush tax plan as proposed during the campaign is simply too large," Mr. Siegel said. "At the same time, there's a growing sense that there very well may be a need for a tax cut. But it doesn't make sense to provide a huge tax cut that leaves little room for flexibility to continue to pay down the debt, to shore up Social Security and Medicare and to provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors."
In the House, where Republicans have a clear majority, there is growing support for taking up a substantial tax cut as one of the first orders of business. In a memorandum sent on Tuesday to all Republicans in the House, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, urged quick action to cut income tax rates.
Mr. Armey's position was more aggressive on tax cuts than previous statements by other Republican leaders, including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who has urged taking up a series of smaller tax cut measures one by one.
But it will be much easier for Republicans to move a tax cut through the House than through the Senate. That is in part because the House's procedural rules make it easier than in the Senate to limit debate and amendments. But it is also because of the nearly even division of power between the two parties in the Senate.
"Tax bills don't become law without bipartisan support," said Jill Kozeny, a spokeswoman for Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who will be chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Ms. Kozeny said Mr. Grassley was "considering every option at this point."
Mr. Lott said he had not recommended any particular course of action to Mr. Bush's team. But he said he had told the incoming administration that if it decided to move ahead under standard Senate procedures, which call for adopting a budget before considering tax bills, then it would be June or July before there could be final action on a tax cut.
"You have to consider, if you want to do something quick, the politics of it as well as the economics," Mr. Lott said. 
"Unlike some people from the House, who are saying do it now or do it this way or do it that way, I think we ought to at least have a little time for input from the administration," he said. "Tell them what the options are, what the pitfalls are, get their reactions and come to a conclusion together."

HEADLINE: For OPEC, Cuts in Production Are a Delicate Balancing Act 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Next week, a dozen men will gather in a room in Vienna and make a decision that could cushion the fall of the American economy -- or pull the rug out from under it. 
 Those men, the leaders of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, have watched -- like Alan Greenspan -- with mounting concern as spending and investment in the United States have slowed with each passing week. For OPEC, a sluggish American economy could lead to a decline in oil consumption worldwide and, with it, a free fall in oil prices. 
 So the delicate task that the cartel's leaders face as they prepare for their meeting next Wednesday is setting production levels that keep prices high enough to sustain their economies without helping shove the United States into recession.
Toward that end, OPEC officials have announced they will sharply curtail petroleum output, although the size of the cut will not be known until next week. The Clinton administration, meanwhile, is scrambling to limit the damage, with the energy secretary, Bill Richardson, planning to leave this evening for a round of talks with key OPEC officials in Europe and the Persian Gulf. 
"We don't want severe, precipitous cuts," one senior Energy Department official said yesterday.
Often in the past, the OPEC nations have resolved to manage production and prices with Greenspan-like precision, only to see their plans crumble as members pursue their individual interest, rather than the cartel's. Over the last two years, however, a freshly invigorated OPEC has found new cohesion, and the confidence that it can shape the global economy rather than struggling to adapt to its shifts. 
For now, the cartel is betting that it can have its hefty oil export revenues without damaging the weakened economies of the United States and Asia. But analysts note that is a fine balance that will be tough to strike in the volatile realm of oil prices. 
"We're on the precipice of something serious, and OPEC needs to be very careful right now," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist with economy.com, a consulting group. "Just the mere fact if OPEC tightens supply and the price of oil jumps by $5 a barrel could be debilitating for consumers and investors reeling with lots of other worries."
OPEC enjoyed the windfall of oil prices higher than $30 a barrel for most of the last half of 2000 thanks to a robust American economy and Asia's rebound from its collapse in 1997 and 1998.
Amid the slowdown in the United States, prices fell below $26 last month. But cold weather and tight supplies pushed prices in the futures market up 6.7 percent yesterday, to $29.48, the biggest one-day rise since October.
Now, OPEC wants to ensure that the price of oil stays somewhere between $25 and $30 a barrel -- something it rarely has been able to sustain for long.
OPEC ministers have called for cuts ranging from one to two million barrels of oil a day. The cartel pumped 30.4 million barrels daily in October, according to the latest data available from the Energy Information Administration in Washington. 
Some oil industry experts said the range of proposed decreases signaled the existence of two camps within OPEC. The so-called price hawks -- Iran, Kuwait and Venezuela -- want, these experts say, a drastic, immediate reduction of two million barrels a day. Another group, led mainly by Saudi Arabia, would like to phase in cuts over the coming months, eventually removing the same two million barrels a day from the market by April. 
The Saudis, considered the de facto leaders of OPEC, have traditionally listened to United States concerns and have been a moderating force in the cartel. But analysts say that the Saudis were rattled by the 30 percent drop in oil prices during December, making them less receptive to American entreaties. 
So in a rare interlude of unity within a group that historically has been fractious, all the OPEC nations agree that a reduction is crucial. And neither Mexico nor Norway, two large non-OPEC producers that lately have worked with the cartel, seems likely to undermine it now.
"Iran believes OPEC's output should be reduced," the Iranian oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, was quoted as telling an Iranian news agency this week. "The rest of the members hold the same view, too, but with a little difference regarding the level of the reduction."
Many analysts expect OPEC to announce a decrease of 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, or 5 percent of total output. The actual decrease may be a bit smaller because of chronic overproduction by OPEC members, which would soften somewhat the blow to the global economy. 
OPEC's decision will come at a time when Americans, accustomed to low fuel prices for nearly a decade, have seen the havoc that high energy costs can wreak. 
In early summer, airlines, trucking companies and motorists experienced steep rises in fuel prices, only to have them settle at levels as much as 50 percent higher than a year earlier. The price of natural gas has increased more than fourfold in the last 18 months, leading to higher costs for manufacturers, steeper heating and electric utility bills in many parts of the country. In California, this has contributed to a crisis that has brought the state's biggest utilities to the edge of bankruptcy. Last fall, the White House ordered the release of 30 million barrels of crude oil from the nation's reserves to help make up a heating oil shortfall in the Northeast. 
Though the OPEC countries are almost entirely dependent on oil revenues to finance their budgets and ensure political stability, recent declines in oil prices have again shown how hard it is for the cartel to navigate through the global economy. 
Under pressure from the United States over the last year, OPEC increased production by about 3.5 million barrels a day. Because it takes weeks for production increases to work their way from wellhead to customer, the oil swell is washing into the world's economies only now, just as those economies are slackening and consumption falling.
"If they don't make production cuts now, 45 days from now there will be a glut of oil and it will cost $15 a barrel," said Ed Morse, executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company. "If you were in their position, what would you do?"
Concerned that a production cut could lead to recession, Mr. Richardson met Ali Rodriguez, the Venezuelan who serves as OPEC's president, in Vienna last weekend -- to no apparent effect. The Bush administration-in-waiting has also asked OPEC not to cut output, though just how Spencer Abraham, the energy secretary-designate, will approach relations with oil producers is unclear. 
But OPEC fears something much worse than Washington's ire: a repeat of what happened after it met in Jakarta, Indonesia, more than three years ago. At the time, OPEC decided to increase output, unaware that the Asian economic crisis would worsen. As a result, the price of oil plummeted to $10 a barrel.
Like war-scarred veterans, OPEC found greater solidarity by enduring the crash in oil prices. Cartel members cut output sharply in 1998 and 1999, then realized over the last year that by working together, they could keep prices high. 
Moreover, countries once at odds with each other have made an effort to cooperate. Saudi Arabia and Iran, usually at loggerheads, have strengthened diplomatic and military ties; industry experts say that President Mohammad Khatami of Iran and the Saudi crown prince, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, have a good personal relationship. President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela has reached out to other OPEC members; previously, Caracas had often flouted OPEC's decisions.
But for all its apparent discipline and unity, OPEC's efforts to micromanage the oil market could backfire. Unlike the Federal Reserve, OPEC relies on information that is often incomplete and inaccurate. Members fib to one another about their output and production capacity. Data about worldwide consumption often arrives months late. 
Working from such a sketchy picture, OPEC could tighten supplies too stringently. Some oil traders have said that if next week's cut exceeds 1.5 million barrels a day, the price of oil could jump significantly. If it stays high -- say, $30 a barrel or more -- the global economy could slow even more, demand would fall more drastically, and OPEC would find itself struggling with lower prices once again.

With a Chill in the Air, Builders Blink

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
IN the midst of New York City's biggest building boom since the mid-to-late-1980's, there is now a certain hollow silence: the sound of developers and bankers holding their collective breath.
 With cranes perched over snow-dusted steel skeletons in virtually every neighborhood in Manhattan, the city's best-known residential developers say they are still pushing to build, negotiate and scout for new sites in the coming year, but they also say they are moving with a new caution, given signs of an economic downturn. 
 "We're looking over our shoulder," said Joshua Muss, a Queens developer, whose six rental buildings are now rising behind the boardwalk at Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.
Besides those already under construction or close to ground-breaking, there are few new condominium projects on the horizon, a pronounced change from last year. 
Stephen M. Ross, the chairman of the Related Companies, one of the most active mixed-use developers in Manhattan -- and one of the developers chosen to build the Coliseum project, with its 203 condominiums -- said he would not even consider initiating new condominiums now, which often require two years of work before a shovel is put in the ground. Nevertheless, he said, he was not worried about building more rental apartments, which developers regard as more resistant to recession. 
But Thomas Elghanayan, the president and chief operating officer of Rockrose Development, one of the largest builders of rental housing in the city, does worry about rentals. "I'm stepping back a little bit," he said last week. Even Donald J. Trump, whose multimillion-dollar condominiums across from the United Nations are selling for record sums, was uncharacteristically hesitant. "The market is at least as strong as it was six months ago," he said. "But talk to me in six months. It's an evolving story."
For the banks, too, the future is up for grabs. "Short term, we're rolling right along; no problems," said William C. McCahill Jr., an executive vice president of Fleet, which last year lent half a billion dollars for apartment construction in the Northeast, most of it in Manhattan.
It's unlikely that that level of activity will be maintained this year. "Long term, well, there's nothing in the pipeline," Mr. McCahill said.
The developers said that while New York City is still among the country's most desirable locations, there has been a shift. "The biggest difference between today and a year ago is the buyers' perceptions, the buyers' confidence," said Daniel Brodsky, a partner in the Brodsky Organization. "Something's going on, a hesitation. Everyone says that. Retail sales are down, everyone has less confidence. In buying apartments, there is a little hesitation."
Like the other developers, Mr. Brodsky said he was concerned about the condominium market. Would he start planning a condominium development tomorrow? "I would hesitate," he said. "The sales of condominiums follow the economy, follow Wall Street."
Interviews with the city's top developers all seemed to start with rosy reflections on the past year. "I can tell you that 2000 is the best year I ever had in business," said Donald Zucker, a 40-year veteran developer and president of the Zucker Organization, echoing almost exactly the words of several other residential developers.
But what about 2001 and beyond? And if the economy continues to slow down? Mr. Zucker, Mr. Ross and the rest say they will be shrewdly positioned to capitalize. If other developers are overleveraged, as many were in the last boom, said Mr. Zucker, who is currently beginning 77 rental apartments at 30th Street and Ninth Avenue, "then guys like me are going to come along and buy up their buildings."
The developers insist that the coming downturn -- if there is one -- will not catch them unprepared.
"I'm not going to be surprised at anything," said Mr. Muss, the Queens developer. "Because I've been there, and we will never build such an oversupply."
In the late 1980's, there were nearly 40,000 apartments built in Manhattan, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. Many of them were shoddily constructed studios and one-bedroom units that, when financial trouble hit, were left to languish on the market.
The number of units built in the mid-to-late-90's was about the same, but the apartments erected are much bigger and more solidly constructed, developers and real estate agents say, so their value may hold up better.
Mr. Ross said the difference in quality is evident even in rentals. "We're putting in granite countertops and quality lobbies," he said. In a downturn, he argued, the quality will separate the best product from the rest.
Right now, Mr. Ross's Related Companies has 1,500 apartments under construction (meaning the ground has been broken), almost all of them in Manhattan. Of those, only 314 are condominiums. In addition, Bruce Beal, a spokesman, said the company had 1,000 more units on the drawing board, with options for the land signed and financing secured. They are all rentals. Mr. Muss said he was just finishing 200 units, had 260 under construction and planned to begin 200 more in the next two months. All of Mr. Muss's are rental units.
At Rockrose, there are 836 units in three new buildings, all scheduled to come on the market by the end of summer, said Kevin P. Singleton, the general manager. All three projects -- at 15 Cliff Street in the Financial District, 22 River Terrace in Battery Park and 200 West 26th Street in north Chelsea -- are rentals. (Mr. Singleton said the company had no new projects planned beyond those three that meet the criteria of having secured both financing and land options.)
Larry Silverstein, the president of Silverstein Properties, with 921 rental apartments nearing completion at the western edge of 42nd Street, said the current rental market "seems to be unabated in its demand, but naturally I'm cautious." He added, "I read the paper like everybody else." 
Initial planning for new condominiums -- perhaps with the exception of those of Mr. Trump, whose imprimatur has its own momentum -- seems to be grinding to a halt. In a recession, there is always some market for rentals -- young people coming to work and study in the city -- but less demand for condominiums, which in the last two years have broken all price records for Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.
"Condos aren't a real alternative right now," Mr. Ross said. One reason is the high cost of construction in New York City, which makes the price of the condos sky high. "To make a profit, you'd have to get $700 a square foot," he said, "and there aren't many proven locations -- and they certainly couldn't command $700 a square foot." (At $700 a square foot, the average-size one-bedroom apartment would sell for almost half a million dollars.)
But with New York's recent boom, those proven locations have increased, the developers say. Because of the runaway market of the last eight years, more and more of Manhattan has been opened for development: Mr. Zucker's rentals at 30th Street and Ninth Avenue are rising in a residential location unheard of just a few years ago.
Thus, every cloud, for these developers, may have a rentable lining.
If rents and sales prices do drop, they say, those who can't now afford Manhattan prices may come back and settle in these marginal neighborhoods, and the developers will be ready for them.
Whatever happens, the developers say, they'll keep going.
"Why would I keep building if I'm worried?" Mr. Elghanayan asked rhetorically. "I'd probably do better if I just waited and could pick up things at a lower level later. But there are people who work here, an office to keep going; the overhead is pretty big."
"I'm still out there looking, but not as enthusiastically," he continued. "It's just in our nature to look. We just want to make sure we can carry on if the bottom falls out."
Mr. Zucker, who is building his 23rd Manhattan building, agreed. "I must have the ability to weather the storm, because it's going to get stormy," he said. "The five-year run we've had is going to end, but we'll keep making money." He paused. "There will just be less of it."

HEADLINE: Iraq Is Focal Point as Bush Meets With Joint Chiefs 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
George W. Bush, the nation's commander in chief to be, went to the Pentagon today for a top-secret session with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review hot spots around the world where he might have to send American forces into harm's way. 
 About half of the 75-minute meeting in the secure conference room where the military chiefs conduct their most sensitive business, focused on a discussion about Iraq and the Persian Gulf, two participants said. Iraq was the first topic briefed because "it's the most visible and most risky area" Mr. Bush will confront after he takes office, one senior officer said. 
 Mr. Bush did not say how he would deal with Iraq, the participants said, but asked several questions about President Saddam Hussein and American allies in the region, before the generals briefing him addressed other possible flashpoints, including the Balkans and the Korean peninsula. 
"Iraqi policy is very much on his mind," one senior Pentagon official said. "Saddam was clearly a discussion point." 
Iraq looms large among the national security challenges Mr. Bush will face. During the campaign, he criticized the Clinton administration as allowing the international coalition against Iraq to erode, and for permitting sanctions against Iraq to loosen. 
But it was the president-elect's father, President George Bush, who left Mr. Clinton with what critics say was unfinished business, by defeating Mr. Hussein in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, but not dislodging him. 
In the past year, Mr. Bush and his advisers have talked about strengthening the sanctions and bolstering the fragmented Iraqi opposition groups, but the president-elect has been careful not to lay out a specific strategy.
Mr. Bush arrived at the Pentagon this morning surrounded by a cast familiar with the building: Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, who was secretary of defense under Mr. Bush's father; Gen. Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state-designate and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs; Donald H. Rumsfeld, a former secretary of defense who is Mr. Bush's choice for the same job; and Condoleezza Rice, the president-elect's pick for national security adviser. 
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen held a 45-minute briefing in his office for the group, touching on a variety of issues, including the nation's nuclear arsenal, before the session with the Joint Chiefs. 
Hours after his meeting with Mr. Bush, Mr. Cohen gave a speech that was part valedictory and part rebuttal to Mr. Bush's repeated criticisms against the Clinton administration's military policies during the campaign.
On Iraq, for instance, Mr. Cohen argued that sanctions had worked.
"Saddam Hussein's forces are in a state where he cannot pose a threat to his neighbors at this point," he said. "We have been successful, through the sanctions regime, to really shut off most of the revenue that will be going to rebuild his military."
In a courtly manner, without mentioning Mr. Bush or his supporters by name, Mr. Cohen time and again suggested that the Republicans had oversimplified defense issues like peacekeeping in the Balkans and building a ballistic missile defense system, a subject that did not come up at today's Pentagon briefings.
In the campaign, for instance, Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Clinton's defense policies had caused military morale to plummet and weapons systems to fall into disrepair.
But Mr. Cohen argued today that policies supported by the Clinton administration and approved by Congress in the past two years would lead to an increase in Pentagon spending of $227 billion by the year 2007. 
Much of that increase will be for personnel costs, including pay increases and improved pension and health care benefits. But much will also go toward maintaining and modernizing weapons systems.
The increase outlined by Mr. Cohen today is actually significantly more than what Mr. Bush proposed during the campaign, which was $45 billion over 10 years. Though Mr. Cohen did not lay out that contrast, he seemed to be suggesting that the Clinton administration had already achieved more than anything Mr. Bush had even proposed during the campaign.
Mr. Cohen also took issue with suggestions by Ms. Rice that it might be necessary to set up international police forces to carry out peacekeeping functions that are now the responsibility of soldiers.
"Some people say, 'Why don't we just train people to be peacekeepers, a certain segment of our military to be peacekeepers, and the others will be the warriors?' " Mr. Cohen said in his address at the National Press Club here. "It doesn't work that way. We have to train our people to do everything, all the way from being peacekeepers to peacemakers to humanitarians to diplomats to being war fighters, because the situation on the ground can change like that."
Throughout the campaign, Republicans also accused the Clinton administration of dragging its heels on building an antiballistic missile defense system. Mr. Cohen, who supports building a limited missile shield, said Mr. Clinton had been deliberate about building support for a system among American allies.
And he strongly warned Mr. Bush to do the same and not rush into deploying something that might trigger a new arms race or alienate America's friends.
"Working with our allies, persuading them that we're doing the right thing and the reasonable thing, is going to very important," Mr. Cohen said.
Mr. Cohen also warned Mr. Bush about cutting spending on three expensive fighter plane programs that Mr. Cohen strongly supported during his tenure. Those programs could cost well over $300 billion over the next two decades, and advisers to Mr. Bush have suggested that the new administration would take a hard look at cutting or canceling one of them, investing the money instead in futuristic skip-a-generation technology.

HEADLINE: Long a T.W.A. Town, St. Louis and Its Airport Cheer 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Word that the owners of American Airlines would acquire T.W.A. -- and probably bring a season of stability to employees of a storied airline that has slipped in and out of bankruptcy for a decade -- was greeted as good news here today.
 After years of worrying about the very survival of T.W.A., which has its headquarters in St. Louis and dominates operations at the airport here, the city rejoiced in the expectation that thousands of jobs and perhaps billions of dollars in regional spending would be secured by the deal. 
 Mayor Clarence Harmon of St. Louis and the city's business leaders cheered the deal; everyday citizens said it would strengthen the local economy, and T.W.A. employees of every stripe seemed to walk a little more confidently at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, even though T.W.A.'s name and rich heritage would disappear after three-quarters of a century. 
"The employees of this company finally have some long-term security," said Paul Gerling, 57, a T.W.A. pilot for nearly 36 years. "We're thankful we've stayed in business this long. A lot of people could have put us out of business, so this is a joyful day."
While top executives from the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, and Trans World Airlines held a news conference at the T.W.A. headquarters in downtown St. Louis this morning, scores of T.W.A.'s 8,900 local employees gathered in knots at the airport to talk about what joining the American team would mean. Many liked what they heard. Several ground employees said they were told that their salaries could rise as much as $4.50 an hour, because of higher pay scales at American.
Nancy Nagel, a customer service agent checking in passengers at Gate C6 for a Chicago flight, pointed at the American Airlines pin she had placed just below the T.W.A. button on her sweater.
"T.W.A. has been struggling for the past 15 years, and I've been working for them for 20 years," she said. "It'd be nice to work for a company that's profitable."
T.W.A.'s losses for most of the last decade and its third Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, made today, were enough to win over Harry Brooks, 65, an employee for 39 years who works the skycap luggage service.
Standing between the two airlines' ticket counters, Mr. Brooks said he would be happy to move over a few steps and exchange his blue T.W.A. uniform for the red and blue of American. 
"The name T.W.A. is good," he said, "but there are a lot of airline names that are gone, and people don't have jobs. I think this saved the airline."
Others here say that the deal may have helped salvage Lambert airport, one of the nation's oldest, where more than 19,000 people work each day.
Like other airports in big cities, it is struggling to overcome congestion and improve outdated quarters -- goals that might have been unreachable if T.W.A. had collapsed rather than falling into American's arms .
City officials have plans to spend hundreds of millions to add a third runway in hopes of ridding the airport of its reputation as a bottleneck in bad weather and making Lambert a more efficient alternative to O'Hare International in Chicago. 
Those plans follow years of battling over how to expand the airport. Without T.W.A., which flies 76 percent of the travelers who pass through St. Louis, the odds that Lambert would grow into a major airline hub seemed dim.
"The importance of the hub to the St. Louis economy is very substantial," said Richard Fleming, president of the Regional Chamber and Growth Association of St. Louis. "We estimate the economic value of the airport to be $5 billion a year, and after our expansion, it could be $12 billion to $15 billion a year."
Travelers had mixed feelings about what the deal will mean for them. Several people interviewed at the airport today said they were pleased that jobs were being saved, but they lamented the loss of a great brand name and said they worried about the prospects for service and ticket prices.
"T.W.A. has been the most reliable in the last four years," said Jack Pledger, a retired Air Force pilot from the St. Louis suburbs . "The last few times I got canceled, I was on American. I'd rather see T.W.A. acquire American. They've got a better service record."
Indeed, for many here in St. Louis, and even for travelers passing through, news of the deal was bittersweet. Jobs were saved, they said, but a part of aviation history was being lost. 
"I'm 55, and I remember having a T.W.A. plane when I was a kid," said Ron Six, a passenger from Albany, Ohio, passing through on his way to Houston. "I used to fly Eastern and Pan Am, airlines that when I was young I never dreamed would disappear."
T.W.A. had celebrated its 75th anniversary a year ago, a time for reflecting on an airline that in its earliest years acquired an aviation company from Charles Lindbergh, the pioneer aviator who flew from Lambert Field. 
Howard Hughes once owned T.W.A.; so did the financier Carl C. Icahn. It is a name that people here grew up with, but for the last few years, T.W.A. has represented little more than the prospect of bankruptcy, and worries about the demise of the St. Louis hub.
Today, it was the object of wistfulness.
Michael Knox, who works at a Paradies news and gift shop at the airport, said he planned to hang onto some trinkets bearing the T.W.A. emblem, like a fuzzy toy airplane that, when squeezed, makes the sound of a plane taking off.
"What are we going to do with stuff like this?" he asked, squeezing the plane again and again. "But if this deal benefits the city, I'm all for it."

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "To Fix the Electricity Mess, More Power Plants Are Needed" (Business Day, Jan. 5):
 New York State needs new, more efficient and cleaner power plants in order to meet our growing economy's demand for electricity. 
The cushion between the demand and our generation capacity is shrinking. This not only puts upward pressure on the price of electricity, but it also threatens the reliability of a system that is absolutely critical to our well-being. 
 Power plant siting decisions are not easy. But today's state-of-the-art facilities will provide environmental benefits by displacing, and eventually replacing, older and less efficient plants. Failure to take action now will cost New Yorkers money, undermine our economic recovery and jeopardize the reliability of an electric system we too often take for granted.

HEADLINE: Clinton Team's Final Forecast: No Recession 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Eight years after taking office with a promise to focus like a laser beam on the economy, the Clinton administration offered its own final economic report card today, saying the country is not slipping into recession and that its long-term prospects have been enhanced by technology and fiscal discipline.
 In a generally optimistic forecast that stands in contrast to the increasing gloom of many private analysts, the White House's chief economist said the economy remained fundamentally sound and should continue to benefit from three factors that drove the long expansion of the 1990's: improvements in the growth rate of productivity, better business management and a shift from federal budget deficits to surpluses. 
 "We don't think the new economy is dead," said Martin N. Baily, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "We don't think we're going into recession." 
Mr. Baily said the economy was slowing more than the administration had anticipated when it decided on the forecasts contained in the Economic Report of the President for 2001, which will be sent to Congress on Friday.
But while some industries, like automobiles and steel, have been particularly hard hit, he said, the administration still expects the overall economy to grow around 2.7 percent this year, a full percentage point lower than last year and half a percentage point less than the White House had expected when it completed its forecast for 2001 just a few months ago.
Many economists on Wall Street have been marking down their forecasts in recent weeks and concluding that the risks of a recession are growing. Although there is no precise definition of a recession, it is generally considered to be two or more consecutive quarters in which gross domestic product, or total output, shrinks.
Economists at Credit Suisse First Boston said today that they had cut their growth forecasts for the first half of the year "aggressively," to zero growth in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second quarter, down from 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively. 
"The difference between our forecast and a recession is semantics," their report said. "Outright contraction in G.D.P. in the first half of the year is well within the range of possible outcomes." 
Mr. Baily said one of the keys to keeping the economy going would be to stick to a path of using the budget surplus to pay down the national debt -- another way of warning the incoming Bush administration not to push for a tax cut so big that it would risk a return to deficits.
"This is not the time to abandon fiscal discipline in favor of large tax cuts," he said. Mr. Bush's team has said the surplus should be large enough to accommodate both a substantial tax cut and debt reduction, and that the stimulus of a tax cut would help kick-start the economy if it proves to be stalling.
The prosperity of the last eight years has provided Mr. Clinton and his team with perhaps their strongest claim to a positive legacy. As they prepare to leave office they have emphasized not the possible downturn in the business cycle but the broader changes in the economy since 1992.
Much of the report released today is taken up with a discussion of whether the economy has been fundamentally transformed in recent years by advances in computers and telecommunications, adept management by businesses and better economic policy at the federal level.
Its conclusion is that there is something new and different going on.
"The new economy is pervasive," Mr. Baily said. "It has transformed not only high technology, but virtually all sectors of the economy."
Mr. Baily said the changes were not a panacea and did not mean the business cycle was dead. But he said the economy was now characterized by a mutually reinforcing set of positive characteristics, including strong productivity growth, low inflation and unemployment, budget surpluses and strong growth in the United States relative to other industrialized nations.
The report touches on two of the biggest potential problems facing the economy, the low personal savings rate and the large trade and current account deficits. But in both cases, it suggests that the problems will more or less take care of themselves as the economy slows.
The administration's long-term forecast, while basically upbeat, also notes that two of the most positive trends of recent years will reverse somewhat over the next decade. The improvement in productivity, the most critical indicator of the economy's potential to grow without generating inflation, will throttle back somewhat, from its current rate of 3 percent a year to 2.3 percent in the middle of the decade and to 2.1 percent by the end of the decade, the administration forecast said.
At the same time, the unemployment rate is expected to drift upward, reflecting a gradual increase in the level at which unemployment can be expected to start generating inflation. By late in the decade, the administration said, the so-called nonacclerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu, is expected to rise from its current level of just over 4 percent to just over 5 percent. 
The unemployment rate, which was 4 percent in December, has hovered around that level for more than a year, and is expected by many analysts to begin rising this month as the economic slowdown becomes pronounced.
The administration also waded into a debate among economists about whether the improvements in productivity in recent years have been confined largely to the computer business. Its conclusion was that while technology companies have enjoyed outsized productivity gains, the improvement was also widespread across the economy.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Getting Credit Where Blame Is Due

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
A DEMOCRATIC judge who did not attend public schools and has no children in public schools has just overruled the governor and the Legislature to impose his own educational theories on public schools. In theory, this sounds to conservatives like the kind of arrogant judicial activism that has produced so much trouble in New York.
 In practice, though, it's hard to argue with Justice Leland DeGrasse's conclusion that the Legislature has shortchanged New York City's students. And in practice, it's hard to see how his decision Wednesday ordering the Legislature to revise its formulas could make city schools any worse, although one should never underestimate the creativity of our legislators. 
 When it comes to schools, they have interfered with everyone else's job while shirking their chief educational task: redressing the financial inequities among school districts. Almost every other job can be left to the local level, but redistributing wealth can only be done in Albany or Washington. 
Equitable redistribution, though, has been of less interest to the Legislature than dictating how school districts can spend the money. Besides promoting pet programs, legislators are experts at blocking reforms. Even when local officials are united in their desires, as Democrats and Republicans have been in calling for more mayoral control over the New York City school system, legislators can be counted on to put up a fight. 
They can afford to oppose even the most popular reforms, like charter schools, because parents have no way to punish them. Legislators virtually never face more than token opposition for re-election. As long as they avoid the wrath of the teachers' unions, criminal indictment and death, their seats are safe.
The judge's order, coupled with Gov. George E. Pataki's call for more control of schools at the local level, may spur some reforms in the way state aid is given out. At the very least, New York City should get a fairer share of state aid. At most, the city schools could get a hefty infusion of money, although the legislators are in no rush to provide it themselves. 
As usual, they are more interested in telling school districts what to do. Democratic legislators yesterday promoted new legislation that would force New York City to spend more of its own money on schools, a strategy that is brilliant in its brazenness. The legislators stand to get credit for handing out money to teachers and schools, and the mayor of New York stands to get blame for raising taxes.
In their eagerness to spend other people's budgets, the legislators seem to have caught the spirit of Justice DeGrasse's decision. His enthusiasm for higher teacher salaries was not dimmed by thoughts of higher taxes, or by evidence that the money might not buy much.
HE was not impressed by the studies of Eric Hanushek, an economist at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, showing that higher spending does not correlate with higher student achievement. Although the studies are detailed and well regarded even by academics who favor more spending on schools, Dr. Hanushek's work was not rigorous enough for the judge.
"His analyses, which focus only on gross per pupil spending," Justice DeGrasse wrote, "are of limited value absent an examination of the effects of particular inputs." If you can understand that sentence, you might want to contact Dr. Hanushek. He could probably use some help in figuring out what kind of study would meet the judge's exacting standards.
Justice DeGrasse's need for precision, though, waned when he dealt with another question: how do urban Catholic schools (which the judge himself attended) provide such a good education for so little money? He said the comparison was "not apt," dismissing it with a few highly debatable generalities about the supposed advantages of the Catholic system.
"Catholic schools enroll very few special-education children," he wrote, ignoring the fact that Catholic schools are cheaper even if you exclude those students. He said the Catholic system has fewer low-income students, ignoring studies that compare schools with similar socioeconomic populations and find better performance in the Catholic schools.
Justice DeGrasse also said, "The vast majority of Catholic schoolteachers are not unionized," as if that were somehow unfair or wrong. Unionized teachers should prosper if he and the State Legislature join to take control of the city's school budget. What the students will gain is anybody's guess.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's to Cut Staff 8%, With $14 Million Charge 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Bracing for mounting fines, legal expenses and a possible downturn in the art market, Sotheby's, the troubled auction house, said yesterday that it planned to cut about 8 percent of its worldwide staff, to about 1,900 employees from 2,050. The downsizing will result in a fourth-quarter charge of about $14 million, mostly for severance-related expenses. 
 "We have spent months reviewing all of our auction operations around the world," said William Ruprecht, president and chief executive, "and it's fair to say that our focus in the United States is principally on the high-end markets while in London we're making a commitment to the secondary sales room because we see an opportunity there in the middle market." 
 "We are not abandoning the markets that make Sotheby's Sotheby's," he added. 
About 75 departments of the company now hold auctions in areas ranging from paperweights and rare porcelains to old master and Impressionist paintings. But Sotheby's plans to operate its biggest money-making departments -- namely Impressionist, contemporary, old master and 19th-century paintings as well as jewelry and Asian art -- globally rather than regionally to sell objects most profitably.
Mr. Ruprecht estimated that over the next two years the reorganization would save the company $20 million in its live auction business and an additional $25 million in Sothebys.com, its Internet operations.
Sotheby's said yesterday that as of March 5 it would increase the amount it charges customers who buy on Sothebys.com to 15 percent of the first $15,000 that they spend and 10 percent thereafter. They now pay a flat rate of 10 percent.
Since introducing its online auction site a year ago, Sotheby's has spent about $80 million. The company originally had two sites, Sothebys.com and Sothebys.amazon.com, but abandoned its Amazon site in October. 
The company's expenses have risen significantly over the last year because of a continuing federal antitrust investigation into price-fixing and collusion with its archrival, Christie's. In October, Sotheby's pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws and agreed to pay a fine of $45 million, a figure that is still subject to approval by a federal judge. In February, its chairman and controlling shareholder, A. Alfred Taubman, resigned, as did Diana D. Brooks, its president and chief executive. Ms. Brooks pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws in October. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 23.
In November, a federal judge gave preliminary approval to a $512 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by more than 100,000 angry buyers and sellers against Sotheby's and Christie's. Mr. Taubman agreed to pay $156 million of Sotheby's $256 million share of the settlement. But this still leaves Sotheby's with $100 million to pay, $50 million in cash and $50 million in the form of certificates to sellers. The auction house is waiting for the judge to evaluate the economics of the coupons; he has asked both Sotheby's and Christie's to show their ability to pay the civil settlement. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 2. 
Last month, Moody's Investors Service, citing multimillion-dollar settlements growing out of civil litigation related to the antitrust investigation, downgraded the company's credit and debt rating to junk status.
Mr. Ruprecht denied that the cutbacks were a result of troubles with the Justice Department. "This is a thoughtful review," he said. "It is a set of strategies and directions for the business we began discussing last spring and summer. There's no question that the cost of the Justice Department investigation is significant, but this review is not driven by it."
In addition to the antitrust investigation, Sotheby's is completing a $150 million expansion of its headquarters on York Avenue. As part of cost-cutting efforts, the company plans to consolidate its five office and warehouse premises around Manhattan into its headquarters.
Shares of Sotheby's rose $1.13 yesterday, to $25.19.

California Barely Avoids First Scheduled Blackouts
California barely avoided its first-ever planned statewide power blackouts as longstanding electricity shortages combined with a storm that cut output at a nuclear power plant.
 In midafternoon, state officials said the blackouts, which would have affected about 1.5 million people, were inevitable. But about 5 p.m., the California Independent System Operator said it had just barely managed to avoid the cutoffs by purchasing some more power from out of state and persuading many customers to cut their use.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Fell in December 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Prices of imports fell modestly in December, and unemployment claims fell in the latest week despite a trend of growing joblessness, government reports showed today.
 The mixed economic news offered little fresh perspective to the overall picture of a slowing economy. 
Economists said the data would not distract the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates at the end of the month. 
 Import prices fell 0.5 percent in December after gaining 0.1 percent in November, the Labor Department said. Economists had expected a drop of 0.2 percent.
Import prices were driven lower largely by a 9.3 percent plunge in the price of petroleum imports, while prices of natural and manufactured gas soared 32.3 percent. Excluding petroleum products, import prices rose 0.9 percent in December after a 0.1 percent dip in the previous month.
Export prices, meanwhile, dropped 0.1 percent in December after being unchanged in November.
The overall decline in import prices could encourage domestic producers to keep their prices down, which in turn will help keep domestic inflation muted.
Since last year, overall import prices have increased 3.5 percent, although much of that gain came from petroleum. December's 0.9 percent rise in import prices excluding petroleum goods was the biggest increase on record since the Labor Department began issuing such monthly data in December 1988.
The Labor Department said weekly jobless claims fell 36,000, to 345,000, in the week ended Jan. 6. Economists had expected 374,000.
But a four-week moving average of the claims data, viewed as more indicative of the trend in the labor market, rose to 363,000 from 356,750 in the previous week.

HEADLINE: THE POWER CRISIS: THE RESULTS; 
The Dog Day in June The Lights Went Out

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
As California energy officials initiated rolling blackouts today to conserve thinning power reserves, companies throughout Silicon Valley dimmed lights, turned off heating systems and switched on backup generators to keep the high-technology industry humming.
 The actions, taken by leading companies like Cisco Systems, Intel and Sun Microsystems, reminded many here of the scorching day last summer when the lights went out. 
 In Silicon Valley, where electricity has been the mother's milk of the technology boom, the risk once again of blackouts like the one last June threatens the economy's very lifeblood.
Steve Lane remembers June 14 as the day his employer, SDL Inc., like many companies in the Valley, lost millions of dollars as its manufacturing plant sat idle without electricity. Mr. Lane, a senior facilities manager, also recalls it as the day diesel fuel ruined a fine dress shirt and pair of slacks. 
With temperatures soaring to 109 degrees that day, straining California's already fatigued power grid, SDL received a call from Pacific Gas and Electric, California's biggest utility, saying that the state's power grid operator had ordered the local electricity supply temporarily shut down to reduce stress on the system.
And so, Mr. Lane recalled recently, he and several colleagues found themselves crouched above the company's burly diesel generator in dress clothes, struggling with five-gallon buckets to keep the fuel tanks filled and emergency power in the plant, which makes lasers for fiber optic networks.
In the end, SDL, which has since bought stronger generators, said the failure that day cost it more than $3 million in repairs and lost production.
"Most of us had no idea, before June 14, how serious that problem was," Mr. Lane said. 
The problems at SDL and Silicon Valley in general serve as a magnified illustration of the energy crisis in California, where a three-year experiment with deregulation has made wholesale energy costs soar as rising demand collided with scarce supplies of power. State price caps prevent utilities from passing on higher prices to consumers. Utilities say they have lost about $12 billion from the situation and will go bankrupt without some government help.
Like most problems in the peninsula just south of here, including increased traffic and housing shortages, the energy problem is caused largely by good fortune. The population has boomed, but the improvements to the infrastructure used to move energy around the region have lagged. High-technology companies, the legions who came to work for them and the computer devices they create have voracious appetites for electricity.
The region's need for power has grown about 5 percent a year, triple the statewide rate. Consumption in Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, has grown by one-third since 1994, and utilities officials expect demand to grow another 11 percent by 2004. Over that decade, peak electricity use is expected to increase by 1,052 megawatts, enough energy to power more than one million homes.
"Every time a company expands, every time a home is built, every time somebody, thank God, gets enough money into his hands to buy a computer for the kids, that's another kilowatt or megawatt in a state and a region that doesn't have a lot to spare," said Scott Blakey, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E. "And if it does have it to spare, it's at a price the utilities are becoming fast unable to afford."
Many high-technology companies also demand an unrelenting flow of power round the clock. Even momentary blackouts are disastrous: semiconductor plants can take days to recover, and companies that are hosts to Web sites for e-commerce can lose angry customers if the sites go down. Trade associations estimate that the industry lost hundreds of millions of dollars during the June 14 failures. 
Ed Quiroz, a regulatory analyst with the California Public Utilities Commission, said a typical commercial office building consumes 10 to 15 watts a square foot. In contrast, a building that houses Internet networking centers or servers for Web hosts uses 120 to 200 watts a square foot. A 10-story building filled with Web host centers can consume up to 40 megawatts, enough energy to power 40,000 homes.
These companies settled into Silicon Valley, the region that grid officials call the most susceptible to power failures in an already energy-starved state. The population boom, insufficient transmission lines and the region's own failure to produce more power locally, despite its needs, are making a tight energy market even tighter.
"The digital economy's demand on electric reliability far outstrips what the current infrastructure is able to provide," Mr. Quiroz said.
So far, most of the largest high-technology companies have been spared from catastrophic blackouts, which industry leaders estimate could cost companies anywhere from $1 million a day to $1 million an hour. Intel, Agilent and others have struck deals with the power system's operators, promising to turn off lights and air-conditioners to reduce demand in exchange for being bypassed in rolling blackouts like those called for today.
Yet the threat of more power shortages like the one that crippled SDL has frightened executives far more than the temporary rate increases announced last week that will raise their energy bills by 7 percent to 15 percent.
Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a powerful trade association with 190 member companies, said nearly every high-technology manufacturer in Silicon Valley had drawn up plans to shift production out of state if necessary. Craig Barrett, chief executive of Intel, announced this week that his company was unlikely to expand in California until energy became more consistent.
"What Craig said is echoed by just about every C.E.O. that I have spoken with," Mr. Guardino said. "The message is, 'Either get a reliable source of power or we can't expand here.' "
Added Mr. Guardino, "This is probably the biggest challenge to our economy, here in Silicon Valley and statewide, that we have faced in decades."
Companies are responding to the power shortage in many ways. Large manufacturers have bought expensive diesel generators, which environmental regulators fear will contribute to air pollution. Oracle, the second-largest software company in the world, recently built a $6 million substation to carry enough energy from California's grid to power its 1.6 million square feet of office space. But diesel generators are on hand to keep the data center, the core of Oracle's Internet business, from crashing during a blackout, the company said. 
Many companies have also devised ways to quickly reduce their lighting and air-conditioning when utilities warn that power supplies are low.
The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, formed in 1977 by David Packard, a co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, created an energy task force, with 35 member companies, to protect the industry's interests and discuss conservation methods. Last week, the group supported a pilot program, created by the Electric Power Research Institute, located in Palo Alto, which allows companies to track their electricity consumption as it is used to better manage their power.
But many argue that the region's biggest shortfall is its lack of local power plants. Generating power locally is considered crucial for efficiency because the farther electricity has to go along wires, the weaker it becomes and the more grid space it ties up.
Gov. Gray Davis recently called the creation of new generators the key to keeping up with power demands. His administration has approved construction of nine new power plants, all outside Silicon Valley, which would add 6,278 megawatts to the state's supplies within five years.
Though Silicon Valley uses more than 2,900 megawatts on peak days, it produces fewer than 200 megawatts, through small plants at universities and private companies.
"Clearly, the San Jose area has to be willing to look at generation in its own area, and not just bring it from other places," said Patrick Dorinson, director of communications for the California Independent System Operator, which controls the power grid.
Two large development companies, the Calpine Corporation and Bechtel Enterprises Inc., are trying to build a 600-megawatt natural gas plant in Coyote Valley, one of the remaining undeveloped sections of San Jose. Tucked against a hill in South San Jose, where existing transmission towers already help carry power from Canada to Mexico, the $400 million Metcalf Energy Center, if approved, would direct nearly all of the power it creates into San Jose and its surrounding areas, a Calpine spokeswoman said.
"At some point, we've got to take responsibility for the power we need," said Steve Tedesco, president of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, which supports the project.
But Bechtel and Calpine have been stymied by a potent combination of resident and corporate resistance. The local neighborhood association and Cisco, which in October received approval to build its new headquarters for 20,000 employees less than a mile from the land being considered for the power plant, waged a successful lobbying campaign against the project, citing concerns about air quality and incompatibility with the surroundings.
Although Cisco's plans face their own challenge in a voter referendum as early as April, the company and the association, with the support of Mayor Ron Gonzales, persuaded the San Jose City Council to reject a petition to change the zoning regulations, which now limit the rural area to office space.
"We're not antibusiness or anti-development; it's simply a bad location," Elizabeth Cord, president of the Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group, said in an interview.
Accusing the neighborhood association of a not-in-my-backyard mentality, the developers have asked the California Energy Commission to approve the project despite the failure to procure a zoning change. Hearings before the commission began this week, with a final decision expected in May or June. The commission's staff has already recommended approval, calling the benefits to San Jose substantial.
Even if construction is approved, the plant will not be operating until the summer of 2003. In the meantime, industry analysts say, companies and the government must work together to both save energy and find new ways to quench the growing thirst for electricity.
"You want to grow an economy in a new set of directions, and the means just aren't there," said Mr. Quiroz, the Public Utilities Commission analyst. "Somebody is going to have to spend the money to provide a new infrastructure and beef it up."

HEADLINE: THE POWER CRISIS: THE FINANCES; 
The Money Trail In California's Energy Debacle

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
Where did the money go?
 Since last spring, California's two biggest utilities have spent $12 billion more for power than they have collected from ratepayers. With the utilities threatening bankruptcy, the Legislature called into emergency session, companies putting off expansion plans and residents braced for rate increases, the search for explanations -- or scapegoats -- has reached a fever pitch. 
 "Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians hostage," Gov. Gray Davis thundered in a speech this week condemning power producers, before flying off to a Washington meeting called by President Clinton seeking solutions to the state's energy mess.
But understanding where the money went is a more complicated matter than pointing to a few rapacious corporations. For while billions have poured out of the state, that flow, many experts say, is an inevitable result of the ill-designed deregulation program that California put in place three years ago, at the behest in part of its now sickly utilities. 
Today, with storms knocking out transmission lines in the northern part of the state, California just avoided blackouts while state and federal officials and utility executives continued to try to hammer out a longer-term remedy.
Certainly, much of California's immense electric bill has been paid to companies based outside the state, with the owners of power plants and concerns that trade and market electricity capturing much of it. 
One of the power companies, Houston-based Dynegy Inc., had one of the best performing stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 last year, its shares more than tripling. Last month, the utility in Portland, Ore., Portland General Electric, abruptly withdrew a proposed 16.5 percent rate increase for its 700,000 customers, after calculating that it could raise the same millions by selling surplus power to California and other places. 
Analysts contend that some energy sellers fueled the crisis by bidding up prices. Though the marketers note that past inquiries have never found evidence of abuse, investigators from the state attorney general's office and other authorities are looking into charges of market manipulation.
Yet more than one-third of the electricity sold in the state by the companies now being demonized used to be controlled by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison -- until the utilities were required to sell power plants as part of deregulation. The two utilities' parent companies -- PG&E and Edison International, respectively -- collected $3 billion from those sales, and they have made about $3 billion more selling power into California's overheated electricity market from plants they were allowed to keep.
Even the municipal power authority in Los Angeles -- considered a dowager when it held onto its plants while deregulation swirled around it -- has made an extra $200 million selling power over the last two years. 
None of this, in hindsight, should have been a surprise. Since deregulation was first approved four years ago, all of the players have pursued their self-interests.
The trouble is that the marketplace in which those interests have clashed turns out to have been ill-conceived. And a power surplus that made the utilities hungry for deregulation has turned into a shortage, with the state's booming economy straining both generating capacity and the natural gas supplies that run many of the power plants. Throw in a few untimely generator shutdowns and cold, dry weather in the Northwest that reduced the supply of hydroelectric power from that region, and the result is a recipe for a debacle.
"California designed the world's most complicated market that people said would not work well and which they've been trying to fix ever since," said Paul Joskow, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Among other miscalculations, the obscure state agency that was supposed to ensure the reliability of the state's power grid instead has added to the volatility in prices, critics say. 
That agency, the California Independent System Operator, was intended to be the power buyer of last resort for Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, which is owned by Sempra Energy. But on some days of high power demand, it has procured up to 30 percent of the state's electricity needs. With its employees focused solely on keeping the lights on -- and with the bills to be paid not by itself but by the utilities -- critics say the agency was ripe to be outfoxed by the power suppliers.
"My people are not trained as traders or arbitragers," conceded Jim McIntosh, director of scheduling for the system operator.
When traders were asking $2,000 for a megawatt-hour of electricity, enough to light 1,000 typical homes for an hour, Mr. McIntosh and one of his bosses refused. 
But the price they settled on -- $1,500 -- was arbitrary, Mr. McIntosh acknowledged. Many of his colleagues, he conceded, believed that generators could produce that amount of electricity for about $250, even with higher natural gas prices.
The objective, he said, was to select a price that assured California had enough electricity. "No one wanted to make the decision on what was the right price to drop off people's service," said Mr. McIntosh, a former Pacific Gas and Electric executive. "You are putting a price on the health and safety of people."
Meanwhile, by freezing rates for the utilities' business and residential customers during the early years of deregulation -- in a move to protect consumers -- the state gave those consumers no reason to curtail power use even as wholesale prices rose more than fiftyfold at their peaks. 
California's energy problems took on crisis proportions only when San Diego Gas and Electric, having sold all its power plants, was freed to pass along its wholesale costs to customers last summer, driving bills up 300 percent during air-conditioning season. Unable to do the same, Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric have had to pay up to $1,400 a megawatt-hour for electricity, while charging customers about $64.
Meanwhile, the state's deregulation plan did little to encourage power plant construction -- no major plants have been built for 12 years -- even as power reserves drifted dangerously low. Utilities were discouraged from securing power supplies through long-term contracts. At the same time, state pollution-control laws idled some plants and forced power producers to buy expensive emissions credits for others. 
Even so, the energy squeeze of the last year was a boon for both power plant owners and electricity traders.
Reliant Energy, a Houston utility whose wholesale energy unit owns several plants in California, said it made $90 million in operating income from California alone during the third quarter of 2000 -- more than twice what the entire subsidiary made in the period the year before. The Calpine Corporation, a San Jose, Calif., company that operates plants in Northern California and elsewhere, in the third-quarter had per-share earnings that rose about 150 percent from a year earlier. 
The gains were not confined to the 50 states. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, the government-owned utility in Canada's western province, had revenues from its electricity-trading business increase nearly fourfold from April through September, to about $1.5 billion, in large part from sales to California. 
Large industrial users of electricity have gotten into the act, too. Officials at the Bonneville Power Administration, which sells wholesale power across the Northwest, say three aluminum producers will collect well over $500 million by shutting down operations and then reselling the electricity they buy under cheap long-term contracts. The proceeds will be split between ratepayers in the Northwest, employees at the plants and the companies.
As for the money that the parent companies of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have made from selling plants and electricity, company officials say the deregulation plan requires that those profits be applied to paying off the costs of nuclear and other facilities built long ago -- and not to today's power costs. 
Power generators, for their part, say their profits, however large, were earned fairly. 
At Dynegy, for example, pretax earnings from the operations that include its California plants rose to $106.4 million in the third quarter of 2000 from $22 million a year earlier, largely because of sales in California. 
But Rob Doty, the company's chief financial officer, said Dynegy made "very little" profit from the state in the fourth quarter, because of the high prices it paid for natural gas to run its power plants, emission credits and other costs. And he dismissed the charge that companies like his were abusing California's energy market, noting that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had rejected such allegations in the past.
"That has been looked at several times, most notably by the F.E.R.C., and nobody has found any evidence of market manipulation and profiteering," he said. "It also ignores the fact that we have very substantial costs we face." Indeed, rising gas prices and worries about the California utilities' ability to pay their bills have knocked down the stock prices of Dynegy and some other power producers this month. 
However, a handful of studies suggest that power generators and marketers may have exercised undue influence in California's untidy market. Research that Mr. Joskow of M.I.T. and a colleague, Edward Kahn, conducted for Southern California Edison concluded that power generators "engaged in behavior to drive prices above competitive levels," Mr. Joskow said.
John Stout, a senior vice president at Reliant Energy, said his company studied California's market and concluded that it was competing energy buyers, not sellers, who drove up costs. 
But, he conceded, if out-of-state generators have an advantage, "it is because someone handed it to them."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Temporary Apartments for Corporate Executives

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Next month, residents will begin occupying the 56-unit apartment building nearing completion at 401 West 22nd Street in Chelsea. But unlike neighboring renters, they will not be decorating rooms or moving in furniture. They are leasing furnished apartments from one of the nation's leading suppliers of temporary housing for executives. 
 Execustay, the corporate housing division of the Marriott International hotel group, has leased all the units in the seven-story building at Ninth Avenue for two years from the developer, 401-402 Realty of Manhattan. Since Execustay signed the lease in the fall, it has in turn rented 85 percent of the studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units to corporate clients, including Morgan Stanley, said David Lorenzo, vice president of the New York office of Execustay. 
 This is one of a handful of small residential buildings that providers of corporate housing are leasing to meet what they say is a continuing demand. Another is the six-story, 40-apartment building at 316 East 63rd Street, between First and Second Avenues, which was developed by M-1 Properties of Manhattan. 
Furnished Quarters of Manhattan, which specializes in corporate housing in the city, is leasing all the studio and one-bedroom apartments in that six-story building. Since it began marketing the apartments in October, it has rented them all, including 10 to Chase, said Steven Brown, a principal at Furnished Quarters. 
Companies use such housing for employees being relocated or attending training programs and needing to stay in Manhattan for a month or longer, and who want to be in a residential setting with some hotel amenities, like maid service. 
While whole buildings dedicated to corporate housing are scarce, there are others in which groups of apartments have been set aside for this use. For instance, 86 of the 520 rentals at the Ocean at 1 West Street in the financial district are being leased by Oakwood Worldwide of Los Angeles as furnished corporate apartments. 
A developer typically leases an apartment for at least a year to the corporate housing provider, who decorates and furnishes them. In some cases, the developers themselves have leased the units to residents. An example is Cambridge Development of Manhattan, which has turned the top 13 floors of the 16-story Romanesque Revival building at 56 Pine Street, a designated city landmark, into the Cambridge Club with 78 apartments. The lower floors of the building are now used as offices. 
Corporate housing has been on the rise since 1997, residential brokers say. That market, like the city's residential and lodging markets, has benefited from a strong local and national economy that has led companies to expand and to add employees, said Joseph Barbaccia, president of Joseph Gregory Marketing, a Manhattan brokerage firm that specializes in corporate housing.
He is also the rental agent for the Cambridge Club, where Salomon Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers leased the studio and one-bedroom apartments soon after they came on the market in the summer. Monthly rents are $2,850 to $4,450, on average.
Rising occupancy and room rates of hotels in the city have also helped increase the number of long-term quarters. Professionals in the corporate housing industry said the monthly cost for their units was 25 percent to 40 percent less than hotel rooms. 
For developers, the benefit is profit, said Andrew Heiberger, president of CitiHabitats, a rental brokerage firm in Manhattan. He said corporate housing providers often paid 10 percent more in rent than traditional tenants. Because the providers also furnish and maintain the apartments, he added, they reduce the landlord's operating expenses.
But what happens if the hospitality market flattens? While hotel occupancy rates were high in 2000, some market studies noted a slackening of the occupancy rate toward the end of the year.
Arthur B. Adler, managing director of the hotel practice at Jones Lang LaSalle, said his firm's studies led him to expect Manhattan hotels to remain at their current 84 percent occupancy rate at least through 2001. He added that even if there were a slowdown, it was unlikely that all corporate apartments would be dumped on the market at one time. 
Mr. Barbaccia added that in slower times, when companies start cutting back, they hire consultants for short-term assignments who will need corporate housing. 
Mr. Lorenzo of Execustay, which is leasing the entire building at 401 West 22nd Street, said it was the first time his company had taken over an entire building. "It will be the first real corporate housing in Chelsea," he added. 
He said monthly rents for the studios and apartments, with 530 to 950 square feet, were now $3,900 to $8,400, including weekly housekeeping, but change seasonally. 
With the addition of the Chelsea apartments, the company has more than tripled its apartment total in Manhattan in the last year. It now operates 750, Mr. Lorenzo said, and plans to bring that to 1,000 by the end of the year. 
At the 63rd Street building, on the site where the Martha Graham Center for Contemporary Dance stood for nearly 50 years, Furnished Quarters is leasing all 40 units for three years, with two renewal options of three years each. Monthly rents for the studio and one-bedroom apartments, including weekly housekeeping, are $3,600 to $5,000.
Mr. Brown said his company planned to add 100 units this year to its inventory of 300 apartments, which includes brownstones. "Even if the economy cools, corporate housing is the more affordable alternative for companies," he said.

HEADLINE: THE RULING ON THE SCHOOLS: THE SOLUTIONS; 
Answering Those Who Say More Money Can't Help

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The decision Wednesday overturning New York State's system of financing public schools was based on an assumption that has come under severe challenge in recent years: that the key to higher student achievement is more spending on schools. 
 Recent efforts at education reform, many of them led by conservatives, have started with the assumptions that poorly performing school systems are wasteful and inefficient and that no reasonable amount of money will make them significantly better. 
 "It's clear that we can't solve the education problem with more money," said Steven G. Rivkin, an associate professor of economics at Amherst College and a leading researcher on the issue. "The schools could do a lot better with the money that is now being spent. But you're not going to get a lot of improvement for a dollar of new spending without changing the underlying structure of the schools." 
Those reformers have tried to raise student achievement by improving standards and accountability and by promoting charter schools, vouchers and other market-related mechanisms. And they have held up the lower-spending parochial schools as an example of why money does not make a difference.
The changes they have made have improved student performance in some cases, but not in all. Some charter schools have failed and had to close and many others have produced results no better than the public schools they competed against.
In his decision ordering public school financing to be restructured, Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan drew a direct link between money and better schools. He did so, however, by making a distinction that is often ignored: that spending is meaningful only when the money is properly deployed.
"That is the key phrase regarding this issue," said Ronald F. Ferguson, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who testified for the plaintiffs at the trial challenging the financing system. 
"The folks who try to deflect discussion away from the question of whether resources matter usually try to point out that there's a lot of waste in the system," Mr. Ferguson said. "But there's no reason to assume going forward that any new money will not be well spent. Plenty of people will be watching to see what changes result." 
A school district that chooses to spend money on patronage jobs is unlikely to have the success of one that puts a higher priority on the training of teachers. But the question of whether money makes a difference focuses less on whether a school system is bureaucratic and wasteful and more properly on where the money goes. The judge mentioned several ways of effective use of more money: hiring more teachers and thereby reducing class size, paying teachers more and thereby attracting better candidates, improving school buildings, and buying books and computers.
"Contrary to defendants' argument, increased educational resources, if properly deployed, can have a significant and lasting effect on student performance," Justice DeGrasse wrote. "There is a causal link between funding and educational opportunity."
The judge also swept aside several arguments against giving more money to the New York City public schools, saying it is irrelevant that their spending is already far higher than the national average. Given the higher costs of operating here and a student population that requires more help, such comparisons are unwarranted, he said.
In doing so, the judge discounted the testimony of Eric A. Hanushek of the Hoover Institution at Stanford, who is perhaps the foremost advocate of the position that money does not make a big difference.
Dr. Hanushek testified that his research sometimes found a negative relationship between spending and the number of students in various New York State school districts who received a Regents diploma, the highest graduating level. 
Among elementary and middle schools in New York City, he found that high-performing schools spent less money than did schools that performed lower. 
But the judge faulted that evidence, saying the studies did not take into account the cumulative effect of differences in spending over many years of schooling. In addition, he discounted studies that looked only at overall spending, rather than how much money goes to specific areas, like class size or teacher training.
The judge also took exception to the view that public schools should take a lesson from the city's parochial schools, although the state had said, in its defense, that the church schools did better while spending less than the public schools. 
According to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, the city's Catholic high schools spend about $5,000 per student and pay their teachers less than public schools do. Roughly 99 percent of the archdiocese's students graduate in four years, and nearly three-quarters pass enough Regents tests to qualify for the top-level diploma. Minority students make up two-thirds of the population, and more than half of all Catholic school students qualify for federal free-lunch programs.
Those results are vastly different from the New York City school system, which spends about $10,000 per student. Only half of its high school students make it to 12th grade in four years, and only 12 percent earn Regents diplomas. Minority groups make up 84 percent of the student population, with roughly three-quarters eligible for federal free-lunch programs.
But Justice DeGrasse said Catholic schools did not have special-education classes, which cost twice as much as general-education classes. Catholic schools also can expel students whom they consider serious troublemakers while public schools must educate everyone, the judge said. 
William C. Thompson Jr., president of the Board of Education, said student achievement would improve when the city got the money it had been denied. "For the last few years, we've seen the restoration of a school system that has standards, that demands results and is starting to focus on improving itself," Mr. Thompson said. The extra money produced by this case "will not be thrown away," he said.

HEADLINE: THE POWER CRISIS: THE SHORTAGES; 
Blackouts Are Narrowly Averted As California Struggles for Power

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
California barely avoided its first planned power blackouts across the state today, as longstanding electricity shortages and a storm that slashed output at a nuclear power plant nearly pushed the state over a precipice on which it has been teetering for months.
 In midafternoon state officials said the blackouts, which would have affected about 1.5 million people, were inevitable. But about 5 p.m., as demand rose toward the winter peak hours, the California Independent System Operator said it had barely managed to avoid the cutoffs by buying power out of state and persuading many customers to cut their use. 
 "At this point it looks like we'll make it," said Patrick Dorinson, the spokesman for the Independent System Operator, which has managed the state's power system since it was deregulated two years ago.
Jim Detmers, the managing director of operations for the system, said he was convinced this morning that the blackouts would be unavoidable because the power supply was only 2 percent greater than demand. 
The state, which normally must import about 15 percent of its electricity, has had to scramble nearly every day for six months to satisfy the enormous demand. But some planned shutdowns of generators for maintenance today, and the winter storm that forced a nuclear plant to reduce output, left the system with 15,000 megawatts less capacity than normal, a huge loss.
"That pushed us over the edge," said Kellan Fluckiger, the chief operating officer of the system. "I can't think of a day when I've seen that many megawatts off."
Some power users did suffer. The major utilities have some customers who have agreed to give up their power first when there are shortages in return for rates about 25 percent lower. Most of those interruptible customers, mostly large industrial and commercial users, lost their power early Thursday, officials said.
The state government also announced that it was slashing its own substantial power demands by 5 percent immediately, which meant that everything from office lights to huge aqueduct pumps were shut down to conserve energy and avoid or mitigate the emergency.
Some areas, like the cities of Los Angeles, Sacramento and Pasadena, were unaffected or little affected because they have municipal power companies. These municipal utilities operate outside of the state's deregulated system, and most have sufficient generating capacity.
While California has reached its most dire power warning stage, called a Stage 3 alert, several times since the energy crisis struck over the summer, this would have been the first time that the Independent System Operator would have ordered the next step, a planned process of switching off customers.
Almost pushing the state over the brink today was the near shutdown of the big Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, near San Luis Obispo, on the central coast.
Normally the plant generates 2,200 megawatts of power, but a major storm pushed up waves of nearly 20 feet today that forced massive beds of kelp into the big pipes that suck in seawater for cooling. Operators had to cut output to 20 percent.
In addition, a power plant in Montana that normally sells about 200 megawatts an hour to California was out of service today, the Independent System Operator said. Officials said they were not sure why.
Because of a quirk in the state's system of transmission lines, the blackouts would have had a greater impact on the north than the south. 
The problem is a transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley, near Bakersfield, known as Path 15, which cannot handle the same capacity as the grids to the north and south of it.
Since power normally flows from south to north in California at this time of year because of the colder weather, that slowed the transmission of power and forced customers in the north to absorb more of the blackouts. 
Given the strong warnings when the Stage 3 alert was declared at 8:50 a.m., most businesses prepared for the first shutdown ever.
For instance, late this afternoon, Agilent Technologies was bracing itself for a blackout at its corporate offices in Silicon Valley. About 400 employees planned to turn off computers, equipment and lights between 4:30 and 7 p.m., relying on generators for emergency lighting.
An Agilent spokeswoman said she expected the company's semiconductor manufacturing plant to avoid blackouts. The plant lies in Santa Clara, where companies like Agilent and Intel have an arrangement with the municipal power company.
The companies, which stand to lose millions of dollars in production costs if power fails, can keep their power if they reduce electricity consumption by 10 percent during emergencies like today's.
California has been running critically short of power since last summer, in part because of rapid population growth throughout the West and an increase in demand because of the robust economy. 
Very few new power plants have been built in the state over the past decade to meet this demand. California imports a large portion of of its electricity, and the rates that the utilities pay for this power on the wholesale market have been soaring, adding a financial crisis to the ongoing energy crisis.
Top state and federal officials have been meeting in Washington in recent days to try to hammer out a comprehensive solution to the problem. California's governor, Gray Davis, declared earlier this week that the deregulation plan was a failure and called for major state intervention in the power market.
Officials said that, though the blackouts were expected to last for just an hour and a half or so at a time, they underscored the fragility of a grid that powers the largest state in the country, with about 34 million residents, and one of the most economically vital and vibrant. 
Were it a separate country, California's economy would be the sixth largest in the world, yet residents, businesses and industries have had to contend with the threat of blackouts for more than six months.
The crisis has pushed the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, have been pushed almost into bankruptcy.
Under California's oddly crafted deregulation formula, the utilities must buy most of their power at unregulated prices on a state-run wholesale market. But the rates they can charge their customers are capped until March of next year.
Wholesale prices rocketed well above retail price caps last year, leaving the two big utilities with more than $12 billion in losses, a figure that is growing. 
In response to the financial strains, Pacific Gas and Electric told its employees today that it was laying off 325 people immediately and would lay off another 675 employees in the coming months. That comes after 180 layoffs in December.
The blackouts are planned to follow a highly complex procedure. The utilities assign customers in advance to various blocks.
The blocks are not geographic. John Nelson, a Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman, said the company spreads them out so that no community suffers more than another.
After the Independent System Operator gives the word, usually just minutes in advance, the utilities shut down their first block and wait to see if they must roll to the next one.
Operators of the system said that they anticipated less strain on Friday. But the system will be struggling for a long time.
"We don't have enough generating resources for our state, and those we do have are old and they break a lot," Mr. Fluckiger said. "I believe these difficulties will be with us for the next couple of years, until major infrastructure changes are in place."

Grim Reports From Hewlett And Gateway

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Investors in computer companies took a double blow to their already diminished hopes for 2001 late yesterday. Gateway announced disappointing fourth-quarter earnings and layoffs, and Hewlett-Packard said it would fall short of Wall Street's projections for its current quarter.
 Gateway, based in San Diego, in late November became the first company to warn that personal computer sales were surprisingly weak at the onset of the holiday shopping season. Yesterday, it said sales had not picked up in December as much as it had expected. This not only eroded earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31, but left the industry with swollen inventories that will hurt earnings prospects through the first six months of 2001. 
 "There's no way to sugarcoat the next several months," said Jeffrey Weitzen, Gateway's president and chief executive.
Gateway said that it would streamline manufacturing and consolidate its purchasing with fewer vendors as part of efforts to limit the earnings damage by cutting costs. Those moves will eliminate about 2,400 jobs, or 10 percent of Gateway's worldwide work force, and result in a $50 million charge against earnings in the first quarter of this year, the company warned.
The announcement from Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and sells a far broader range of products, was in some ways more ominous. Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, had bucked the gathering gloom in early December by repeating previous projections that the company expected 15 to 17 percent revenue growth in the fiscal year ending April 30.
But yesterday, Ms. Fiorina said the company's revenue would grow in the low- to midsingle-digits in the current quarter ending Jan. 31, and that its earnings would be 35 to 40 cents a share, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of 42 cents. She also declined to reaffirm previous projections for the rest of the fiscal year.
"It's clear there's been a significant change in market conditions in recent weeks," Ms. Fiorina said. Not only has consumer spending in the United States been below company estimates, which she described as "conservative," but businesses have become more cautious about buying Hewlett-Packard's computers, software and consulting services.
Ms. Fiorina said that the company was running into weakening demand across the board in the United States and that it was not losing market share. "December was like somebody turned the lights out," she said in a conference call with analysts.
Hewlett-Packard's move to reduce expectations was no surprise, but it cut revenue growth projections more deeply than analysts had anticipated.
"Carly is shifting to a more cautious approach to try to regain credibility," said George Elling, who follows the company for Lehman Brothers.
The announcements came at the end of what had been a buoyant day for technology stocks on Wall Street. Hewlett-Packard had risen 63 cents, to $32.38, and Gateway had jumped $2.96, to $22.90. But after the announcements, both tumbled in after-hours trading, with Hewlett down as much as $2 and Gateway off as much as $3.39. Other stocks caught in the after-hours downdraft included Microsoft, Dell Computer, and Intel.
"We have an economic problem that is widening and deepening," said Donald Young, who follows computer companies for UBS Warburg. "A lot of high-tech companies are feeling it."
Gateway executives, in a conference call with analysts, said its problems were not entirely a result of deteriorating market conditions. The company said that it had not cut expenses fast enough in December and that it had fumbled a product introduction in Asia. But Gateway stressed that the financial problems did not give it any reason to second-guess its "beyond the box" strategy, which is aimed at shifting its emphasis from personal computers to selling a broad range of consumer electronic devices that will connect to computers and to the Internet. The strategy includes expanding its own chain of retail stores.
Gateway said it lost $94.3 million, or 29 cents a diluted share, on revenues of $2.37 billion, in contrast to a profit of $126 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $2.55 billion a year ago. The loss in the recent quarter included a one-time $187 million pretax charge related to the declining value of Gateway's portfolio of investments in other technology companies. Excluding the charges, Gateway would have earned $37.6 million, or 12 cents a share, in the recent quarter, a decline of more than 68 percent from a year earlier.
As tough as the fourth quarter was on Gateway's profits, the current quarter promises to be even more challenging. Gateway said it lowered personal computer prices by 10 percent in December but had generally let other companies lead the way on price cuts. In the future, the company said, it plans to be a more aggressive participant in the unfolding personal computer price war even though it lost money on that part of its business in the recent quarter.

Clinton's Last Memo

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Memo to: The Arab Street
From: President Bill Clinton
 Dear ladies and gentlemen, over the last few years I've often written your leaders, but now that my term is ending I've decided my last letter should be to you, the Arab masses, the Arab street, who have paid such a high price for this ongoing conflict. 
 I'm going to be blunt. I've done all I could to build a fair, realistic pathway out of the Arab-Israeli conflict for both you and the Israelis, but if you want to continue fighting it out and avoiding a deal that gives you 95 percent of what you want, well, there's nothing more I can do.
But there is something I can say, and it's this: What troubles me most about the mood on the Arab street today is the hostility I detect there to modernization, globalization, demo cratization and the information revolution. What you do with the Israelis is up to you now, but what you do with your own societies is going to affect the stability of the whole Middle East. 
Where other countries are focused on developing world-class competitive industries, you are still focused on protecting your uncompetitive ones. Where others are aggressively trading with the world, you barely trade with each other. Where others are freeing their presses, you are still controlling yours. Where other world leaders are building their legitimacy by pushing education, most of yours are still building their legitimacy by pushing a religious conflict. Where others are seeking foreign investors in order to create jobs for their young people, you are driving off foreign investors with unfriendly bureaucracies and pursuit of a conflict that scares everyone away from your region. In an age when others are making microchips, you are making potato chips.
I would have thought that this reality would be a hotly debated subject among your elites, and I know some have raised it. But for the most part your intellectuals, pundits and parliamentarians, rather than fostering an honest debate, prefer to make excuses. When I ask Arab leaders why South Korea had roughly the same per capita income in the early 1950's as Syria or Egypt, and now South Korea is a highly developed country and Syria and Egypt are still developing, the answer I get is that the Arab states had to fight wars. Well, South Korea had a struggle with North Korea for decades. Another excuse I get is that the Arab states had population problems. Well, so does China, and it's been growing at 10 percent per year.
Your intellectuals seem more interested in protecting their perks, by coming up with excuses for the weakness of their regimes, rather than fostering an honest debate.
I realize that the issue of Israel, and who rules over the Muslim holy places in Jerusalem, touches the soul of the Arab street. I would not think of asking you to give up on controlling your religious sites. But I would urge you to consider asking more than one question. Who rules al Aksa mosque is critical for the dignity of every Arab and Palestinian Muslim in the modern world. But what sort of education you offer your kids, what sort of economy you build and what sort of rule of law you establish will also determine your dignity and standing in the modern world. You should be concerned with answering the old questions, but you have to recognize that they are not the only questions.
There has to be a balance. A society that forgets its roots will never be stable. But a society that is preoccupied with its roots, and is asking the question only of who owns which root, will never grow into the world or bear fruit. Your intellectuals don't care. They eat the fruit no matter what. They are protected by the regimes, while they keep you living only by the old questions and the old role models. In doing so, they ensure that you never reach your full potential. 
I understand you get frustrated with America. But when you follow the Arab elites into supporting Saddam Hussein, I don't understand. Forget about us, think about this man and what he has done to his neighbors, the poison gas he has used on his own people, the generation of Iraqis he has destroyed. Is this a role model? Is this the sort of Arab leader you want for your own societies?
I hope not. I hope one day soon I will see an intifada not only for an independent Palestine but for Arab education, for Arab free press, for Arab legality, for Arab democracy. An Arab street that can ask only one question will, in the end, not be a very nice place to raise your kids.
Sincerely,
Bill Clinton

HEADLINE: For Hillary Clinton, a Health Care Assignment 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was appointed to three Senate committees today, including one that has jurisdiction over health care, the very issue she tried to put her stamp on as first lady.
 Mrs. Clinton's appointment to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee came as somewhat of a surprise, since she has been so closely identified in Washington with the Clinton administration's failed attempt to overhaul the nation's health care system in 1993. 
 Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said Mrs. Clinton was chosen for that committee because of her expertise in areas like health care and education. She dismissed any suggestion that Mrs. Clinton would be a polarizing figure on the panel. "I think she will fit right in," Ms. Schmezler said. "She'll lend her expertise to issues, and she'll have a lot to learn."
The announcement of Mrs. Clinton's committee assignments offered an early indication of where New York's new senator will make her mark on Capitol Hill. In the days leading up to the announcement, some lawmakers said that serving on a committee with Mrs. Clinton would be a mixed blessing. They acknowledged that she could bring greater attention to their issues, but said they were also aware that her celebrity status could eclipse them.
The other high-profile committee that Mrs. Clinton was assigned to is Environment and Public Works. That committee is responsible not only for helping write the nation's environmental laws, but also for overseeing hundreds of millions of dollars in highway and other transportation money.
Mrs. Clinton's aides said the assignment was particularly valuable in part because the committee gives members the opportunity to direct federal money to their home states. Mrs. Clinton's predecessor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, excelled at that when he served as the chairman of Environment and Public Works, so much so that former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo openly worried when Mr. Moynihan left the committee in 1992 to become chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee.
New Jersey's new junior senator, Jon S. Corzine, was also appointed to the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
In a nod to his Wall Street credentials, Mr. Corzine was also chosen for the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over financial services, and the Joint Economics Committee. He rose from being a trader at Goldman, Sachs & Company to become its co-chairman, amassing a $400 million fortune, $65 million of which he spent during his Senate campaign.
Mrs. Clinton's third committee assignment is on the Budget Committee, which deals with an array of important fiscal policy questions but is not considered a powerhouse like the Finance or the Appropriations Committees.

HEADLINE: Helms Urges Foreign Aid Be Handled By Charities 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Senator Jesse Helms, the most powerful critic of foreign aid in Congress, said today that he would champion an increase in international assistance -- but only if all future United States aid was funneled to the needy through private charities and religious groups instead of a government agency.
 Mr. Helms, a North Carolina Republican who will return to lead the Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 20, said he modeled his proposal after President-elect George W. Bush's campaign theme of empowering private relief groups to help the poor. If adopted by the administration and Congress, Mr. Helms's plan would mark the most decisive shift in 40 years in how America helps the world's downtrodden. 
 "The time has come to reject what President Bush correctly labels the 'failed compassion of towering, distant bureaucracies' and, instead, empower private and faith-based groups who care most about those in need," Mr. Helms said in a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group. 
Gen. Colin L. Powell, Mr. Bush's choice for secretary of state, met with Mr. Helms earlier this week, and while General Powell expressed support for increasing foreign aid, an aide said he was not briefed on details of the senator's proposal. 
A spokesman for General Powell, F. William Smullen, was noncommittal tonight: "We've now seen the senator's comments, and we welcome his ideas and his contribution to the debate. We obviously need to study a variety of different issues." 
In his wide-ranging speech, Mr. Helms called on Mr. Bush to isolate and weaken Fidel Castro's government in Cuba, equip Taiwan's military with more advanced weapons, ratchet up pressure on President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and ensure that Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are invited to join NATO. 
But his most provocative proposal was to abolish the Agency for International Development and shift responsibility for overseeing $7 billion a year in economic and humanitarian aid to a quasi-governmental foundation, which would deliver grants to private and community relief groups. 
The plan envisions replacing the aid agency and its 7,300 employees with a smaller, streamlined International Development Foundation with lower expenses. The secretary of state as well as relief groups would oversee the foundation's activities, Mr. Helms's aides said, to provide oversight and coordination with American foreign policy goals. 
"If we can reform the way in which we deliver aid to the needy," Mr. Helms said, "I will be willing to take the lead in the Senate in supporting increased U.S. investment." 
Relief groups voiced mixed reactions to the proposal, from cautious skepticism to stunned disbelief to enthusiastic support. Mr. Helms has long been a searing critic of American foreign aid, complaining, as he did today, that government-organized assistance has only "lined the pockets of corrupt dictators, while funding the salaries of a growing, bloated bureaucracy." 
But in the past several months, Mr. Helms has shown a new zeal for helping the world's poor, particularly in Africa. The 79-year-old senator has attributed his conversion of sorts to conversations with the Rev. Franklin Graham -- the son of the Rev. Billy Graham -- who runs a relief organization in North Carolina called Samaritan's Purse. 
Under his plan, Mr. Helms said, the groups that could receive grants include World Vision, Save the Children, Hadassah, Catholic Relief Services and Samaritan's Purse.
"I'm delighted to hear Senator Helms call for dramatically improving and increasing foreign aid to poor and hungry people," said the Rev. David Beckmann, president of Bread for the World, the nation's largest grass-roots anti-hunger lobbying group. 
But Bruce Wilkinson, a senior vice president for World Vision, which distributes $900 million in aid a year, 10 percent from A.I.D., to 100 countries, expressed concern that the long partnership between the government and private relief groups could be disrupted. "I really do applaud the moral commitment that Helms is demonstrating," said Mr. Wilkinson, "but at this point, the International Development Foundation is a very sketchy idea." 
Mr. Helms is resurrecting a proposal he made five years ago that ran into opposition and died in committee. Other lawmakers have proposed alternatives. Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who heads the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees A.I.D., has favored integrating the agency into the State Department. 
An A.I.D. spokesman said 37 percent of its bilateral development assistance goes through non-governmental groups, including faith-based ones. Since President Clinton took office, it has slashed its staff to 7,300 people from 10,000.

HEADLINE: Choice for Health Secretary Is Faulted on Tobacco Issue 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Tobacco opponents in Wisconsin and Washington say Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who is President-elect George W. Bush's choice to head the Health and Human Services Department, has not vigorously pursued tobacco control initiatives, in part because of ties to executives of Philip Morris, the cigarette maker.
 As the parent corporation of two Wisconsin companies -- the Miller Brewing Company and Oscar Mayer Foods, a division of Kraft Foods -- Philip Morris is one of Wisconsin's largest employers. Mr. Thompson's aides and Philip Morris officials say it is appropriate that he has worked closely with company executives over the 14 years he has been Wisconsin's governor. 
 But tobacco opponents have raised concerns about Mr. Thompson's participation in two international trips financed largely by Philip Morris, as well as more than $72,000 in contributions to him from employees and executives of the company and its food and beer subsidiaries.
The contributions, made from 1993 to 2000, account for less than 1 percent of more than $10 million raised by the governor in that time. But those contributions represent the largest amount affiliated with any single company, according to the records compiled by Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan group that tracks election spending.
Tobacco opponents also criticize some of the governor's policy decisions, like his vetoes of two bills, one in 1995 that would have banned smoking at Milwaukee's new baseball stadium and another in 1990 that would have permitted municipalities to enact tougher tobacco restrictions than those of the state.
"Governor Thompson has a pretty well-documented relationship with Philip Morris, and that causes us some concern," said Paul Billings, a spokesman for the American Lung Association, which is neither opposing nor supporting the governor's nomination. "As secretary of health, one of the most important issues he will be facing is the horrendous toll tobacco takes on the American public."
Mr. Thompson, a Republican, declined to be interviewed for this article, referring questions to a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush. The spokeswoman, Alicia Peterson, said, "Governor Thompson has a record of opposing youth access to tobacco and tobacco products." Ms. Peterson said Mr. Thompson had banned smoking on school grounds and allowed teenagers to participate in sting operations to expose retailers who sold cigarettes to minors.
Peggy Roberts, a Philip Morris spokeswoman, said the company had worked closely with Mr. Thompson because of Philip Morris's economic interests in the state. The company has nearly 7,500 employees in Wisconsin, but no cigarette manufacturing plants there.
Mr. Thompson, 59, is Wisconsin's longest-serving governor. He has earned a national reputation as a champion of programs to put welfare recipients back to work and to provide health insurance for the poor. Democrats and Republicans in Washington expect him to win confirmation with little trouble. 
Still, his record on tobacco policy is likely to surface in Senate confirmation hearings next week. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said he intended to explore "the governor's views and record on issues like tobacco control."
If confirmed as secretary of health and human services, Mr. Thompson would oversee a vast agency. The department includes the Food and Drug Administration, which has tried to regulate tobacco products, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which guides states in developing antismoking initiatives.
Those initiatives, relying on money from a settlement with cigarette makers, have been controversial in Wisconsin, as in many states. Mr. Thompson has drawn criticism for the way he allocated money from Wisconsin's $170-million-a-year tobacco settlement. And while he has raised the cigarette tax several times -- most recently by 15 cents a pack in 1997 -- some say it is not enough.
The tax now stands at 59 cents a pack, but Bonnie Sumner, president of the Wisconsin Initiative on Smoking and Health, a nonprofit group that advocates strict smoking regulations, said she and other tobacco opponents believed that a tax of $1 was necessary to discourage young people from buying cigarettes. State officials said that 38 percent of high school students in Wisconsin smoke, as compared with 34 percent nationally.
"A 15-cent tax is a meaningless figure as far as decreasing smoking," Ms. Sumner said. 
Joe Leann, Wisconsin's health secretary, said critics like Ms. Sumner were short-sighted, and said they have ignored the governor's other accomplishments, which included offering smoking cessation clinics as part of the state's health insurance program for low-income families.
In 1996, when many states were contemplating filing suit against the tobacco industry for reimbursement of the cost of caring for injured smokers, the state's attorney general accused Mr. Thompson of dragging his heels.
Wisconsin did join more than a dozen other states in filing claims against the cigarette industry, and Mr. Thompson became a vocal supporter of the lawsuit. But he drew criticism when The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel published telephone records indicating that in the weeks before the suit was filed, Mr. Thompson had placed a series of telephone calls to Philip Morris executives, including one to its chief executive, Geoffrey C. Bible.
The content of the conversation with Mr. Bible has never been disclosed and Ms. Roberts declined to discuss it. But she defended the relationship between the governor and the company. "It is important to our businesses in Wisconsin for us to maintain that relationship, and those businesses include food and beer," Ms. Roberts said.
Dennis Dresang, the chairman of the department of political science at the University of Wisconsin, said the news articles about Mr. Thompson's contacts with top Philip Morris executives had hurt the governor's image because "people were suspicious of the phone calls." That suspicion was raised again, Professor Dresang said, when trips Mr. Thompson took with company executives to South Africa and Australia were disclosed. 
The trips, in 1995 and 1996, were arranged by the National Governors' Association; Mr. Thompson was chairman of the group at the time. "There has been a bit of concern about whether the governor was promoting Wisconsin, or Philip Morris products," Professor Dresang said.
The trips were financed largely by Philip Morris through three nonprofit groups that promote free trade. Mr. Thompson said he learned of the company's involvement only later. In Australia, the delegation went scuba diving, and Mr. Thompson wrote to a Philip Morris lobbyist, John C. Lenzi, thanking him for taking "the scuba diving plunge with me" and encouraging Mr. Lenzi to visit the next time he was in Madison, the state capital. The correspondence was first disclosed by The Journal-Sentinel in 1997.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Thompson's wife, Sue Ann, said it was "only natural" for him to maintain good ties with such an important corporate citizen. "I just know for a fact that he would not be influenced because of the dollars being spent on a trip or whatever," said Mrs. Thompson, the founder of a nonprofit women's health advocacy group. "Anyone who knows Tom knows that the decisions he makes are based on what's best for Wisconsin."

HEADLINE: Woman in the News; 
A Washington Veteran for Labor; a Tested Negotiator for Trade; Elaine Lan Chao

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Ever since she was 8, and a freighter bearing her family into New York harbor offered a first glimpse of the Statue of Liberty, Elaine L. Chao has concentrated on finding her place in America.
 Ms. Chao -- Chinese immigrant, Harvard graduate, former head of the Peace Corps and the United Way -- reached a new rung today in a fast-rising career, becoming President-elect George W. Bush's choice as secretary of labor. 
 Just two days after his first selection for the post, Linda Chavez, pulled out, Mr. Bush introduced a replacement in Ms. Chao, 47, saying she epitomized the values and dreams of hard-working Americans. Ms. Chao, who is now an expert on philanthropy at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research institute, is widely sought after as a public speaker, fund-raiser and board member. 
"Elaine Chao believes deeply in the American dream because she has lived it," Mr. Bush said.
Ms. Chao thanked a litany of friends and relatives today for supporting her, most notably her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, whom she called "the love of my life." But her public remarks have made plain that she believes self-reliance is the essential engine of success.
She has said she opposes racial quotas and numerical goals, but emphasized the importance of giving everyone an equal opportunity. She advocates working to bring immigrants into the mainstream, and suggests that new citizens be given a course in what is considered appropriate behavior by most Americans.
Ms. Chao's views on affirmative action are likely to draw close scrutiny from minority and immigrant advocacy groups. As a participant in President Clinton's 1998 "Dialogue on Race," she criticized schools and companies that overlooked merit to meet diversity goals. 
"I think we should heed to the overall core value of this country that equal opportunity applies for all, and that should be the same standards for everyone," she said.
Asian-Americans, she said at a 1997 meeting of the National Commission of Civic Renewal, "have also been tremendously damaged by affirmative action." 
"Many Asian-Americans are excluded from minority procurement programs," she said. "They are not considered to be minorities in the full sense of the word -- positive and negative -- and quota systems in the best universities in this land exclude qualified Asian-Americans."
If confirmed by the Senate, Ms. Chao will probably confront several more mundane, but still controversial, issues affecting regulation of the American workplace. Among them are whether to rescind the Clinton administration's new rules on ergonomics in the workplace; whether to support the right of union members to withhold the part of their dues that is used for political purposes; whether to support more inspectors for safety, wage and overtime violations; and whether to back an increase in the $5.15 minimum wage.
In remarks to the press today, Ms. Chao (pronounced chow) said she would work to "protect, nurture and develop America's most precious resource," its working men and women.
Elaine Lan Chao grew up in New York, where her father worked three jobs, put himself through college, and eventually built a successful shipping business. She received a degree in economics from Mount Holyoke College, then went on to earn a master's degree in business administration at the Harvard Business School, which Mr. Bush also attended.
Ms. Chao worked as an investment banker at Bank of America and Citicorp before moving to Washington, where she received a White House fellowship in 1983. In that post, she met then-Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who later helped pave the way for her appointment as deputy secretary of transportation under President George Bush in 1989.
It was a cataclysmic year at Transportation. Ms. Chao was generally regarded as coping effectively with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the San Francisco earthquake and Hurricane Hugo.
After a brief stint as director of the Peace Corps, Ms. Chao took a job that plunged her into a different sort of crisis.
In 1992, she took charge of the United Way of America after its president, William V. Aramony, resigned amid charges of financial improprieties and an outcry over his $390,000 salary. Ms. Chao undertook a tough reorganization, which included cutting her salary to half that of Mr. Aramony's, cutting the administrative budget by 30 percent and laying off a third of the staff.
She was widely praised for restoring the image of the charity, but did not escape without a controversy at her departure. When she announced she was leaving in 1996, several board members sought to present Ms. Chao with a privately raised bonus of $292,500. Amid a public outcry over the bonus, Ms. Chao ultimately refused it.
At the Heritage Foundation, she has provided expertise on civil society, the nonprofit sector and philanthropy. She has served on numerous corporate boards, including those of Clorox, Dole Food and Northwest Airlines. Since 1993, she has been married to Senator McConnell, who is perhaps best known for his opposition to campaign finance reform.
Ms. Chao displayed some political savvy today by placing early calls to labor leaders, who responded cordially.
"I can attest to her leadership skills, her integrity and her ability to bring together diverse interests," said Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America. "I believe she will be responsive to the needs of working families."

HEADLINE: Man in the News; 
A Washington Veteran for Labor; a Tested Negotiator for Trade; Robert Bruce Zoellick

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
A visitor to Robert B. Zoellick's seventh-floor office in the State Department in the early 1990's might have mistaken the young diplomat for a college prankster. He stacked his coffee table with a parody of Time magazine and a picture book of rat-eating snakes. Felt posters of poker-playing dogs lined the walls.
 But that sophomoric sense of humor -- friends say Mr. Zoellick decorated his office that way to tease the gray-suited dignitaries who called on him -- is about the only thing impish about the man President-elect George W. Bush named today as his chief trade representative. 
 People who worked with Mr. Zoellick, 47, during two earlier Republican administrations describe him as a policy wonk whose sharp-edged negotiating tactics and mastery of details often won over, or wore down, his rivals -- notably over the past several weeks as he lobbied for the trade job and its role within the new administration. A confidant of former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, he rallied Western allies to back a speedy German reunification and finagled a compromise that led to the creation of the World Trade Organization. 
"He was the most impressive thinker of my time in government," said Richard Burt, a former assistant secretary of state. Derek H. Burney, Canada's former ambassador to the United States, called Mr. Zoellick a sharp-elbowed negotiator, but added, "in the end he won the argument through the power of his intellect, not the raw political power of the U.S."
In tapping Mr. Zoellick, Mr. Bush chose a Republican insider whose resume reads a little like an encyclopedia of diplomatic and economic abbreviations -- NATO, W.T.O., Nafta, G-7, APEC and Uruguay Round -- are among the many trade, military and economic groups, summits and negotiating forums in which he had a role.
That experience, though broad, was a largely behind-the-curtains preparation for what he will face as United States trade representative. If confirmed, Mr. Zoellick (pronounced ZELL-ik) will occupy a post that arguably has a higher public profile and more sensitive political mission than ever before. 
Mr. Zoellick will have to implement Mr. Bush's campaign pledge to work toward eliminating the remaining barriers to free trade throughout the Americas. He will also have to address mounting discontent among developing nations, some of which contend that the United States and other wealthy countries have betrayed free trade by refusing to dismantle import barriers that protect farm goods, textiles and steel.
"The overarching issue for him is going to be restoring American leadership of free trade," said Harold McGraw III, the chief executive officer of McGraw Hill Companies, who serves as chairman of the Emergency Committee for American Trade, a lobbying group.
The politics are complex. Lawmakers are split almost evenly on the wisdom of expanding trade, and unions have energized their members to oppose many trade agreements.
Some Bush advisers view the task of building a consensus for free trade as so essential that they considered selecting Richard W. Fisher, a Democrat who is the No. 2 trade official in the Clinton administration, for the top trade post. The Bush transition team also thought about stripping the trade representative of the cabinet rank the position has held for 25 years to streamline the way the administration managed the economy.
In the end, Mr. Zoellick had his way. People who know him said he pushed for the trade post and argued passionately that the trade representative should continue to sit with the cabinet. That things worked out in his favor stems partly from his public-policy credentials, his supporters said, and his circle of friends, which includes several prominent Democrats. But he also cashed in some chits from his lengthy service to the Bush family.
Under his mentor, Mr. Baker, Mr. Zoellick helped run two campaigns for President George Bush. Mr. Zoellick earned the nickname "the adding machine" for his number-crunching contribution to policy ideas that addressed what the elder Bush once called "the vision thing."
Mr. Zoellick served the president-elect in a similar way. He became one of Mr. Bush's foreign policy pundits, writing a stream of op-ed pieces and magazine articles that laid the groundwork for what he called a Republican foreign policy. 
He dissected what he saw as President Clinton's mistakes in dealings with China, Russia, Iraq and Japan. He pushed the theme that the new administration should avoid nation-building exercises like the United States role in Haiti and Somalia and in the Balkans, an idea Mr. Bush used in his debates with Vice President Al Gore.
Robert Bruce Zoellick grew up in Naperville, Ill., near Chicago. He attended Naperville Central High School and then moved East, attending Swarthmore College before receiving law and public policy degrees at Harvard University.
Mr. Zoellick joined the Reagan administration at the behest of Richard Darman, one of his former Harvard teachers who at the time served in the Treasury Department. He went on to become a close aide to Mr. Baker, working for him in the Treasury Department and then, during President Bush's term, at the State Department, where he became an under secretary for economic policy.
There, aside from his kitschy office, he was remembered for toting around yellow legal pads filled to the margins with his tidy penmanship, diligently laying out the pros and cons of strategy choices.
"He was the best prepared guy in the room," said Edward Djerejian, a former ambassador and State Department official. "He often had an outside-the-box solution for many issues."
But he is most widely remembered in foreign policy circles for being the United States' representative at the multiparty negotiation over the future of divided Germany. He persuaded the Bush administration to embrace German unity despite the qualms of allies and alarm in the former Soviet Union.
By defusing the potentially volatile issue of Germany, Mr. Djerejian said, Mr. Zoellick "gets a lot of credit for the fact that the cold war ended with a whimper."

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Clinton's Heart Is on His Sleeve 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Jan. 11 

 BODY:
President Clinton took a walk down memory lane today -- or to be more exact, down Elm Street -- in the center of a city that was so crucial nearly nine years ago to his presidential election.
 Mr. Clinton ducked into the Merrimack Restaurant, one of his haunts here in the 1992 campaign, and requested the same waitress, Jane Davis, who had served him then and had once written in the local newspaper that he was the best tipper of all the candidates who came through. 
 "He was presidential, even back then," Ms. Davis said. "He is a charming man and he didn't just shake your hand all stiff, like the rest of them." 
Continuing his nationwide farewell tour, Mr. Clinton, who is in the final two weeks of his presidency, visited the state that salvaged his presidential bid in some of its darkest moments in 1992.
As accusations of draft dodging and marital infidelity threatened to destroy his campaign, Mr. Clinton promised the people of New Hampshire that he would fight for them "until the last dog dies." Today, in a return trip to the city of Dover, he recounted his administration's achievements and declared that "the last dog is still barking."
Later, in Manchester, the president walked past stores along Elm Street that he said had been boarded up when he came through as a governor aspiring the presidency.
"It was a tough time eight years ago for our country when I came here," Mr. Clinton said. "It was also a fairly tough time for me. I was taking a whipping in the press and I was dropping in the polls. But I said then, and I would like to say again, that was nothing compared to the punishment that the people of this state and this nation were enduring."
Reminiscing about that first campaign, Mr. Clinton recalled meeting a man who had lost his job 30 days before his pension became vested and hearing a girl describe how she hated dinner because her unemployed father would always cry. He spotted an older citizen whom he had first met in a bingo hall in Dover, and told her, "I would say, ma'am, I've aged a lot more than you have in the last eight years."
Mr. Clinton held up the "Putting People First" pamphlet that his campaign handed out in 1992 and said, "The stuff that was in this book that people made fun of is now real in the lives of the American people."
Mr. Clinton's eyes welled with tears and he bit his lip when he was introduced at Dover High School today by Ron Machos Jr., a thriving small-business man who had been out of work with no health insurance and a sick son when he met Mr. Clinton on his first campaign. The president called Mr. Machos and his family "the symbol of what my efforts in 1992 were all about."
The early months of that year were tough ones for Mr. Clinton, whose campaign was floundering as he battled reports that he had evaded the draft and carried on a lengthy affair with Gennifer Flowers. 
Mr. Clinton ultimately finished second in New Hampshire, just behind Paul Tsongas, surprising the Democratic establishment and prompting him to declare himself "the Comeback Kid."
"I came here one last time as president to thank you for making me the Comeback Kid, and far more important, to thank you for making America the comeback country," Mr. Clinton said today. "Through all the ups and downs of the last eight years, I never forgot the lesson I learned from you hear in those amazing weeks in the winter of 1991 and 1992."
When he huddled with longtime supporters in the Manchester diner, he said another candidate had also learned from that experience in New Hampshire.
"One of the reasons Hillary did so well is she ran in upstate New York like how I ran in New Hampshire," Mr. Clinton said. "She talked to people about the economic challenges."

HEADLINE: THE POWER CRISIS: THE NEGOTIATIONS; 
Seeking Harmony to Quiet California Energy Turmoil

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
While Californians readied themselves for yet another day of possible power blackouts, negotiators in Washington continued today to try to hammer out a solution to the state's energy problems.
 Two days ago, President Clinton brought together federal and state leaders, utility executives and power generation representatives to discuss the crisis in California that has driven the state's two largest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and threatens the state's economy. That group, which included Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, agreed that several issues needed to be addressed to solve California's problems. 
 Topics discussed today and in the seven-hour meeting on Tuesday included promoting long-term purchasing contracts between the utilities that use electricity and the power generators that sell it, and the willingness of creditors to give temporary relief while the utilities and state regulators sort out how to pay the $12 billion in electricity costs that the utilities have incurred since May. This weekend, the group is expected to reconvene to devise a course of action. 
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told reporters in Washington today that a plan may not be ready by Saturday as planned, but that one of the options would be to give utilities 60 to 90 days to repay past debts.
Also on the agenda this weekend will be whether to allow the companies who make and sell electricity to enter into contracts to charge utilities 5.5 cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity. Utilities are currently allowed to charge consumers about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, although they have been paying power producers an average of 35 cents.
In Washington today, people who attended the meetings said that representatives of producers would like to lock in that price for nine years, while state officials would prefer to limit that price to three years.
John Burton, president of the California State Senate, who attended Tuesday's meeting, said he supported the price being discussed. He said he wanted the state to buy electricity and then resell it to utilities, but did not want to be a guarantor of the utilities' debt. At a price of 5.5 cents, he said, "this would guarantee long-term stability and affordability."
Consumer groups have complained that any price negotiated now could look too high in the future if prices for electricity fall, a surety, they contend, as much as they have gone up.
"It all depends on the terms," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. 
Those on hand at today's meeting also included officials from the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, as well as Treasury officials.
California utility executives from Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have warned that bankruptcy is imminent, possibly by Feb. 1, if something is not done to relieve the cash shortage that has led them to suspend dividends and lay off employees. Financial ratings agencies, which monitor the utilities' health, are a step away from giving their debt a junk-bond rating, which would cripple their efforts to get more financing.
One of the most surprising aspects of the situation is that it took the intervention of the Treasury Secretary to broker a meeting about a crisis that many in California had predicted, but no one wanted to take responsibility for.
One person involved in the talks said that in November, executives from the Federal Reserve in San Francisco warned Treasury officials that trouble was brewing at the state's largest utilities, a situation that could have a negative impact on financial markets. Worse, said the individual, officials were told that relations between state officials and regulators at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees the power generators, had grown so testy that the two sides were unable to work together.
Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission, has repeatedly blamed the federal commission for doing nothing to admonish the power generators for high prices. James Hoecker, chairman of the federal commission, has told state officials repeatedly that they had to get their own house in order. At Tuesday's meeting, the two sat side by side but barely said a word to each other, one person who attended said.
Still, utility executives were heartened that all the parties are talking. "We've finally reached a point in the road where we have to come to some agreement," said Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison.
At the same time that harmony was being attempted in Washington, Los Angeles officials said they wanted reassurances that Los Angeles would be repaid for any electricity it had already sold to the state. 
"We are not a charitable organization," said S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Power and Water. "We are not pulling the plug on anyone. We just want to be reassured that the money we are putting out is going to get reimbursed."

HEADLINE: IN A SWIFT ACTION, BUSH NAMES CHOICE FOR LABOR DEPT. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush moved swiftly today to replace his initial selection for labor secretary, naming a less outspoken conservative, Elaine L. Chao, who was an official in his father's administration. He also selected a Republican veteran of economic diplomacy, Robert B. Zoellick, to serve as the country's top trade negotiator, a post Mr. Bush said he had decided to keep in the cabinet. 
 Mr. Bush announced the appointments today without mentioning the revelations that sank his first choice for the labor job, Linda Chavez, and he somewhat testily defended his most controversial candidate, John Ashcroft, a religious conservative who is the attorney general designee. 
 "I want Americans to see this good man," Mr. Bush said, adding that he had recently held a "long talk with John" about how he would enforce civil rights laws -- an area that has been a particular focus of Mr. Ashcroft's critics. 
In another exchange, Mr. Bush made little effort to hide his annoyance at President Clinton, who questioned the legitimacy of the president-elect's victory on Tuesday night, saying "the only way they could win the election was to stop the voting in Florida."
Mr. Bush, asked about Mr. Clinton's comments, retorted, "He can say what he wants to say, but January the 20th I'll be honored to be sworn in as president." 
While Ms. Chao as labor secretary must deal with unions' suspicions of the Bush administration's intentions, Mr. Zoelleck, 47, must navigate divisions within the Democratic and Republican Parties over America's strategy in global trade negotiations.
Ms. Chao, 47, came to the United States at age 8 from Taiwan, was considered for a cabinet job and passed over two weeks ago. But as soon as Ms. Chavez withdrew, after it became clear that she had misled the Bush transition team and the F.B.I. by initially failing to disclose that an illegal immigrant had lived in her house and performed chores, the Bush team scrambled for a quick replacement whose background had already been thoroughly reviewed. Page A17. 
That quickly led them to Ms. Chao, a prominent conservative, who has raised concerns about the use of numerical goals and quotas in hiring, but unlike Ms. Chavez has not been an outspoken opponent of affirmative action.
In the previous Bush administration Ms. Chao served as deputy transportation secretary, and more recently she headed the United Way. She is also the wife of Mitch McConnell, the conservative senator from Kentucky who has led the opposition to campaign finance reform. One Republican objection to the reform bills is that they do not block unions from contributing; Ms. Chao would now be the administration's chief official dealing with those unions.
Today, Ms. Chao did not talk about how she would run the labor department. Instead, she focused on the story of her own arrival in the United States and her emotions sailing past the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. She described how she entered the third grade speaking no English and how her father worked to teach her every evening.
The selection of Mr. Zoellick was less surprising than Ms. Chao's. Among senior Republican officials in Washington, he is one of the few with deep experience navigating the turbulent waters of international economics. A committed internationalist, he was under secretary of state for economic affairs under former President George Bush. From that post he was a major player in the negotiations over the Nafta accord and was architect of a major agreement involving German reunification.
"Free trade is about freedom," he said today. " It's important for our economy but also for America's other interests and values throughout the world."
Mr. Zoellick is also a fierce Bush loyalist. He was called to Florida in November by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has long been his mentor, to help Mr. Bush in the legal fight to retain his narrow lead in Florida. 
Behind the scenes, Mr. Zoellick won another battle: To preserve the trade representative's seat at the cabinet table, the subject of a fierce internal debate within the Bush transition team. Every trade representative since the Carter administration has held cabinet-equivalent rank, but Mr. Bush sought to reduce the cabinet's size. Meanwhile, other members of Mr. Bush's foreign policy team -- a field already crowded with Gen. Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Donald H. Rumsfeld and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney -- were clearly leery of introducing another major voice on international affairs in the administration.
"We've been looking at the question of how much authority the treasury and the trade office have had in American foreign policy," one adviser to the president-elect said recently. But once the debate broke into the open, Mr. Bush's team came under intense pressure not to downgrade the trade representative's post. Members of Congressional committees with oversight responsibility for trade complained. And virtually every major American trading partner places a cabinet-level official in charge of trade talks -- many combine the job with foreign minister -- raising the question of whether they would negotiate with an American of lesser rank.
"This idea is madness," Charlene Barshefsky, President Clinton's trade representative, said earlier this week, as word of the internal arguments in the Bush camp spread. "No one would deal with us."
In the end, a senior Bush adviser said today, Mr. Bush concluded that "it was important to the agricultural community and to our friends in the hemisphere" to keep the post in the cabinet. Mr. Bush himself said that "the reason why the position needs to remain a cabinet position is because of the importance of a global economy."
By announcing the two selections today, Mr. Bush and his aides were clearly trying to put their first major setback, the failed candidacy of Ms. Chavez, behind them. While Ms. Chao has championed conservative causes, labor union officials were conciliatory today about her selection. They made it clear she was unlikely to evoke the kind of ideological objections that Ms. Chavez did, objections that sped Ms. Chavez's fall once she conceded a personal mistake.
Moreover, as the wife of a sitting senator, Ms. Chao will probably be treated with additional deference in the Senate confirmation proceedings. But Mr. Ashcroft and the designee for interior secretary, Gale A. Norton, are clearly headed for contentious hearings. 
Ms. Norton has been a strong advocate of giving states and local communities more authority than the federal government on environmental matters, and in 1996 speaking of her own effort to improve states' rights, she referred to the Confederate cause, saying "we lost too much" when the Union won the Civil War. "Bad facts make bad law," she said, meaning that when slavery, a bad cause, was linked with states' sovereignty, a good cause, the nation did too much to curtail state's rights. 
Mr. Bush, asked about the statement today, said: "She in no way, shape or form was talking about any value to slavery. And, you know, what happens in this town is the voices of the special interests like to tear people down."
He called any effort to read more into Ms. Norton's comments "a ridiculous interpretation of what's in her heart." 
Mr. Bush's strongest words were for Mr. Ashcroft, who he said he would lobby for directly if necessary.
"I picked John Ashcroft because he's a good attorney," he said. "He's going to be the attorney general. He's going to be the nation's lawyer, and he'll enforce the laws on the books."
Mr. Bush left Washington after the announcements for a final stay in Texas before his inauguration as president. He plans to turn his journey toward his inauguration into a piece of theater, stopping along the way for a huge outdoor rally in his boyhood home town in West Texas. 
Senior Bush advisers said that Mr. Bush would make his way from his ranch near Waco to Washington on Wednesday, but that his plane would first head west, taking a short hop into Mr. Bush's past. 
In Mr. Bush's home town, Midland, local bands would salute the president-elect with music, they said, and local figures would share their recollections about him. Perhaps, advisers said, a former elementary school teacher of his would say a few words.
Earlier today, in a meeting with 19 educators and business leaders, Mr. Bush said that winning Congressional support for his educational program would be his first order of business upon taking office.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Europe's Demographic Time Bomb" (editorial, Jan. 7): Yes, changing demographics will strain, if not bankrupt, some European countries' current pension schemes, but there is a larger phenomenon that argues in the opposite direction.
 Today's capitalist mantra is expansion -- of profits, consumers and economies. 
The basis for this prosperity model is continuing population growth. But declining birthrates in Western Europe and a few other mature industrialized societies reflect a contrary view. In these communities, people increasingly regard the ills of modern industrial society -- global warming and pollution, environmental destruction, species extinctions -- as the direct consequence of continuing population growth. 
 Expectations may have to change, together with the way affluent societies provide for their elderly. Sooner or later, we must face the bottom line and halt the population bomb.

Re "Governor Pataki's Lean to the Left" (editorial, Jan. 6):
 There are many steps that Gov. George E. Pataki should take to reduce New York City's energy costs, risk of power outages and price spikes all while cleaning the air we breathe and stimulating economic growth. 
The answer is energy efficiency. 
 Through increasing financing for current state-run programs, the governor can help New Yorkers use energy more efficiently while maintaining the same level of service and comfort. Many other states pay for energy efficiency programs at much higher levels. Reducing peak consumption on hot summer days, for example, will lower electricity prices for all New Yorkers. Many effective measures could be quickly carried out and in place by this summer.

HEADLINE: Auction Houses Sweeten Deal 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL and RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
As they wait for a federal judge to give final approval to a $512 million class-action antitrust settlement, Sotheby's and Christie's have sweetened part of the deal they had agreed to in October.
 Under the original plan, the two auction houses charged with price fixing have the option of paying $100 million of the settlement in the form of discount certificates to future sellers toward commission fees and other charges. 
 But lawyers for some auction customers argued that such coupons were intrinsically worth less than cash and that it would take coupons with more than a face value of $100 million to equal the same amount of cash. 
With Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York scheduled to receive a report from court-appointed economic experts on the issue on Tuesday, the lead law firm representing the class of about 100,000 auction customers told the judge by letter on Thursday that Sotheby's and Christie's had proposed "a significant change" in the certificate plan.
The firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner, said that the auction houses agreed that all unredeemed certificates would be redeemable for cash at their full face value when they expired five years after their issuance.
The sweetening of the offer was reported by The Wall Street Journal yesterday.
"We continue to think the coupons are worth their face value and this is another way to make that point," said Steven A. Reiss, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, Sotheby's lawyers. "They're really the same as money."
Scott T. Kragie, a lawyer representing the auction customers Fataihi Company and Swicorp S.A., which have been critical of the settlement, called the new proposal "clearly a substantial improvement in the certificates." Yet, he said yesterday, "they remain far from $100 million in fair market value."

HEADLINE: An Old Key To Why Countries Get Rich 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
Why has Poland prospered and Russia struggled since the end of the cold war? Why is the economy of South Korea 15 times as large as that of Ghana when they were comparable less than 40 years ago? Why have the Chinese minorities thrived economically in such different places as Malaysia, the Philippines and San Francisco?
 The answer, in all cases, is culture, according to a growing number of scholars who have come to believe that social attitudes are more important than politics and economics in determining why some societies are richer than others. 
 "If we learn anything from the history of economic development, it is that culture makes almost all the difference," declares David Landes, a professor of history at Harvard, in "Culture Matters: How Values Shape Human Progress" (Basic Books), a new collection of essays that is a kind of manifesto for this increasingly influential school of thought.
But this latest incarnation of the "culture matters" thesis, popular early in the 20th century, is unsettling scholars and policymakers. For starters, it challenges the assumptions of market economists and liberal and Marxist thinkers, who share an assumption that political and economic programs are of primary importance and that social values and attitudes follow their lead. 
"The standard economic way of thinking is to assume that people are rational, utility-maximizing agents that will seek their economic self-interest," said Benjamin Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard who counts himself in the culture matters camp. "The 'culture matters' idea -- that different folks have different utility functions, or even that they disregard rational, utility-maximizing norms -- is very subversive of what most economists do." 
Even more controversial are the political implications. "Culture matters" essentially creates a map of world culture, comparing various cultural values like interpersonal trust, tolerance, attitudes toward authority and personal freedom. The book, edited by two Harvard professors, Lawrence E. Harrison and Samuel P. Huntington, argues that there are striking correlations between economic and democratic development, income level and religion.
Ronald Inglehart, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, writes, "The fact that a society was historically Protestant or Orthodox or Islamic or Confucian gives rise to cultural zones with highly distinctive value systems that persist when we control for the effects of economic development." Thus New Zealand has more in common with distant Canada than neighboring Indonesia, he argues, and Argentina with its history of heavy Italian immigration has more in common with Italy than with some nearby South American societies.
Many scholars find such judgments disturbing. "There is a shift from a racism based on skin color to a racism based on culture," says Moustafa Bayoumi, who is researching the writings of Muslim slaves in the United States and teaches at Brooklyn College, "which is not to say that culture does not have a role in who we are and how we do things."
Certainly, the culture matters thesis tends to polarize people into opposing camps. Conservatives tend to see it as evidence that the solution to poverty is not government aid but internal cultural change among the poor, while liberals see it as proof that poverty is not intractable but subject to structural, political and economic solutions. As Mr. Huntington, the leading theorist of the new culture matters school, put it by quoting Daniel Patrick Moynihan: "The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself."
In many ways, "Culture Matters" is a return to the thinking of the German sociologist Max Weber and his seminal essay "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism." At the beginning of the 20th century, at the height of Western imperialism and an earlier form of globalization, Weber tried to identify the factors that led to Northern Europe's sudden rise in the modern era and wrote that the emphasis on individual responsibility in the Protestant Reformation had provided the inner motor of the capitalist revolution. But later scholars found the idea to be too sweeping as well as smacking of a spirit of Western superiority.
Why, then, has the idea been revived? One reason is the end of the cold war, which transformed the global order as well as thinking about how the world works. The widely divergent trajectories of the countries of the former Soviet bloc, the recent meteoric rise of many former East Asian colonies (Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea) and the continued stagnation of most of Africa and the Middle East have confounded traditional theories of underdevelopment, for example, the crippling legacy of colonialism.
"For many, the statute of limitations on colonialism as an explanation for underdevelopment lapsed long ago," writes Mr. Harrison, who is also a former foreign aid official.
But Jeffrey D. Sachs, another economist at Harvard who has worked as an economic adviser to many developing countries, says he is "very skeptical of these cultural explanations. "I think this idea of culture is generally used very loosely in a self-serving way in which rich people blame poverty on the inferiority of somebody's culture. When I went to Poland, everyone said its culture made it impossible for it to develop, but now it's doing very well."
Mr. Sachs recalls that in Weber's original theory about Protestantism and capitalism, his principal counterexample was Confucianism in China: a static, hierarchical culture that exalted the figure of the mandarin, who with his long fingernails disdained manual labor and commerce. "So the idea that East Asian religious influences were adverse to modern economic growth has been turned on its head," he said.
Indeed, many of the essays in "Culture Matters" refer to Confucianism as a kind of Asian equivalent of the Protestant work ethic.
Mr. Sachs finds geography a more compelling explanation. "Perhaps the strongest empirical relationship in the wealth and poverty of nations is the one between ecological zones and per capita income," he stated at a recent conference. "Economies in tropical ecozones are nearly everywhere poor, while those in temperate ecozones are generally rich."
The hazards of geography -- the prevalence of deadly tropical diseases, poor soil quality and remoteness from trading routes -- placed Africa at a serious economic deficit, Mr. Sachs insists. Europeans were unable to colonize Africa until they discovered a treatment for malaria that allowed them to live in the tropics. And the great success of the Protestant countries of Northern Europe, Mr. Sachs said, has more to do with the importance of coal starting in the 17th century than with religion.
"Southern Europe had little coal, higher malaria rates and lower soil productivity," he said. "Now that coal has lost much of its importance, the Southern European countries are catching up. Culture matters, but it matters a lot less when you control for geography, climate, political structures and past history. In the case of the transition of the former Soviet bloc countries, the single largest explanatory factor in how well they are doing is the number of miles from Stuttgart," closer being better.
Mr. Huntington, whose earlier work maintained that Islam and the West were fundamentally incompatible, counters that one of the world's great recent success stories is Singapore, "a tropical country located practically on the equator." But if Singapore contradicts Mr. Sach's geography thesis, it also undermines a piece of Mr. Huntington's cultural determinism. According to some of the essays in "Culture Matters," Asian and African countries lag well behind Northern Europe and the Anglo-Saxon in levels of political corruption, while Singapore ranks with Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand as one of the least corrupt. To Mr. Huntington, this suggests that "cultures can change, albeit within the basic parameters of that culture."
To others, it suggests something different. "Politics and political leadership is one of the great underestimated factors," says Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of history at All Souls College at Oxford. "I object to the implicit determinism in grouping countries as Protestant, Orthodox, Islamic and so forth. We started the 1990's with a sort of vulgar economic determinism -- get the economics right and all else will follow -- and we ended the decade with what I would call 'vulgar Huntingtonism.' 
"It's clearly true that history matters -- and if you had 500 years under the Ottoman Empire, with a very strong tradition of state authority, there are certain ingrained ways of doing things that do not help the development of rule of law and a modern trajectory. But the difference between Bulgaria and Slovakia is one of degree and not of kind. Islam in Bosnia is worlds away from Islam in Iran or Central Asia. To say that it characterizes the fundamental political character of a civilization seems simply wrong."
Anthony Appiah, chairman of African studies at Harvard, finds any single explanation overly simplistic: "Clearly history, habits, values, religious institutions all matter but lumping them all together under the label 'culture' is too broad to be very useful," he said. 
Mr. Appiah said he prefers the analysis of Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard who has tried to find empirical ways of studying what Mr. Sachs calls civil society -- levels of civic participation, the strength of social bonds and trust.
Mr. Putnam's work is heavily cited in "Culture Matters," but he insists his own idea of what he terms "social capital" is very different from Mr. Huntington's idea of culture. "I specifically don't use the word culture," he said. "I try to describe patterns of reciprocity and social networks to help explain why democracy works better and the economy grows better in some places. I think Russia has had such a difficult time not because of some ineffable Russianness or Slavicness but because of specific social structures and networks that have inhibited the emergence of a modern state."
But as with other debates on the culture matters thesis, different scholars can draw different conclusions from a single example. Mr. Huntington notes that Mr. Putnam's book "Making Democracy Work" traced social and political differences between northern and southern Italy that stretch back to the Middle Ages. But, as Mr. Putnam responded, "southern and northern Italy have the same language, religion and culture."

HEADLINE: Amid Pockets of Growth, December Retail Sales Rose a Sliver 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Retail sales, while clearly weak, defied gloomy expectations and rose slightly in December, the government said yesterday, ending a week in which economic data showed some surprising resilience.
 The retail numbers -- combined with other reports on inflation, mortgage applications and unemployment claims -- have decreased the chances that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates by another half-point at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 30-31. Most analysts now expect the Fed to make a quarter-point cut in rates in an effort to ease the slowdown of recent months. 
 Investors offered a similar prognosis yesterday, as the price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32 , suggesting that many traders, who had been counting on the Fed to be more aggressive, now believe a quarter-point cut is more likely. The major stock indexes also declined, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 84.17 points, to 10,525.38. 
Still, economists said the Commerce Department's preliminary retail report contains plenty of evidence that the American economy has entered a new stage of tepid growth. Sales grew just 0.1 percent last month, when compared with November and adjusted for seasonal variations, and the fourth quarter was the weakest quarter since 1990, when the country was in the midst of its last recession.
"We may not be in another recession," said John Lonski, the chief economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc., the credit rating agency. But, he added, "growth has slowed substantially; a gain of one-tenth of 1 percent in retail sales is nothing to brag about."
Moreover, the government revised downward the retail numbers for October and November yesterday, helping give the fourth quarter its dismal showing. "The retail numbers are really quite weak," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.
Many analysts also said the report contained a few odd findings that might be statistical blips that will be reversed in the final revised numbers or in January's data. Most significantly, sales at car dealers rose 0.3 percent in December, according to the government, even though automakers have called the month extremely weak and are cutting jobs and production as a result.
Spending at clothing stores and supermarkets also increased, while retail sales of building materials and home furnishings fell. Spending at department stores and restaurants also declined.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said yesterday that the prices that dealers pay for cars and light trucks rose last month. "It's pretty obvious to most people that car prices did not go up in the month of December," said Michael Strauss, the senior economist at Commonfund, a money manager for universities that is based in Wilton, Conn.
The overall Producer Price Index -- which measures the cost that manufacturers charge for their goods -- was flat last month and finished the year up 3.5 percent, largely because of rising energy costs. The core index -- which excludes the volatile energy and food sectors -- rose 0.3 percent in December, causing some alarm among economists that inflation remains a threat and that the Fed will be reluctant to cut rates.
But for all of 2000 the core index grew just 1.2 percent, only slightly faster than in 1999 and about half its pace in 1998. "One month doesn't make a trend," said Brian Catron, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the index. 
The prices of most unfinished goods and raw materials have fallen in recent months, the government reported, and those measures are typically a leading indicator for the Producer Price Index, which in turn suggests where the more well-known Consumer Price Index is heading. 
Over all, though, the economic data released this week surprised many analysts with its mild strength and offered a reminder that most economists still expect some growth in the first half of 2001.
Mortgage applications for home purchases increased 7.5 percent last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday, after two weeks of sharp declines. And unemployment claims fell last week, dropping to the same level as in December, the Department of Labor reported on Thursday.
But almost every indicator suggests an economy that is far weaker than it was last summer. In response, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, convened an unscheduled conference call on Jan. 3, during which Fed officials decided to cut interest rates by a half-point to 6 percent.
Most analysts expect the Fed to cut rates by at least another half-point in the next three months, according to a weekly survey of Fed watchers by Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. By June, the majority of analysts expect rates to fall by a full percentage point, to 5 percent.
The Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets rates, meets for two days at this month's end and then on March 20, May 15 and June 26.

HEADLINE: Robert Love, 102, a Developer Of Consumer Credit Insurance 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Robert A. Love, an economist and businessman who helped develop a type of life insurance that covered the value of home mortgages, died in his sleep on Jan. 5 at his apartment in New York. He was 102 years old.
 Mr. Love served as a professor and administrator in the City College system of New York for 45 years. In 1969, at the age of 71, he retired from City College's School of Business, now the Zicklin School of Business of the Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York, said his wife, Terry Belsito-Love. But he kept working as a consultant to mutual fund and insurance companies until his mid-80's and continued with economic and business projects until shortly before his death. 
Mr. Love, a tall, lanky man who played second base in college and skied and hiked most of his life, was an early advocate of installment lending to consumers, which, in the 1920's, many economists and bankers thought was riskier than providing credit to businesses. The type of life insurance he help develop, often referred to as credit life, was later applied to the outstanding balances on credit cards and an infinite range of consumer credit purchases.
While both concepts remain in wide use, consumer advocates are critical of credit life. They argue that premiums are proportionately lower for basic life insurance. They also favor basic life insurance because it pays a set amount at death, and can be used for any purpose. By contrast, credit life is intended to cover only the balance of specific debts. But credit life premiums are often as low as a few dollars a month -- because the benefits are relatively low -- and some advocates say this enables people with modest incomes to buy at least some coverage.
Mr. Love was born in Chriesman, Tex., on Dec. 19, 1898. He started in business early. As a boy he sold road maps door to door on credit, which friends say influenced his study on installment lending. And when he ran short of money while studying at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Tex., he dropped out and worked as a grain buyer at a flour mill. He also taught high school athletics before returning to Southwestern and receiving a bachelor's degree in 1922.
He earned a master's degree in economics at Columbia University in 1924 and began teaching at City College. Beginning in 1926, he did his work on installment credit as a part of a team of economists that included Arthur Burns, who later became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Love received a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1931.
In 1939, he became assistant director of the evening and extension division of the business school. Two years later, he became director of the division and held that post while continuing to teach until he retired. The evening and daytime programs were merged several years ago.
Attendance at the evening business school jumped sharply after World War II and again after the Korean War as military veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill, which subsidized their education.
Over his long career, Mr. Love conducted research for the National Democratic Committee and New York City. He helped start and run several mutual funds in the 1950's and 1960's and wrote seven books including, "How to Analyze Your Business" in 1938 and "Life Insurance and Mutual Funds" in 1968.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, LaNelle Love Donaldson of Houston. Mr. Love's first wife, the former Helen Hitchcock, who taught English and classics at Hunter College, died in 1983. They had been students together in high school in Texas and at Columbia and were married for 56 years.
Discussing his approach as director of the evening business school, Mr. Love once said: "We like to tailor-make a course for the specific job a man wants to do. The biggest danger in education is teaching people disassociated facts that confuse them and which they forget very quickly. We like to hitch the facts onto the things they're doing and where they're going."

HEADLINE: Hearings Put Port Authority's Toll Plan on the Line 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, long known for its ambitious building programs, will begin public hearings next week on toll and fare increases intended not only to finance its largest construction effort ever, but also to change how commuters behave.
 The proposed increases in tolls at the Hudson River crossings and fares on the PATH commuter rail line are expected to raise most of the money for a five-year capital plan whose $14 billion price tag equals the Port Authority's construction bill over its entire 80-year history. The increases -- the first in PATH fares since 1987 and the first in tolls since 1991 -- would allow the authority to increase its annual capital spending from the current figure, $700 million, to nearly $2 billion over the next decade. 
 But beyond bricks and mortar and creation of jobs, the increases are part of a novel congestion pricing plan at the toll plazas to modify driver behavior and counter trends that threaten gridlock, which could lead to stagnation of the region's economy.
Just as the agency believes it has eased congestion with E-ZPass, which is now used by nearly 60 percent of the vehicles crossing the river daily, it hopes to take the social engineering a step further. 
Under the new plan, which has not been tried elsewhere, tolls would be highest for cars and trucks paying cash during peak hours, rising to $7 from the current $4.
The increase would be less for those using E-ZPass and crossing at nonpeak hours. An existing discount plan for some New Jersey and Staten Island residents who regularly use E-ZPass at Staten Island crossings would continue, yielding a slight decrease to $3 from $3.60.
The Port Authority particularly wants to encourage commercial traffic to use the crossings overnight, when the rates would be lower for trucks equipped with E-ZPass. Over time, the agency wants to persuade businesses to allow employees to work flexible hours by showing how that can lead to the lower commuting costs, shorter travel times and happier workers. 
"Getting people over the bridges and through the tunnels at the right time is important, and if you are not pricing that within the way the overall economy functions, then you are dragging them down," said Christopher Ward, the agency's director of planning and external affairs.
It is this approach, rather than the ambitious building program for the ports, bridges, airports and other facilities run by the Port Authority, that is likely to be the lightning rod drawing the most reaction -- pro and con -- at four hearings scheduled to begin on Tuesday.
On Thursday, a coalition of business interests and environmental and transportation advocacy groups came together here to announce support for the fare and toll increases in spite of disagreements on some of the specific projects the money would finance. Coalition members made it clear that the glue that held them together was their mutual support for the variable pricing plan.
"This is a unique coalition," said Philip K. Beachem, president of the New Jersey Alliance for Action, a business group, as he pointed to representatives of the Sierra Club; the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group; the New Jersey Laborers-EmployersCooperation and Education Trust; and the Heavy and General Construction Laborers' Union. "We not only support the capital plan, but the toll structure and fare increase as well," Mr. Beachem said. "It's a quality-of-life issue."
Coalition members said the toll pricing plan would ease traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and bolster the region's economy.
"The Port Authority is really ahead of the curve with their variable pricing plan," said Janine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. 
But Sam Cunninghame, director of government relations for the 1,000 companies that make up the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, which is usually an ally of Mr. Beachem's group, says he sees the hubris of an Icarus in the agency's ambitions. 
He calls the plan a "penalty schedule and not a toll schedule," which "a bunch of rocket scientists believe will change behavior."
"It's not going to happen," he said, noting that the users of the trucking companies' services determined when goods move, not the truckers themselves. "And nobody is going to send a union trucker into the city at time and a half pay two and half hours before he needs to be there, just to save $10 on a toll," he added.
Steve Carellas, the coordinator of the New Jersey Motorists Association, accused the Port Authority of trying to make drivers "the cash cows" financing a capital program that is weighted toward airports and marine facilities. He said that the real need was for additional Hudson River crossings to ease congestion, and that he would urge group members who could not attend the hearings to voice their opposition through the Port Authority's Web site.
Mr. Carellas and some other opponents of the toll increases hope that the State Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who will become acting governor if Gov. Christie Whitman is confirmed as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, will block the plan. Port Authority commissioners have said they will not approve any toll increases without the support of the governors of New York and New Jersey, and Mr. DiFrancesco has said publicly that the increases are too high.
Rae Hutton, a spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco, said the Senate president would wait until after the hearings and a briefing by Port Authority officials before making a decision.
Most of the controversy is over higher toll prices, and not the PATH fare increases, which many insist have been held artificially low and subsidized by the Port Authority for too long. But United States Representative Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, has expressed concern that many poor people would not be able to take advantage of the discounts for buyers of multitrip passes.
The hearings on the toll and fare increases will be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday at the World Trade Center headquarters of the Port Authority, and from 5 to 9 p.m. at the Hudson County Administration Building Annex in Jersey City. On Wednesday, hearings will be from 5 to 9 p.m. at the Williamson Theater at the College of Staten Island; on Thursday, hearings will run from 5 to 9 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J.
If approved by the governors, the Port Authority's capital construction plan will mean $3 billion in airport improvements over the next five years, with $1.3 billion going to Newark International Airport for a host of new access roads, monorail connections and terminal expansions; $1 billion to Kennedy International Airport for new and expanded terminals, and $700 million to La Guardia Airport for improvements and new construction at all four concourses.
Another $1.8 billion is to be spent on port projects including dredging channels for larger cargo ships, dockside rail connections and development of the Howland Hook container port on Staten Island.
For the PATH system, money from the fare and toll increases would finance the $1 billion purchase of new and larger cars to replace the rail line's 35-year-old rolling stock, station improvements to accommodate longer trains and new switching technology for faster, safer travel.
And for most of the Hudson River crossings, some $1.6 billion would be spent for transportation systems that use a network of electronic signs to alert drivers to problems at the crossings and their approaches so they can alter their routes. The plan also envisions a second bridge to supplement the narrow Goethals Bridge connecting New Jersey and Staten Island.
Charles F. McClafferty, the Port Authority's chief financial officer, said the plan envisioned borrowing about $9 billion and supplementing that with $5 billion drawn over the next few years from the agency's annual income. The toll increases would also pay for a $250 million development bank for each state to finance ancillary projects. 
Mr. Beachem, of the Alliance for Action, said that although the toll increases for car and truck drivers paying cash sounded steep, there were cheaper alternatives: using E-ZPass, altering travel times or changing routes. The pricing plan is calibrated to impose higher tolls at crossings like the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, where there are many mass transit alternatives, and lower tolls at locations like the George Washington Bridge and the Staten Island bridges, where there are few or no such options. 
Robert Yaro, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a transportation and planning advocacy group that has long supported congestion pricing, said he suspected that the late William Vickrey, the Nobel Prize-winning Columbia University economics professor who is considered the father of such pricing schemes, was smiling down upon the Port Authority plan.
Mr. Yaro said he hoped that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would carefully watch the Port Authority effort and consider applying congestion pricing to its East River crossings.
"I think it is at least logical if not inexorable that the M.T.A. consider this sort of thing," he said.

HEADLINE: Cynicism Abounds as Californians Lurch Through Energy Shortages 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Kathleen Rose, a teacher in Sacramento, decided to keep her car outside last night, fearing that a blackout would make it impossible to raise her electric garage door. Michelle Gatreaux responded to a doubling in her Bay Area electric bill by turning down the heat to 60-degrees at night and shutting it off entirely during the day.
 And Trudy Sprankle a 65-year-old retiree in Fremont, Calif., said she's replaced all her light-bulbs with 40-watt ones and has calculated that, what with higher California electricity rates, it is now more cost-effective to lug wet clothes to the neighborhood laundry than use her own dryer. 
 Earthquakes, tidal surges, raging forest fires, "Sigalerts" of long delays on the San Diego Freeway - Californians always live with the threat of calamity tucked somewhere in the back of their mind. So perhaps it is no surprise that most people seemed today to be taking the tremors caused by the state's power crisis, with its threats of rolling blackouts, utility bankruptcies and skyrocketing electricity bills, pretty much in stride. 
"We know the drill," said Cara Green, who lives in La Canada Flintridge, an upscale bedroom suburb of Los Angeles in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains that gets its power from Southern California Edison. "We just didn't expect to have to do it for this reason."
When Ms. Green heard that there might be rolling power blackouts last night, she distributed candles and flashlights and promised to let her daughter roast marshmallows in the fireplace.
But what to make of it all?
Gov. Gray Davis and other politicians were still warning of calamity and vowing to do whatever was necessary to keep electricity flowing to constituents; utility executives said it was not their fault and begged for emergency help, and everyone was blaming the 1996 deregulation of the utility industry that had promised lower prices through competition and delivered chaos instead.
The situation left more than a few of the people interviewed around the state today feeling, frankly, a little powerless.
"My main thing is, I don't understand why we have this problem," Ms. Green said. "Nobody does."
Mansour Eid, owner of the Le Petit Market outside the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, said he was worried that electricity would be cut to his freezers and refrigerators, ruining the ice cream and dairy products that help make college life bearable. "The whole story is very confusing," he said. "It was another bad decision by bureaucrats."
At least one thing appeared abundantly clear today: If cynicism were electricity, the California power grid would be overloaded.
"I think it's fake," said Ken LaManche, a 64-year-old retired engineer in Fremont. "It's too convenient that this happens when we need the fuel the most. They say they're going to deregulate everything and they're supposed to save us money, but instead they raise the prices."
Sarah Cline, who runs the Top Dog cafe near the Berkeley campus, said that she can cook her wieners and sausages on a gas grill, so she is not too worried about blackouts, except at night, when she might have to let her customers eat in the dark or close up shop. "Of course, the government screwed it up," she said. "I don't think anyone's disputing that."
No, indeed, no one was disputing that.
"Deregulation is what caused it all," said Glen Jackson, a computer programmer from the Bay Area community of El Cerrito. "I don't see how you can look at this as an economic model that is going to provide better service. What advantage you get from deregulating a monopoly escapes me."
Still, Mr. Jackson said he was confident something would be done about it before the whole thing spun too far out of control. "It affects too many people, so it will have to be taken care of," he said.
A statewide poll in The Los Angeles Times last Sunday showed a startling reservoir of cynicism about a crisis that virtually every politician, business leader and newspaper editorialist in the state has been saying, over and over again, is absolutely genuine. More than half of those polled, or 54 percent, said that they did not believe there really was an electricity shortage. Nearly 40 percent said they strongly disapproved of the state's privately owned utilities, and an additional 20 percent disapproved somewhat. Perhaps unsurprisingly, 66 percent said they disapproved of the 1996 state deregulation plan.
None of it, however, seemed to be having much of an impact yet on most people's behavior, outside of a few small economies and token conservations.
Judy Greene, owner of A&J Discount, an appliance dealer in La Canada Flintridge, said most of her customers want high-end equipment and are less concerned -- even now -- with cash than with cachet. Ms. Greene did not seem to blame them. She thinks the whole thing smells fishy, too.
"I'm a cynic," she said. "We all believe Edison has so much money that there is no way this should be going on. I want to know what the CEO pulled down last year. If they're hurting so much, why aren't they selling off some of their land?"
When the California Legislature voted in 1996 to deregulate the state's privately owned power industry, it was done with the promise that increased competition would lower prices, allow consumers to shop among power providers and even stir renewed interest in alternative forms of energy.
Instead, California finds itself with a power shortage. Its private utilities, which sold off their power plants as part of the deregulation package, say they are forced to pay higher and higher prices to suppliers and either pass along the higher costs to consumers or file for bankruptcy.
Only a few cities, like Los Angeles and Pasadena, which opted to stay out of the deregulation program in 1996, are immune from the higher costs. Indeed, their utilities have been able to sell excess power, at today's higher costs, to the rest of energy-starved California. But many experts are cautioning residents of those cities not to gloat too much -- the costs of any state bailout of beleaguered utilities would likely fall on the shoulders of all the state's taxpayers, and even those cities are not immune from impending price hikes in the natural gas market.
"I believe the energy crisis is real," said Wayne Gould, president of Sunlaw Cogeneration Partners, a Los Angeles company that, among other things, is promoting construction of what it says will be a new, more energy-efficient power plant. "And I believe it is a three-legged stool. One leg is the lack of supply of electricity. Another leg is the effects of deregulation, which has allowed what I call marketeering to come in. And the third leg, which most people don't recognize yet, are the natural gas supply issues."
The problem, he said, is that most people just don't seem to grasp -- or to believe -- that the stool is sturdy and the crisis is real.
"For the most part, I don't think people understand it," Mr. Gould said. "They certainly don't understand the comprehensiveness of the crisis."
For the time being, most people seem to be trying to cut back on electricity, if they do anything at all, and to take whatever small steps they need to keep life livable.
Michelle Andaya, a 27-year-old marketing specialist, and Jason Buckner, a 26-year-old computer network technician, were sipping steaming cups of coffee outside a Starbucks in Fremont today. Their bills have gone up, they said, enough to force the couple to put aside money every week rather than taking their electric bill for granted. And they try to keep the thermostat on low, which is why they were out.
"It's cheaper to put on a sweater and buy a cup of coffee than put the heater on at home," Mr. Buckner said.

HEADLINE: Any Means to an End Zone; 
Meadowlands Mortals Do What It Takes to See Giants

BYLINE:  By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: CARLSTADT, N.J., Jan. 11 

 BODY:
In the plain little towns that ring the Meadowlands, where Giants Stadium rises from the swampy flats like a forbidden city, Sunday's N.F.C. championship game will carry with it a familiar, slightly bittersweet taste of exclusion.
 Of course the game is sold out. It's the playoffs. But Giants games are always sold out. And while hometown fans of most N.F.L. teams have a hard time getting into games these days, this is especially true in the case of the Giants, whose long, proud history -- much of it as the only pro team northeast of Philadelphia -- means that season tickets are passed down from generation to generation like jeweled watches. The waiting list is at least a decade long. 
 There are, to be sure, some football fans in southern Bergen County who have season tickets. But for the rest there are two options -- watch the game on TV like the rest of America, or be creative. For locals who choose creativity, a whole culture, almost an underground economy, has developed around ways to angle, wangle, bluff or schmooze a way into the stadium.
Hence the tale of Robert Soboleski and George Georgeou, friends who were drinking happy-hour beers here in Carlstadt, just up Route 503 from the Meadowlands, at the Grasshopper Also bar (not to be confused with the Grasshopper Too, a related establishment in Wayne). 
Both are local guys who wore the caps of their employer, Matheson Tri-Gas, esteemed vendor of argon, arsine and other industrial substances, in East Rutherford. And since they were boys, both have rooted like hell for the Giants.
But Mr. Soboleski, 36, has a second job, plowing snow at the stadium for a big construction company. A big shot there has season tickets. And he's usually out of town on the weekends. So he gives -- gives! -- Mr. Soboleski his tickets.
So on Sunday, as the Giants try to hold off the Minnesota Vikings for 60 minutes and dee-fense their way to the Super Bowl, Mr. Soboleski, a big, beefy guy, will be at his usual spot in the stands, his big, beefy face painted Big Blue. And Mr. Georgeou, as usual, will watch from his couch in Little Ferry, three miles north of the end zone.
"You've got to love it," said Mr. Soboleski, nearly dancing in his chair.
"I don't love it," said Mr. Georgeou, 63, who can count on one hand the number of games he has attended since the Giants moved to his backyard 25 years ago. "But I don't begrudge him, because he's a diehard Giants fan."
Similar stories abound.
At Maggie O'Byrne's, a bar on a ridge on the west side of Carlstadt, overlooking the stadium, Tom Harnett, the grounds supervisor at Hackensack University Medical Center, said he relied on charity and luck to breach the stadium gates. The Giants give tickets to a fund for children with cancer, which then raffles them off. Mr. Harnett, 55, said he had won the raffle about 20 times.
A bartender at Maggie's, Patty Garrett, will be at the game Sunday, working, sort of. Ms. Garrett, who is 24 but looks younger, is paid to make the rounds of the concession stands, buying beer to make sure the vendors ask for ID. Ms. Garrett got her job through a neighbor in Wood-Ridge who worked for the Giants concessionaire, she said.
A few years ago, she said, someone offered her father field-level press passes. "He said, 'All you have to do is wear a camera around your neck and pretend you're a reporter,' " she recalled. Her father declined, she said, and she has not forgiven him.
On the steps of Carlstadt's boxy beige-brick municipal building, Domenick D. Giancaspro lifted his eyebrows conspiratorially when asked how he managed to get to games several times a year.
"I can't say," he said. "I'm the chief financial officer of the town. But let's say connections."
Elsewhere, the gallery of longtime Giant rooters is filled with giants of many sorts. 
Andy Rooney drives to Manhattan from Norwalk, Conn., boards a shuttle at the Port Authority Bus Terminal and rides to the games with his fellow fans. He has decent tickets now, but he had to work for them.
In the 1950's, Mr. Rooney explained, he was part of a group who shared a cluster of 10 season tickets, one of which was behind a pole at the Polo Grounds. "If you were new," he said, "you had to sit behind the pole until someone left the group and you could move up, and I was there for one year behind the pole."
A federal judge in the Southern District of New York, Richard C. Casey, has been going to the games for more than 40 years, the last 13 in the company of a guide dog.
"God was kind to me," the judge said. "I saw the Giants win the Super Bowl in 1987, and I was blind a month later."
The novelist E. L. Doctorow still cherishes memories of attending Giants games back when cheap bleacher seats drew a much more diverse crowd. "If you go out to the ballgame now, it's all white and middle class and up, and I think that's to be regretted." 
At Maggie O'Byrne's, Eddie Marthinson was holding forth, fondly remembering the days in the 1950's when the Giants played at Yankee Stadium and anyone could buy a ticket on game day for $1.75 and sit in the bleachers. The face value of some upper-tier tickets for Sunday's game was $82, but with the sellout, scalpers will be asking many times that price.
Years back, Mr. Marthinson, 58 and now the assistant track supervisor at Meadowlands Racetrack, got his hands on season tickets and has not let go.
"I put them in my daughter's name," he said. "That way if I drop dead I know damn well who's going to get the tickets."
At the Grasshopper Also, a few of Mr. Georgeou's neighbors confessed to having season tickets. Mike Raleigh, 37, a sales executive, said he waited 10 years for his. Lee Johnson, 67, who works at a towel factory in Moonachie, got his season tickets in 1954.
Mr. Georgeou was glad to hear about his fellow fans' good fortune.
"If anybody's interested in giving away tickets, come and see me," he said. "They can reach me on my cell phone."
He did not offer his number.

HEADLINE: Plan to Build Generators Is Approved 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
State environmental officials granted permission yesterday for a state agency to go ahead with a controversial plan to build 10 temporary generators around New York City in an effort to prevent energy shortages this summer.
 The Department of Environmental Conservation, which held hearings recently to listen to the concerns of city residents, handed out the three-year air-control permits to the New York Power Authority, which plans to build 10 turbines that generate 47 megawatts each. The authority has also submitted a plan to build an 11th turbine in Staten Island, which the environmental agency is reviewing. All 11 generators would cost the authority $450 million. They will be bought from General Electric. 
 "These permits will allow the State Power Authority to build small, clean-burning, state-of-the art power plants that will help meet immediate short-term demand for electric power in the New York City metropolitan area," said Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation.
The agency gave its approval at a time when California has been wracked with energy shortages because of what its state officials say is an inability to build more power plants.
Last October, the New York State Department of Public Service said there was an "urgent and compelling need" for more power in the city before the summer, when many residents and businesses begin using air-conditioners and other equipment that require electricity. Two years ago, Washington Heights was crippled by a 19-hour blackout.
The new turbines are to be scattered among six plants throughout the city, with one also on Long Island. Of the 10 approved generators, four gas-fired turbines are to be built in the Bronx; three in Brooklyn; two in Queens; and one in Brentwood, in Suffolk County.
The generating-capacity of the plants will be small compared with those of most others, which usually churn out 500 to 1,000 megawatts. Each turbine, which is expected to be in place for two to three years, are to be 140 feet long and 40 feet high. They will stay in place until private energy companies begin to supply electricity from new or rebuilt plants around the city. More than a dozen such plants are being proposed by several companies.
But many residents near the areas where the temporary generators would be built have denounced the construction plans.
Some have criticized the lack of a full environmental impact study of the plants. Such a study is not required because the amount of power each plant generates is below the threshold necessary for a review. That minimum is 80 megawatts, while the permits limit plants with two turbines to a total of 79.9 megawatts.
What is more, environmentalists say, the plants could contribute to air pollution in their surroundings and destroy economic revitalization in the communities.
"We feel it's very discouraging how they've gone about this," said Kyle Rabin, a program associate at Environmental Advocates, an Albany watchdog group. "It's still going to add air pollution to the immediate areas that are hosts to these proposals. They're simply looking at these turbines without doing a comprehensive analysis of other sources of pollution in the areas." 
Mr. Rabin called for the state to do complete environmental impact studies in all the areas where the plants are to be built before construction begins.
Other critics have complained about the noise and cited fears that the turbines may drive developers away from land near the plants. One of the city's largest television and film centers, Silvercup Studios, said recently that it would drop plans to build studios on the East River waterfront in Queens because two of the proposed turbines would be built nearby. The turbines may be too noisy, company executives said.
The Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, said last month that she would not allow plant construction on the East River, and business executives complained that the turbines would take up prime waterfront development land.
But Ms. Post said that the Department of Environmental Conservation had reviewed everyone's concerns and felt confident that the plants would not harm their surroundings. She said that the Power Authority had agreed to offset the emissions generated by these turbines by putting tighter controls on emissions generated from other nearby plants.
"One of the highlights of the permits and of an agreement by the Power Authority is that these plants will not increase air pollution in the communities where they will be built," she said.
But Mr. Rabin said the way in which the plants had been approved was disingenuous and "undermined the public's ability to get involved in the process."

HEADLINE: AOL Time Warner Sticks to Its Aggressive Goals 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Just over a year after signing the biggest merger ever to create a new breed of technology-driven media company, the leaders of what late Thursday formally became AOL Time Warner said yesterday that they were sticking to the aggressive financial goals promised to investors.
 The merger of Time Warner, the nation's biggest media company, and America Online, the largest Internet service, was completed just hours after it received final approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The deal, which was originally announced on Jan. 10, 2000, took months longer to complete than the companies expected because of tough regulatory reviews in Washington and Europe. 
 With the government satisfied, AOL Time Warner now faces the uncertainties of the economy. But its executives maintain a positive view, in sharp contrast to the stream of warnings in recent weeks by companies in the old and new economies of shortfalls in sales and profits. 
The company will announce a round of layoffs in the next few weeks, people close to its plans said. But Stephen M. Case, the chairman of the new company who had been chairman and chief executive of AOL, said that any cutbacks would come from eliminating overlapping areas in the two companies rather than cutting costs in the face of bleak business prospects.
"We want to be the most valuable and most respected company in the world, and we're not going to get there by cost-cutting," Mr. Case said. "We recognize that with $30 billion in costs, there are opportunities for efficiencies."
He said that despite the cutbacks, which he declined to quantify, the company would end this year with more than the 85,000 workers it currently employs.
Cuts are expected at CNN, which has financial problems; in staff areas; and in Time Warner's technology units as AOL takes over their functions.
Last month, Time Warner said it would not meet its financial targets in the fourth quarter of 2000 because of low movie attendance and a shortfall in advertising on its television networks. But the executives said the combined company still expected to record $40 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion in pretax operating profit. The company said that $1 billion of the pretax earnings would come from cost savings and new business opportunities created by the merger. 
Gerald M. Levin, the former Time Warner chairman and now chief executive of the new company, said that whatever the ups and downs in the advertising market and the movie business, AOL Time Warner rested on a very stable base of 130 million subscriptions to its magazines, online services, cable systems and HBO movie channels. These, he said, are unlikely to be hurt in any economic downturn.
"We have inserted our products and services into the lifestyles of our customers," he said. "People depend on them to manage their everyday lives and for those who want to be relieved of their unrelenting boredom, we tell stories." 
The executives said that the America Online Internet service was not seeing any slowdown in its advertising revenue, despite the sharp drop in online advertising at other companies. On Wednesday, for example, Yahoo, the largest Web site, slightly missed analysts' sales targets in the fourth quarter of 2000 and warned that its sales in 2001 would be short of expectations.
"AOL is in a totally different zone than a dot-com advertising vehicle," Mr. Levin said. Rather than the sort of banner ads that sites like Yahoo offer, AOL specializes in joint promotions that are more akin to direct mail programs.
Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said he agreed that America Online's advertising revenue appeared to be less vulnerable in a recession than other media and online companies.
"In a downturn, money flows from advertising into marketing budgets," he said. Mr. Case said that despite the delays, the company was not hobbled in any way by the restrictions imposed by the F.C.C. and the Federal Trade Commission. In the end, he said, the government largely forced the company to do what it said from the start it would do -- open its cable systems and instant message systems to rivals.
"Our preference was to be able to demonstrate that the commitments we made to open access would work in the marketplace," Mr. Case said. "The preference of the F.C.C. and the F.T.C was to take a more regulatory approach."
The rules relating to offering high-speed Internet services over cable systems, imposed by the F.T.C. last month, affect a business that is experiencing growth now. The F.C.C. rules about instant messaging, however, will have little immediate impact and my never come into play.
America Online dominates the market for instant messages -- short bits of text that can be sent immediately from one user to another -- and its system is incompatible with those of its main rivals. But the F.C.C. concluded that because Time Warner did not have an instant messaging service, the merger did not give the agency any authority to regulate the existing system.
The F.C.C. did rule that if AOL Time Warner were ever to offer an instant message service that let users send video images to each other, presumably utilizing the Time Warner cable systems, that system would have to be opened to competitors.
Mr. Case said that AOL had no plans to offer such a video message system any time soon. 
Shares of AOL Time Warner closed at $46.47, down 76 cents, in their first day of trading. That represents a 37 percent drop from the $73.75 that AOL's shares were trading at before the merger was announced.
Mr. Levin said he hoped investors would no longer look at AOL Time Warner as either an Internet company or a media company. Rather he hoped that since the company's nearly $200 billion in market capitalization towers over either sort of rival, investors would see it in an even more rarefied league.
"This is a one-of-a-kind, very profitable, global large-capitalization growth stock, like G.E. or Wal-Mart that deserves a premium valuation," he said.

PERSON: William Hewlett 

HEADLINE: William Hewlett Dies at 87; A Pioneer of Silicon Valley 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
William Redington Hewlett, the electrical engineer who in 1938 with David Packard pulled together $538 to set up a tiny electronics company in a Palo Alto, Calif., garage that ultimately led to the creation of Silicon Valley, died today at his home in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 87.
 In 1987 after building the company that would become the nation's second-largest computer maker, Mr. Hewlett went on to become one of the nation's leading philanthropists. Currently the Hewlett Foundation, which he established with his wife, Flora Hewlett, in 1966, has an endowment of $3.5 billion. With Mr. Packard, Mr. Hewlett has contributed more than $300 million to Stanford University. 
 The two men's bootstrap approach to business became the founding legend of the region of Northern California that in the 1970's was to become known as Silicon Valley. 
The Valley's economy has since given rise to a range of industries including semiconductors and personal computing. It is known for its openness to energetic engineers with ideas and passion and still venerates the individual entrepreneur, ideas that Mr. Hewlett and Mr. Packard pioneered.
"They created the first Silicon Valley company," said Steven P. Jobs, founder and chairman of Apple Computer Inc. "When David Packard died in 1996 it was the beginning of the end of an era; now this is the end."
The two men founded Hewlett-Packard while they were doing graduate work at Stanford University, after Mr. Hewlett had moved back to the San Francisco area from a job at General Electric in Schenectady, N.Y.
Acting at the urging of Frederick E. Terman, his radio engineering professor at Stanford University, Mr. Hewlett made plans to start a business with Mr. Packard while on a climbing trip in Colorado in 1934. At the time most Stanford engineering students were forced to move East to take jobs at the large electronics companies of the era. Mr. Terman was looking for a way to create a home-grown industry on the West Coast.
Initially they tried to sell a variety of diverse inventions including a self-flushing urinal, a bowling lane foul indicator and a shock machine to help people lose weight.
Their big break, however, came when they received an order from Walt Disney Studios for eight audio oscillators, which were used to test sound equipment in the production of the movie "Fantasia."
The two men went on to build a global electronics, instrumentation and computing powerhouse that was noted for an informal corporate culture that had a commitment to a set of pragmatic corporate values -- referred to as the H.P. Way -- aimed at eschewing hierarchy, valuing employees as people and unleashing individual creativity.
Last year the company they created was split into two corporations: the Hewlett-Packard Company, with revenue of $48.8 billion and more than 88,500 employees; and Agilent Technologies Inc., with revenue of $10.8 billion and more than 47,000 employees.
Mr. Hewlett's informal approach to business and to life is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that in 1967 he picked up the phone to speak to a precocious 12-year-old who was calling the company to ask for parts to make a piece of electronics equipment known as a frequency counter.
"I was asking for some spare parts," said Mr. Jobs, who at the time was an eighth grader in a local junior high school intent on exploring the world of electronics. "Not only did he give me the parts, but the following summer he saw that I had a job in the division of the company that made frequency counters."
Mr. Jobs said that the encounter changed his life and added that what he learned at the company became a blueprint for his own computer company, Apple.
At H.P. many of the engineers who worked for him remember Mr. Hewlett as the consummate engineer who would roll up his sleeves and plunge in to any problem with great enthusiasm.
"He was the engineer's engineer," said John Young, a Hewlett-Packard veteran who became chief executive of the company in 1977. "He was a very creative person and he was close to the engineers and interested in their work."
Although much of Mr. Hewlett's professional work was done before the emergence of the digital computing era, he played a crucial role after the company had invented the H.P. 9100, the first desktop scientific calculator, in 1968.
It was Mr. Hewlett who issued a challenge to his engineers in the early 1970's to design a version of the system that would fit in his shirt pocket. The engineers answered in 1972 with the H.P. 35, which was the world's first pocket scientific calculator and which quickly led to the obsolescence of the slide rule.
Although it was his partner, Mr. Packard, who is known for the informal business leadership approach of "management by walking around," Mr. Hewlett was also a practitioner of the art.
"He would wander by and pull up a chair and sit down and begin playing with the knobs and offering suggestions," Mr. Young said. Indeed, he was so good at examining the work of his employees that they coined the term "the Hewlett effect" to explain how projects that they thought worked perfectly would inevitably reveal some flaw after Mr. Hewlett began exploring them, Mr. Young said.
Mr. Hewlett was also known for his sense of humor, which leaned toward puns -- some good and some bad.
He was so averse to conventional business hierarchies that he would usually choose to sit at the middle rather than the head of the table during business meetings.
After World War II, during which Mr. Hewlett served in the Army Signal Corps, the company began growing rapidly.
In the 1950's it became a dominate player in the market for electronic test and measurement equipment and then in 1966 it entered the computer market with the H.P. 2116A, a machine that had been designed as a controller for electronic systems.
Hewlett-Packard pioneered the "open plan" office in Silicon Valley. It was a way of organizing an open workplace without doors where employees were separated only by low-rise dividers. 
Mr. Hewlett prided himself particularly on his company's employee-oriented policies. During his career benefits like catastrophic medical coverage, flexible work hours and decentralized decision making were all at the core of the company's philosophy.
Ultimately, Mr. Hewlett, who at one time owned about 30 percent of Hewlett-Packard's stock with Mr. Packard, became a billionaire. But he did not live a jet-set life, and he worked hard at trying to keep the wealth in perspective for his children, at one point telling a reporter that he was worried about the impact that great wealth would have on his family.
"We felt we were just ordinary people," said Walter Hewlett, Mr. Hewlett's oldest son. He said in an interview today that he remembered asking his father frequently about what the largest company in Palo Alto was, and each time his father would respond, "the cannery."
"Then one day he told me it wasn't the cannery any longer, it was Hewlett-Packard," he said. 
Mr. Hewlett's wealth was estimated to be $9 billion last year by Forbes magazine, making him one of the nation's 50 wealthiest people.
Although Mr. Hewlett is generally remembered more for his engineering acumen and Mr. Packard for his business expertise, they shared a similar vision for their company.
After his military service Mr. Hewlett returned to H.P. in 1947 and became a vice president. He was elected executive vice president in 1957, president in 1964 and chief executive in 1969. Mr. Hewlett resigned as president in 1977 and retired as chief executive in 1978. He then served as chairman of the executive committee until 1983, when he became vice chairman of the board. In 1987, he was named director emeritus.
The Hewlett Foundation, which is the nation's 18th largest, focuses on a wide range of issues including conflict resolution, education, environment, family and community development, the performing arts, population issues and United States-Latin American relations.
Mr. Hewlett, who was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and moved to California when he was three, was an outdoorsman and a mountaineer. He made a number of difficult ascents in Yosemite as a young man and was an ardent amateur botanist and devotee of wildflowers found in the Sierras, where he went frequently.
In 1977, Flora Hewlett died, and in 1978, he married Rosemary Bradford. He is survived by his wife and five children from his first marriage: Eleanor Hewlett Gimon; Walter B., William A. and James S. Hewlett; and Mary Hewlett Jaffe. In addition, he is survived by five stepchildren from his second marriage: David C., Robert A., Peter K. and Jeffrey M. Bradford; and Deborah Bradford Whelan.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Says No Secret Economic Data Led to Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., said today that the central bank's surprise decision last week to cut interest rates sharply was not based on any nonpublic information about economic or financial problems.
 In a speech to an economic conference in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Ferguson provided some glimpses into how the Fed came to its decision, between regularly scheduled meetings, to reduce its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point in response to growing concern that the long economic expansion was in peril. 
 He hinted that tumbling stock prices had played some role in the decision. But he seemed intent on tamping down speculation that the Fed had cut rates on the basis of some secret information or as yet unpublicized trouble in the financial system.
"Taking a policy action between meetings surprised some observers, and some have asked, 'What does the Fed know that we don't?' " Mr. Ferguson said. "The answer to this question now, as in nearly every situation in which we change policy, is, 'very little if anything.' "
He also offered a vague forecast for the rest of the year, saying that while demand has weakened more than expected and inventories are uncomfortably high, businesses are adjusting quickly and lower rates should give the economy a lift.
"Consequently, I would expect a period of notable weakness early in 2001, followed by a pickup in activity," Mr. Ferguson said.
Further rate cuts by the Fed, he said, would depend in part on the strength of the stock market and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital to keep the economy humming. But he signaled that the Fed would reduce rates sufficiently to ensure that the economy goes back on track fairly quickly.
"While the scenario I outlined seems the most likely to occur, I am not sure what level of interest rates will be associated with it," he said. "This depends on a number of developments, including the evolution of financial markets and investor appetite for risk." 
He said the Fed would act "prudently and forcefully" to avert a recession.
Mr. Ferguson, whose term on the Fed board has expired and whose future at the central bank hinges on whether President-elect George W. Bush chooses to renominate him, said the central bank spent much of last year trying to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace, but that economic conditions "changed dramatically" late in the year.
He said the Fed had "wrestled" at its last scheduled meeting, on Dec. 19, with whether the sharp slowdown that by then was clearly under way was a precursor of a serious problem.
"The risks clearly had shifted toward a period of subpar growth, but as of the middle of December, the evidence in hand did not appear sufficient to justify a rate cut," he said.
But in the weeks after the Dec. 19 meeting, he said, data suggested that the economy was deteriorating quickly. Mr. Ferguson cited in particular the index of manufacturing activity compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Managers, which came out the day before the Fed voted to cut rates on Jan. 3. The index showed that manufacturing activity had fallen to a level not seen since the end of the last recession a decade ago.
He also noted declines in automobile sales and production, downward revisions to data on orders and shipments of capital goods, indicators of rising unemployment and disappointing corporate profit reports.

 California Governor Orders Energy Conservation Plan
One day after California was on the verge of blackouts because of its energy crisis, Gov. Gray Davis ordered a crash power conservation program for the state and met with other regional governors to map out comprehensive solutions.
Under orders to cut energy use by 5 percent by next Tuesday, state officials initiated programs that included changing the bulbs in traffic lights to more efficient models and redirecting the power generated by a state dam to the power grid rather than to pumps in state-owned aqueducts. Page A1.

HEADLINE: 60's Administrations Considered Bombing Nuclear Sites in China 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Alarmed by the rapid development of China's nuclear program in the early 1960's, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations considered bombing targets there and killing the experts, as well as supplying India with nuclear weapons, recently declassified documents show.
 All options were rejected as too risky, according to the documents obtained by researchers at the independent National Security Archive and used as the basis for an article appearing this month in International Security, a Harvard University publication. 
 Pentagon officials expressed concern about China's nuclear program as early as February 1961, when Air Force planners said a C.I.A. estimate that China could have the bomb as early as 1963 was too conservative and predicted that bomb testing could begin as early as that year. 
Intelligence reports concluded that the Chinese had made significant progress by 1963, and the issue began to figure prominently in meetings between President Kennedy and his national security advisers.
In April 1963, the Joint Chiefs of Staff prepared a document examining all available options -- from blockading China and infiltrating and sabotaging the program, to air attacks on the facilities, backing a Taiwanese invasion of China and launching a tactical nuclear attack.
However, the document rejected direct force as unlikely to wipe out the Chinese nuclear capability. Indeed, it suggested that any attacks, covert or overt, would probably spur Chinese aggression.
It instead recommended cooperating with the Soviet Union and Britain to contain the Chinese threat through diplomacy, for instance, by offering the Chinese economic assistance as a disincentive to developing the nuclear program.
Subsequent reports by Robert Johnson, an official of the State Department's Policy Planning Council in both administrations, suggested that China's nuclear capacity would never be great enough to threaten American interests and that the Chinese were not disposed to recklessness in any case.
One Robert Johnson paper from April 1964, outlining the range of "unorthodox" responses should the Chinese ever pose a real threat, remains classified.
The view that it was impossible to wipe out the Chinese nuclear capability -- and unwise to attempt it -- prevailed until Oct. 14, 1964, when the Chinese first tested a nuclear device, alarming President Johnson's administration and prompting some officials to counsel more direct action.
In a paper dated Dec. 14, 1964, George Rathjens, an official of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, argues that Robert Johnson's reports ignored the danger "that relatively weak powers will be able to inflict very great and totally unacceptable damage on much stronger ones if they acquire nuclear capabilities."
He counsels "further consideration of direct action against Chinese nuclear facilities," and even considers a policy of assassinating Chinese nuclear officials. "For a longer term effect it would be necessary to destroy research facilities and personnel," he says.
The declassified papers show that officials also considered helping India develop nuclear weapons as a means of containing its neighbor.
President Johnson, who was committed to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, rejected such direct responses and instead chose to continue the policy of containing nuclear expansion by diplomatic means.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
'What Sales Slump?' Foreign Makers Ask

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
For the Nissan Motor Company, it seems like a poor time to be thinking about expanding in the United States. Its troubles at home in Japan are forcing it to close five factories there. Meanwhile, auto sales are slowing sharply here.
 Yet Nissan has just begun work on a new factory in Mississippi to make full-size pickup trucks for the American market. 
 "A lot of people," Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's chief executive, said at a preview for the annual North American International Auto Show that formally opens here this weekend, "are telling me, 'You are getting into the U.S. market as it is going down? Are you crazy?' " 
Not in the least, he responds. The full-size pickup truck market in the United States, he said, is Nissan's single biggest opportunity for profit around the world. The market for American full-size pickups alone is more than half the size of the entire passenger vehicle market in recession-weary Japan. And just four companies -- General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and Toyota -- compete for the big money to be made in selling large pickups.
Besides, Mr. Ghosn added, the strength of the dollar against the Japanese yen makes it profitable to do business here despite current economic softness. "There is some slowdown in the U.S. market, it is true, but there is some compensation in the exchange markets," he said.
Just as demand in the United States is shrinking, Detroit automakers are facing the most serious assault on their home market in years. Japanese and European automakers have embarked on an investment binge in the United States, erecting factories from Indiana to South Carolina and from West Virginia to Mississippi in an effort to compete with General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in the highly profitable markets for pickups, minivans and sport utilities.
Foreign-car lovers who used to buy American when it came to full-size pickups, sport utilities and minivans are now finding that they can buy similar models, assembled in North America, from the same Japanese companies that have long sold them high-quality cars.
At the same time, imports are soaring. Korean automakers are rapidly taking over the American market for the smallest, cheapest cars. At the top of the market, Mercedes, BMW and other luxury cars from Europe are selling as fast as they arrive. And profits are excellent because the cost of making the cars has fallen sharply, in dollar terms, as a result of the weakness of the euro.
Together, more foreign-owned factories in the United States and more imports from Asia and Europe have produced a jump in the market share of foreign automakers. This, combined with the unexpected drop in American demand this winter, has caught Detroit with large inventories of unsold vehicles; General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler continued running their factories full tilt through the autumn, ignoring the first hints of a weaker market.
Now the Big Three are being forced to hunker down, making production cuts that are far deeper than the fairly modest 10 percent falloff in sales would seem to require. And these production cuts are slowing the entire industrial Midwest economy, which led the nation in growth through much of the last decade.
Ford has reduced planned first-quarter production by 17 percent from its level a year ago; G.M. has cut production by 21 percent and DaimlerChrysler by 26 percent. Ward's Automotive, an auto industry data service, forecasts that sales of American-brand vehicles this year -- excluding American-owned foreign brands like Volvo and Saab -- will be the lowest since 1992, when the country was just barely emerging from recession.
"We shouldn't debate too long on whether the slowdown is here -- it is," said John Devine, G.M.'s vice chairman. "The issue for me is much more of duration."
President-elect George W. Bush has been increasingly outspoken about the risks of economic trouble ahead. Auto executives say that proposed tax cuts would help raise demand for new cars a bit. But as industry executives have gathered here this week, there have been surprisingly few calls for government actions to assist the auto industry, such as encouraging the dollar to drop or threatening tariffs and other restrictions on imports.
When Bill Clinton won his first presidential election eight years ago, the domestic auto industry was still struggling while foreign automakers were thriving. The chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met with the president-elect then to complain that the American dollar was overvalued against the Japanese yen. They also began secretly preparing a sweeping legal complaint, accusing Japanese automakers of unfair competition.
In an interview here this week, Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said that when he joined chief executives from other industries at a meeting with Mr. Bush a week ago, he mentioned that the dollar was too strong. But Mr. Wagoner said that he raised the subject only briefly, and added that he saw little chance that the industry might take the more aggressive approach of seeking higher tariffs on imported cars by filing trade complaints at the Commerce Department.
"It's not something we're putting a lot of effort into right now," he said. "So many of the manufacturers we traditionally fight against have developed U.S. manufacturing bases."
Complicating any attempt to form a unified industry strategy are the many foreign alliances the industry now has. G.M. owns Saab and has acquired stakes in Isuzu, Suzuki, Fiat and Fuji, the parent of Subaru. Ford owns Jaguar, Volvo and Land Rover and controls Mazda. And Chrysler, of course, is now little more than an operating division of DaimlerChrysler A.G., which also bought a third of Mitsubishi in October.
Dieter Zetsche, a longtime Mercedes executive recently installed by Daimler as Chrysler's chief executive, said that he thought the dollar should fall 10 to 15 percent against the yen and the euro. He said this was a DaimlerChrysler position as well, while acknowledging that his former colleagues at Mercedes were enjoying the profits from producing cars in Europe and selling them in the United States.
But he opposed any of the trade restrictions Detroit has favored in the past. "As I'm in favor of free trade," Mr. Zetsche said, "I cannot now raise my voice for protection."
While Motown dithers, though, automakers from around the world are shipping more vehicles here from factories in their home countries, making use of the dollar's strength to book fat profits in yen, euros and Korean won.
The Big Three have managed to keep their prices flat for comparably equipped vehicles. But foreign automakers have been actually reducing the prices for some models, partly because of the strong dollar. Toyota cut the price for the imported RAV4 sport utility vehicle last autumn by 3.7 percent, or $678. Toyota was able to reduce the price a year earlier for the imported Celica small car by 21.6 percent, or $4,745.
With aggressive pricing and new models, foreign automakers are confident that their sales will stay strong even as the overall American market slows. For 2001, said James E. Press, Toyota's executive vice president for North American sales, "We really think we will avoid a decline."
At Nissan, the determination to build full-size pickup trucks in the United States is even more striking given the gloominess about the American economy that prevails at Renault, the French automaker that controls Nissan and owns Samsung of South Korea. Louis Schweitzer, Renault's director general and top executive, said he expected the slowdown in the United States to prove enduring. "Will it be more than six months?" he said. "Yes, I believe."
American manufacturers are suffering from the weakness of the euro and yen, and have begun some quiet lobbying. But many are leery of publicizing the extent of the harm for fear that more investors will sell their shares, said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economics at the National Association of Manufacturers. 
In any event, John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, was pessimistic about the prospects for any action by the incoming administration. "There's a strong belief that a strong dollar is good for everyone because it makes imports cheaper," he said. "Weakness in currencies is a problem for us, but we're going to have to live with it."
The only people talking about using trade laws against imports these days are at Solidarity House, the headquarters of the United Automobile Workers union. But while the union has the legal standing to bring complaints against importers, it has little influence with a Republican administration and has not filed trade complaints without the automakers.
The entanglement of foreign alliances is not entirely new in discouraging Detroit from seeking trade restrictions on imports. In early 1993, after Toyota threatened to cancel various joint ventures with G.M., the Big Three ended up deciding not to file their trade complaint against Japanese imports.
But Detroit mounted a big push for a lower dollar. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen did make several comments in the first few months of the Clinton administration that contributed to a decline in the American currency.
Detroit is not alone in having trouble devising a strategy on trade or the dollar. Japanese automakers have become leery of discussing the subject among themselves, because so many companies in Japanese auto industry groups are now controlled by foreign automakers, a Japanese executive said.
The first victims of the slowdown have been auto parts suppliers and their workers. Delphi Automotive Systems and Visteon, spun off in the last two years by G.M. and Ford respectively, have laid off several thousand workers already.
Not all suppliers are being hurt, however. Suppliers of auto parts that need replacing several times during the life of a vehicle, like tires, are faring better.
And suppliers in the South are benefiting from the steady expansion there of foreign-owned auto factories. In addition to the Nissan pickup factory in Mississippi, Honda and Mercedes are building factories in Alabama to produce minivans and carlike sport utilities. All three factories are aimed at market segments that American manufacturers have long dominated.
Nissan showed here a "concept" version of how its pickup might look, an aggressive, even menacing gray vehicle that strongly resembled a gray GMC concept pickup displayed here last year. A gaggle of G.M. executives who walked by the pickup were amused and dismayed by the similarities.
"It looks like Mad Max," said one of the executives to his colleagues.
"At least they could have changed the color," another remarked.
Another G.M. executive was more somber, noting that Nissan had said that it planned to market the full-size pickup mainly to households that already owned a Japanese compact pickup. Such households currently trade up to Detroit-built full-size pickups, the executive warned, adding that Nissan's marketing forecast was, "a polite way of saying it's aimed right down our throats."

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA ACTING TO RELIEVE CRISIS 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
A day after California narrowly avoided rolling blackouts across the state, Gov. Gray Davis attacked the simmering energy crisis by ordering a crash power conservation program and meeting with regional governors to map out comprehensive solutions.
 In an atmosphere of broad public mobilization, Mr. Davis ordered the government to slash energy use by 5 percent by Tuesday. State officials started programs that included replacing the bulbs in traffic lights with more efficient models and redirecting the power generated by a dam to the power grid rather than to pumps in state-owned aqueducts. 
 The state even sent out orders that janitors change the way they clean government buildings so more lights can be shut off at one time.
The flurry of activity created almost a wartime mood of general mobilization to battle the critical power shortages, although Californians remained skeptical about the entire situation. Page A11. 
"What we are doing now is really total behavior modification," said Claudia Chandler, a spokeswoman for the California Energy Commission, which is managing many of the efforts. "We have a lot of conservation programs, but this goes way beyond that."
At the same time, the State Assembly approved two bills today to provide longer-term solutions. 
One measure would restructure the boards of the two entities that oversee the distribution of power, the California Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange. The boards would consist of experts appointed by the governor rather than representatives of the power industry and consumer groups, as is the case now. 
Another bill would prevent private utilities from selling off more of their electricity generating plants.
Both bills must now go before the State Senate.
"We absolutely get the urgency of this," said Robert M. Hertzberg, the Assembly speaker, who said the Legislature was working in a bipartisan spirit to pass a range of bills in the coming days. "Government got us into this mess and government has got to get us out. We are laying the cornerstone for the restructuring of the entire power system."
He added that the Assembly had abandoned its usual method of operation, considering a large number of bills and voting on just a few, and was now far more focused and disciplined, working cooperatively on a smaller number of bills that would be passed quickly.
In Sacramento, Mr. Davis met with Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon and Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, and they issued a statement pledging a cooperative effort to solve the crisis, in large part through broad conservation programs. 
Much of California's power is imported from Oregon and Washington, and while some have expressed concern about how California was taking in energy from elsewhere during this crisis, today the governors offered mutual support and said they would even explore joint purchases of energy-efficient equipment.
The three also said they would focus on developing alternative energy sources and new technologies for generating cheaper power.
Perhaps most important, the governors called for federal action to cap soaring wholesale prices for electricity, something Mr. Davis has sought , with no success, for weeks. They urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to set the limits. Failing that, they said they would seek relief from Congress and the Clinton and Bush administrations.
After the two oil shocks of the 1970's and the birth of the environmental movement, energy conservation became such an ingrained way of thinking in many spheres of the economy that some companies said there was little further they could do. For example, Kinko's, which operates shops for photocopying, printing and other services, has not done anything in response to the recent energy crisis. Energy conservation "is already such an integral part of the company," said Maggie Thill, a spokeswoman at Kinko's Ventura headquarters. 
Since last summer, Ms. Thill said, the 75 Kinko's branches in California have drawn electricity from Green Mountain Energy, which derives some of its energy from renewable resources like wind and water. 
But under the plan announced by Mr. Davis today, the state will initiate a large education program that will urge people to take steps to cut demand and offer some incentives. On Monday, Mr. Davis announced a program to offer consumers rebates on energy-efficient refrigerators, washers and air-conditioners.
Mike Courtney, the state official who oversees maintenance of all state office buildings, said he was preparing a campaign that involved measures like reducing indoor winter temperatures to 70 degrees from 72 degrees and shutting off computers and placing others on sleep mode, so they would burn less power when they were not being used.
He said that janitors were being told to clean buildings differently. Instead of fanning out, they are being told to clean one floor at a time. That way, Mr. Courtney said, they can turn off the lights on the other floors and conserve power.
Mr. Courtney said that the state was already using roughly 8 percent less power now than it was a year ago because of various conservation programs, but that he still felt he could meet the 5 percent emergency reduction.
Ms. Chandler of the energy commission said that some big savings were being offered by the Department of Water Resources, a huge consumer. In one important measure, the department will change the way the pumps in certain aqueducts are used, turning them on mostly during off-peak hours. That will allow the department to shift power produced by its Orville Dam in Northern California to the general power grid at peak hours, boosting the available supply.
All of this came against a backdrop in which the threat of imminent blackouts subsided. On Thursday, the Independent System Operator had warned that planned blackouts might be required in late afternoon. It narrowly averted them because of a combination of spontaneous conservation and the purchase of emergency power from sources outside the state.
Today, the state was still on a so-called Stage 2 alert, in which the supply of power was just 5 percent greater than actual use. But no blackouts were expected and officials said the situation would probably improve next week. Several large plants that had been down or generating a reduced supply of power were now operating, the officials said, with more increases in power generation expected over the weekend.

HEADLINE: WINTER IN THE SUN; 
PALM SPRINGS LOOSENS UP

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB; BERNARD WEINRAUB reports on entertainment for The New York Times in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
WILL KLEINDIENST, the exuberant mayor of Palm Springs, sat in his corner office of City Hall on East Tahquitz. The building -- with its fiberglass panels and corrugated metal roof and sand-blasted concrete block -- was designed by Albert Frey, one of several renowned modernist architects whose houses and hotels are coming back in favor in the desert city. Outside, passenger jets dip slowly from the cloudless sky down to the newly expanded Palm Springs International Airport.
 "Palm Springs used to be known as 'God's waiting room.' You came here to retire and, well, recreate," said Mr. Kleindienst, a 48-year-old city official. "We've made a concerted effort to broaden our base to make sure everyone can enjoy Palm Springs -- single or married, family or divorced, gay or straight, black or white. It's no longer just for the traditional wealthy." 
 A few miles away at the trendy Mediterranean-style Korakia Pensione, a group of private homes converted into a 27-room hotel, Douglas Smith, the owner, pointed out the various sites used for fashion shoots and nodded to an MTV crew. "Bloomingdale's just left," said Mr. Smith, who bought the property in the Tennis Club district of the newly gentrified Palm Springs in 1989. Three years later, he opened it as a hotel. The actresses Natalie Portman and Julianna Margulies had been recent weekend guests, as well as such stylish types as Tom Ford and Donatella Versace, the designers; Annie Leibovitz, the photographer; K. D. Lang, the singer; the actress Susan Sarandon; and one of the Dalai Lama's top associates with 11 monks. In short, it's not the kind of place where the traditional Palm Beach resident would feel comfortable.
"The town isn't necessarily hip," said Mr. Smith, "but there's certainly a quirky energy here. It's a weird place. Don't forget you once had Sonny Bono as Mayor. Liberace had a house here. You go to a club and there's a model from New York, a physician from Dallas, a lady in a tilted wig, some photographers from Europe and a Barry Manilow look-alike playing the piano. There's a live-and-let-live attitude that's part of the appeal. And don't forget you're in the desert: it's beautiful." 
Hip hotels -- most of them small and kitschy -- are booming all over Palm Springs, a sign that the city of more than 48,000 is in the midst of a resurgence that recalls the 1940's. At the time, the town, with its aura of seediness, even decadence, became a haven for movie stars like Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz and Bing Crosby, as well as such moguls as Darryl F. Zanuck, once they could put air-conditioning in their walled compounds. Earlier the Palm Springs Racquet Club, built by Charles Farrell and Ralph Bellamy in 1932 for the Hollywood crowd, served as a favorite hangout. (The club was also created to counter the restrictive code of top Palm Springs hotels that barred Jews and blacks.)
By the 1970's and 80's, the town's center, Palm Canyon Drive, had turned bleak and was cluttered with cheap restaurants and T-shirt shops. Many hotels were in disrepair. And newcomers and tourists were driving to the other towns in the Coachella Valley like Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Coachella, Desert Hot Springs, Indian Wells, Indio, La Quinta and Cathedral City. (At Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City there is a small gravestone lying flat on the ground that reads: "The Best Is Yet to Come. Francis Albert Sinatra, 1915 to 1998." Although outsiders often view these towns as part of Palm Springs, they're not. The newer towns are separate entities. But the weak real estate market and shaky tourism of that time proved, in some ways, fortuitous for the future of Palm Springs.
While many American cities in the 1970's and 80's were in the grip of urban renewal and bulldozing their recent past, Palm Springs had neither the money nor the desire to send wreckers into its neighborhoods. The result is that dozens of homes by the underappreciated and highly prolific Mr. Frey, who designed about 200 projects in Palm Springs, as well as such modernist architects as Richard Neutra and Rudolf Schindler, were left unscathed. These houses and others were picked up relatively cheaply by buyers, many from Los Angeles, 107 miles away, to restore as second homes or, in a few cases, to turn into hotels.
The newer hotels are a mixed lot. Perhaps the most elegant (and expensive) is The Willows, with just eight rooms, near the center of town. The Italianate-Mediterranean-style villa, at the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains, was once the home of Samuel Untermyer, an affluent lawyer from New York, who built the mansion in 1927. Marion Davies later lived there. Albert Einstein, a friend of Mr. Untermyer's, was a house guest. Clark Gable visited on his honeymoon with Carole Lombard. By the 1980's, the house had become a shambles.
Fade in to 1994: Two young emergency room doctors from Los Angeles, Tracy Conrad and her husband, Paul Marut, on a vacation in Palm Springs, saw the mansion for sale. "It was pretty much in a state of disrepair and we thought we could restore the house -- we love architecture and design," said Ms. Conrad. "It was way too big to live in. We thought we could make it a bed-and-breakfast. We were complete neophytes. We probably wouldn't have done it had we known. It was more expensive than medical school by far."
The result is a meticulously restored B & B with polished red-oak floors and distinctive rooms that are quite opulent, 1930's-style. One room, The Library, where Gable and Lombard stayed, includes a carved cherry fireplace, a private patio and a silver chandelier in the bathroom. The Einstein Room, where the great scientist stayed, includes Art Deco inlaid mahogany furnishings and a patio with French doors. 
"When we first bought the house people thought we were nuts," recalled Ms. Conrad. "The recession hit this town hard. But now real estate has gone nuts here. Palm Springs is the Hamptons of Los Angeles."
Only a few miles away on North Indian Canyon Drive, visitors seeking retro, 50's-style hotels (complete with Princess phones) would be welcomed at Ballantine's as well as Ballantine's Movie Colony. Opened last February, Ballantine's is one of the first hotels in Palm Springs to embrace kitsch and midcentury modernism. The 14 rooms, many quite small, as well as suites, are filled with period furniture by Eames, Knoll and others. Vinyl and Formica are everywhere. Blue Astroturf surrounds the pool. Classic 1950's B movies with Humphrey Bogart are shown in each room. 
Once called Mira Loma, and sometimes used as a rendezvous for movie stars and moguls who wanted to slip away from the nearby Racquet Club, the hotel was popular with guests like Marilyn Monroe and Veronica Lake. Now there's a Marilyn Monroe suite, where she once stayed, with photographs of the star and posters of her films, as well as an Audrey Hepburn Room, a Palm Springs 50's room and a French 50's room, with a red and orange shag pile carpet, Bertoia chairs and Leger prints on the walls. Some rooms have 50's chenille bedspreads, along with vintage toasters and radios. The Princess phones have a certain charm, but try getting messages. 
Sarah Robarts, a British painter and interior designer, owns Ballantine's with her husband, Fraser Robertson, a venture capitalist from Scotland. Ms. Robarts said the couple came to California from London a year and a half ago to change their way of life, visited Palm Springs and were entranced by the desert and the town. "Many of the smaller hotels were Southwestern or tacky," said Ms. Robarts. "There was nothing midcentury. There was a wealth of architecture, but it was mostly private homes. This hotel itself was pink and green, just awful. But Fraser said, 'Look at this architecture.' "
The success of Ballantine's led the couple to buy another building only a few blocks away and turn it into Ballantine's Movie Colony, the newest hotel in town. In one of the earliest buildings designed in Palm Springs by the Bauhaus-trained Albert Frey, it has 16 kitschy rooms decorated with original and reproduction 40's and 50's furnishings. 
"What surprised me about Palm Springs is that it's so different from the profile of being a very conservative place," said Ms. Robarts. "It's quite arty. There's a big gay community." 
Certainly the influx of gay tourists and residents has influenced Palm Springs. Like Key West, Fla., and Provincetown, Mass., the town is now a popular destination for gays. John Williams, co-owner of the INNdulge Palm Springs hotel in the mostly gay Warm Springs section of the city, and former president of the Desert Gay Tourism Guild, said there were now 34 gay hotels in the area, mostly in Palm Springs. Moreover, the Palm Springs Bureau of Tourism has made an effort to attract gay tourists. (Hotels catering to the gay market account for nearly 10 percent of the occupancy taxes collected from Palm Springs lodgings.)
Mr. Williams, walking around his hotel while several nude men swam in the pool, moved to Palm Springs from Hawaii in 1995 and, like many others, found the town affordable enough then to buy the property for a hotel. Now the increase in tourism -- and the purchase of homes -- has accelerated because of the prosperous economy in the 1990's. 
Curiously, Palm Springs has something of a split personality. The town often votes Republican, and presumably many of the wealthy golf crowd are conservative.
But the quirkiness of Palm Springs, coupled with the arrival of new residents, has given it a freewheeling spirit. Dr. Janice Lyle, executive director of the Palm Springs Desert Museum, the cultural bedrock of the town, began working at the museum 17 years ago. (The museum has just completed a highly successful exhibition of the artist and sculptor Duane Hansen.) "When I first came here," said Ms. Lyle, "I kept thinking, 'How am I going to live in this place?' Everything seemed so narrow to me. It's not that way at all now." 
The community's resurgence has also led, of course, to a restaurant revival. There are traditional high-priced restaurants like Le Vallauris and Johannes in Palm Springs and Cuistot in Palm Desert, and at the other end of the price spectrum very popular dining spots like Thai Smile and El Mirasol. A mid-priced, comfortable restaurant, Davey's Hideaway, with a traditional prime rib and rack of lamb type menu, is perhaps most typical of Palm Springs. On a recent night, the crowd mixed the casual and the slightly formal: tables of affluent couples with women wearing diamonds, several tables of three or four gay men, a family with children, and several young couples. The food was unfussy and straightforward, the mood friendly.
At the moment, the trendy crowd seems to favor, among others, La Provence in Palm Springs. And for a 1950's Palm Springs experience, order a martini at the bar of Melvyn's at the Ingleside Inn or the Bamboo Lounge of the Racquet Club, whose lobby is filled with photographs of such long-ago visitors as Lucille Ball, Clark Gable and Natalie Wood.
Despite its renewed popularity, it would be inaccurate to say that Palm Springs and the region are suddenly supercool and supertrendy. It's still a place with huge golf resorts, and buildings all over town seem crammed with surgeons, doctors, dentists and financial advisers. A visitor walking along a quiet stretch of Palm Canyon Drive, the main street, early the other morning was startled to see in the dawn dimness a brightly lighted storefront with nurses and dialysis patients visible through the windows.
The desert is still a mecca for golfers: there are more than 100 golf courses in the area. Visitors looking for tennis, health clubs and resort amenities favor such lush hotels as the 884-room Marriott Desert Springs Resort and Spa in Palm Desert, as well as the Ritz-Carlton and Westin Mission Hills Resort in Rancho Mirage and the Hyatt Grand Champions Resort in Indian Wells. There are also any number of spas, one of the more lavish being Merv Griffin's Resort Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs. (After the actor Robert Downey Jr. was arrested there over the Thanksgiving weekend and charged with possession of drugs, reservations increased substantially.)
Stewart Weiner, editor of Palm Springs Life, a monthly magazine that covers the region, moved to the area from Los Angeles with his family in 1994.
"There's still a village atmosphere about this place, you still talk to strangers on the supermarket line," said Mr. Weiner. "But we're sort of the rage now. Golf's the rage. People are interested in midcentury modern architecture, Hollywood nostalgia, the 50's. I went to a restaurant last night and everyone was speaking French and German. That didn't happen a few years ago."

Hotels with an air of old Hollywood
The season is now in high gear in Palm Springs, and lasts until Memorial Day, when the desert temperatures start climbing. The Palm Springs Bureau of Tourism has a highly efficient Web site (www
.palm-springs.org). Hotel reservations can be made by calling (800) 347-7746.

Where to Stay
Among the smaller hotels in town is the sedately luxurious eight-room Willows, 412 West Tahquitz Way, (760) 320-0771 or (800) 966-9597, fax (760) 320-0780, Web site www
.thewillowspalmsprings.com, a villa with rooms filled with antiques; some have lush garden patios. The most expensive is the Marion Davies Room, with an imposing fireplace, elegantly carved king-sized bed and a chaise longue and silver chandelier in the spacious bathroom. Hotel amenities include a three-course breakfast and wine and hors d'oeuvres. A 30's-style pool adds to the ambience of old Palm Springs, or even old Hollywood. Prices in season range from $295 to $550. Weekend reservations are sometimes difficult to snare.
Several streets away is the Korakia Pensione, 257 South Patencio Road, (760) 864-6411, fax (760) 864-4147, made up of two villas, bungalows and guest houses. The 1924 Moroccan-style villa is especially popular with the trendy crowd, mostly from Los Angeles, some from New York. Across the street is a Mediterranean-style villa, once owned by the early screen star J. Carrol Naish. The atmosphere is sometimes sensual, sometimes commercial. (There seem to be frequent visits by fashion photographers and models.) Torches blaze by the pool at night; archways are draped in bougainvillea. The rooms have stone floors, feather beds and Mediterranean-style furniture. Rates: generally $119 to $369. 
The 14-room Ballantine's Hotel, at 1420 North Indian Canyon Drive, is about seven blocks from its sister hotel, Ballantine's Movie Colony, at 726 North Indian Canyon Drive, with 16 rooms and three townhouses. Reservations for both, (800) 780-3464; information, www.ballantineshotels
.com. At Ballantine's, the small rooms (and smaller bathrooms) are given 1950's touches. The Marilyn Monroe suite costs about $265 a night. For the same price, there is the 1950's musicals suite, with photos of Fred and Ginger and Gershwin, a Kelvinator refrigerator, Crosley radio and lava lamp. Other rooms, including the Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Room (he used the former hotel on the site for assignations, according to a brochure), are less expensive (from $139). The newer, bigger Movie Colony, in a building designed by Albert Frey, also has a 50's theme. Rates are similar to Ballantine's, though townhouses cost $395.
INNdulge Palm Springs, at 601 Grenfall Road, (760) 327-1408, fax (760) 327-7273, a gay hotel in the Warm Springs section of town, has 22 rooms. Doubles are $109; $125 with kitchenette; suites $145 to $165. 

Where to Eat
There are dozens of restaurants in Palm Springs, with every price available. At the top end is Le Vallauris, 385 West Tahquitz Canyon Way, (760) 325-5059, an old-school French restaurant with a lovely garden. Specialties include seafood as well as beef and lamb. Dinner for two can cost at least $150 with wine. 
Somewhat less expensive and less formal, and popular with the new hip crowd, is La Provence, 254 North Palm Canyon Drive, (760) 416-7784, serving mostly Provencal cuisine. Dinner for two, about $115, with wine. 
A meal at Davey's Hideaway, a friendly steak-and-potatoes (as well as fish) restaurant at 292 East Palm Canyon Drive, (760) 320-4480, costs about $70 for two, with wine. 
And one of the most crowded and informal places in town -- with some of the best food -- is Thai Smile at 651 North Palm Canyon Drive, (760) 320-5503. Try the pad Thai noodles. Dinner for two, about $30, with beer. 
There are a half-dozen good Mexican restaurants around town, but the one that seems most popular among locals is El Mirasol, 140 East Palm Canyon Drive, (760) 323-0721. Pollo con mole and enchiladas verdes will satisfy cravings for Mexican food. Dinner for two, $30, with beer.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 14 about Palm Springs referred incorrectly to the training of the architect Albert Frey, who designed some 200 buildings there. A letter received on March 1 from Sandra A. Kocher, the daughter of Mr. Frey's partner, A. Lawrence Kocher, pointed out that while Mr. Frey was aware of architectural developments in Germany during the Bauhaus years, that he was not Bauhaus-trained. He studied in his native Switzerland.

Produce Politics

BYLINE:  By Michael Pollan; Michael Pollan is a contributing writer for the magazine. His new book, "The Botany of Desire," will be published in May.

 BODY:
Whenever I go to the supermarket these days, I collect labels. No, I'm not saving up box tops in order to get a decoder ring from Battle Creek. The sort of labels I collect now promise something else, a slightly different decoding. Each of them tells me a little story about where the food I'm buying comes from and how it has been produced.
 "Organic" is the oldest and by now most familiar of these labels, and it's about to become even more commonplace, now that the federal government has finally issued its long-awaited, much-debated national organic standards. Sometime next year, a new green-and-white U.S.D.A. "organic" seal will begin to show up on everything from carrots to TV dinners and breakfast cereal, indicating that their ingredients were grown and processed without synthetic chemicals. But organic is just the earliest bud in what is beginning to look like a flowering of supermarket narrative. Lately I've seen labels informing me that the fish in the seafood cooler was caught in a sea-turtle-friendly net; that the coffee in the caffeine aisle has been "shade grown"; that the tea on sale next to it is not only organic but "fairly traded"; that the beef in the meat case was humanely raised; and that the apples in the produce section were locally grown by a farmer who treats his workers respectfully. 
 At first I wasn't certain whether this banquet of storied food was just a marketing gimmick or the first stirrings of a new politics of food. Superficially at least, the proliferation of eco-labels is of a piece with the trend toward "liberation marketing," in which almost everything is sold as an expression of the consumer's sense of social justice, environmental consciousness or moral virtue. But while it is true that casting the purchase of an iMac or a pair of Nikes as an act of political courage is a gesture worse than empty (particularly when the sneakers in question were made in a sweatshop), the stories now on sale in the supermarket strike me as belonging to a very different genre. These are stories about what used to be called "the means of production," and in a food system as troubled and opaque as ours, they can be radical indeed.
Ever since we began buying our food in supermarkets, the food chain that ostensibly links the American eater to the American land has grown steadily longer, more intricate and less legible; by now it is all but invisible to most of us. This is evidently the way agribusiness wants it, judging by the vigor with which they fight any effort to tell consumers more about how their food is made. It's not hard to see why: the stories about our food system that do get out don't do much for the appetite. There's the one about how genetically engineered StarLink corn deemed unfit for human consumption somehow found its way into tacos and breakfast cereal. Then there's the mad-cow story, which brought us the disquieting news that beef cattle in this country routinely dine not only on hormones and antibiotics but also on bits of other beef cattle (not to mention pellets made from their own manure).
Stories have a way of begetting more stories, and it is scary ones like these that have spawned the more pastoral tales told by the new food labels. The industry objects to eco-labels on the grounds that they constitute an "implicit criticism" of conventional food. They also point out that the spectacular growth of the organic industry during the last decade has been driven by "food scares." Exactly!
Food that comes with a story -- whether it's organic, fairly traded, humanely grown, sustainably caught or whatever -- represents a not-so-implicit challenge to every other product in the supermarket that dares not narrate its path from farm to table. To get some idea of the potential power of that challenge to an industry that has fought to nullify the word "organic" and now campaigns against proposals to label food made with genetically modified ingredients, consider a technology now in some supermarkets in Denmark. Packages of meat and poultry carry a bar code that, when scanned by a machine in the store, calls up pictures of the farm where the animal was raised, as well as information about its diet, living conditions, the date of its slaughter and so on. Imagine how quickly this sort of transparency would force a revolution in our food chain.
Indeed, the simple act of suggesting that such stories about our food are our business verges on sedition in an era of deregulation and free trade. It is one of the pillars of free trade that a country may not discriminate against any product based on the way it was made. "Dolphin safe" gives conniptions to the World Trade Organization, just as "Ulysses" once did to the courts. The W.T.O. doesn't like stories.
That a growing number of consumers apparently do is alarming or encouraging, depending on what you've got to sell or tell. One of the many triumphs of free-market thinking over the past few years has been to redefine "the public interest" as simply whatever the public is interested in buying. Under this convenient formulation, the consumer -- that one-dimensional economic actor beloved of world traders and food marketers -- trumps the citizen, and the corporation can pretty much do what it wants so long as it enjoys the consent of the shopper. What the architects of this so-called market populism could never have foreseen, however, is that the sharp distinction between the roles of consumer and citizen might blur, and that the citizen - that somewhat recherche character -- would actually show up in a supermarket one day. Well, here he comes now. Look for him in the produce aisle.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
In Theaters Now: The Asian Alternative

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

 BODY:
THE hyperkinetic Hong Kong action films of Jackie Chan could hardly have less in common with the contemplative, novelistic dramas of Taiwan's Edward Yang. But both belong to a phenomenon that has been called the "Asian Invasion," the sudden ubiquity of films from the Far East in art and commercial theaters, both here and in Europe. 
 In New York, Mr. Yang's "Yi Yi" ("A One and a Two") -- a many-layered, 173-minute examination of the passions and disappointments of a middlingly prosperous Taipei family -- was recently named best foreign-language film of the year by the New York Film Critics Circle and best film overall by the National Society of Film Critics. In Paris, Wong Kar-wai's aggressively stylish Hong Kong romance, "In the Mood for Love" (which opens in New York on Feb. 2), was one of last year's most successful commercial releases. And around the Western world, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," an elevated martial arts film from Taiwan's Ang Lee ("The Wedding Banquet"), is on its way to becoming the first Chinese-language film to break out of the art house and become a genuine popular success. 
 As it expands its run into America's shopping mall theaters, where subtitles are largely a novelty, "Crouching Tiger" will almost certainly become the highest-grossing foreign-language film of all time in the United States, surpassing the $58 million take of Roberto Benigni's "Life Is Beautiful." 
For its part, Hollywood has paid its ultimate compliment to the Asian cinema by luring away some of its leading talent. John Woo, whose innovative gangster films ("A Better Tomorrow," "The Killer") changed the face of Hong Kong filmmaking in the 1980's, is the director behind the blockbuster hit "Mission: Impossible 2," and the star he created, Chow Yun Fat, is now a regular in American productions. Yuen Woo-ping, a veteran martial arts choreographer, took time off from his regular employer, the Hong Kong star Jet Li, to create the stylized fight sequences for "The Matrix" and "Crouching Tiger"; his brother, Yuen Cheung-yan, did the same for "Charlie's Angels."
Clearly, Asia is much too big and complex a place for there to be a single, simple explanation for the current success of Asian films. But just as clearly, there is a new creative energy crossing the continent that can't be denied. China, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and even several of the less economically privileged countries of the Pacific Rim (including Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines) have all seen a dramatic increase in the number of their films selected for westward export. Where Asian films were once barely visible at international festivals (apart from those by the Japanese masters Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu and Kenji Mizoguchi in the 1950's and 60's), it is now practically mandatory for festivals to devote entire sections to surveys of recent Asian film.
Yet the surge in Asian films is unlike the revivals of national cinema that occurred in Italy in the late 30's, France in the early 60's and Germany in the mid-70's. There is no single, pan-Asian figure -- no equivalent to Rossellini, Godard or Fassbinder of the earlier movements -- to found a new style and, through the force of his originality, a new school. There is no new, single source of finance, as government was for European cinema in the 80's, that can explain the renaissances occurring in capitalist Taiwan and socialist Vietnam. And there is no new, devoted audience that has emerged to support Asian films in general: one suspects that the teenage fan of Japanese anime (the feature-length adaptations of Japan's sophisticated, adult-themed comic books) would have very little to say to the film festival patron shuffling into the latest formal study by Taiwan's Tsai Ming-liang (whose 1998 film "Hole" featured upstairs and downstairs neighbors spying on each other through a fissure in the flooring).
And certainly there is no single, monolithic Asian cinema. The cultural differences among the nations of eastern Asia are certainly as profound as those among the nations of Western Europe, if less obvious to Western eyes. The lush historical dramas that come out of Korea, like Im Kwon Taek's gorgeous "Chunhyang" of last year, have little in common with the down-and-dirty cop thrillers that are now in vogue in Hong Kong, or for that matter with Korea's own highly stylized crime films, like Lee Myung-se's recent "Nowhere to Hide."
But there is one thing that unites the new movies coming out of Asia: they are not Hollywood films, a major distinction in a world where alternatives to the big American machine have become unconscionably rare. Mr. Yang's "Yi Yi" displays a concern with the texture of everyday reality that no Hollywood film would countenance; Mr. Lee's "Crouching Tiger" displays a willful transcendence of that same reality that no American movie would dare.
More than new personalities or new styles, the Asian cinema offers a new perspective for viewers accustomed to Hollywood films, a grip on reality that differs in small but important ways. Hollywood has settled into a comfortable, unselfconscious, totally unintellectual postmodernism, which consists of recycling bits and pieces of old, half-remembered movies.
Just as George Lucas inflated his childhood memories of "Flash Gordon" reruns on Saturday morning television into the empty grandeur of the "Star Wars" films -- transforming naive art into formulas for heroic myth straight out of Joseph Campbell -- so have many of the American filmmakers who followed him mined their primal memories, scraping vague impressions of the cop movies, war films, detective stories and slapstick comedies (above all, the Three Stooges) they enjoyed as children into the ur-genre films that populate the multiplexes today.
FILMS like "What Women Want" or "Vertical Limit" spring not from any actual experience or observation but from the impulse to make, respectively, a Tracy-Hepburn romantic comedy or a mountain climbing adventure. The most chilling film in this regard last year was Ridley Scott's "Gladiator," a loose collection of plot cliches and stock characters gathered from the history of a largely forgotten genre, the sword-and-sandal epics of the 50's and 60's, rolled into one big ball. 
And now, with the dominance of digital special effects, filmmakers can create settings and spectacles every bit as synthetic as their recycled characters and situations. Just as the Coliseum crowds and roaring tigers of Mr. Scott's film dissolve into screenfuls of buzzing pixels when you look closely, so does the film's fiction fly away into fragments and references -- a bit of "Spartacus" here, a bit of "Ben Hur" there -- when you try to grasp it.
It is only in the last couple of years that Asian films have begun to exploit digital technology, a delay that has worked much to their advantage. When Jackie Chan leaps from a mountain wall onto a passenger balloon that happens to be passing by -- this amazing stunt occurs in his 1986 "Armor of God" -- there is no question that he is actually doing it; the risk is real, and the sense that death and disaster are genuine possibilities informs not just the scene itself but the whole sense of Mr. Chan's work. He is an adventurer, in life as well as in the movies, and he knows what he is talking about.
At 46, Mr. Chan is getting to the point in life where such exploits are no longer a possibility, but now that he is making American movies ("Rush Hour," "Shanghai Noon"), the insurance companies are hardly likely to allow him to continue taking risks. It is one thing to break a leg and hold up shooting on a modestly budgeted Hong Kong film; it's something quite different to suffer an injury and shut down a major Hollywood production. Inevitably, Mr. Chan will find himself on the same digital mountaintops conquered by Chris O'Donnell in the weightless, frictionless "Vertical Limit," where the only risk is running out of RAM.
What is true in action films is also true in domestic dramas, though in a different way. Edward Yang's "Yi Yi" is set in the concrete reality of present day Taipei, a city of glass boxes that could be almost anywhere on the planet. The film follows the fortunes of the Jian family, which appears to be breaking apart under the pressure of modern urban life. 
NJ (Wu Nienjen), the 40-ish businessman who is the de facto head of the family, feels disengaged from his job at a struggling software company; when his high school sweetheart (Ke Suyun) shows up, visiting from America, a door opens into a possible future. Meanwhile, NJ's wife, Min-Min (Elaine Jin), has left home for a Buddhist retreat, unable to cope with the devastating stroke her mother has suffered, which leaves NJ's teenage daughter, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee), largely on her own as she tries to negotiate the pitfalls of a first romance. 
As a plot outline, "Yi Yi" doesn't differ much from "American Beauty," last year's Oscar winner for best picture. NJ could sit down with Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham over a Scotch, and the two men could share their sense of hopeless alienation from their work, their barren relationships with their wives, their fantasies of romantic escape and their incomprehension of their teenage daughters.
Lester's wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), finds an outlet for her romantic frustration not in Buddhism but in an equally demanding American discipline: the selling of real estate. And, just like Thora Birch's Jane Burnham, Ting-Ting finds herself with no parental figure to help her through adolescence; she finds her role model instead in a more assured, more attractive and apparently more sexually sophisticated girlfriend. Both films end, somewhat disappointingly, with tabloid-style incidents of violence, which the filmmakers link to the violence that courses through popular culture.
But "American Beauty" is a film that takes place within quotation marks, within a "perfect" American suburb, a "perfect" two-story Colonial house, a "perfect" nuclear family. The director, Sam Mendes, is a British stage veteran whose understanding of America seems based entirely on our exported sitcoms and soap operas; in trying to turn those abstracted, idealized images on their heads, he produces only an equally abstract cynicism: an attack on institutions that no one really believes in, institutions that exist only as conventions in entertainment formulas. They are the remains of the glorious middle-American iconography created by Steven Spielberg under, and in a sense for, the Reagan administration -- now threadbare and untenable but still with a certain resonance and authority.
In "Yi Yi," there is no such easy cynicism or ironic distance. At least to this non-Asian observer, Mr. Yang's image of contemporary Taipei has an authenticity that shakes off facile generalizations and condescending stereotypes. Though the film's world view is limited to that of its privileged characters (there are no visions of the shantytowns or impoverished mountain villages you see in the films of Taiwan's other leading director, Hou Hsiao-hsien), there is nothing in it that seems manipulated, exaggerated or cunningly art-directed. Rather than having ironic recourse to a Taiwanese Norman Rockwell -- or whatever artist might define that country's treasured complacencies -- Mr. Yang pushes aside conventions and goes directly to character. The Burnhams are defined by their wall hangings, the Jians by their relationships to each other.
It's suggestive, too, that "American Beauty" remains tied to the consciousness of Lester: he is its central character and narrator, and most everything in the film is seen from his point of view. Mr. Yang, like his colleague Mr. Hou and many other Asian directors, prefers a fluid point of view, one not tied to any particular character; his is a slightly set-back perspective that allows the audience members to choose their own identification figures, or shift their focus of identification as the drama unfolds. 
Mr. Yang and Mr. Hou have both been pioneers in a long-take, long-shot style; the camera, for example, will be positioned on the far side of a room, observing the characters for long moments without a cut or a close-up as they circulate around a dining room table or a tea room. No single figure is privileged above any other, and the focus is placed instead on the transactions between characters, on the gestures and speeches they make toward one another, on the way they approach, avoid and circulate. The opening sequence of "Yi Yi," set in a catering hall where a chaotic wedding reception is taking place, is a model in this regard; what we learn about the characters comes from how they sit, stand and converse with each other. For a viewer accustomed to the continual assault of Hollywood films, with their high-impact close-ups and rapid, analytical cutting, these Asian films seem blessedly calm, cool and respectful of the viewer's ability to make his or her own judgments and connections.
This intense but unruffled quality is common both to the art films of Taiwan and the popular entertainments of Hong Kong. Rooted in the stage tradition of the Chinese opera, martial arts movies have long remained conscious of the importance of an integrated, fully articulated space in which the action can be placed; the use of the widescreen, CinemaScope format, almost ubiquitous in Hong Kong movies, allows protagonist and antagonist to share the same space, to react with and against each other in much the same way Fred Astaire related to Ginger Rogers in their dance sequences, shot with an equally distant camera. It's a perspective that emphasizes continuity over fragmentation and grace above impact -- whereas the rapid cutting in an American action film like "Gone in 60 Seconds" or "Con Air" creates mainly a sense of being slapped in the face, forcefully and persistently.
Inevitably, Eastern and Western filmmaking styles are moving closer together. Though influences between the two have always been strong -- John Ford's westerns inspired Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas, which in turn inspired Sergio Leone's Italian gunfighter sagas -- it is only in the last 10 or 15 years that video has made films widely available on both sides of the cultural divide.
In China, the young members of the so-called Sixth Generation of filmmakers (the sixth to emerge since the arrival of cinema in China), like Lou Ye ("Suzhou River," 2000) and Wang Xiaoshuai ("The Days," 1994), are reflecting the influence of European art house directors of the 50's and 60's like Michelangelo Antonioni and Alain Resnais, whose films were not shown in China at the time of their release. Suddenly, the Sixth Generation filmmakers seem fixated on themes of anomie, alienation and dissolving identity -- all maladies of individualism -- whereas the Fifth Generation directors, among them Chen Kaige ("Farewell, My Concubine," 1993) and Zhang Yimou ("Raise the Red Lantern," 1991), were concerned with social issues and reclaiming Chinese history. (A series of nine Sixth Generation films, including "Platform," Jia Zhang Ke's magnificent 2000 chronicle of post-Mao China, will be shown at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center from Feb. 23 through March 8.)
The most imitated figure among young Asian filmmakers right now is the maverick Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai. His almost psychedelically stylized films -- "Chungking Express," "The Days of Being Wild" -- blend inventive hand-held camera work (generally by the gifted Australian cinematographer Christopher Doyle) and oblique narratives (generally on themes of l'amour fou) into festival-winning, cult-spawning visual extravaganzas.
Mr. Wong's "In the Mood for Love," which won a best actor award for its star Tony Leung at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is, as its title suggests, a mood piece about romantic longing. Most of the actual plot points in this tale of adulterous neighbors seem to have been deliberately snipped out of the final cut, leaving a kind of memory residue of stylish sexual frustration.
The object of Mr. Leung's pining -- an obsession shared by Mr. Wong's camera -- is the willowy Hong Kong star Maggie Cheung, outfitted in a series of high-necked, traditional Chinese silk dresses. Mr. Wong's eclectic approach -- half MTV, half Josef von Sternberg -- is strongly echoed in such films as "Suzhou River" and "Nowhere to Hide," and has proved distinctive enough to inspire at least one Hong Kong parody, Ko Sau-leung's "The Days of Being Dumb."
South Korea is the latest Asian nation to emerge on the international festival circuit. Its filmmaking is as divided as Korea -- between movies that look inward, hoping to find a sense of national identity in history and in traditional art forms ("Chunhyang" is a celebration of the traditional form of sung storytelling called pansori), and movies that look beyond national borders, struggling to form a new aesthetic based more on Western models.
Kim Ki-duk's "The Isle," Hong Sang-soo's "Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors" and Jang Sun Woo's "Lies" all use modernistic stylistic devices (actors who step out of character to speak to the camera, multiple points of view on the same event) to tell stories that deal with transgressive sexual themes, as if their makers meant to shock the Korean public out of the past and into the future. 
Still, no current film better represents the intermingling of East and West than "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," a film created by a consortium of New York independents, Hollywood studio money and Asian financiers. The director, Ang Lee, is a Taiwanese national who has lived in the United States since the mid-70's; the co-writer and producer is James Schamus, an American who also collaborated with Mr. Lee on "The Wedding Banquet" and "The Ice Storm." The cinematographer, Peter Pau, is from Hong Kong (where he photographed John Woo's "The Killer"); the editor is Tim Squyres, an American who has worked with Mr. Lee since his first feature, "Pushing Hands," in 1992. 
WITH its sources in the gorgeous, lyrical kung-fu films directed in the 60's and 70's by the late King Hu ("A Touch of Zen," "The Fate of Lee Kahn"), "Crouching Tiger" welds a Chinese story to American techniques. Where King Hu staged his aerodynamic sword fights with trampolines and fancy wire work, Mr. Lee makes extensive use of digital effects to send his characters spinning through the air. Hampered by the fact that his star, the immensely appealing Chow Yun Fat, is not a martial artist, Mr. Lee is forced to create his stunts out of fast cutting, doubling and digital intervention. The results are impressive, and the film has been entertaining audiences around the world.
And yet there is a self-consciousness in "Crouching Tiger" that nudges the film uncomfortably close to a postmodern bloodlessness. In a way, it is the kung-fu equivalent of "Shane," the 1953 George Stevens film that first turned the American western from a natural expression of American culture into something deliberately "mythical," with archetypes instead of characters, a quest instead of a story and a heavy, painterly sense of landscape that no longer allowed actors to move simply and organically through it but reduced them to compositional elements in a tableau.
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is not as bombastic as "Shane" (Mr. Lee came closer to that with his 1999 Civil War western, "Ride with the Devil"), nor is it as proudly synthetic as "Gladiator." (Michelle Yeoh, a greatly talented martial artist, is always on hand to provide weight and authenticity.) Yet it is ambiguous enough to provoke a troubling question: Does the West love this movie because it is so profoundly Asian, or because it is not?

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Flemington, N.J.; 
Small-Town Feel, With Outlets

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
A HOLE-IN-THE-DOUGHNUT municipality surrounded by Raritan Township, the one-square-mile borough of Flemington is known for its outlet stores, pottery and cut glass. As the seat of Hunterdon County in the southern part of the state, the borough also has a rich history as the farming center that, at the turn of the century, was served by the Central, Pennsylvania and Lehigh Valley Railroads. In its heyday, 54 freight trains a day stopped in Flemington to supply produce and industrial goods to New York City and Philadelphia. 
 About 80 percent of the single-family houses were built before World War II. According to a local history, Flemington has one of the finest collections of Greek Revival houses in the nation, with 60 percent of the borough's structures -- including most of the houses -- in a district that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
 The oldest house in the borough is the white clapboard Fleming Castle, built in 1756 by one of the earliest European settlers, Samuel Fleming, who was of Irish descent. 
Originally a tavern, the structure is now a private residence on Bonnell Street near the center of town. 
Everywhere, houses are being upgraded or expanded. Mayor Austin H. Kutscher Jr. notes that the borough has obtained a $200,000 grant from the State Department of Community Affairs, which allows it to offer residents loans of up to $10,000 each to upgrade historic properties.
Mayor Kutscher also says his administration is stressing economic development and downtown revitalization by streamlining the process under which commercial landlords are allowed to change the permitted uses of their buildings. Indeed, in the downtown business district, there are few empty stores.
Craig G. Proctor, a broker with Coldwell Banker Realty on Main Street, says that houses that are priced right in Flemington often sell within two weeks. He characterizes his customers as mostly executives, white-collar workers and business people.
"They want to live in Hunterdon County for the educational system, the rural nature and the job market," he said. "We are close to New York, Philadelphia and large employment areas of New Jersey. But they also like the small-town friendliness, the older homes and the convenience of a walkable main street."
At the end of December, 15 houses were on the market in the Multiple Listing Service. Their prices ranged from $97,000 for a small two-bedroom ranch that needs work to $499,000 for a six-bedroom, six-bath 19th-century Queen Anne-style house on Main Street that is now a bed-and-breakfast. The median price of homes that were sold rose 17 percent last year, Mr. Proctor said. 
There are 86 condominium town houses in two developments: the 56-unit Coppermine Village off Mine Street and the newer 30-unit Victorian Square off Walter Foran Boulevard. Homes in Coppermine bring $140,000 for smaller two-bedroom units to $165,000 for larger three-bedroom units; in Victorian Square, prices are about 10 percent higher.
FLEMINGTON has six large apartment complexes, with 668 units. The largest are the 164-unit Prospect Hills on Capner Street and the 182-unit Hunter Hills garden apartment complex off Garden Lane, both on the west side of town. Rentals throughout the borough range from $750 for small one-bedroom units to $1,100 for larger two-bedroom units.
Among the newer residents are Dan and Judi Morgan, who bought a four-bedroom Victorian on Broad Street a year and a half ago. Mr. Morgan works from home as a computer systems analyst, and Mrs. Morgan teaches in the local school system. 
"We moved from a home on a large lot in Raritan Township, where you don't know your neighbors and have to drive everywhere," Mr. Morgan said. "Now, we're in town, where you can walk to everything. It's really pleasurable to know your neighbors and the store owners. It's a sense of community."
Commercially, Flemington is split between its historic Main and Broad Streets and two outlet malls off Church Street: the modern brick 60-store Liberty Village, and Turntable Junction, an eclectic collection of a dozen old buildings transplanted into Flemington in 1965 to become an outlet shopping area. 
Among the most unusual shops in the historic section is Stangl/Pfaltzgraff Pottery, started on Mine Street in the early 19th century. Although they no longer operate, three conical brick kilns form the core of the structure -- a reminder of the way pottery was produced at the turn of the century, when the company was making 1,500 pieces of stoneware at the site daily. Another well-known local business is Flemington Cut Glass, a lead-crystal manufacturer that opened in 1902 and still has a shop off Main Street. 
The lone relic of Flemington's railroading past is the Black River and Western Railroad, a tourist train that starts just outside Liberty Village and is pulled by a 1937 steam-powered locomotive to nearby Lambertville. It operates from March 31 through Dec. 9; round trips cost $8 for adults and $4 for children ages 3 to 12.
The most famous structure in town is the former Hunterdon County Courthouse, a colonnaded white structure built on Main Street in 1828. In 1935, it was the venue for what was called "the trial of the century," in which a handyman, Bruno Hauptmann, was convicted of kidnapping and killing Charles A. Lindbergh Jr., the infant son of the famous aviator. Across the street is the Union Hotel -- a four-story 1877 brick structure with two-story gingerbread porches -- where the Lindbergh jurors were sequestered during the trial.
Now a restaurant and office space, the building is still used for annual re-enactments of the Lindbergh trial, which take place in October. Also on Main Street are a number of antiques shops, a tobacconist with a cigar-store Indian out front and Flemington Furs, which says it is the world's largest fur outlet. The borough has no supermarkets; residents do their food shopping in Raritan Township.
One of Flemington's attractions for the Morgans was its excellent school system. Mr. Morgan's 14-year-old daughter, Carey, is now in the eighth grade at the 1,160-student Reading-Fleming Middle School, which houses grades six through eight. Together with four elementary schools, the middle school makes up the 3,500-student Flemington-Raritan Regional School District, which it shares with the surrounding Raritan Township. 
AFTER middle school, the students go on to Hunterdon Central High School, which also includes students from Raritan, Readington, East Amwell and Delaware Townships.
The superintendent of schools of the Flemington-Raritan Regional District, Dr. Jack Farr, notes that the elementary and middle school system has both a wide-ranging special education program starting in kindergarten and a gifted-and-talented program starting in the third grade.
Spanish language instruction starts in the first grade, and computers are introduced in kindergarten. Each classroom has at least one terminal, and each school has a computer laboratory. 
The 2,740-student Hunterdon Central High School is on a 72-acre campus on Route 31 in Flemington. It includes four classroom buildings, a music building, a media center and a communications building that houses a student-run FM-radio station and a cable television station, which broadcasts local events. Advanced placement courses are offered in English, psychology, economics, calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, German and Spanish.
On last year's SAT's, Hunterdon Central's students scored a combined verbal and mathematics average of 1,073, which is 64 points higher than the state average. Of last year's 505 graduating seniors, 87 percent went on to two- or four-year colleges. 
The largest recreational facility in town is the five-acre Tuccamirgan Park, off Bonnell Street. It has playground equipment, picnic tables under a pavilion, a running path and a basketball court.

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
A Major in Business With a Minor in Aviation

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
EVEN the most frequent of flyers have never heard of Amber Air, created last year to provide nonstop service between New York and Riga, Latvia.
 There's a good reason for that: Amber Air is a fiction dreamed up for a classroom project last year by four employees of Aer Lingus, the Irish national airline, . Their goal was to convince their bosses that investing in a one-plane start-up airline was a good idea. 
 As an extra-credit project, the same four students brainstormed something that flyers can actually appreciate: a new design for the Aer Lingus passenger lounge at Kennedy. Their design, which partitions the room into separate areas for work, entertainment and snacking, won out over a competing plan submitted by a team of architects. 
Both Amber Air and the lounge are outcomes of an Aer Lingus career-development program that blends a standard business curriculum with special attention to airline industry realities. The curriculum was developed by the Dowling Institute, a nine-year-old Dowling College program that creates customized training for about 20 Long Island businesses every year.
Last week, the four employees returned to the classroom to begin their third and final term. Over the next six months the students -- an administrative assistant, a clerk in the sales department, a food-service worker and a telemarketer -- will create temporary job assignments for themselves.
"It's a little like creating your own internship," said Jack Foley, the Aer Lingus executive vice president who developed the program in conjunction with Dr. Leo Giglio (pronounced JILL-ee-oh), a Dowling business professor, and Elana Stern, the institute's director.
A self-described "Brooklyn guy" who started out 25 years ago as a baggage handler at Lufthansa, Mr. Foley worked at several airlines before getting the chance to run the North American operations for Aer Lingus. "When I was at British Air," he said with a straight face, "I think my Brooklyn accent was a bit of a drawback."
The Aer Lingus program at Dowling provides employees with a chance for advancement. "I'd rather give opportunities to dedicated people who work for us than go recruit new people for every opening," Mr. Foley said. "The Dowling program makes it cheaper to train than recruit."
The airline is paying about $25,000 a term for this first group, but Dowling says the cost may go up for subsequent classes. The program is unusual in that enrollment is open to both managers and hourly workers, who attend classes in addition to doing their regular jobs. 
Dr. Giglio said he was a little surprised when nine of the original 13 students dropped out. "However, I'm really impressed by the dedication and achievement of the four who remained," he said. "We recognized that some students might leave the progam before completion, or change jobs afterward. It's a risk, but Jack said he's O.K. with that."
The four students said they were proud of completing two-thirds of a curriculum that proved more challenging than they anticipated. "Sitting home and doing assignments was pretty easy," said Nancy Gavin, the clerk. "Learning to work together in teams, that was more difficult."
The research and presentation skills required for the Amber Air project put their newly acquired training to the test, said Lara McCarthy, the administrative assistant. The students worked months on the project before making the presentation to Aer Lingus management. "We had so much information, we had to focus on which information communicated the facts we wanted to emphasize," Ms. McCarthy said.
The Aer Lingus training program began taking shape in the early summer of 1997, when the airline was planning to move from midtown Manhattan to Melville, to lower real estate costs while expanding space. 
"We had to become profitable, as the government of Ireland plans to privatize the airline," Mr. Foley said. 
Aer Lingus was part of a mini-migration of international airlines that left New York for Long Island during the last decade, said Robert Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington: Lufthansa moved to East Meadow, Swissair/Sabena to Melville, and Varig to Valley Stream.
Aer Lingus completed its move from Manhattan to Melville in July and doubled its work force from 60 to 120. "Our North Atlantic service is growing, and we anticipate a number of managerial and professional jobs opening up," Mr. Foley said.
As recently as 1995, Aer Lingus, which is based in Dublin, sold fewer than 400,000 tickets to its two North American destinations, New York and Boston. But that figure has more than tripled, Mr. Foley said, as the airline added service to Washington, Newark, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Mr. Foley believes the Dowling training program supports the North American division's emphasis on employee development. "My choice is always to reward our workers when there's a career opportunity," he said. "Now, in today's tight labor market, the cost of recruitment makes this strategy economically important as well."
Often, he said, workers who are promoted through the managerial ranks lack fundamental skills in accounting, finance, marketing and personal communications. "The dilemma every company faces," he said, "is how do you move people around an organization -- people who are dedicated and hard-working -- if they don't have the training and experience to do the job?"
He rejected the traditional solution of paying for employees to take management courses at local colleges. "Too generic," he said. As for in-house training, such programs tend to reinforce conventional industry thinking, he believes.
So the fact that Dr. Giglio was not an airline specialist appealed to Mr. Foley, and Dr. Giglio, who has been a consultant to Long Island companies like Aeroflex Inc., Arrow Electronics and Dayton T. Brown Inc., developed a program that teaches business fundamentals within the context of the airline industry. 
While a conventional business can reshelve inventory for sale the next day, an airline cannot. "Our product is an empty seat that loses all value the moment the plane takes off," Mr. Foley said. "But you can't sell the seat for whatever you can get for it at the last minute. If you do that, you devalue the product and antagonize the 200 people who paid full value."
As they reassembled for their last semester, the four students and their instructor reminisced about last year's great success, the multimedia Amber Air presentation.
"I was glad we chose Riga rather than a city like Warsaw," said Ms. McCarthy, a Dubliner by birth. "Not only did the airline have no competition, but we couldn't be second-guessed. No one could hold up a competitor's report and say, 'You're wrong, and here are the numbers to prove it.' "
Mr. Foley said the quality of the presentation showed the Dowling program was a success and pronounced himself delighted.
Dr. Giglio remembered Mr. Foley as being a bit more than that. "Jack was almost in tears," he said. "He was that proud."

Two People, One Job

BYLINE:  By JUDITH LEDERMAN

 BODY:
BETH MURTHA has no qualms about volunteering at her children's schools Monday through Wednesday. She knows that her job-sharing partner, Barbara Keesler, is at the office, handling administrative work for the Jell-O brand group at Kraft Foods in Rye Brook. 
 She also knows that when she goes to work on Thursday, a note tracking the week's activities will be in place, as will a work-in-progress folder, so she can pick up where Ms. Keesler left off. 
 Ms. Murtha, who lives in Brewster, and Ms. Keesler, who lives in Cortlandt Manor, enjoy a flexible work option called job sharing that is gaining acceptance in Westchester as companies strive to retain seasoned employees and recruit new ones.
"Job sharing is a wonderful addition to a company's flexible schedule and employment opportunities," said Marjorie Schelling, category business director for Jell-O brands at Kraft, and Ms. Murtha's and Ms. Keesler's supervisor. Ms. Schelling also supervises another job-share duo in her 17-member team. She describes job sharing as "a seamless process."
"There are no hiccups in the job," she said. "I constantly mix them up and I often call them by each other's names, but the job always gets done. It doesn't matter which of them is on."
Shari Rosen Ascher, a Dobbs Ferry resident, and her job-sharing business partner, Maggie Sisco of Ridgewood, N.J., are both examples and leaders in job sharing.
Their company, Share Goals, established in April, advises would-be job sharers and companies interested in learning to manage job-share teams. Their self-published book, "Share the Goals -- How to Successfully Job Share," will be available this month.
"Job sharing is a win-win for job-share partners," Ms. Rosen Ascher said. Ms. Sisco added, "As well as for corporations." 
They often complete each other's sentences. In fact, over time many of their clients, not knowing which of the duo they were talking to, combined their names -- Shari and Maggie -- into Shaggy. Their answering machine announces that "Team Shaggy" will get back to the caller.
They began job sharing in 1995, after working together as account executives at a radio sales company in Manhattan. Ms. Sisco left when her first child was born, and Ms. Rosen Ascher had a baby nine months later. Because their hours were demanding, they discussed sharing their job. When they presented the idea to their company, they were turned down. 
They took the idea to Interep Radio, a competing company, and were hired. Together they worked their way up from account executive to vice president of sales, all the while splitting their workweek, each working three days a week, two days alone and one overlapping.
"We couldn't have risen to vice president without the job share," Ms. Rosen Ascher said. "Because of the demands, it was much easier to become V.P. as a team."
The "Shaggy" team points out that many part-time employees are disappointed because they have a reduced income and fewer benefits, yet their workloads remain the same. With job sharing, there is always someone on the job, no down time for vacations, and no time lost while a mother is giving out pizza at the class picnic.
While benefit arrangements depend on the company, it is not unusual for job sharers to have full or partial benefits.
Nadine Mockler of Pleasantville shares a job with Laurie Young of Norwalk, Conn., her partner in Flexible Resources, a Greenwich consulting and staffing company. 
"We find 70 percent of companies flexing their employment arrangements to attract and retain good employees," Ms. Mockler said. "Whether the economy is on an upslide and good employees are hard to come by or the economy is in recession and cutting back, the flexible job market is an untapped resource."
She points out that job sharing was introduced in the 1970's, largely as an option for secretarial and white-collar jobs that were easy to divide. Now, she said, more managers are enjoying the benefits of job sharing.
Job-seekers looking for this arrangement have two options. They can find a partner to present to corporations or, more often, apply for half of a job share already in place.
One such job-seeker is Gabriela St. Denis of Katonah. Now working on a project-by-project basis, Ms. St. Denis, a human resource generalist, is looking for a permanent flexible job situation.
Although she isn't limiting her search to job-sharing opportunities, she is looking for a chance to become part of a job-sharing team. Flexible Resources is helping Ms. St. Denis find a situation so she can be around more for her sons, ages 7 and 4.
"Job sharing sounds like an interesting option," Ms. St. Denis said. "If it gives me the flexibility I need, I'm certainly willing to give it a try."
Many Westchester companies permit job sharing, including the White Plains law firm of Skyer & Most, Gannett Newspapers, and PepsiCo, which has offered job sharing as an option for more than 20 years. 
Elaine Franklin, manager of corporate information at PepsiCo, said job sharing has been increasing there. Ms. Franklin herself has assistants who share a job.
There are no hard and fast rules for splitting the workload in a job share. Some people split the day, others split the workweek. Some have an overlapping day and others alternate weeks.
"The mechanics don't matter," Ms. Rosen Ascher said. "It doesn't matter if you spoke to Maggie on Thursday or me on Monday, as long as you know that you're only going to have one conversation."
Ms. Schelling said communications and commitment are essential for successful job sharing on her Jell-O team.
"Communications are paramount in the business world and there's a lot to be learned from teams like Beth and Barbara," she said. "This is not a position to them, it's a career to both of them. They spend time thinking ahead, anticipating each other's needs. They make sure that things are in great shape for the next person."
To get this kind of synergy, the Share Goals team recommends that job sharers find a partner who is philosophically on the same track in terms of business and career. When job-sharing arrangements don't work out, it is often because the situation was constructed around scheduling or the job share was put together in haste because someone was going to leave. 
A job-share partner doesn't have to be exactly like the other partner, but should be complementary. Share Goals's biggest challenge is dealing with nonbelievers, but both partners have a "we'll show you" attitude. 
"After all, they're getting two brains, four eyes," Ms. Sisco pointed out. Ms. Rosen Ascher chimed in: "And 20 fingers. All for the price of one."

HEADLINE: 'Eco-Terrorism,' And Nary a Redwood In Sight; 
Is Suburban Sprawl Debate So Fevered That It Encourages the Torching of Homes?

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: MOUNT SINAI 

 BODY:
WHEN an underground environmental group sought credit for ruining a Cold Spring Harbor cornfield last summer, it left behind a graffiti message denouncing genetic engineering. But the crops, it turned out, were never genetically altered.
 When the elusive group, the Earth Liberation Front, announced on New Year's Eve that it had firebombed some luxury houses under construction on old farmland in Mount Sinai, it used more graffiti messages: "Stop Urban Sprawl" and "If You Build It We Will Burn It." 
 But Lennard Axinn, the builder who was targeted that snowy Dec. 30 morning, played a role in saving nearly 18 acres of land across the street from the upscale subdivision for a park, a model use of open space. Mr. Axinn is considered by mainstream East End environmentalists to be a gem among developers for his friendly dealings with the greens. 
"He was conscious of the environment," said Lori Baldassare, president of the Mount Sinai Civic Association, said of Mr. Axinn. "He wanted to work with the community, which is always a welcome change for a developer. I am not really sure why they picked that development to target. We have been trying to figure it out ourselves."
It has not gone unnoticed by federal and local authorities tracking the group that news bulletins about Long Island actions released by an Earth Liberation Front spokesman in Portland, Ore., are chock-full of errors.
Those bulletins have miscalculated the scope of damage (fire gutted one unit in one building in a Middle Island condominium complex, not 16 nearly completed luxury homes, as claimed); overestimated the economic value of their destruction ($200,000 worth of fire and smoke damage in Middle Island, rather than the $3.5 million claimed); and gotten simple facts wrong (the communique claimed the Mount Sinai attack was on Dec. 29, when in fact it was a day later).
Tactically, there have been mistakes too. The crude incendiary devices used in a Dec. 9 arson at an upscale subdivision in Middle Island malfunctioned in three of four cases when slow-burning punks affixed to plastic jugs of gasoline did not ignite a blaze. The group replaced the punks with birthday candles in the Mount Sinai arson, but even then one device malfunctioned, the police said.
Rather than all-knowing defenders of the earth who strike with pinpoint precision and then vanish, the group known by the acronym ELF is beginning to emerge as the gang of militant environmentalists that could not shoot straight.
Some people are even wondering why ELF has targeted Long Island, a place whose gentle hills and heaving surf have long been a magnet for people looking to live far enough but not too far from the city.
Long Island would not make it on a mainstream environmentalist's Top 10 list of national causes, said Eric A. Goldstein, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. And Daniel F. Becker of the Sierra Club said: "Long Island's environmental problems are not radically better nor radically worse than many other suburban areas in the United States."
Long Island is in no great distress from a major industrial contaminant. It is not some poverty-stricken community living in the shadow of a gigantic oil refinery. And it does not have any crown jewels of the national park system that might be perceived as threatened.
Its farms are vanishing in a cloud of developers' dust, but they are farms, after all, not pristine wilderness. The Island's wildest area, the Pine Barrens, is mostly protected from development.
"I'm baffled," Richard L. Amper, Jr., executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, said when asked why he thought the Earth Liberation Front has turned up in Suffolk County.
"They may have picked a place that is a paradigm for overdevelopment, but the audience didn't need the message," Mr. Amper said. "It is like bringing us a telegram saying, 'World War II is over.' We know!"
But in many ways, Long Island may be the perfect place to gain attention for such a movement. A quintessential suburb, it has been host to a long-running debate on land use: preservationists against developers is an old story. But in recent years that debate has grown hotter. Today, there is not one town on the East End that does not have some land dispute.
Robert S. DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, described the Island as "a perfect laboratory for anarchy."
For the last 50 years, farmland has been disappearing at the rate of 1,200 acres per year as the population of eastern Long Island has tripled since 1960, Mr. DeLuca said. He added that the number of farms in Suffolk has gone from 2,200 to 600 in the last decade.
"We invented suburbia," said Steven Englebright, a Democratic state Assemblyman from Setauket. "Long Island has been a crucible for environmental issues resulting from our society's confrontation with crowding, transportation problems, air quality and water quality. None of which is new." 
Mr. Englebright first ran for Suffolk County legislator on the issue of preserving open space back in 1983. Now, nearly 20 years later, the issue is bigger than ever.
"I think they are exploiting us," Mr. Englebright said of ELF. "It appears that what they are doing is trying to take advantage of Long Island's struggles for their own notoriety and to try to get some coverage that would benefit their operation."
With the biggest media center in the world a mere bumper-to-bumper ride west on the Long Island Expressway, the region can be attractive for anyone craving attention. Craig S. Rosebraugh, the ELF spokesman in Portland, said he had received about 70 calls from reporters around the country and the world in the past weeks.
It is a classic case of what is called "propaganda of the deed," said Chip Berlet, the senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a think tank in Somerville, Mass., that studies authoritarian and anti-democratic social movements.
"What they are trying to say to one side is, 'You need to be more radical,' " Mr. Berlet said. "Overwhelmingly, as a tactic, this fails because people are repulsed by the violence."
That is what happened after ELF took credit for a $12 million arson at a new ski resort in Vail, Colo., in 1998, said Michael Roselle, who works for Greenpeace, which over the years has had many confrontations with whalers, loggers and builders but says it has never destroyed property.
"They came back stronger and they got a better facility and they wiped out the local opposition to their expansion," Mr. Roselle said of those pushing for the Vail project. "So it was lose-lose" for the environmentalists.
Already in Suffolk, some developers have begun to paint all environmentalists with the same broad brush -- an injustice akin to painting all members of the media as unscrupulous paparazzi, Mr. Englebright said.
Robert A. Wieboldt, executive vice president of the Long Island Builders Institute, said the invective over land use on the East End has actually provided a toehold for violence. He has urged all political and governmental leaders in the area to denounce the violence and has offered a $10,000 reward. 
"The key question in my mind is 'Why Long Island?' " Mr. Wieboldt said. "And the thing that first comes to mind is, the level of rhetoric on this island about preservation and development has been so extreme. The extreme rhetoric is essentially almost sort of a prior cause for this thing. I can just see soft minds being led, and I think the whole tone of the rhetoric has been so extreme that that is why it is hitting here."
Local and national environmentalists reject that notion as preposterous. The politics of environmentalism on Long Island, no matter how divisive, cannot be blamed for criminality, they say. But they do not shrink from the issue of overdevelopment of Long Island as a valid concern.
"Violence should have no place whatsoever in political discourse, and the means employed by these few kooks are repugnant," said Mr. Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But the concerns that prompted their action are reality-based. The environment is a major reason why people want to live on Long Island in the first place and you don't want to kill the goose that laid the golden egg by destroying it for short-sighted reasons."
Mr. Becker, director of the global warming and energy program at the Sierra Club's Washington headquarters, argued that it was not worth discussing what may have driven the ELF actions because there could be no justification for criminal activity. And whatever their motivation, he said, it had nothing to do with the environment.
"I would be very surprised if, in the fullness of time, someone found out there was a specific operation to target Long Island," Mr. Becker said. "These are either disturbed people or criminals. I have no respect for people who resort to violence, no matter what their political goals."
And when they get the underlying set of facts about their target wrong, it further muddies the picture, many said.
"They don't consider the facts to be as important as the overall mission. They feel there is an excuse for this total-warfare attitude, and they don't necessarily need to do any kind of research," said Mr. Roselle, who was a founder of Earth First, an environmental group whose members held a gathering in England in the early 1990's where the ELF movement is said to have gotten its start.
Mr. Rosebraugh said he could not speak to the tactical errors because he was not member of the group. He attributes the informational glitches to the difficulty of corroborating the claims of an anonymous band of radicals.
Mr. Rosebraugh, who said he merely shared the information forwarded to him through means he declined to reveal, said his attempts to verify the details before releasing them were often hindered because local authorities would not speak freely.
Mr. Rosebraugh said he trusted the information from the communiques more than he did any account by officials or the media, because the ELF members were present for the action. But details aside, he said, "the key importance is to let the public know what went on and why it went on."
"The question is, 'How do I know that the actions I receive communications for are the ELF?' Well, truthfully, there is no way to know because the ELF is an anonymous group," Mr. Rosebraugh said recently. "But we do as much checking as we can. We try to contact the media, for them to contact the authorities."
But even the authorities have questions about who is behind the destruction and how connected they may (or may not) be to a national movement that emerged publicly in 1997, in a wave of illegal and extreme environmentalism mostly in the Pacific Northwest.
A local debate has begun about whether those who caused the Suffolk damage are part of a small traveling band of ELF nomads that crisscross the nation or some local residents sympathetic to the ELF cause but entirely divorced from any organized leadership.
Mr. Rosebraugh describes the group as a series of cells across the country with no hierarchy, no membership roll and a decentralized philosophy for direct action. It claims allegiance only to the cause of opposing those judged to be destroying the environment to make a profit.
Or, as the group itself said in a 1997 Internet posting: "ELF works to speed up the collapse of industry, to scare the rich and to undermine the foundations of the state." The posting gave directions to cut power lines, blow up transformers and "smash, burn or flood" buildings.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation refers to such acts eco-terrorism.
"We are aware of them as a special-interest group," Steven Berry, a supervisory special agent for the F.B.I. in Washington, said of ELF. "Some members of the group emphasize violence and other illegal activities to support their cause. We consider any act of eco-terrorism as serious, and we investigate these matters fully and thoroughly."
The F.B.I. is working with the Suffolk District Attorney, James M. Catterson Jr., and the local police. Samples of the red paint used to scrawl graffiti on the nearly completed houses have been sent to a forensics laboratory, said Detective Sgt. Dodd R. Amrhein of the Suffolk County Police arson squad. The police are examining other evidence, including a claw hammer hurled through a window, for the trace of any fingerprints, he said.
Mr. Roselle, like others, is at a loss to explain who is behind the acts. Mr. Rosebraugh said it was impossible to put reporters in touch with actual ELF members. But Federal officials yearning to know more about ELF have hauled him before a grand jury six times, Mr. Rosebraugh said.
He has always invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent under questioning, he said, except for once last year when he was placed under an order compelling testimony about a fire at the Monmouth, Ore., offices of the Boise Cascade lumber company that ELF took responsibility for.
"I, to the best of my ability, told the truth," Mr. Rosebraugh said of his testimony on that occasion. "I, to a number of questions, said, 'I do not recall.' "
Back in July, officials at Cold Spring Harbor Lab who surveyed the damage to the trampled corn at the Uplands Farm facility in Huntington, said the vandalism provided few clues about why ELF chose the site. It was not only misguided, they said, but misdirected.
The land was where Dr. Barbara McClintock studied Indian corn in the 1940's to learn about transposable elements -- work that won her a Nobel Prize in 1983, said Jeffrey J. Picarello, a lab spokesman. It was not the kind of site to make a statement denouncing genetic engineering of a popular American food.
Even a cursory search of the Internet could tell people that, Mr. Picarello said.
"They attacked a field of natural corn," Mr. Picarello said. "It set our research back two years, but they made a mistake. We were using it to study natural plant breeding, so I assume they thought they were targeting a genetically modified field of corn. But we don't have genetically modified crops here. I mean, it is not even a food crop."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND JOURNAL; 
The 'Padrecito' Ministers to Diverse Flocks

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 

 BODY:
NOTICING three day laborers walking along a Farmingville street lugging sacks of laundry on their backs, the Rev. Allan Byron Ramirez stopped his silver BMW 325i.
 "No work today?" the minister asked in Spanish. The men shook their heads. The weather was cold and damp, and work was scarce. 
 Mr. Ramirez, 47, known to the immigrant workers as the "padrecito," popped open his trunk, pulled out new winter jackets and slipper socks for each, and wished them well. 
Moments later, he knocked on the door of a ramshackle house occupied by 14 Mexican day laborers, including the father of one of the two workers beaten in a much-publicized attack in Shirley on Sept. 17.
Finding four people at home, Mr. Ramirez presented them with jackets, socks and blankets, promising to return the following week with thermal underwear. Last year, Mr. Ramirez's congregation at the Brookville Reformed Church raised $41,000 to buy clothing for immigrant workers. 
From the street corners in Farmingville to the Shape Up Center in Glen Cove where day laborers wait for jobs, in the dank basements and overcrowded apartments where the workers live, Mr. Ramirez is an increasingly visible and sometimes incongruous watchdog for the Island's Latino community.
Mr. Ramirez, who was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador, is the pastor of an all-white, largely Republican congregation in one of the wealthiest enclaves on the North Shore. William Waldorf, the church's financial secretary, described the congregation as "beyond upper middle class in average economic status."
In this role as the church's leader, Mr. Ramirez leads a blue-blood life, with all the trappings of privilege: fine clothes, a spacious new parsonage in Sea Cliff, ski trips to Vermont, six-week jaunts to Europe each summer and wintertime vacations in the Caribbean. His son, Kial, 14, and daughter, April, 16, attended the tony Friends Academy in Locust Valley before switching to public schools four years ago.
"It is a white world that has come to respect me and recognize me for who I am and the challenges I have brought before them," Mr. Ramirez said. "By raising their consciousness, we are in a position to make a difference. I am awakening their faith, the willingness to live out the demands of the Gospel that says you must love your neighbor as yourself."
"How do we inspire people to lift themselves up to be better unless we show them?" Mr. Ramirez added. "I can't ask congregants to go and serve breakfast unless I do it. I can't ask my congregants to give out clothing unless I do it."
In the past he has butted heads with Mayor Thomas Suozzi of Glen Cove over the need for a homeless shelter and what Mr. Ramirez says is the city's selective building-code enforcement that disregards constitutional rights. "Over the years, I have tried to simply respond to situations where it's obvious that people are being either discriminated against or they are facing some kind of persecution," he said as he showed a visitor a one-room Glen Cove apartment that sleeps 15 immigrants.
Paul Tonna, the presiding officer of the Suffolk County Legislature, recently asked Mr. Ramirez to serve on a panel to study the day laborer issue.
"He has allowed the Latino community to speak for themselves," Mr. Tonna said. "This is not a guy trying to control the process but to provide leadership, not by demonizing people but by lifting people up."
After handing out the jackets to the Mexican workers in Farmingville, Mr. Ramirez dropped by to see Eduardo and Reyna Mendez Rojas and her mother, Reyna Espinoza, in Selden. Since they bought the neat ranch house a year and a half ago, they say they have been harassed by neighbors shouting racial epithets, revving a motorcycle up and down their driveway and accusing them of harboring illegal aliens in their basement. Things have gotten so bad, they say, that they have put their house up for sale.
"They cannot take the racial insults and harassments they have to live with every day," Mr. Ramirez said, hugging Mrs. Mendez Rojas and settling onto the sofa in her unheated living room. "She really has been feeling very, very lonely. So I try to call from time to time and see how she's doing. It's not much, but it makes her feel somebody is remembering her, that she's not alone."
Tears welling in her eyes, Mrs. Mendez Rojas praised Mr. Ramirez for arranging a meeting at the Mexican consulate in New York to straighten out a visa problem and for offering to have his congregation pay to fill her oil tank.
"I saw him on the TV when he helped the man who was beaten up on the corner," Mrs. Mendez Rojas said, leading a visitor on a tour of her newly finished -- and unoccupied -- basement. "We also knew that he was the one who helped the men over there when they had been beaten up. Also in church I had heard about him when people talk about when you need help, who do you go to."
Mr. Ramirez's penchant for helping the downtrodden grew out of his own experience. At age 11, he moved from Ecuador with his parents and eight siblings to a roach-infested three-room basement apartment in Hackensack, N.J. Two weeks later he began delivering the local newspaper and working weekends at a car wash, giving half his earnings to his parents. During high school he worked his way up to manager of the frozen-food department at a local supermarket, logging 30 hours a week.
In those days, Mr. Ramirez recalled, he didn't have any white friends and hung out with his brothers and the other Latinos in the neighborhood. "We dressed differently," he said. "We spoke differently. Our customs were different."
When he was a junior in high school, an English teacher assigned him a presentation about Edward Albee's "Zoo Story." Another student invited Mr. Ramirez to watch the play with the youth group at the Second Reformed Church. Mr. Ramirez was stunned. No white child had ever spoken to him in such a friendly manner before. Afraid of a setup, he nervously rode his bicycle past the stone church, recalling stories he had heard about the Ku Klux Klan and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Afterward, Mr. Ramirez was invited to stay for a soda and ping-pong. His new friend, the son of the minister, asked him to return to the youth group, and he started worshiping at the church regularly.
"That invitation in essence shaped my theology," Mr. Ramirez said. "These kids were members of a white upper-middle-class congregation. They embraced me, they reached out to me as a human being. For the first time I was being affirmed."
Encouraged by his church friends, Mr. Ramirez enrolled at Central College in Pella, Iowa, a school affiliated with the Reformed Church in America. He was the only nonwhite student. "I immersed myself in the white world to learn to survive in that environment," he said, although he wore his curly hair in a bushy Afro.
By the time he graduated from Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Mich., in 1979, each of his 30 classmates had received a call to a church. Only Mr. Ramirez didn't have a job. "The only difference between myself and all my classmates was that I was Latino," he said.
While he was in the seminary, he married Kim Renskers, a Reformed minister's daughter from a Dutch family. Together, they headed to New York, where she enrolled in law school and he sold clothes at Gucci, worked as a building superintendent in Brooklyn and taught Spanish at the State University at Farmingdale. He sent out 125 applications for a pulpit.
"Every single one of those churches turned me down," he recalled. He had no problem getting interviews at white, middle-class churches, he said, but when he showed up and the search committees saw his cocoa-colored skin, he was never offered a job.
"But then I would go to Latino churches or African-American churches," he said, "and they'd be courteous and give me interviews, and I could read between the lines there, too: 'He's too white. He sold out.' I was in a no man's land. That was probably one of the most painful experiences in my life." 
It was four years before Mr. Ramirez was offered a permanent job as the pastor of the Brookville church after filling in as its minister for 32 weeks. Though he has been with the 200-member congregation since 1983, he is still not convinced that he would have been hired if the congregation had not gotten to know him first.
"That's why when I see these guys out on the street corner at 6 o'clock in the morning and willing to work a 12- to 14-hour day for $70, helping them is really honoring my parents and honoring the struggle of every immigrant who has come to this country with nothing more than a dream to better their lives," Mr. Ramirez said. "I feel very, very strongly about that. I hate to see injustice."
Mr. Waldorf, the financial secretary at Mr. Ramirez's church, said the minister stirred his congregation. "It's a heart-opening experience to have him here," Mr. Waldorf said. "It's a strong message in the oneness of God's children." 
Without Mr. Ramirez's influence, Mr. Waldorf said, he was not sure the church would have rented its sanctuary to a Jewish congregation on Friday nights. Mr. Ramirez, who ended a service on a recent Sunday with a benediction in Hebrew, now calls the building a "chumple."
Howard Crofoot, the vice president of the Brookville church, said a recent survey of congregants gave Mr. Ramirez top marks. The pastor has a fancy lifestyle, he said, "but look how he takes care of us."
"We are so proud of him," he added. "We think he walks on water."
Nan Coffey, a former vice president of the church, said that although some members were concerned about their pastor's high profile, most appreciated his habit of calling attention to social problems in the area.
"He's very strong and passionate in his defense of people being abused," Ms. Coffey said. "He's a wonderful defender of the underdog."
And a political force to contend with. Mr. Ramirez and Mr. Suozzi now meet for breakfast or lunch from time to time, and Mr. Ramirez has talked about helping with Mr. Suozzi's campaign for Nassau County executive. But Mr. Ramirez hasn't ruled out his own run for the same office. Mr. Ramirez, who is registered as an independent, said, "If I see the concern of this community is not being addressed, I have no other choice but to go and take that road." 
Mr. Suozzi said he shared Mr. Ramirez's mission to protect people's rights and to improve the quality of life for newcomers as well as longtime residents. "One of the impetuses is what has been going on out in Suffolk," Mr. Suozzi said. "While the reverend doesn't think what we are doing is perfect, we are going to do the best we can."
But Mr. Suozzi argued that while Mr. Ramirez beat the drum for more affordable housing in Glen Cove, he wondered why he wasn't demanding the same in Sea Cliff, where he lives, and in Brookville, where he preaches.
Mr. Ramirez's salary in Brookville is $54,000 a year, he said, and the church pays for the parsonage and his BMW. Acknowledging these perks, Mr. Ramirez said he knew he how lucky he was.
"You have to realize life is more than a big house in the suburbs, a BMW, a weekend in the Hamptons," Mr. Ramirez said, picking up his cell phone when he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to ask an acquaintance -- he would not say who, exactly -- for tickets to a Jets game, and, please, don't forget the parking pass.
His work with the immigrants keeps him grounded. "I am immersed in a world of pain," he said. "I am immersed in a world of struggle. It is my reality check."
Mr. Ramirez said if he walked down the street in a dirty jacket, rather than his $100 slacks and navy blazer, he might be mistaken for a day laborer. "I would dare to say if Christ came into this world today, he would go and hang out with the have-nots," Mr. Ramirez said. "He would go hang out with the homeless. He would go hang out with the day laborers. And he would try to speak on their behalf."

HEADLINE: A Role Model for Urban Revival; 
Seeking to Turn Around its Downtown, a Neighboring City Looked to Stamford

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH

 BODY:
THREE years ago, White Plains was a city in decline. The tax base had been dropping for more than a decade, and the office vacancy rate was more than 30 percent -- the highest in the world for cities of its size. "You could fire a cannon in the downtown area at night and not hit anybody," said Joseph M. Delfino, who became mayor in 1998.
 So the mayor and his aides looked for a model to help guide their efforts to bring the city back to life. They found one 15 miles northeast, in Stamford. That Connecticut city, after all, had been in similarly dire straits only a few years earlier, with its vacancy rate close to 30 percent, and the streets around its gleaming office towers empty and forbidding. But it had risen from the ashes with amazing speed, in part by building new high-rise residential towers and adding dozens of restaurants and bars in the downtown area. 
 "We looked very closely at what they did in their downtown," said Paul Wood, an aide to Mr. Delfino. The renewal plan White Plains arrived at -- rooted in new housing and entertainment in the downtown area -- is straight out of the Stamford playbook. There were other models, Mr. Wood said, but Stamford was the clearest, because it was so close and because its history has so paralleled that of White Plains. 
Although Stamford is much larger -- 37.7 square miles as opposed to 9.9 -- the two cities' downtown areas are of comparable size. Their demographic makeup, median income and daytime population -- roughly 200,000 -- are virtually the same. Both cities are viewed as the center of their respective counties, and both fall under the shadow of New York City, from which they began to draw corporations looking for safer and more suburban settings starting in the 1950's and 60's. 
Both underwent a similarly dramatic urban renewal, bulldozing large sections of their downtown areas and rebuilding them with vast office towers in the 1970's and 80's. Both built enclosed malls at roughly the same time; and those malls helped destroy the existing retail outlets on the city's main retail street, which was known, in both cases, as "little Fifth Avenue."
Both cities have also been held up as examples of what the architecture critic Joel Garreau has called the "edge city," a hastily built agglomeration of office towers and parking garages designed to accommodate the needs of cars more than pedestrians. But they also illustrate the ways city planners have tried to revitalize what had been viewed as cold, hostile settings.
On that front, even a casual visitor can see that Stamford has come further than White Plains. On a weeknight after 8, White Plains is virtually empty, its audible pedestrian signals -- designed for the blind -- chiming eerily in the silence. In the heart of the downtown, the old Macy's building remains vacant, and across from it are discount stores like The $1 Limit.
There are few young people on the streets, and none of the sleek coffee bars that have become almost ubiquitous. It is as though the city's clocks had stopped in the last recession and never started again.
By contrast, Stamford's streets at night are often filled with patrons from dozens of new downtown restaurants, bars and the city's two multiscreen movie theaters. 
Stamford has also gained more than 1,000 units of new residential housing in its downtown area over the last five years, with 2,500 more units planned; and there are new security and sanitation workers to keep the streets safe and clean. The city's office vacancy rate is now about 7 percent, while White Plains remains at 13.4 percent, though it has less than half of Stamford's 15 million square feet of office space, said Frank Tomasulo, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a real estate brokerage firm.
That comparison might seem humbling to a city that has often been viewed as Stamford's rival. But competition between the cities has mostly been mythological, said Edward Steinberg, who worked as a planner for White Plains and then for Stamford over three decades.
"The notion of competition between White Plains and Stamford has been for the most part in the minds of third parties," he said. "They were just doing similar things at similar times." 
Both cities were founded in the 17th century, and grew slowly over the years. 
White Plains, which has been the seat of the Westchester County government since 1778, was mostly residential, with some commerce and the county office buildings, while Stamford was a manufacturing town, shipping pianos, bicycles, locks and other goods to New York City from its Canal Street docks. 
By 1960, when they decided to participate in the federal urban renewal program, both cities encompassed a series of mostly wealthy residential neighborhoods surrounding a declining urban core. 
In both cities, urban renewal drew opposition. In White Plains, the 138-acre renewal zone -- the second largest in the country -- included the city's old commercial center and an old courthouse, parts of which dated to 1830. It also included slum areas and an old hotel called the Honeymoon Flats that was also a brothel, said Alfred Del Vecchio, who served as the city's mayor from 1976 to 1994, and has been a White Plains resident since 1957.
The Stamford urban renewal zone had a similar variety of old homes. 
"It's like an entire city vanished without a record," said Renee Kahn, the director of the Stamford Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program. "Many of the houses had seen better days, but it was very mixed and very interesting."
The cities chose different approaches: Stamford appointed a single developer, the local F. D. Rich Company, while White Plains chose to work with a variety of builders. And Stamford built a number of huge, single-occupancy buildings to accommodate the corporations moving up from Manhattan. Frightened by a wave of crime and terrorist attacks on office buildings in New York City, GTE designed its new Stamford headquarters to be bomb-proof in the early 1970's, said Robert N. Rich, who supervised the entire renewal project. 
Although Stamford hired a number of renowned architects, such as Cesar Pelli, Arthur Erickson and Michael Graves, they designed similarly cold, fortress-like buildings that bore no apparent relationship to one another. Because of the city's proximity to the sea, parking garages could not be built too deep, so the new office towers tended to have several floors of parking at the base, with little attention paid to pedestrian access. The result was a strikingly forbidding landscape, where employees could come and go by car without ever touching their feet to the streets.
White Plains, which had drawn the first major corporate relocation from New York City when General Foods moved its headquarters up to Westchester Avenue in 1954, chose not to build single-occupancy towers in the downtown area. But it did put up $1 billion of new construction between 1976 and 1986, including many office buildings that echoed Stamford's bomb-proof fortresses. 
"We were in such a rush to get everything completed that as a city, we sometimes didn't insist on a high degree of architectural excellence," said William A. Rose Jr., an architect who served on the citizens advisory committee for the Central Urban Renewal Project and later as a White Plains city councilman.
Christopher Bruhl, president of SACIA, the business council of southwestern Connecticut, said urban planners misunderstood what was happening in cities.
"The emphasis on automotive access to buildings, and the assumption that people would not venture out, was temporary," he said, "but it happened to be in full swing when White Plains and Stamford were doing urban renewal and deciding what to build." 
In both cities, planners hoped that putting a major enclosed mall downtown would lure people back to the cities' fraying retail area. Most malls, after all, were still being built in suburban locations in the 1970's. 
But as it happened, the 889,000-square-foot Galleria mall in White Plains, which opened for business in 1980, helped kill the old retail district on Mamaroneck Avenue, which once boasted such high-end stores as Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.
"The mall did, I think, sound the death knell for retail on Mamaroneck Avenue as we had known it," said Mary Anne Keenan, who served on the White Plains city council from 1974 until 1999. The Westchester mall, which opened in 1995 with 1.1 million square feet and high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus and Tiffany's, may have aggravated the problem.
The 900,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center (some locals prefer to call it "Fort Stamford") was built in 1982 on Boston Post Road, the only place between New York and Boston where the road is interrupted. The city planners said they wanted to help Bedford Street, Stamford's equivalent of Mamaroneck Avenue. 
But they made it into a one-way street, running away from the mall, while another street with no shops on it led into the enclosed mall, Ms. Kahn said. "It was like a giant black hole that sucked the life out of the businesses around it," she added.
When the recession arrived in the late 1980's, it struck both cities almost equally.
Stamford emerged partly through luck, when the state economic development director helped broker a tax abatement package to lure the financial giant Swiss Bank (now UBS Warburg) from Manhattan in 1994. The deal, which included tax breaks that could amount to $120 million over 10 years, so incensed New York City officials that they took out large advertisements in Connecticut newspapers to denounce Stamford's "blatant and unneighborly raid."
Ironically, the absence of a Fairfield County government may have benefited Stamford -- not just by keeping taxes down, but also by making the state more generous than it otherwise would be, said Mr. Steinberg, the planner who worked for White Plains and then for Stamford. 
Even though White Plains is the county seat, city officials there have rarely had a good working relationship with Westchester County, and New York State has not stepped in to help out with economic incentives until recently, he added.
Connecticut has also had a longstanding tax advantage. Until a decade ago, there was no income tax, and today that tax is lower than New York's, as are corporate and sales taxes. Although White Plains has one of the lowest property tax rates in Westchester, it is still almost twice that of Stamford.
Meanwhile White Plains, lacking a catalyst like Swiss Bank, saw its tax base decline steadily. The departure of Macy's from its downtown location next to the Galleria in 1995 was "a crushing blow," Mayor Delfino said. 
And several development deals fell through or stalled, including a proposal by Tishman-Speyer to build a 21-screen Loews movie theater on the Macy's site.
One important obstacle has been the city's zoning laws and review process, which are far more cumbersome than Stamford's. "All the businesses and developers I have spoken with over the past 10 years told me they didn't feel welcome in White Plains," Mr. Delfino said. 
One developer who owns properties in both cities said: "It's a much quicker process in Stamford. In White Plains, they just kill you. Everything is spot zoning. And there's too many people in the approval process."
Part of the problem, several developers said, is White Plains's often-fractious Common Council, whose six elected members review every proposed development. Because Stamford's government is more complex, with two elected representatives from each of 20 districts in addition to the mayor, the Board of Representatives, as it is called, rarely reviews proposals, making for a smoother process.
But in the last three years, White Plains has embarked on an aggressive effort to reinvent itself. Although the council still has the power to slow projects, Mr. Delfino initiated a new "coordinated review" process for development proposals in 1998 that has been hailed as a vast improvement.
Builders now sit down at a table with every city official who needs to review a proposal, instead of being forced to go from office to office. "That process has streamlined what was a long, arduous task," said Salvatore Campofranco, senior vice president of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, which owns property in both Westchester and Fairfield. 
And the state and county authorities, which had never offered White Plains much help with economic development, are now pitching in. "New York State is now more competitive than Connecticut in terms of offering incentive packages," Mr. Steinberg said.
That extra help has allowed White Plains to compete successfully with Stamford for the first time in many years, particularly in the area of information technology, where Westchester has long had an advantage because of I.B.M.'s presence in the county. Although the county has not drawn major employers on the scale of Swiss Bank, it has cut its vacancy rate by focusing on small and midsize firms, said Salvatore Carrera, the county economic development director.
In April 2000, for instance, Greenwich Technology Partners, an expanding network consultants and engineering company, moved its headquarters to White Plains from Stamford, bringing 90 employees.
Part of the draw was availability and price, said Greenwich's chief executive officer, Joseph Beninati. Stamford's low vacancy rate has helped to drive its average asking price per square foot of office space to about $34, while White Plains is about $27, Mr. Tomasulo said.
But the city, working with the county and the Empire State Development Corporation, also made an important difference. "Sal Carrera and Mayor Delfino were really helpful in terms of putting together economic incentives," Mr. Beninati said. "That was in substantial contrast to efforts by Connecticut and Fairfield politicians. They were sort of silent."
Another factor, Mr. Beninati said, was traffic: congestion on I-95 has become a serious problem for commuters, and White Plains has easier access to New York and the metropolitan area.
In fact, transportation has become a challenge for both cities. Although there is traffic on I-287 and the other roads that serve White Plains, including the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, there are more alternatives than in Stamford, where the traffic on I-95 is almost unparalleled. 
And though Stamford has had an edge in railroad access, with four Metro-North tracks serving the city instead of the two that run to White Plains, the Stamford station -- currently undergoing a $100 million renovation -- does not have enough trains scheduled in the peak times, said Mayor Dannel Malloy of Stamford. 
Meanwhile, a plan to build a third track serving White Plains was approved in November by the Federal Transit Administration, and the work is expected to be completed in the next few years, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. White Plains already has better access to the Westchester County Airport -- a 10-minute drive from downtown -- and to the New York City airports.
Traffic problems have helped to tighten the housing market in both cities. Both have wealthy neighborhoods, though Stamford has more million-dollar homes, particularly in the area north of the Merritt Parkway and on Shippan Point, along the shore. And both have more poverty, and a higher concentration of ethnic minorities, than any of the surrounding suburbs.
Stamford's growth has also put pressure on its school system, which has a higher percentage of poor students and racial minorities and lower academic scores than most of its wealthier suburban neighbors, like Greenwich. 
The White Plains school district, with half as many students, has a similar demographic mix and is similarly overshadowed by Scarsdale and other high-scoring neighbors. But Mayor Malloy has made Stamford's public schools a major priority, spending more than $100 million on school construction and renovation in the past three years, adding a prekindergarten program that is available to all the city's 4-year-olds.
But as they build more housing in their once-lonely downtown areas, the most important distinction between the two cities may have more to do with urban atmosphere than roads, schools and taxes.
"Once these places are more or less equal, what determines who wins or loses is the squishy stuff -- soul, community, identity," said Mr. Garreau, who has continued to write and lecture about urban issues since the publication of "Edge City" in 1991.
And though Stamford could hardly be described as cozy, city officials have worked hard to make it more appealing. The Downtown Special Services District, established in 1992 and financed through a 5 percent surtax on property owners, has worked with the city government to prevent suburban sprawl and ensure that new developments are more pedestrian-friendly. 
It has also encouraged more retail and entertainment outlets. The city already has two movie complexes, and the Stamford Center for the Arts is now renovating and expanding the old Palace Theater, which along with the Rich Forum draws 250,000 people a year to live performances, said Sandra Goldstein, the director of the Special Services District.
The district has also added more security and sanitation patrols to keep the streets safe and clean. Crime has dropped 27 percent in the last four years, thanks in part to the innovative community policing strategies of Police Chief Dean M. Esserman, a former protege of a former New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton.
The city's business leaders, conscious of Stamford's image problem, began working a decade ago to promote the city as a welcoming place to live, partnering with the Special Services District and sponsoring the Fairfield County Information Exchange as a news source. "We all worked together to create a framework for evaluating what needed to be done, largely based around the edge city concept," said Darrell Harvey, the co-chief executive officer of the Ashforth Company, a commercial real estate firm. 
Some of the things Stamford has done may not be realistic in White Plains. "Stamford is just far enough from New York that it can support its own cultural institutions,"Mr. Steinberg said.
That distance -- 49 minutes on the train as opposed to 37 -- may also help account for Stamford's greater success with creating high-density housing in the downtown area. Workers in White Plains, after all, can more easily commute from New York, or a number of surrounding counties. "People come to White Plains because it's a suburb, with the advantages of a city," Ms. Keenan said. "They don't want to live downtown."
Mayor Delfino, however, could not disagree more. "They got a 10-year jump on us," he said. "But we're planning to build 1,500 to 2,000 housing units right in the downtown area. We're on our way now."

The Ambience Of a Small Town
FOR Daniel Bryan, a 25-year-old financial analyst who moved to White Plains from Stamford in August, the difference between the two cities is one of atmosphere: Stamford feels more like a small town.
"There's a downtown area where you can walk to a number of restaurants and bars, and it's a younger, more professional crowd," he said. Downtown White Plains has a grittier, more urban feel and lacks Stamford's movie theaters, he said. 
Other people who have lived in downtown Stamford tend to agree. "When you say the words 'corporate headquarters,' you imagine people all dressed up," said Robbie Monsma, who moved to downtown Stamford with her family last fall. "But there were lots of kids and older people on the street; I found it really charming." The difference is partly a matter of the distance to New York City. "White Plains is closer, so when I want to go out I just go into New York," Mr. Bryan said. 
And one thing is certain: White Plains, which has far less housing in its downtown area, is cheaper. "You definitely get more bang for your buck in White Plains," said Mr. Bryan, who is paying more than he did in Stamford but has a much larger apartment, he said. Despite its more run-down atmosphere, there are people who consider White Plains downright cozy. 
"I've never been so comfortable with my neighbors as I am here," said Jennifer Scharbach, who has lived in a $1,200-a-month two-bedroom apartment on Martine Avenue with her husband and two children for six years. ROBERT WORTH

Apartments Planned Near Aberdeen Train Station

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: ABERDEEN 

 BODY:
FOURTEEN mostly wooded acres overlooking the Mohingson Creek in the center of Aberdeen Township will soon be transformed into a new neighborhood: 290 upscale rental apartments spread over six Victorian-style buildings, four stories tall.
 The $38 million gated community, Jefferson at Aberdeen Station, is the first development of any significant size in two decades in this nearly fully developed 5.4-square mile Monmouth County municipality. It will rise over the next 20 months on the site, which is near both Exit 117 of the Garden State Parkway and New Jersey Transit's Aberdeen-Matawan train station, with direct service to Manhattan, at the corner of Atlantic Avenue. 
 The apartments will have one or two bedrooms and sometimes a den as well and such features as nine-foot-high ceilings, washers and dryers and high-tech wiring, said Jack Englert, regional area managing partner for the developer, JPI. The company, based in Dallas, is among the nation's largest developers of rental apartments. He said JPI, with GE Capital as an investment partner, builds an average of about 13,000 units a year and leases and manages more than 24,000 apartments nationally. 
The Aberdeen project, which marks JPI's initial foray into New Jersey, will also include a 5,600-square-foot clubhouse with an exercise room and a business conference center, as well as an outdoor swimming pool and garage parking. Monthly rents for the units, with 767 to 1,297 square feet, will range from $1,250 to $2,300 when leasing begins in August.
Mr. Englert said the Aberdeen location "was perfectly suited" for his company's development, which he said is tailored to young professional couples as well as empty-nesters. One reason is that few luxury rentals have been developed in northern Monmouth County in 20 years, he said. 
In addition, he said, the site is visible from the parkway and is close to "a decent number of jobs in that part of the county, as well as a 45-minute train commute to Manhattan." As part of the project, whose main entrance will be at the intersection of Lower Main Street and Central Avenue, there will be a walkway extending from the rear of the property two-tenths of a mile to the rail station. 
The township welcomes the project because it will not strain services, said Mark Coren, the township's manager. He pointed out that 40 percent of the units are one-bedrooms, limiting the project's impact on schools. 
The project is part of a larger redevelopment plan to revive the area adjoining the train station. With 3,000 riders a day, the station is among the busiest on the North Jersey Coast line, according to New Jersey Transit, which oversees the state's mass transit system. 
The plan is being pursued by the transit agency, Aberdeen Township and the neighboring Matawan borough. The borough encompasses less than 2.3 square miles, is mostly developed and is nearly surrounded by Aberdeen. 
The redevelopment district consists of 100 acres straddling the two communities. Of the total, 60 acres are in Aberdeen and are dotted with an empty paint factory, a warehouse, woodlands and some residences. The 40 acres in Matawan, not far from the borough's downtown, are laced with mostly old industrial buildings and vacant parcels that double as parking lots. 
New Jersey Transit owns more than 20 acres that it now uses for two parking lots. The area sits roughly between the Garden State Parkway to the northeast, Matawan Creek to the west and commuter parking lots to the southwest; and it is bisected by Main Street and Atlantic Avenue, which form the border between Aberdeen and Matawan. 
Explaining the importance of the redevelopment for Aberdeen, Mr. Coren said that the only way for the township to grow or diversify "is to change land use patterns." 
Joseph P. Leo, the borough administrator for Matawan, added, "With so many people coming into the borough to use the train and leaving, we can," through new development, "reverse that flow into the community." 
At its heart the redevelopment plan, which still is being negotiated by the three parties, calls for transforming the now underutilized area into a vibrant patchwork of offices, stores, residences and entertainment uses. For Aberdeen that translates to what Mayor David Sobel called "a public place," where people could go to live, work and play. 
IN Matawan, Mayor Robert Clifton said the train station area could become an extension of the downtown and help turn the borough into a destination. 
Both men said they also hoped the redevelopment would diversify their economic bases and, in turn, keep a lid on property taxes and perhaps even lower them. 
The two communities have increasingly become more reliant on residential property owners for their tax revenue as industries close or move away. And Matawan's downtown -- a half-mile strip of stores, offices and restaurants along Main Street -- has also suffered as retailers fled to nearby Routes 34 and 35, where shopping centers and strip malls had opened. 
The plan also seeks to mitigate traffic, a major concern, by improving roads and traffic signals. New Jersey Transit is also contemplating expanding shuttle bus service to the train station from surrounding communities. Another hope is that having projects like Jefferson at Aberdeen Station, with its direct walkway to the rail station, will promote use of the train.
Increased ridership would benefit New Jersey Transit, which for years has been encouraging mixed-use development around its stations. 
Last summer the agency awarded Aberdeen and Matawan a planning grant to help them "define how best to approach redevelopment around the train station and to crystallize development opportunities," said Mark V. Gordon, senior director of real estate and economic development at the transit agency. "Cooperation among the three parties has the potential for leading to an improved land use and plan for the area."
Agreeing with that assessment are officials from Aberdeen, which has had its redevelopment plan in place since 1999, and from Matawan, which is to adopt its plan by April. 
The redevelopment area could also be designated a "transit village," under a program administered by New Jersey Transit and the state's Department of Transportation. Under the program, participating communities are eligible for certain state and federal financing and grants. 
Construction of Jefferson at Aberdeen Station, Mayor Sobel said, "will send the message that we are serious about the redevelopment plan." Mayor Clifton of Matawan added that the project would also spur additional interest in the area.
Mr. Englert, the JPI executive, said having the project in the redevelopment zone helped with "securing permits" and provided a "cooperative environment" for creating a rental project. 
The company will also receive a partial tax abatement from the township over a period of 20 years. For its part JPI agreed, among other things, to contribute $1.8 million to Aberdeen's affordable-housing trust fund. 
The project is proceeding at a time when New Jersey's rental market remains tight and the vacancy rate low. It is about 5 percent for the state and less than that for northern Monmouth County, where development of luxury rentals has been limited, said Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association, a trade group in East Brunswick.
Jefferson at Aberdeen Station, designed by EDI Architecture of Houston, is one of two major rental developments planned for Monmouth County. The other is a 296-unit project being developed on 70 acres of former farmland off Route 79 in nearby Freehold Township by AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va. There, the one- to three-bedroom apartments will have 750 to 1,325 square feet, and monthly rents are expected to be $1,000 to $1,600, according to the developer. 
Several residential brokers said the highest rents proposed for apartments at JPI's project -- $2,300 a month -- would test the upper limits of the area's apartment market. "I don't know if there will be enough people willing to pay that much when a four-bedroom colonial in the area rents in the $2,000 range," said Deborah Venedam, manager of the Aberdeen office of Weichert Realtors. 
Mr. Slovin added, "The project will not be a slam-dunk, but there will be an audience for it because there is an extraordinary need for housing, whether upscale or any part of the scale." 
Mr. Englert of JPI said his company was willing "to take the risk" because "there was a pent-up demand for luxury rentals." He also said the project's proximity to the train station would increase its attractiveness for people living in North Jersey and working in New York City as well as for Manhattanites seeking lower rents.

HEADLINE: A Role Model for Urban Revival; 
Seeking to Turn Around Its Downtown, White Plains Looked to a Connecticut Neighbor

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH

 BODY:
THREE years ago, White Plains was a city in decline. The tax base had been dropping for more than a decade, and the office vacancy rate was more than 30 percent -- the highest in the world for cities of its size. "You could fire a cannon in the downtown area at night and not hit anybody," said Joseph M. Delfino, who became mayor in 1998.
 So the mayor and his aides looked for a model to help guide their efforts to bring the city back to life. They found one 15 miles northeast, in Stamford. The Connecticut city, after all, had been in similarly dire straits only a few years earlier, with its vacancy rate close to 30 percent, and the streets around its gleaming office towers empty and forbidding. But it had risen from the ashes with amazing speed, in part by building new high-rise residential towers and adding dozens of restaurants and bars in the downtown area. 
 "We looked very closely at what they did in their downtown," said Paul Wood, an aide to Mr. Delfino. The renewal plan White Plains arrived at -- rooted in new housing and entertainment in the downtown area -- is straight out of the Stamford playbook. There were other models, Mr. Wood said, but Stamford was the clearest, because it was so close and because its history has so paralleled that of White Plains. 
Although Stamford is much larger -- 37.7 square miles as opposed to 9.9 -- the two cities' downtown areas are of comparable size. Their demographic makeup, median income and daytime population -- roughly 200,000 -- are virtually the same. Both cities are viewed as the center of their respective counties, and both fall under the shadow of New York City, from which they began to draw corporations looking for safer and more suburban settings starting in the 1950's and 60's. 
Both underwent a similarly dramatic urban renewal, bulldozing large sections of their downtown areas and rebuilding them with vast office towers in the 1970's and 80's. Both built enclosed malls at roughly the same time; and those malls helped destroy the existing retail outlets on the city's main retail street, which was known, in both cases, as "little Fifth Avenue."
Both cities have also been held up as examples of what the architecture critic Joel Garreau has called the "edge city," a hastily built agglomeration of office towers and parking garages designed to accommodate the needs of cars more than pedestrians. But they also illustrate the ways city planners have tried to revitalize what had been viewed as cold, hostile settings.
On that front, even a casual visitor can see that Stamford has come further than White Plains. On a weeknight after 8, White Plains is virtually empty, its audible pedestrian signals -- designed for the blind -- chiming eerily in the silence. In the heart of the downtown, the old Macy's building remains vacant, and across from it are discount stores like The $1 Limit.
There are few young people on the streets, and none of the sleek coffee bars that have become almost ubiquitous elsewhere. It is as though the city's clocks had stopped in the last recession and never started again.
By contrast, Stamford's streets at night are often filled with patrons from dozens of new downtown restaurants, bars and the city's two multiscreen movie theaters. 
Stamford has also gained more than 1,000 units of residential housing downtown over the last five years, with 2,500 more units planned; and there are new security and sanitation workers to keep the streets safe and clean. The city's office vacancy rate is now about 7 percent. White Plains remains at 13.4 percent, though it has less than half of Stamford's 15 million square feet of office space, said Frank Tomasulo, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a real estate brokerage firm.
That comparison might seem humbling to a city that has often been viewed as Stamford's rival. But competition between the cities has mostly been mythological, said Edward Steinberg, who worked as a planner for White Plains and then for Stamford over three decades.
"The notion of competition between White Plains and Stamford has been for the most part in the minds of third parties," he said. "They were just doing similar things at similar times." 
Both cities were founded in the 17th century, and grew slowly over the years. 
White Plains, which has been the seat of the Westchester County government since 1778, was mostly residential, with some commerce and the county office buildings, while Stamford was a manufacturing town, shipping pianos, bicycles, locks and other goods to New York City from its Canal Street docks. 
By 1960, when they decided to participate in the federal urban renewal program, both cities encompassed a series of mostly wealthy residential neighborhoods surrounding a declining urban core. 
In both cities, urban renewal drew opposition. In White Plains, the 138-acre renewal zone -- the second largest in the country -- included the city's old commercial center and an old courthouse, parts of which dated to 1830. It also included slum areas and an old hotel called the Honeymoon Flats that was also a brothel, said Alfred Del Vecchio, who served as the city's mayor from 1976 to 1994, and has been a White Plains resident since 1957.
The Stamford urban renewal zone had a similar variety of old homes. 
"It's like an entire city vanished without a record," said Renee Kahn, the director of the Stamford Historic Neighborhood Preservation Program. "Many of the houses had seen better days, but it was very mixed and very interesting."
The cities chose different approaches: Stamford appointed a single developer, the local F. D. Rich Company, while White Plains chose to work with a variety of builders.
And Stamford built a number of huge, single-occupancy buildings to accommodate the corporations moving up from Manhattan. Frightened by a wave of crime and terrorist attacks on office buildings in New York City, GTE designed its new Stamford headquarters to be bomb-proof in the early 1970's, said Robert N. Rich, who supervised the entire renewal project. 
Although Stamford hired a number of renowned architects, such as Cesar Pelli, Arthur Erickson and Michael Graves, they designed similarly cold, fortress-like buildings that bore no apparent relationship to one another. Because of the city's proximity to the sea, parking garages could not be built too deep, so the new office towers tended to have several floors of parking at the base, with little attention paid to pedestrian access. The result was a strikingly forbidding landscape, where employees could come and go by car without ever touching their feet to the streets.
White Plains, which had drawn the first major corporate relocation from New York City when General Foods moved its headquarters to Westchester Avenue in 1954, chose not to build single-occupancy towers in the downtown area. But it did put up $1 billion of new construction between 1976 and 1986, including many office buildings that echoed Stamford's bomb-proof fortresses. 
"We were in such a rush to get everything completed that as a city, we sometimes didn't insist on a high degree of architectural excellence," said William A. Rose Jr., an architect who served on the citizens advisory committee for the Central Urban Renewal Project and later as a White Plains city councilman.
Christopher Bruhl, president of SACIA, the business council of southwestern Connecticut, said urban planners misunderstood what was happening in cities.
"The emphasis on automotive access to buildings, and the assumption that people would not venture out, was temporary," he said, "but it happened to be in full swing when White Plains and Stamford were doing urban renewal and deciding what to build." 
In both cities, planners hoped that putting a major enclosed mall downtown would lure people back to the cities' fraying retail area. Most malls, after all, were still being built in suburban locations in the 1970's. 
But as it happened, the 889,000-square-foot Galleria mall in White Plains, which opened for business in 1980, helped kill the old retail district on Mamaroneck Avenue, which once boasted such high-end stores as Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.
"The mall did, I think, sound the death knell for retail on Mamaroneck Avenue as we had known it," said Mary Anne Keenan, who served on the White Plains city council from 1974 until 1999. The Westchester mall, which opened in 1995 with 1.1 million square feet and high-end retailers like Neiman Marcus and Tiffany's, may have aggravated the problem.
The 900,000-square-foot Stamford Town Center (some locals prefer to call it "Fort Stamford") was built in 1982 on Boston Post Road, the only place between New York and Boston where the road is interrupted. The city planners said they wanted to help Bedford Street, Stamford's equivalent of Mamaroneck Avenue. 
But they made it into a one-way street, running away from the mall, while another street with no shops on it led into the enclosed mall, Ms. Kahn said. "It was like a giant black hole that sucked the life out of the businesses around it," she added.
When the recession arrived in the late 1980's, it struck both cities almost equally.
Stamford emerged partly through luck, when the state economic development director helped broker a tax abatement package to lure the financial giant Swiss Bank (now UBS Warburg) from Manhattan in 1994. The deal, which included tax breaks that could amount to $120 million over 10 years, so incensed New York City officials that they took out large advertisements in Connecticut newspapers to denounce Stamford's "blatant and unneighborly raid."
Ironically, the absence of a Fairfield County government may have benefited Stamford -- not just by keeping taxes down, but also by making the state more generous than it otherwise would be, said Mr. Steinberg, the planner who worked for White Plains and then for Stamford. 
Even though White Plains is the county seat, city officials there have rarely had a good working relationship with Westchester County, and New York State has not stepped in to help out with economic incentives until recently, he added.
Connecticut has also had a longstanding tax advantage. 
Until a decade ago, there was no income tax, and today that tax is lower than New York's, as are corporate and sales taxes. Although White Plains has one of the lowest property tax rates in Westchester, it is still almost twice that of Stamford.
Meanwhile White Plains, lacking a catalyst like Swiss Bank, saw its tax base decline steadily. The departure of Macy's from its downtown location next to the Galleria in 1995 was "a crushing blow," Mayor Delfino said. 
And several development deals fell through or stalled, including a proposal by Tishman-Speyer to build a 21-screen Loews movie theater on the Macy's site.
One important obstacle has been the city's zoning laws and review process, which are far more cumbersome than Stamford's. "All the businesses and developers I have spoken with over the past 10 years told me they didn't feel welcome in White Plains," Mr. Delfino said. 
One developer who owns properties in both cities said: "It's a much quicker process in Stamford. In White Plains, they just kill you. Everything is spot zoning. And there's too many people in the approval process."
Part of the problem, several developers said, is White Plains's often-fractious Common Council, whose six elected members review every proposed development. Because Stamford's government is more complex, with two elected representatives from each of 20 districts in addition to the mayor, the Board of Representatives, as it is called, rarely reviews proposals, making for a smoother process.
But in the last three years White Plains has embarked on an aggressive effort to reinvent itself. Although the council still has the power to slow projects, Mr. Delfino initiated a new "coordinated review" process for development proposals in 1998 that has been hailed as a vast improvement.
Builders now sit down at a table with every city official who needs to review a proposal, instead of being forced to go from office to office. "That process has streamlined what was a long, arduous task," said Salvatore Campofranco, senior vice president of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, which owns property in both Westchester and Fairfield. 
And the state and county authorities, which had never offered White Plains much help with economic development, are now pitching in. "New York State is now more competitive than Connecticut in terms of offering incentive packages," Mr. Steinberg said.
That extra help has allowed White Plains to compete successfully with Stamford for the first time in many years, particularly in the area of information technology, where Westchester has long had an advantage because of I.B.M.'s presence in the county. Although the county has not drawn major employers on the scale of Swiss Bank, it has cut its vacancy rate by focusing on small and midsize firms, said Salvatore Carrera, the county economic development director.
In April 2000, for instance, Greenwich Technology Partners, an expanding network consultants and engineering company, moved its headquarters to White Plains from Stamford, bringing 90 employees.
Part of the draw was availability and price, said Greenwich's chief executive officer, Joseph Beninati. Stamford's low vacancy rate has helped to drive its average asking price per square foot of office space to about $34, while White Plains is about $27, Mr. Tomasulo said.
But the city, working with the county and the Empire State Development Corporation, also made an important difference. "Sal Carrera and Mayor Delfino were really helpful in terms of putting together economic incentives," Mr. Beninati said. "That was in substantial contrast to efforts by Connecticut and Fairfield politicians. They were sort of silent."
Another factor, Mr. Beninati said, was traffic: congestion on I-95 has become a serious problem for commuters, and White Plains has easier access to New York and the metropolitan area.
In fact, transportation has become a challenge for both cities. Although there is traffic on I-287 and the other roads that serve White Plains, including the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, there are more alternatives than in Stamford, where the traffic on I-95 is almost unparalleled. 
And though Stamford has had an edge in railroad access, with four Metro-North tracks serving the city instead of the two that run to White Plains, the Stamford station -- currently undergoing a $100 million renovation -- does not have enough trains scheduled in the peak times, said Mayor Dannel Malloy of Stamford. 
Meanwhile, a plan to build a third track serving White Plains was approved in November by the Federal Transit Administration, and the work is expected to be completed in the next few years, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. White Plains already has better access to the Westchester County Airport -- a 10-minute drive from downtown -- and to the New York City airports.
Traffic problems have helped to tighten the housing market in both cities. Both have wealthy neighborhoods, though Stamford has more million-dollar homes, particularly in the area north of the Merritt Parkway and on Shippan Point, along the shore. And both have more poverty, and a higher concentration of ethnic minorities, than any of the surrounding suburbs.
Stamford's growth has also put pressure on its school system, which has a higher percentage of poor students and racial minorities and lower academic scores than most of its wealthier suburban neighbors, like Greenwich. 
The White Plains school district, with half as many students, has a similar demographic mix and is similarly overshadowed by Scarsdale and other high-scoring neighbors. But Mayor Malloy has made Stamford's public schools a major priority, spending more than $100 million on school construction and renovation in the past three years, adding a prekindergarten program that is available to all the city's 4-year-olds.
But as they build more housing in their once-lonely downtown areas, the most important distinction between the two cities may have more to do with urban atmosphere than roads, schools and taxes.
"Once these places are more or less equal, what determines who wins or loses is the squishy stuff -- soul, community, identity," said Mr. Garreau, who has continued to write and lecture about urban issues since the publication of "Edge City" in 1991.
And though Stamford could hardly be described as cozy, city officials have worked hard to make it more appealing. The Downtown Special Services District, established in 1992 and financed through a 5 percent surtax on property owners, has worked with the city government to prevent suburban sprawl and ensure that new developments are more pedestrian-friendly. 
It has also encouraged more retail and entertainment outlets. The city already has two movie complexes, and the Stamford Center for the Arts is now renovating and expanding the old Palace Theater, which along with the Rich Forum draws 250,000 people a year to live performances, said Sandra Goldstein, the director of the Special Services District.
The district has also added more security and sanitation patrols to keep the streets safe and clean. Crime has dropped 27 percent in the last four years, thanks in part to the innovative community policing strategies of Police Chief Dean M. Esserman, a former protege of a former New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton.
The city's business leaders, conscious of Stamford's image problem, began working a decade ago to promote the city as a welcoming place to live, partnering with the Special Services District and sponsoring the Fairfield County Information Exchange as a news source. "We all worked together to create a framework for evaluating what needed to be done, largely based around the edge city concept," said Darrell Harvey, the co-chief executive officer of the Ashforth Company, a commercial real estate firm. 
Some of the things Stamford has done may not be realistic in White Plains. "Stamford is just far enough from New York that it can support its own cultural institutions," Mr. Steinberg said. "White Plains doesn't have any of that." 
That distance -- 49 minutes on the train as opposed to 37 -- may also help account for Stamford's greater success with creating high-density housing in the downtown area. Workers in White Plains, after all, can more easily commute from New York, or a number of surrounding counties. "People come to White Plains because it's a suburb, with the advantages of a city," Ms. Keenan said. "They don't want to live downtown."
Mayor Delfino, however, could not disagree more. 
"They got a 10-year jump on us," he said. "But we're planning to build 1,500 to 2,000 housing units right in the downtown area. We're on our way now."

The Ambience Of a Small Town
 For Daniel Bryan, a 25-year-old financial analyst who moved to White Plains from Stamford in August, the difference between the two cities is one of atmosphere: Stamford feels more like a small town.
"There's a downtown area where you can walk to a number of restaurants and bars, and it's a younger, more professional crowd," he said. Downtown White Plains has a grittier, more urban feel and lacks Stamford's movie theaters, he said. 
Other people who have lived in downtown Stamford tend to agree. "When you say the words 'corporate headquarters,' you imagine people all dressed up," said Robbie Monsma, who moved to downtown Stamford with her family last fall. "But there were lots of kids and older people on the street; I found it really charming." The difference is partly a matter of the distance to New York City. "White Plains is closer, so when I want to go out I just go into New York," Mr. Bryan said. 
And one thing is certain: White Plains, which has far less housing in its downtown area, is cheaper. "You definitely get more bang for your buck in White Plains," said Mr. Bryan, who is paying more than he did in Stamford but has a much larger apartment, he said. Despite its more run-down atmosphere, there are people who consider White Plains downright cozy. "I've never been so comfortable with my neighbors as I am here," said Jennifer Scharbach, who has lived in a $1,200-a-month two-bedroom apartment on Martine Avenue with her husband and two children for six years.

HEADLINE: Bridge Loans Offer Smooth Passage Between Homes 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
BEFORE Lucien and Tiffany DiForte decided to move to eastern Pennsylvania from Staten Island, the couple went through the endless calculations that make home buying almost as much fun as an I.R.S. audit. The considerations included the sales price, property taxes and, because they have a 3-year-old son, schools. Since Mr. DiForte is keeping his job on Staten Island, as manager of P. A. C. Plumbing, Heating and Air Conditioning, the family also had to take into account his daily commute. 
 After satisfying themselves on each count, the DiFortes settled on an eight-room, two-bath house on a half acre in Easton, Pa., just across the Delaware River from New Jersey, and closed on the property last Monday. They still have to close on the sale of their five-room, one-bath town house in the Arden Heights section of Staten Island, a closing scheduled for Jan. 22. By paying $152,000 for their new house and selling their town house for $157,000, they are in solid financial shape -- at least on paper. 
 "But since we had to pay off a $17,000 balance on our home equity loan," Mr. DiForte said, "and because there were closing costs on the new house and costs to move, we took out a $45,800 bridge loan. With that we paid off the equity loan, and when we sell this house, we'll pay off the bridge loan and put the balance toward the mortgage on our new house." 
As the term suggests, bridge loans are short-term loans intended to bridge the time span between buying one house and selling another. Although those loans were once commonly part of a move from one home to another, they began disappearing in the late 1980's. What relegated them to the niche market where they dwell to this day were home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. 
Home equity loans typically provide funds at a fixed rate for a fixed period of time. Home equity lines of credit have variable rates and can be tapped into at any time. Either loan can be used for any number of things, including home improvements, consolidating or paying off debts, tuition or medical bills.
Equity loans soared after Congress passed the tax act of 1986, according to Keith Leggett, a senior economist for the American Bankers Association. That law eliminated deductions on interest payments on credit cards and on loans to buy cars and many other worldly goods, but continued allowing borrowers to deduct interest for loans on which their property was put up as collateral. Thus, bridge loans are also deductible, but they are usually made for only a couple of months and home equity loans can be repaid over decades.
In 1983, according to the Federal Reserve, 7 percent of all homeowners had some form of home equity loan or credit in addition to their mortgages, Mr. Leggett said. By 1988 that figure was up to 11 percent, and it had risen to 13 percent -- roughly nine million households -- in 1997, the latest year for which figures are available. 
Overall statistics about the number of bridge loans are nonexistent, because very few banks even make the loans and because reporting the statistics would hardly be worth the bother for the lending institutions that do. 
"We write only a few bridge loans a month," said Palmer Heenan, senior vice president of Weichert Financial Services in Morris Plains, N.J., which made the bridge loan to the DiFortes. "But those loans still have a place." 
This is so even though interest rates on bridge loans are often two percentage points higher than those for conventional loans and some lenders require borrowers to pay points as a loan-origination fee. (Each point is equal to 1 percent of the total loan.)
Worse, if the borrower cannot sell his current house, he may end up shouldering two mortgages and the bridge loan. In that case he may have to lower the asking price sharply. 
The lending company, too, could find itself at risk, and in possible legal trouble. "If the deal fell apart, the lender could be viewed as liable for allowing the borrower to encumber himself with so much debt," said Eric P. Declercq, a regional vice president for Countrywide Home Loans, a California-based company with 30 lending offices in the New York area. That is why financial counselors advise people thinking of taking out a bridge loan to instead sell their current house before buying another, even though that runs the risk of losing out on a dream house they might have an eye on. Another safeguard would be to make the sale of one's current house contingent on finding a new house, although that too is easier said than done in a seller's market.
Most bridge loans cover 80 percent of the overall value of the property, while equity loans often go as high as 90 percent. "But in order to get a new or bigger equity loan, you can't have your house listed for sale," said John Greco, the president of Darien Financial Services Inc. in Darien, Conn.
And applying for a new equity loan or a higher line of credit requires a new appraisal -- but "you can't get a new appraisal if your house is already on the market," said Moshira Namoury, president of First Fidelity Mortgage Bankers in Stamford, Conn. Ms. Namoury added that if borrowers with home equity loans want to refinance their first mortgages, "a lot of lenders won't allow them to if they've touched their home equity within the last 12 months." 
While people who already have a home equity loan can list their home for sale, Mr. Greco said, some lenders require the borrower to occupy the house for as much as six months before putting it on the market. In addition, if the loan is closed within six months, some lenders will require the borrower to reimburse them for the expenses incurred in opening the loan.
For many borrowers, the appeal of bridge loans is that they can borrow a larger amount than would be the case if they simply took out an unsecured loan. One reason is that the bridge loan is secured by existing property.
Another is the formula by which lenders calculate the size of the loan for which borrowers can qualify. That calculation is based on dividing borrowers' gross monthly income into their monthly housing expenses, including principal, interest, taxes and insurance. Almost all lenders make housing loans that most borrowers will be able to repay with no more than 33 percent of their incomes, while allowing another 5 percent of income to repay all other debt. For a bridge loan, most lenders do not use the bridge loan itself in calculating the debt. Instead, they require that a borrower have a signed sales contract for the existing home, or they require that the borrower pay six months' interest in advance.
But just because higher loans are available, lenders say that borrowers should apply for only as big a loan as they need. "The bridge loan is not usually for the faint of heart," Mr. Greco said. "It's usually for the more sophisticated buyer." Bridge loans are also appealing for borrowers who do not have a home equity loan or who have reached the maximum of their existing line of credit. They also appeal to that handful of investors who would rather take out a short-term loan for the down payment and closing costs of a new house than sell their stocks or bonds. 
Lenders justify the higher rates of bridge loans, when compared with home-equity loans, by citing a higher degree of risk. "They are fairly risky transactions, more so than on traditional owner-occupied properties," said Mr. Heenan of Weichert Financial Services. Weichert charges two points (that is, 2 percent of the total loan) and an interest rate two percentage points more for bridge loans than for more traditional loans, Mr. Heenan said, "because if the loan is outstanding for only a week, as some of them are, we need to be compensated for taking a risk." 
Bridge loans come in an assortment of shapes and sizes, although the usual term is 30 to 60 days. But Darien Financial Services, for example, makes them for 180 days, and borrowers need not have a existing relationship, as many other lenders require. Others will make them for longer periods. 
Weichert offers two types of bridge loans and only for terms of one year -- a first mortgage on which the borrower makes monthly payments of only the interest that accumulates between receipt of the loan and its repayment, or a loan secured by a second mortgage on the borrower's existing property. On second mortgages, Weichert will lend up to $100,000, compared with $400,000 on a first mortgage.
The recent bullish housing market has conspired against bridge loans. With homes selling as fast as they were put on the market and in some cases even before they were listed, many owners accepted the first inviting offer that was accompanied by a down payment, rather than wait the week to 10 days for a bridge loan to be approved. 
"When properties are still selling briskly, most sellers can still get a buyer pretty quickly," Mr. Heenan said. "But as the economy is throttling back, that may change." 
Bridge loans were once a routine part of the corporate relocation process -- that is, employees transferred to other cities who have an urgent need for loans to tide them over while they look for a new house as they try to sell their current one. 
In the 1980's, bridge loans were often the loan of choice. But in the strong economy of recent years, that pattern also changed. Most of the time the employer will advance the amount the employee needs for the house, said Ms. Namoury of the First Fidelity Mortgage Bankers in Stamford.
Even when bridge loans are offered as part of a corporate relocation, lenders are wary. "We only offer a true bridge loan to people being transferred by a Fortune 1,000 company, and we'll lend them 100 percent of the value of the home purchased," said Mr. Declercq of Countrywide Home Loans. "But the company must agree in writing to buy the house after a fixed period, usually six months, or carry the payments."
In such cases, the employee takes out a first and second mortgage to finance the full sales price of the new home, up to $500,000. Eighty percent is financed with the first mortgage; the remainder is available as a home equity line of credit for a fixed-term second mortgage. 
"This way we've protected the consumer, making sure they don't get in over their heads," Mr. Declercq said. "Then when they sell their house, they'll be able to pay off the second mortgage, leaving them with the 80 percent first mortgage and without having to incur any private mortgage insurance." That insurance, known as P.M.I., is required on any home loan for which the borrower puts down less than 20 percent.
Bridge loans are not limited to individual homeowners. "I do them on a small scale for friends who are builders and with whom we have a long-term relationship," said Nadine Malone, president of Madison Home Equities in Carle Place, on Long Island. "I recently made a $275,000 bridge loan to a builder in East Hampton who had just finished 90 percent of a million-dollar-plus house, but needed the loan to finish the plumbing and landscaping in order to get the certificate of occupancy." 
BY contrast, the average bridge loan provided by the American Mortgage Acceptance Company in Manhattan is $2 million -- not for single-family homes, to be sure, but primarily for the construction and mortgage financing of government-insured multifamily housing.
"Developers can go to the Federal Housing Administration and under a special program can get them to put up 90 percent of the cost of developing apartment buildings," said Stuart Boesky, the company's chief executive. "But then they have to ask themselves whether they can put up the other $1 million or so, and if not they come to us for a bridge loan." However, he added that bridge loans generally are getting harder to find, because "our environment is getting more risk averse." He added, "People want bigger and bigger returns to take risks." 
Mr. and Mrs. DiForte may have taken a risk of a different kind by deciding to move to Easton, but you wouldn't know if from talking with them. "The closing was painless," Mrs. DeForte said, before rhapsodizing about their new house with its sun room, dining room, living room, eat-in kitchen and second bathroom, spaciousness that she does not have in her other house.
As for Mr. DiForte's daily 130-mile round-trip commute by car back to Staten Island, neither of them sounded especially concerned. "It's only an hour and 15 minutes each way," he said. 
Besides, Mrs. DiForte added: "My mother takes a bus from Arden Heights to Manhattan, and it takes her two hours each day. God forbid how long it takes when there's an accident in a tunnel or on a bridge."

HEADLINE: Why Can't Hudson County Get Any Respect?; 
Despite Soaring Towers, Rising Property Values and Even a Light Rail, the Region Struggles to Polish Its Image

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
ON CLIFTON PLACE, where the rocky face of the Palisades mellows into a gentle slope overlooking this city's booming waterfront and trendy downtown -- the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital looms like the mocking specter of a past that Hudson County would just as soon forget.
 It has been two decades since the last baby was born in the aging building. And 72 years after its groundbreaking, the what was a seven-story palace of pediatrics -- solidly built of brick and limestone -- is a deserted corpse. Most of the windows are smashed, and torn shades flap in the chill wind that that whips off New York Bay. Its arched main entrance is a wall of cinder block. 
 A few years ago a cyclone fence was put up around the decaying building to deter squatters and scavengers, but it was too late. In a thinly veiled reference to the Margaret Hague in his novel "Clockers," Richard Price, a chronicler of Hudson County's underbelly, described how junkies stripped the hospital interior of copper tubing to sell for scrap. 
"It's actually where I was born," said Officer Raymond Ortiz of the Jersey City Police Department, who lives in a multifamily house across the street from the hospital. 
Officer Ortiz said that the battered hulk where his mother gave him life 27 years ago did not bother him. "Sign of the times," he said with a shrug.
Frank ("I Am the Law") Hague, mayor of Jersey City from 1917 to 1947 and longtime leader of the Democratic Party in Hudson County, named the maternity hospital after his mother. And while there is no question that the hospital provided invaluable pediatric services -- often free to poor residents -- it was also exploited as a patronage mill with a large political price tag.
And just as the Margaret Hague -- inhabited by rodents these days -- stands as a symbol of the Hague machine and the ultimate ruin wrought by corruption, the failure to demolish the hospital or convert it into much-needed housing parallels Hudson County's inability to cleanse itself entirely of the stigma that Boss Hague and his ilk left in their wake.
While the county has made great strides, particularly along its stretch of the Hudson River known as the Gold Coast, even the county's proudest boosters concede that people in and outside New Jersey still envision Hudson County as something just short of Gomorrah on the Palisades.
"The perception is that nothing really good is going on in Hudson County," said Edward J. DeFazio, a longtime assistant Hudson County prosecutor and resident. "There's a certain disrespect for the county and its citizens.
Despite the intensive development in former waterfront wastelands -- resulting in soaring property values, the wholesale creation of jobs, cooperation among municipalities once known for bitter squabbling, and the virtual end of the old-style machine politics -- several factors have conspired to conceal Hudson's rebound.
Old perceptions do not seem to be stemming the flow of residents and businesses into the county. In Jersey City alone, the planning board has approved 11 million square feet of office space and 6,000 new residential units since 1997, much of that already under construction, said Tom Gallagher, the mayor's chief of staff.
"Jersey City is now known nationally as being one of the hottest real estate markets in the country, and a premiere location for both Fortune 500 companies and middle-class famililes," Mr. Gallagher said.
And as for the area's tainted history, he observed: "I don't think most people are aware, and when the do become aware of it, they see it as sort of a colorful part of the city's past."
Obviously, Hudson County's recovery -- like Newark's ballyhooed renaissance -- is due in part to the nation's economic surge in the 90's. Yet Newark's turnaround pricks at the pride of people in Jersey City, Hoboken and other parts of Hudson, who believe their gains have received much less attention.
If there were a physical embodiment of Hudson County, it would have to be County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski, who 55 years after his birth still lives here, in a condominium near the Exchange Place financial center.
Mr. Janiszewski, a former board member of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, once had higher aspirations, but he has since recognized the constraints placed on him by his place of birth. He recalled the opinion of one newspaper columnist while he was in the State Assembly that had he been from Bergen County, he would have been considered a gubernatorial candidate.
"There's probably not a month that that goes by," he said, "that I don't run into someone, 'Oh, I've heard your name. You're up in Hudson County, Jersey City, right? Oh, I haven't been there in 30 years. What's it like?' Or someone who says to me, 'Wow, I was in Jersey City recently, or Hoboken recently, or Weehawken recently, and Wow! And what's with this new train?"
He rules from a large, wood-paneled office in the Justice Brennan Courthouse on Newark Avenue, an imposing building named for the late Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, who presided there as a state judge early in his career. It is hardly a surprise that Mr. Janiszewski is loquacious and impassioned in his praise of his county or that he is so plainly frustrated by its negative image.
Mr. Janiszewski sees the county's reputation problem largely as the media's making. In particular, he blames The Star-Ledger, New Jersey's only statewide newspaper, for failing to publish a Hudson County edition or to even cover the county regularly. Newhouse Newspapers publishes The Star-Ledger as well as The Jersey Journal, a daily newspaper available at PATH stations and at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan as well as in Hudson County.
Mr. Janiszewski said he and potential advertisers had appealed to the newspaper for coverage, but had been told that the company did not want its newswpapers competing for the same news and advertisers. "It is not in our economic interest," Mr. Janiszewski said was the response.
Jim Wilse, editor of The Star-Ledger, could not be reached for comment.
"When the pumpkin patch gets picked in Hopatcong, that's a news story," said Mr. Janiszewski. But referring to the new Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line, he added, "When someone invests a billion dollars in Hudson County, it's a news blackout."
One result of the gap in coverage, he said, was that many voters knew little about the Hudson County politicians who aspired to statewide office -- Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City and Representative Robert Menendez of Union City, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House.
"It's unfair to them and to the public in New Jersey that there is this curtain in the sharing of public information," he said, "leaving Hudson County in the recesses of someone's ancient memory, or to the pages of an old history book."
But, oh, what a history.
Still one of Hudson's most colorful and often-remembered political figures, Frank Hague ruled with a stern, patriarchal style, and was respected by many for delivering essential services to a largely poor, historically immigrant population. But the price could be high. He was said to take a cut of his appointees' salaries and was known to have political opponents roughed up or jailed. He avoided prosecution, conventional wisdom has it, by dealing only in cash, and grew wealthy on a salary of $5,000 a year.
Mr. Hague was also influential in national Democratic politics, and his allies included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who could count on the county boss to deliver a large voter turnout. In return, Mr. Hague could count on federal largesse to finance the projects that propped up his regime.
To be sure, the reputation that has stuck with Hudson County took decades to earn and in all likelihood will live long after the Margaret Hague has been replaced by town houses. The list of indicted and convicted public officials is almost as familiar as the names enshrined in Cooperstown.
There was John V. Kenny, a Hague lieutenant who broke with his former boss and beat a Hague-backed incumbent for mayor in 1949, quickly setting up his own machine. Unlike Mr. Hague, however, who retired a free man, Mr. Kenny did not escape prosecution and was sentenced to an 18-month prison term for federal tax evasion.
Asked years later how Mr. Hague would have viewed the prosecutors who indicted officials after the death of the former boss, Mr. Kenny was quoted as saying, "If Hague were alive, he'd be in jail."
Again in July 1971, prosecutors struck pay dirt. Mayor Thomas J. Whelan of Jersey City and seven other officials, including the county police chief, the city council president and the county Democratic chairman were convicted of conspiracy and extortion for collecting millions in kickbacks from companies doing business with Hudson County or Jersey City. The take, according to testimony at the trial of what was called the Hudson 8, was 10 percent off the top.
Then in 1991, Mayor Gerald McCann was removed from office after his conviction for real estate fraud -- though his supporters were quick to point out that the charges were not related to his office.
Of course, Jersey City, home to nearly half of Hudson's 550,000 residents, is hardly the only source of its folklore.
Take Bayonne, which was represented both in Congress by Representative Cornelius E. Gallagher, who in 1973 went to prison for income tax evasion linked to a political fund-raising scheme.
And in Union City, Mayor William V. Musto, who was also a state senator, was convicted of seeking bribes. And Mr. Musto's successor as mayor, Robert C. Botti, was convicted in a bid-rigging scheme involving school supplies.
Union City is also home to what was perhaps the nation's most corrupt union office, Teamsters Local 60, where a federal trustee was installed for 13 years starting in 1986 because of the ubiquitous presence of the Genovese organized crime family.
In Weehawken, where Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr played out their bitter political rivalry their infamous duel, former Mayor Wally P. Lindsey was convicted of trying to extort $600,000 from a builder.
In West New York, the arrest of 29 people in 1988 -- most of them local police officers -- was billed by the United States Attorneys office in Newark as the largest police corruption scandal in New Jersey history.
Not surprisingly, simply existing in the shadow of this abundance of public corruption has taken its toll.
"There can be psychological consequences," said Dr. Carlos Hernandez, an environmental psychologist who is president of New Jersey City University, Mr. Janiszewski's alma mater.
"Self-identity is tied into the physical environment to some degree," said Dr. Hernandez, who went so far as to say that said some academics even project their negative perception of the county onto the university. "It takes contact with the setting to realize what's actually occurring. And if you're not covered in the press and people are not coming to see firsthand what a great place this county is, certainly you're going to be dealing with antiquated perceptions."
To begin with, Hudson is largely a paved-over peninsula, with the Hudson River and Upper New York Bay to the east, Newark Bay and the Passaic River to the west, and the Arthur Kill, which barely separates Bayonne from Staten Island, to the south. It is bordered by land -- Bergen County -- only to the north. Even Essex County, to the west, sits across the Passaic River.
Indeed, Hudson might be viewed as an asphalt jungle so jammed that political skills are a requisite just to navigate the sidewalk. With 550,000 residents crammed into just 47 square miles, it is both the state's smallest county in area and its most densely populated. Its 11,837 residents per square mile is more than 10 times the statewide figure of 1,097, according to 1999 census estimates.
And if politics and its rewards offered savvy street fighters an escape from poverty, as it did for the young Frank Hague, Hudson was as likely a breeding ground as any for political corruption. Even in 1995, the latest year for which census estimates are available, Hudson's poverty rate of 17.3 percent of the overall population was twice the statewide average.
The cloud of corruption and intrigue that still hovers over Hudson County began gathering in this country's infancy.
Joan Doherty Lovero, chief librarian of the Jersey City Public Library, who wrote "Hudson County: The Left Bank" (American History Press, 1999) said the political corruption dates to 1870, when the treasurer of Jersey City, Alexander D. Hamilton, absconded with city funds and fled to Mexico.
Yet Ms. Lovero believes there is another explanation for Hudson's less-than-favorable image born of its geographic isolation, and that is its traditional economic ties to New York -- which continue to this day with its influx of financial back-office jobs -- and even the county's demographics, which set it apart from the rest of New Jersey.
"It was easy for people in the rest of the state to look with scorn on us, as we looked on them, because there were not that many ties that bound," Ms. Lovero said. "And we were the immigrants, and up until the World War II period, the rest of the state was pretty rural."
And Charles Cummings, the Newark city historian, insisted there was no rivalry between the state's two largest cities. Yet Mr. Cummings then proceeded to reel off a list of such cultural institutions as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the Newark Museum and the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which he said set Newark apart from Jersey City.
Even Newark's current mayor, Sharpe James, took a playful jab at Hudson County, poking fun at the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system, the recently opened trolley line that competed with a similar proposal from Essex and Union Counties.
"I look at that line that they have, with the low ridership, that could have gone from Newark to Elizabeth, and I think they're doing pretty well," Mr. James said in a recent interview.
What might it take for Hudson County -- with its gleaming financial towers and high-rise apartments proliferating along the river and its trendy neighborhoods replacing blue-collar enclaves -- to leave behind its sullied past?
For Mayor Schundler, the answer to that question is crucial, for it could very well weigh on his current bid for the Republican nomination for governor. As it is, the ambitious mayor faces a daunting primary battle against the powerful State Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who in a matter of days will in all likelihood have the advantages of incumbency as acting governor.
Mr. Schundler, who grew up in Westfield, must overcome not only a lack of statewide exposure, but Hudson's legacy of corruption. He is, after all, running for governor from Frank Hague's very office.
"He'll never make it," said Wylie Herbert, a native of Summit, who was seated at the counter of the Tunnel Diner just two blocks west of the Holland Tunnel. "Hudson County? They'll never pull a governor out of Hudson County. You've got to remember, for years Hudson County was the most corrupt county in the state. I don't know about now, but then."
The last politician from Hudson County to ascend to the position of governor was A. Harry Moore, a Democrat from Jersey City, who was elected to the last of his three terms in 1937. But it had been even longer than that since Jersey City elected its last Republican mayor -- in 1917 -- before Mr. Schundler won a special nonpartisan election among about 20 candidates in 1992.
"I'd argue there are still some people who have a negative view based on the fact that Jersey City was a difficult place to live," Mr. Schundler said. "The 70's in Jersey City, you had fires every night in downtown Jersey City, because the only way you could get any money for your property was to burn it and collect on the insurance. So you had massive abandonment, massive drug problems, massive crime problems."
But, he added: "Image typically does trail changes in reality. But you do get changes in image happening." 
Unfortunately, it was one of Mr. Schundler's own hand-picked appointees who contributed one of the more colorful chapters in Hudson's recent past. Before the authorities charged him in 1994, the Rev. R. L. Williams, a deputy mayor who also founded the Real Love Missionary Baptist Church in Jersey City, used a credit card issued to him as president of the Jersey City Public Library to run up $46,000 in improper charges, mainly at strip clubs in Manhattan and New Jersey.
Unlikely as Mr. Williams was to find real love in such places, he spent thousands of dollars many nights trying with money raised by overdue book fees and library subsidies from taxpayers. He received a five-year probationary term, but has spent a year in jail for violation of probation.
Hudson's stigma as a backwater has even stung the arts community despite zoning changes in Jersey City allowing artists to live in their studio spaces after improving them to comply with residential standards, even if other parts of the building do not.
Michael Fauerbach, who came out of a group of expressionist painters known as the Rhino Horn, said that before he moved to Jersey City from Tribeca 20 years ago, he himself was a snob when it came to trans-Hudson artists like Leon Yost, a photographer who had moved across the river from Manhattan six years earlier.
"I guess, like a lot of people, I felt like it was somewhat bizarre, like he had moved to the suburbs," said Mr. Fauerbach, who today is 58. "He might as well have moved to Kansas, as far as we were concerned."
Yet Mr. Yost, who publishes a calendar with photographs of county landmarks, said he missed those early days, before demand sent property values soaring.
"Some of us don't want any respect," he said, noting that he paid $14,000 for a three-story brick town house in 1974, when his property taxes were $600 a year. Now, Mr. Yost said, houses like his sell for more than $300,000, and, he added, "in two years we pay for our property tax what we bought our house for."
For Barry Zubrow, chief administrative officer and a managing director for Goldman Sachs, one of the many New York-based financial giants that have taken space along the waterfront, the only perception he or his colleagues have of Hudson County is of an attractive place to do business. 
"The honest answer is, we did not have that perception or impression in terms of the way Hudson County historically was," Mr. Zubrow said. "And so it was not a part of our analysis. The most important part of our analysis was that we think Jersey City is a terrific place to work."
Whatever the new realities, the old perceptions of Hudson are likely to linger, at least while the generations that lived through Hudson's scandals remain.
Sheila Simpson grew up the daughter of one of Hudson's most feared prosecutors, James Tumulty. Ms. Simpson, 56, who now lives in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, has memories not only of criminals and political rivals trying to get at her father through her, but also of federal authorities.
"I had I.R.S. investigators at my door, trying to get information from me," Ms. Simpson said. 
The past left such a mark that Ms. Simpson said she never discussed Hudson County or her father's reputation with her son, Scott. Then one day last summer he told her of an encounter he had with two elderly women from Jersey City.
"We were all at the beach one day, and Scott came home and he was just white, and he said, 'Was my grandfather an S.O.B.?' "
Thinking about it, Ms. Simpson said, "It's hard for me to judge, but I have to think that the reputation will always be sullied in my mind."
Could be, Mr. Janiszewski conceded.
"History is immutable," he said. "You can't change it. All you can change is the future."

Maplewood's Tangled Taxes

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD 

 BODY:
Maplewood has the well-scrubbed look of an ideal suburban village: a trim downtown with a small train depot hard by a tidy village green; substantial brick and clapboard homes with broad lawns; new cars and S.U.V.'s of German and Japanese vintage in the driveways and along the tree-lined streets.
 But inside many of those freshly painted houses, people are seething like never before. 
 In a mini-tax revolt that some say could escalate into an effort to recall the entire five-member township committee, groups are forming on such streets as Euclid Avenue, Walton Road and Wyoming Avenue over new property tax assessments with increases ranging from 25 percent to 85 percent.
Making matters worse, homeowners in other parts of town, including the newly installed mayor, could see their property taxes go down.
As one homeowner put it, "I've lived here 19 years and I've never anything like this." 
At a meeting one night last week for residents of Roosevelt Road, Morrow Memorial Church began filling up with people from neighboring streets and beyond in this township of 21,000.
"We have 30 families on the street, and I thought we'd get about 10 people, maybe 15, but we got somewhere between 170 and 200 people," said Kevin Friel, a 37-year old computer analyst who helped to organize the meeting. "I was actually trying to limit the size of the meeting so it would be more structured, so I was very surprised."
In response to the wave of complaints, township officials sought and were granted a two-week extension from Essex County for submitting the revaluations by a Jan. 10 deadline. In addition, the Maplewood tax assessor will have until mid-February to make any adjustments. The earliest the revaluations will be reflected in the tax bill is the third quarter of 2001, around August.
Nonetheless, township officials stand by the revaluations.
"We feel we did the right thing," said Vic De Luca, a member of the township committee who was sworn in as mayor on Jan. 1. "We ordered reassessment to bring fairness and balance to the property tax situation." But, he added, "It's also fair to say we did not expect the level of increases we are hearing about."
If the proposed valuations do eventually go into effect, especially hard hit will be young families who have stretched their financial resources to buy a house and older residents on fixed incomes.
"I feel terrible about it," said Sam Whinery, a 79-year old former operations manager for the Hammond Map Co. whose relatively modest, four-bedroom colonial on Beach Place in the Jefferson School area went to an assessment of $489,700 from $82,200.
Mr. Whinery, who has lived in Maplewood since 1924 and in his current house since 1968, said his taxes would increase 50 percent, to $12,977 from $8,393. "As a senior with a fixed income," he said sadly, "my ability to hold on isn't there."
Meetings like the one at Morrow Church have become commonplace, particularly on the west side of town in the Jefferson School area, where some of the more expensive houses are situated and taxes could more than double.
Some homeowners say they have been assessed for such amenities as air conditioning or additions to existing structures that did not exist. Others say the people who did the revaluations had not even been inside their houses. Still others contend that no one in authority could explain the process by which the firm that did the revaluations, Certified Valuations Inc. of Randolph, arrived at specific assessments.
Tempers are running so high that Terence Lowe, an organizer of the meeting at the Morrow Church placed an advertisement last week in a local weekly newspaper, The News-Record of Maplewood and South Orange, urging residents to join in a class-action suit against the township committee.
John Rountree, a 61-year-old printing company consultant who has lived in Maplewood for 36 years, said he was "shocked" last month when he received a new assessment on his four-bedroom Victorian. According to Certified Valuations, the value of Mr. Rountree's home had soared to $498,000 from $88,000, creating an expected tax increase of $5,000, for a total of $13,000 -- or a 61 percent increase.
With that, Mr. Rountree and a neighbor, Ken Swan, went to town hall and got the assessments for 41 houses along a stretch of Maplewood Avenue from the village center.
"We found there would be a 23 percent to 89 percent increase in taxes, with an average increase of 53.25 percent and an average increase of $5,000 a person," he said. 
When he met with a representative of Certified Valuations at town hall, Mr. Rountree said the person could not explain how his property was assessed.
"I went in and asked five simple questions," he said. "I got five, 'I don't knows.' "
In a telephone interview last week, a representative from Certified Valuations said there was no one available for comment.
Under state law, municipalities are required to reassess residential and commercial properties at current market value every 10 years. But Committeewoman Ellen Davenport said the last revaluation in Maplewood took place in 1981, and consequently the property was at about 36 percent of true value.
The township first began discussing revaluating properties at a public meeting in 1998, Ms. Davenport said. From there, it contracted with Certified Valuations, which had also been hired by the State Department of the Treasury to revalue properties in Newark. Last summer, she said, the company began assessing homes in Maplewood.
Initially, letters went out assuring homeowners that the revaluation would spread the tax burden more equitably to try to allay fears of a major tax increase.
But then, said Mayor DeLuca, most of Maplewood's properties went up fourfold. Of the town's 6,843 residential properties, 57 percent will pay about the same in taxes or a little less, 19 percent will get a moderate increase and 24 percent a higher increase, he said.
The value of 841 properties, he added, has gone up four-and-a-half to five times, 653 saw their properties increase in value five to six times, and 125 properties saw increases of more than six times.
As for Mayor DeLuca, the president of a foundation that awards grants to environmental groups, who lives in the southeast part of town near Irvington and Newark, the value of his house rose to $130,000 from $53,00, and his taxes went down $1,700, from about $5,500 a year.
"As a homeowner who is going to get relief," Mr. De Luca said, "I certainly don't want to see that relief given to me at the expense of destroying the town."
Bob Klein, a real-estate agent and former township committee member here, said the valuations probably rose as steeply as they did because they were done at a time when the housing market was booming.
"When a house came on the market, we got six or eight people bidding on it, and they drove the market up on those in the vicinity of the railroad station," he said. "Some were paying well over the asking price, sometimes $100,000 over what somebody was asking."
He added: "You don't assess property at the peak of the crest."
Many residents feel the town should try to postpone implementing the new assessments until the economy shakes out and the inequities can be worked out.
"Basically," Mr. Klein said, "people want them to hold off, rethink this, educate the public and do it next year."

HEADLINE: Pooling the Assets of Thoughtful Young Investors 

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
LONG before the Internet let teenagers play the stock market, at least two companies created mutual funds specifically for the under-20 crowd. And the companies have found that they can be a demanding bunch.
 The teenage shareholders of the $1.3 billion Liberty Stein Roe Young Investors fund enjoy sharing their opinions, said the manager, David P. Brady, who estimated that he receives several hundred letters a year. He recalls one from a 13-year-old girl that began pleasantly, complimenting him on the fund's performance. Then it continued: "I don't know why you own McDonald's. I don't go there, and my friends don't go there. It's just not cool." 
Mr. Brady wrote back, explaining that he had met recently with McDonald's management at its Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Ill., and was satisfied with the company's global and domestic strategies. Then he asked the crucial question: "If you don't go to McDonald's, where do you go?" Unfortunately, he said, she didn't respond.
Mr. Brady, 36, has run the fund since it started nearly seven years ago. It returned 20.7 percent a year, on average, from its April 1994 inception through Jan. 10 of this year, compared with 18 percent for its group, large-capitalization growth stocks, according to Morningstar Inc. Besides aiming for long-term capital growth, the fund teaches its investors about basic principles of economics and personal finance.
Its shareholders use surprising criteria to recommend stocks. One wrote: "I shop at the Gap because I like the clothes, and one just opened in my neighborhood, and because they give money for AIDS education programs."
Prompting from shareholders led Mr. Brady to increase his stake in technology stocks, alongside his traditional holdings like Mattel and Walt Disney. "As the fund developed and we received lots of shareholder letters, it became apparent that they wanted us to own more than bubble-gum companies," Mr. Brady said. "They wanted growth." The fund's technology stake is now 23 percent.
SHAREHOLDER comments also led Curt Rohrman, manager of the $250 million USAA First Start Growth fund, to buy certain stocks. The fund, which is also geared to young investors, teaches saving as well as investing. In monthly newsletters, the fund includes prepaid postcards soliciting comment; Mr. Rohrman receives about 250 a month.
One card came from a teenage boy who asked whether Mr. Rohrman could buy Boeing shares. "As I got halfway through the reply, telling him that I didn't own it, I stopped to do some research on the stock," Mr. Rohrman said. "I ended up buying it, and making money." 
That is not to say that all his investor suggestions are moneymakers: the fund lost money on another, AMC Entertainment, after buying a stake in December 1999. 
Mr. Rohrman, 38, has run the fund since it started in 1987. It returned 10.4 percent a year, on average, versus 13.7 percent for its peers through Jan. 10, Morningstar said.
He said he had fielded "a ton of questions" on technology stocks, the fund's biggest sector, at 42 percent of assets. About one-third of the questions, he suspects, are written by parents. "Sometimes," he added, "when I respond to investor questions, I'll say, 'You have great handwriting for a 6-month-old.' "
A year ago, as part of his interest in investor education, Mr. Rohrman visited the kindergarten class of his 6-year-old daughter, Sarah, to explain what he did for living. Clearly, his message got through. A week later, the Rohrmans got a puppy, which they named Molly. When Mr. Rohrman came home from work, his daughter said, "Daddy, you have to invest in a paper towel company" -- Molly had had an accident that covered the floor.

Reys and Butlers, Moguls and Kiters

BYLINE:  By SID FRIGAND; Sid Frigand served as the spokesman for Mayor Abraham D. Beame, the M.T.A. and the Port Authority. He lives in Greenwich Village.

 BODY:
THE 2000 census has found 281,421,906 people in the United States, but we still await the detailed breakdowns that offer a snapshot of who we are demographically and economically. New York simply won't sit still for a portrait. So why wait?
 The telephone directory is a gold mine of information about New Yorkers' diversity, genealogy, history and lifestyles. It not only tells us who we are but who we were. The clues are in our names. 
 Consider how many craftsmen left their mark and progeny listed in the Manhattan phone book: Goldsmiths, Coppersmiths, Silversmiths, Saddlers, Wainwrights, Tanners, Tinkers, Joiners, Turners, Bookbinders, Shoemakers, Weavers, Sewers, Glovers, Hatters, Potters and Glaziers. Barrel makers apparently were also gifted baby makers: witness the 720 Coopers in Manhattan's listing.
Service providers were also fecund forbearers. There are more than 2,000 Millers, 500 Bakers and almost 400 Carters. In lesser numbers are names like Butcher, Postman, Brewer, Printer, Pressman, Scribe and Scrivener. New York's preeminence in banking and commerce is mirrored by folks named Merchant, Trader, Stockman, Broker, Banker, Shipper and a multitude of Clerks and Clarks (with a nod to the Brits). There are also Buyers, Sellers, Moguls and, wouldn't you know, Sharks and one self-proclaimed Kiter.
Our rural heritage? Consider how many Hunters, Skinners, Farmers and Shepherds are recorded. Add to that Forester, Woodman, Axman, Scout, Thrasher, Comber, Miner, Herder and thanks to the growing Hispanic population -- 35 Caballeros. True to our tradition as seafarers, we have an Admiral, a Shipwright, a Sailor, three Mariners, four Pilots and three Rowers. From the professional callings we have several Doctors (and Medicos and Medici) and almost a dozen Nurses. In addition we have Advocates, Judges, Justices, Officers and Jurists, but only one Suer.
Our military lineage is highlighted by a General and several Generali, a Colonel, a Captain, Marshals and more than 50 Majors (Major Deegan absent). True to military inequities, there are 10 Riders and 600 Walkers.
Among the most diverse set of names are those reflecting royal households. We have Kings galore (730) and scores of Sultans, Kaisers, Koenigs, Res and Reys. Queens, Sultanas, Reinas, Reines and Reginas are well represented. Lesser royalty include Princes, Dukes, Earls, Barons and a Baroness, lots of Knights, loads of Lords and a Lady. Elsewhere are the castle's grunt workers: Pages, Heralds, Butlers, Cooks, Porters and Servers. Tending the estates are Gardeners, Grooms, Stablers, Falconers and even two Thralls (servant slaves).
As a center for the arts, New York has Painters, Dancers, Bards, Rhymers as well as a Poet. Musicians? We have Leaders, Maestri, Fiddlers, Fifers, Drummers and down in the orchestra pit Cello, Piccolo, Viola, Harp, Cornet, Guitar and Piano. The theater and side shows give us Players, Directors, Jesters, Barkers, Hams and Hamlets, Lears, a Macbeth, an Actor and four dozen Angels.
The city is also a sports town, witness such names as Boxer, Trainer, Coach, Pitcher, Fielder, Runner and more than threescore Fans. If the Jets come back to the city, we already have Passers, Blockers, Tacklers, Ends and Backs. On the links, we have Drivers, Putters and one self-confessed Duffer.
Among the more puzzling heritages are those that bear ecclesiastic names. Traditionally thought to be celibate, Popes, Cardinals, Priests, Abbots, Bishops and Monks abound. There are also Priors, Friars, Sextons and a Deacon. From the Middle East we find three Imams, one misspelled Rabai and a slew of Cantors. On a more esoteric note we boast Prophets, Sages, Swamis, Shamans and a Yogi. We also have a Cherub, Cherubini and a couple of Cupids. Darkly, we must admit to a few Warlocks, two Lamias (female demons), a Crone and -- wouldn't you guess? -- a Devil.

Lowering the Volume In the Valley of the Dogs

BYLINE:  By William Santiago

 BODY:
Handling sales calls became difficult with all that woofing in the background. Begging for scraps in the cafeteria became a bit much. 
Allergies flared. So, many once dog-friendly technology companies in and around Silicon Valley now ban dogs in the workplace.
 "Out of respect for our employees and customers who visit our offices, we don't allow dogs anymore," said Liz Aune, a spokeswoman for the Vicinity Corporation, a mapping software company in Sunnyvale, Calif. "When companies grow and it's no longer just your buddies working there, it requires policies like that to benefit everybody." 
 As many start-up companies have downsized or disappeared, and as profits have actually been deemed more important than indulgent perks, many survivors of the slumping new economy have rethought the canine question. 
Other Silicon Valley companies putting pup prohibition into effect include Excite@Home in Redwood City, Rainfinity in San Jose and Apple Computer in Cupertino.
The first dog at a Sacramento company, eMonitoringSolutions.com, was a Jack Russell terrier. It was later joined by an Irish setter, a miniature pinscher and others, which led to the unruly behavior that pack animals exhibit when they reach critical mass. "Now, we only allow the original terrier as a mascot," said Russell Trumm, a company spokesman. "It was important during our core business hours that there not be a lot of barking." William Santiago

How to Scale Back the Hours, but Not the Career

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS

 BODY:
SIX years ago, Karen Kurek, who was a partner at Arthur Andersen in Chicago, was permitted to reduce her workweek to four days to spend more time with her twin daughters, who were just a year old at the time. Although she worried that scaling back her hours might stall her career, she would discover that those concerns were unfounded.
 Not only did she remain productive during the shortened work schedule, she was also promoted about two years ago to managing partner and now oversees the flexible work offerings herself at the Arthur Andersen consulting company, which was separated from its parent accounting company and recently changed its name to Accenture. "I may have slowed down my pace, but my career hasn't stalled," said Mrs. Kurek, 41, of Hinsdale, Ill., who has remained on a four-day schedule. 
 When Lisa Grau joined Brodeur Worldwide, a public relations firm based in Boston, two years ago, she chose to telecommute between her San Diego home and the company's Phoenix office because she wanted to remain near her family and friends. Working from home, she found, did not slow her career path, either. After starting as an account manager, Mrs. Grau, 32, who is now married with an infant daughter, was promoted twice -- to group manager and, most recently, to vice president. 
To attract and retain employees in a tight labor market, an increasing number of companies have been offering flexible work arrangements like those of Mrs. Kurek and Mrs. Grau. Forty-three percent of large employers, in fact, let their employees work from home at least some of the time last year, up from 33 percent in 1999, while 27 percent offered a reduced workweek, up from 19 percent, according to a survey released in late December by Watson Wyatt, a benefits consulting firm in Washington. (The company questioned 410 employers with at least 1,000 employees.)
Although the slowing economy may be making the job market less competitive, workplace experts expect companies to continue offering flexible benefits at the current pace, while cutting back on other perks like bonuses or overtime. "That's a win-win situation" for the employer, said John A. Challenger, who runs the Challenger, Gray & Christmas outplacement firm in Chicago. "It doesn't really cost them anything. If anything, it can help cut costs." 
Some workers, however, still fear that flexible schedules and telecommuting may be impediments to their careers. But the positive experiences of both Mrs. Kurek and Mrs. Grau support the findings of an extensive study released last summer by Catalyst, a research and advisory group in New York; the study tracked 24 women who worked flexible schedules over the last decade. It found that most of the women, employed in a variety of industries, were satisfied with the career trade-offs they had made, and that more than half had received promotions.
"If you handle a flexible arrangement very, very carefully, it won't hinder your career," said Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president for research at Catalyst.
Employees who participate in flexible work programs acknowledge the potential trickiness of keeping their careers on track. The biggest challenge, they say, is convincing their bosses and colleagues that they can remain key players without being in the office every day. 
Sue Keenan, human resources director at Household International, a consumer-finance company based in Prospect Heights, Ill., had such concerns when she chose to share her position with a colleague, Jeanne Gruner, starting in June 1999. Both women work reduced hours to spend more time with their young children.
"There were some people who worried that we wouldn't be available when they needed us," said Mrs. Keenan, 36, of Arlington Heights, Ill. To keep in contact with her co-workers and clients, she bought a cell phone and a pager. 
Other workers keep themselves marketable by taking on high-profile assignments. Ms. Brumit Kropf recalled the story of an accountant who decided recently to cut down on her hours, along with the number of clients she served. "She kept those clients who were most critical to the firm," she said, "because she knew she'd play a more visible role that way." 
Even if the boss approves, flexible work arrangements are not for everyone, especially those who thrive on interaction on the job. 
Jeff Rappaport, chief executive of Outlook Marketing Services Inc., a marketing communications company based in Northbrook, Ill., manages a staff of 20 full- and part-time employees, all of whom work from home. Mr. Rappaport says he recently hired a woman away from an advertising agency. "She came from a culture where co-workers used to go out every Friday for drinks," he said. The woman left the firm after only a few months, he said. 
TELECOMMUTERS who work far from their company's headquarters say their travel to the office, when necessary, can be exhausting. Ron Langer, director of languages at the Fujitsu Software Corporation in San Jose, Calif., dreads making the bimonthly trek from his home office in Bend, Ore., to the company's headquarters for project meetings. "I feel like I'm on a plane an awful lot," said Mr. Langer, 43, a father of two daughters, who chose to telecommute two years ago so he could move to a less expensive area and spend more time with his family.
Work hours can be another variable. Denise B. Benz, 41, a partner in the West Conshohocken, Pa., office of Cozen & O'Connor, has been with that law firm for more than 14 years but decided to work a three-quarters schedule six years ago, shortly after her second child turned 1 year old. But Mrs. Benz still finds herself working many more hours when she is involved in a trial. Two years ago, when she was handling a major insurance case, she spent four months working full time to prepare; then she had to spend two and a half months in a courtroom in St. Louis litigating the case. 
"When I'm on trial, a flexible schedule doesn't work," she said. To make up for the extra hours, Mrs. Benz often takes days off during slower periods, and her firm also compensates her with extra pay. "You've got to be flexible, especially in my job," she said. "I could be sitting at home with my daughters and all of a sudden a motion comes down and all of my plans for the next two weeks go out the window." 
Mrs. Keenan, the human resources director for Household International, finds herself working, on average, about 30 hours a week even though she is supposed to work only 24. "At my level, you can't expect to just get up and leave the office if there's work that still needs to be done," she said.
Administrators of flexible programs also say that employees who work reduced hours, while still promotable, may experience a slower climb up the career ladder. 
"We want to make sure that those lawyers who are working reduced schedules aren't taken off the partner track," said Elaine Rinaldi, the hiring partner at Cozen & O'Connor, where 30 of the firm's 430 lawyers are on flexible work schedules. Still, Ms. Rinaldi said, those working reduced schedules will have a longer wait for partner status than those who work full time. "It wouldn't be fair to put part-timers on the same track as full-timers," she said.
Other managers say they would be happy to promote workers on flexible schedules -- as long as they agree to return to the office full time. "We look at job-sharing as a temporary situation for people," said Colin Kelly, senior vice president of administration at Household. "In most cases, if such an employee wants to move to a higher-level position, they'll have to go full time."
In the Catalyst study, more than half of the women said they had felt pressure at some point from their superiors to return to work full time.
Despite the challenges, many workers say flexible benefits give them the balance they need. Mr. Langer says that since he began telecommuting, he has been able to have breakfast and dinner with his family every day -- something he rarely did when he worked in Fujitsu's home office.
Mrs. Benz has no regrets, either. "Could I be advancing even higher in my firm if I was working full time? Probably," she said. "But working flextime means that if my daughter has a violin concert in the middle of the day, I can go to it. To me that's much more important."

Staying in the Loop, Without a Loss
DO you wish that you could work from home or cut back your hours? Workplace experts offered these tips for keeping a career on track while taking advantage of flexible benefits:
* Keep the lines of communication open. Confer with your manager about how to handle your workload. Seek regular feedback on job performance, and make career goals clear. 
* Take the initiative. Don't focus only on your daily work. Look for opportunities to build relationships with colleagues, to receive more training and to take on new projects.
* Be flexible. On a day off, be prepared to return phone calls to clients or to come in to work if necessary. 
* Be patient. If you're working half-time, it could take twice as long to advance. Don't be discouraged when full-time colleagues move up the ladder at a quicker pace.

With or Without a Recession, Profits Are Under Threat

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
DON'T let the Federal Reserve's rate cut on Jan. 3 -- and the expectation of more to come -- take your eye off corporate earnings. They could drive the market until investors are assured that the central bank has rescued the slumping economy.
 Now, with your focus in the right place, please contemplate a decline in corporate profits. That's right, a decline in earnings, not a slowdown in earnings growth, which corporate America has already had. 
 But don't blink. The outlook for the economy and corporate earnings has been deteriorating rapidly. Just three weeks ago, Merrill Lynch predicted 5 percent growth this year in the operating earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500. That projection is now down to zero growth, with actual profit declines of 3.4 percent in the first quarter and 5.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier.
Yet there is no recession in Merrill's forecast, a point that the chief economist, Bruce Steinberg, emphasized when he issued his revision last week. "Several of our competitors have introduced recession forecasts," he wrote, calling them "dramatic." But, he added, "we don't agree."
Still, he said, "it certainly feels like a recession to many companies whose earnings will decline."
Two competitors who have jumped into the recession camp are Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, and Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Mr. Barbera says he believes that a recession began in the fourth quarter of last year. Mr. Berner thinks that the recession will show up in the first two quarters of this year. Both think that earnings will be hammered.
Mr. Barbera is predicting that S.& P. profits will fall 7 to 10 percent in the first half of 2001, compared with last year. He bases this forecast on historical comparisons of how changes in the economy's growth rate affect profits. Under his forecast, nominal economic growth, which is not adjusted for inflation, will be 5.4 percentage points slower in the first half of 2001 than it was in 2000. "That is a disaster for profits," he said.
Mr. Berner is also focusing on the magnitude and swiftness of the economic slowdown. "Changes in growth rates rather than the absolute depth of the contraction may be a better way to judge the severity of this downturn," he said. Based on his outlook, the size and speed of the decline in growth -- all since the end of June -- will probably make this economic contraction as painful as a typical recession, even if it ends quickly. Not the worst recession, mind you, just a normal one. But even normal recessions have never been good for corporate profits.
He measures the downturn in earnings with the broader corporate profits calculation in the government's report on the gross domestic product. This profits gauge, after taxes, will decline 8.5 percent in 2001, compared with last year, he says.
The last four months of 2000 were so unpleasant for the stock market because many investors had misjudged how much corporate earnings would slow once the Fed successfully curbed economic growth. It took months of corporate earnings warnings before the message got through. Now investors have to adjust to the prospect of a recession-induced earnings decline.
While Mr. Barbera and Mr. Berner, and the few others in the recession camp, are still in the minority, the majority is moving in their direction. With a recession, popularly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline, Mr. Berner forecasts that total growth will be 1.1 percent, year over year, in 2001. Among economists, the January consensus forecast compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is now down to 2.6 percent growth for 2001, from 3.4 percent in November. Randell Moore, the newsletter's editor, said contributors were already cutting their forecasts further, so the consensus number will fall again in the February survey.
As the Merrill Lynch forecast shows, it won't take an actual recession to produce several quarters of earnings declines that could rattle investors anew.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Bernard F. Myszkowski And Thomas J. Marthaler; 
Alleghany/Chicago Trust Balanced Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
IN New York, the Subway Series produced loud arguments last fall between fans of the Yankees and the Mets. In Chicago, such disagreements are everyday events for the fund managers Bernard F. Myszkowski and Thomas J. Marthaler, who debate nonstop the relative merits of the Cubs and the White Sox. 
 "We have one optimist and one realist," said Mr. Myszkowski, the Cubs fan. But Mr. Marthaler quickly interrupted, "You have to decide which is which." 
 But they are on common ground when the discussion turns to the $283 million Alleghany/Chicago Trust Balanced fund, which invests in a mix of stocks and bonds. With the exception of a one-year hiatus that ended in 1999, Mr. Myszkowski, 55, has run the stock portion since September 1987, when it was a pension and profit-sharing account; it was converted into a mutual fund in 1995. Mr. Marthaler, 41, has run the bond portion since January 1998.
Together, the two managers have earned a few pennants. The fund returned 15 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 8.2 percent for the domestic hybrid fund group, according to Morningstar Inc.
The managers examine long-term trends during quarterly investment committee meetings to decide how to divide the fund. Using a computer model that balances risk and expected returns, they typically put about 60 percent of the portfolio into stocks, 35 percent into bonds and the rest into cash. The allocation has been relatively stable for five years.
Both managers use a bottom-up process in choosing investments, picking individual securities, rather than groups, based on companies' long-term outlooks. The fund's annual turnover rate is just 30 percent.
For stocks, Mr. Myszkowski said, "we look for high-quality companies using strong fundamental research, with strict risk control and diversification." He starts by using a computer to select American companies with market capitalizations of more than $3 billion whose five-year growth in revenue, earnings per share and operating income all exceed the average of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. He says he also wants companies to beat the index in earnings consistency (as measured by standard deviation) and in 12-month return on equity, a ratio of profits to company value. 
Mr. Myszkowski works with four industry analysts to research the 250 to 300 companies on the resulting list to come up with the 35 to 40 stocks in the fund. They try to determine whether the companies can continue their good historical growth.
"Our companies have got to have earnings, which leaves us out of a lot of I.P.O.'s and dot-coms," he said. "That's why we didn't get caught in a lot of the dot-com craziness over the last couple of years."
The analysts visit companies, talk to customers, suppliers and distributors, and read research. Management experience and expertise are crucial. "Our main question is, 'What's the strategic vision that guides these people?' " Mr. Myszkowski said.
They use the information to project quarterly earnings and revenue for two years, pitching their ideas to a committee of four people who meet twice a week.
To gauge valuation, Mr. Myszkowski looks at the ratio of a company's price-to-earnings multiple to its earnings growth rate; a company with a multiple of 30 and growth of 15 percent a year would have a ratio of 2. The lower the ratio, the better. The companies in the stock portion of the portfolio sell for an average ratio of 1.2 times projected annual earnings growth over two years, versus a ratio of 2.7 for the S.& P. 500. "We pay about half of what you would pay for a unit of growth for the average S.& P. 500 stock," he said.
BY contrast, Mr. Marthaler uses no computer screens to pick the 60 or so bond investments. His portion of the fund is divided among corporate bonds (40 percent) and mortgage-backed and government issues (30 percent each).
He works with a group of four analysts, who meet twice a week to pitch issues that they believe can exceed the return of the Lehman Aggregate Bond index at least 75 percent of the time -- and with less risk. Over all, the bond portion of the fund yields 7.25 percent, compared with 6.4 percent for the index.
Based on talks with company management, Wall Street research and credit agency reports, the bond group devises its projections. "A lot of Wall Street information is very macro-driven, so it doesn't do a good job of analyzing geographic and demographic factors," Mr. Mar thaler said. "When interest rates change, the impact is different in different parts of the country."
He also weighs expectations for interest rates and the economy. Right now, he said, "we think a soft landing is more likely than a recession."
In the stock portion of the fund, Mr. Myszkowski bought shares of Starbucks, the coffee chain, at $40 in October. "We think it's the emergence of a global brand name," he said, "and they're leveraging the Starbucks name" into new products like teas and into new channels like restaurants and airlines. On Friday, the stock closed at $44.75.
Another favorite is Firstar, a Milwaukee-based bank created by the mergers of several regional banks. Its merger with U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis is expected to close by midyear. 
Mr. Myszkowski bought shares in December at $20, a low price that reflects most risks of the coming merger, he said. Firstar's management team is excellent, he said, and the company does not have many problems, like foreign loan exposure, that affect even larger banks. The stock now trades at $23.06.
On the bond side, Mr. Marthaler likes the 4 percent convertible subordinated debentures, or bonds convertible into stock, issued by Waste Management of Houston. The bonds, yielding 10.1 percent and maturing in 2002, financed acquisitions during the mid-1990's.
When Waste Management announced in January that it would sell some operations and use the proceeds to pay down debt, Wall Street's relief pushed the price to $89.25, when Mr. Marthaler made his purchase, from the mid-80's in November. The company has resolved accounting problems, he said, and stabilized profit margins, while new management has reduced the company's risks. The debentures closed on Friday at $96.375.

HEADLINE: A Woman's Status In European Life 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Europe's Demographic Time Bomb" (editorial, Jan. 7): 
 European leaders concerned about declining work forces have several options. 
They can accept more immigrants, as you point out. They can also adapt their social security systems to changed working ages for both young and old.
Or they can ease women's labor in family and child care.
Significantly, the countries most worried about low birthrates -- Spain, Italy and Russia -- are also among those where women are still expected to shoulder that load with little help from either society or their menfolk. Where women's status in every way approaches that of men, fertility rates most nearly approach the sustainable population "replacement" level.

HEADLINE: Work First, Invest Later? Not These Days; 
To Be Old, Gifted and Employed Is No Longer Rare

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
EACH morning, F. William Sunderman arrives at work at 8 at the Institute for Clinical Science at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He edits a medical journal and brags that he keeps two secretaries busy.
 "If I didn't do this, what else would I do?" he asked. "I'd just twiddle my thumbs." 
 Assuredly, Dr. Sunderman is an exquisitely accomplished man. He has four doctorates, if you count the honorary one; he developed the method for measuring glucose in the blood, the Sunderman Sugar Tube, and he thinks that he may have been the first doctor to use insulin to bring a patient out of a diabetic coma. He worked as a medical researcher in secrecy to protect workers' health during the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. 
Two years ago, he played his violin, a 1694 Stradivarius, with a string quartet -- in celebration of his 100th birthday.
This go-getting Methuselah is not alone. In Battle Creek, Mich., John F. Mally, 92, puts in 40 hours a week as an efficiency expert at a plant making steel strings for guitars and banjos. In Los Angeles, Robert Eisenberg, 102, works at a zipper factory where he makes sales calls -- and worries mightily about cheap imports.
In the little town of North, S.C., Mario D. Fogel, 95, still cuts hair at the barbershop he opened in 1925. In Santa Claus, Ind., Frieda Foretsch, 90, the greenhouse manager at the Holiday World amusement park, has 400 geraniums and 500 ferns ready to plant as soon as the weather warms up.
And at a sandstone quarry in Carroll County, Va., Walter Burnette, a comparative youngster at 89, maneuvers a power shovel for eight bumpy, grinding hours a day. "About everything I've learned is that you ought to keep working and do everything you can and you'll stay a lot younger," he said.
The number of very, very old workers is growing, largely because of the blazing demand for labor in recent years and the stunning growth in the number of older people. When the United States was born, one of every 40 people was over 65. Today, one in seven is, and by 2030 one in four will be, the Census Bureau has predicted. Older people today are also healthier, on average, making it easier for them to keep working.
While longevity makes it possible for more older workers to stay on the job, it also makes it more necessary. As the number of people over 65 climbs -- by the middle of the century, they are forecast to outnumber people under 18 for the first time -- younger people will be hard-pressed to support them through payments into pension and Social Security systems. That shift may also mean greater need for skilled workers, making it necessary for older people to work. Many employers are already recruiting the elderly.
"The fact is that we are living longer, healthier lives," said Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb, a federal program to train older workers.
The Census Bureau says that from 1900 to 2000, the number of people 85 and over grew tenfold, to four million, while the overall population grew less than fourfold. The bureau projects that the 85-and-over population will exceed 13 million by 2040. The number of centenarians is expected to grow to more than 834,000, from just 63,000 in 1900.
And there is growing evidence that people already plan to work longer: a 1998 poll by AARP showed that 80 percent of baby boomers, those born between 1946 and 1964, planned to work past the age of 65. People already past that traditional retirement age are the vanguard. The percentage of people 70 to 74 who are in the work force or looking for work rose to 13.5 percent last year, from 11.3 percent in 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; the figure for those aged 75 and older climbed to 5.3 percent from 4.3 percent a decade ago.
A significant change in attitude toward retirement seems to be afoot. During the postwar years, retirement became enshrined as the pot of gold at the end of everyone's rainbow. Social Security and private pensions grew inexorably, as did the value of the family house. Del Webb, the builder of retirement communities, coined the term "the golden years."
Some experts argue that the double whammy of prosperity and a deeply embedded belief in retirement may be impossible to change, except for those blessed with very satisfying careers. "Provided they can afford to retire and pursue activities, these individuals will retire," wrote Dora L. Costa, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the November issue of Participant, a magazine published by TIAA-CREF Mutual Funds.
Others suggest that the future is not so clear-cut. Whether out of economic necessity or intellectual curiosity, an increasing number of older workers are remaining in the work force, at least part-time. A telltale signal is that the Del Webb Corporation now routinely offers home offices in the retirement communities it builds. And in a measure of willingness to embrace new technology, people over 65 are the fastest-growing group of Internet users, according to a September report by eMarketer, an Internet research company.
ADDING momentum to the possibility of later, more productive retirements are the growing willingness of employers to hire older workers, especially for service jobs, and the removal of certain disincentives. Last year, for example, Social Security rules were changed to stop financially penalizing 65- to 69-year-olds for continuing to work.
But retirement is only half of an increasingly unbalanced equation in the labor market. Baby boomers represent a huge bubble moving up the age chart, and there may simply not be enough young people to support them in retirements that could last almost as long as what were formerly considered normal working lives. The ratio of Americans aged 20 to 64 to those older than 64 was 16.5 to 1 in 1950. It is now 3.3 to 1, and Social Security's trustees estimate that it will decline to about 2 to 1 by 2030.
"Clearly, we can take care of greatly disabled senior citizens, but the idea that most are not able to do a lot of work is not really on," said Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank, who was commerce secretary in the Nixon administration. Mr. Peterson, 74, has written and spoken extensively on the dangers of a coming demographic crunch.
And fewer older people are unable to work. The proportion of Americans 65 or older with a chronic disability declined to 21 percent in 1994 from 24 percent in 1982, according to the National Long-Term Care Survey.
OF perhaps crucial importance, there are signs that employers like older workers. Companies like Wal-Mart Stores, McDonald's and the CVS drugstore chain have made concerted efforts to hire them.
Moreover, a Harris poll last year of 774 corporate human resource directors showed 80 percent agreeing that older workers (aged 55 and up) had less turnover, and 71 percent saying these workers had as much ability as younger ones to acquire new skills.
But William K. Zinke, president of Human Resource Services, the Boulder, Colo., firm that commissioned the poll, said that there was a "remarkable disconnect" between the professionals' responses and many companies' behavior. The reason is age discrimination, which has become the biggest complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A common example, Mr. Zinke said, is companies' unwillingness to offer training to older workers.
To draw attention to the value of older workers, Green Thumb, which is named for its early efforts to help Lady Bird Johnson beautify the nation's roadsides, annually picks an older worker for special recognition.
The winners, by anyone's definition, have been as impressive as their ages. Most say they typify nothing more than the stubborn streak of just keeping on keeping on. But given current trends and future needs, they may well be guides to what lies ahead.
MR. EISENBERG, the Los Angeles zipper manufacturer, was the honoree last year. As a young soldier during World War I, he was about to ship out to Europe when the armistice was declared. As a silk dealer in Manhattan, he reveled in the Roaring Twenties, but lost all he had, $100,000, in the market crash of 1929. He moved to Los Angeles after World War II, in which his only son, Marc, was killed. He and a partner established a garment trim company in the early 1950's; he retired at 72.
Golf and traveling the globe wore thin, and in 1982, at 82, he returned to work, joining his former business partner at Zabin Industries, which cranks out 16,000 zippers each eight-hour shift. He negotiates with vendors, helps oversee the plant and personally handles a couple of important accounts. He still puts in 20 hours or more a week.
"Robbie is invaluable at work because of what he teaches the younger managers, the kind of knowledge you can't get out of a book," said Alan Faiola, Zabin's president.
Mr. Eisenberg said, "I like that they trust me."
In 1999, Green Thumb named Dr. Sunderman, then 100, as the nation's oldest worker. Born in Altoona, Pa., he was drawn to classical music, but helped finance his education by playing violin in burlesque houses. He collects antique instruments, including the Stradivarius, and has performed in Carnegie Hall.
He describes his accomplishments as "too long to tell" -- and they do fill three pages of the Marquis "Who's Who in America." Among other things, the listings say that he has held faculty positions at nine medical schools and that he served as chief of clinical pathology at the Communicable Disease Center when it was part of the United States Public Health Service in the 1940's.
He works from 8 to 4, and, after quitting driving last year, now has a chauffeur. He complains bitterly about physicians unionizing and medicine losing its professionalism. His view of retirement is shaped by friends who have retired to Florida.
"The first year, they play golf three or four days a week and have a highball before dinner," he said. "The next year, they play twice a week and start having liquor at lunch. Then they forget about golf, become alcoholics and pass away."
Clara Martin of Woodbridge, N.J., minimizes her accomplishment. "I'm just an old lady, that's all," she said. "I'm going to be 93 this year."
She is too modest. This August, she will have worked as a secretary for the same real estate office for 50 years. She can still type nearly 120 words a minute and take dictation at 200; she does the books because she likes to. "I can look at rows of figures, eight across and seven down, and know there's a mistake," she said.
She lives in a retirement community with her daughter Marie, who is retired from her job as a school psychologist. The two crochet hats and scarves for the needy. (Mrs. Martin recalls knitting socks for World War I soldiers when she was 10.) She likes the independence of bringing home a paycheck, although like almost all of the much-older workers, she does not need the money. "There's nothing in terms of outerwear or underwear that I need," as she put it.
When her office got computers a dozen years ago, Mrs. Martin was told she was too old to learn to use them. She promptly enrolled in a computer course at a local college for the sole reason of proving to herself that she could do it. "I may have been the oldest student in the class, but I was also the smartest," she said.
To this day, she said she still refused to use a computer at work because of the initial insult. But she says she is cheerful about it. "If you can't laugh," she added, "what's life about?"
Maybe a good haircut. Mr. Fogel gave his first one at 11, and opened his own shop in 1925. Haircuts then cost 35 cents and shaves 20 cents. These days, haircuts go for $9 and nobody has asked for a shave in years. If they did, it would be $1.50. Another change is that people no longer have time to gab away afternoons in barbershops.
Mr. Fogel did not teach his three sons to cut hair. They all went to college; he paid tuition with calves produced each spring by his 50 head of cattle. The problem these days is that too many people forget that the old barber is still around. He gets maybe 10 customers a day, but figures that he could easily handle 60.
"When I get where I can't cut a good head of hair, that's when I'm going to quit," he said. "I'm not going to quit yet. I ain't but 95."
Clarence Wilcox, 93, lives in Sierra Vista, Ariz., and is the oldest worker in his state, according to Green Thumb. He works 40 hours a week as a civil engineer, but is starting to worry that he may have to give up doing his own surveying. He still does complex math to complete watershed reviews and other engineering tasks, and recently finished fighting the local authorities to have a 200-unit recreational vehicle resort approved.
Mr. Wilcox smokes a pack of Camels a day, and enjoys a half-pint of Bacardi rum before dinner, poured all at once into a large glass. "I attribute my longevity to a combination of the two," he said.
Carley Zell, at 101, does not work as much as he used to. But he still goes to his office in Brunswick, Ga., to oversee his business interests, which include warehouses and real estate. He has been working continuously since he started delivering newspapers at 12.
A colleague recalls going to the airport with him about six years ago, and how Mr. Zell strode past panting 70-year-olds on his way to the gate. "It's entirely too hard to make old people walk that far," the friend recalled him saying in a huff.
Then there is Russell H. Harrell, 92, who works for Sieco, an engineering firm in Columbus, Ind. He started working as a water boy with a road construction crew when he was 16, and ended up as director of the state's highway system. When he began, mules did the hard work. He loved road work, becoming expert at blasting through rock.
"I like the land. I like the rivers. I like the rocks. I like the people," he said.
At 66, he sincerely tried to retire. "I played a little golf, and then I said, 'This is kind of silly,' " he recalled. "I've been used to spending a half a billion dollars a year" as head of the highway system.
He sometimes drives 1,000 miles a week in one of his two Cadillacs and has been known to work 12 hours a day. "My life's been work since I was a kid," he said. "I've had a great life."
SOME older workers come to their callings later in life. Mrs. Foretsch grew tired of staying at home after her daughters left for college. So she began volunteering at Holiday World, as do others in the Santa Claus community. Before long, she applied for the paying job of managing the greenhouse and was soon mothering 3,000 plants. She experiments with plant hybridization and cross-pollination, and has developed her own mixture of potting soil. She designed and made aprons for the crew that sweeps the park, so that they could carry their supplies with them.
"My friends don't ask me to go quilting or to card games anymore," she said. "I just don't have time."
Others just keep right on doing the same thing. Mr. Burnette has been operating a construction shovel for 65 years in his native Virginia. He helped build the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel and the Pentagon. His first job, at the age of 9, was feeding logging horses; his current one is operating a power shovel at a rock quarry. "It's good exercise because you're using your legs and arms all the time," he said.
Other workers once went to the company's safety officer and asked why someone so elderly was operating heavy equipment -- even though he has never had an injury. "He ain't no more apt to have a heart attack than a younger man," the safety officer replied, Mr. Burnette recalled. "And I can't find anybody who would be any safer."
Mr. Burnette, like many of the other older workers, has never smoked or drank. In the summer, he works up to 12 hours a day. He gets up at 3 a.m. to read, most often the encyclopedia. "When you quit work, you've ruined yourself," he said. "You sit around and get old."
Charlotte Haugland, 92, a certified public accountant in Tacoma, Wash., loves her work, too. She does accounting and taxes from her home office for both corporations and individuals. For recreation, she enjoys reading journals on taxation. Another favorite activity is attending the 60 hours of courses needed each year to maintain her C.P.A. license.
"I enjoy that so much," she said. "I'm a listener, not a talker. I know what I know, but I don't know what the other guy knows."
Ms. Haugland figures that she will just keep doing what she's doing. "I've thought about going into assisted living," she said, "but, golly sakes, you're living with all those old people."
Mr. Mally, the efficiency expert, tried to retire four times, but employers keep seeking out his expertise. Among his jobs after he left General Foods was helping the Steinway & Sons piano company in New York develop auditing standards and methods. He cut costs by 15 percent by reducing the number of times a piano under construction was moved.
At his present 40-hour-a-week job at the GHS Corporation of Battle Creek, Mich., which makes strings for guitars and other instruments, he devised a method to reduce scrap by more than 80 percent, saving more than $250,000 a year.
He likes to point out that he was born in 1908, the last year the Chicago Cubs won the World Series; his uncle was the team's batboy. His former doctors and dentists are all dead, but the fascinations of making things more efficient never subside.
"I don't have time to get idle," he said. "It's pretty fast."
FOR some older workers, work has become just about the most permanent thing. "I haven't got a buddy I used to hunt or fish with still alive," said Rhode B. Causey, 96, who has been selling office machines in Little Rock since 1927. "I'm afraid to retire."
Norris C. Hatcher, 94, who had retired from a managerial job at a furniture company after 43 years and "loafed" for six months, took a job in his mid-60's on a furniture company assembly line in Mount Airy, N.C.. "I lost my wife about 25 years ago and I didn't have any hobbies," he said. "That's my hobby -- working."
Clearly, work seems to do more than pay the bills and fill the time. For many of the oldest laborers, it imparts wisdom -- and then gives that wisdom a useful context.
Milton W. Garland was Green Thumb's first honoree as oldest worker, in 1998. He earned 41 patents in his field of refrigeration, was named "Mr. Refrigeration" by his industry and, until last May, worked 20 hours a week evaluating refrigeration patents. He died last July, at 104.

HEADLINE: More And More, We Get Less and . . . 

BYLINE:  By JAMES SCHEMBARI

 BODY:
WE consumers must be a predictable lot. Although we pride ourselves on our shopping savvy, consumer product companies know better. They know we are slaves not to fashion but to price, and the one thing we will not tolerate is when prices rise. If a bottle of aspirin costs $4.49 today, it better cost $4.49 tomorrow. Otherwise, we will abandon it and buy something else, like Fritos.
 So companies have discovered they can fatten their bottom lines by reducing the amount of product in the package while keeping prices the same, a technique they call weight-out. Less product is more profit. 
 Because their eyes are on the price, the companies' magic-act theory goes, consumers won't notice a light-fingered hand sliding cookies out of the bag. And indeed, few of us have noticed as Cracker Jack, bottled water, diapers -- even Fritos -- have experienced weight losses. 
In today's creative business environment, that kind of success should inspire all sorts of copy-catting. If this ploy can work for products that come in a bag, why not for products that don't? Let the Federal Reserve keep cutting interest rates in an attempt to head off an economic slowdown. Companies know the type of cuts that really count.
Airlines, for example, which already use yield management to manipulate ticket prices minute by minute, could, say, sell a New York-San Francisco ticket, but make everybody get off in Phoenix. Want to continue your journey? Then you would have to buy another ticket to San Francisco, which, if the airlines are really clever, would only get you to San Diego. Frustrated travelers who decide to drive the rest of the way can rent a mid-sized car for $80 a day, but the 24-hour day can easily go the way of the 14.5-ounce bag of Doritos (shrinks have long shrunk their hour to 45 minutes). Who says a day has to be so long, anyway? Astronomers? Where are their M.B.A.'s? Anyone who can't get everything done in 19 hours isn't really trying.
At hotels, you could say goodbye to the noon check-out. "It's 9 a.m. Here's your complimentary Continental breakfast. Now get out!" 
Breakfast wouldn't be the same, either. Starbucks might begin putting its grande latte in those pathetic little cups the Italians drink from, the holes in doughnuts could suddenly expand, and while there might still be two scoops of raisins in Raisin Bran, who would be determining the size of the scoop?
Of course, companies would have to be careful that "less is more" doesn't turn against them. Consumers who keep learning to get by with less could eventually discover they really don't need the product after all. Then warehouses would be full of more of all that less.
Still, companies wouldn't be the only ones that could benefit from less is more. States, for example, could raise more transportation funds by squeezing toll plazas closer together and building another plaza or two. New Jersey, whose residents are too wise to fall for that, could instead save money by moving all the toll booths on the southbound New Jersey Turnpike a couple of miles north and giving the last few miles to Delaware to maintain. Heaven knows, Delaware could use the extra land. 
Colleges could graduate students after 3.5 years, FedEx could guarantee delivery by "whenever," not 10 a.m., and dry cleaners will no longer both clean and press. Customers can have one or the other, take your pick. In the auto industry, can three-wheel drive be far behind? Let's not even think what the mortuary industry could do with this. Or health care, which has been warming up to the idea of minimalization for years.
Possibly the only good news here is that maybe our elected officials will shorten their terms. Presidents might serve three years; senators, five. 
Even this newspaper might change. Articles could be a few paragraphs shorter. No more ending with a smart quote from a source summarizing the theme. Instead, we could fill the space with little ads urging people to read this section. Articles would end when we have no more left to say.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Now, 3 Bears: Weak Dollar, Trade Gap And Inflation

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
JUST two years ago, economists were still saying that America had a Goldilocks economy, the consummate combination of low inflation and low unemployment that helped the economy grow swiftly and kept interest rates under control.
 Sounds like ancient history now, with the stock market plunging, economic growth slowing and the incoming Bush administration making preparations for emergency tax cuts. In fact, one of the economists who helped popularize the Goldilocks concept is using another term that has not been heard much since the 1970's. 
 "Stagflation," said Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. "I think it can, and may, come back." 
That combination of high inflation and unemployment and relatively slow economic growth sounds alarmist, even in today's less-rosy economic environment. But Mr. Gordon's reasoning is that the Goldilocks economy was never about the United States economy alone: it was about global contributions to American prosperity. Stagflation, he said, could also be imported.
"So much of what supported the American economy was the perception that this country offered consistently higher rates of return on capital, especially because of our technological leadership," Mr. Gordon said. "The moment you start to see negative returns relative to what people think they can get abroad, then you have a problem."
If the United States does enter a period of economic pain, as economists predict, this country and the new economic team in Washington will most likely have to deal with an inverted set of international economic issues. A weaker dollar, more costly imports, and an outflow of capital could restrain the economy just as a strong dollar, cheap imports and a seemingly endless bounty of foreign capital once unleashed it.
In the 1990's, the alchemy worked like this: with much of the rest of the world lagging behind the United States in growth and innovation, foreign money flooded into this country as foreigners bought American companies and snapped up surging Nasdaq stocks. That helped raise the value of the dollar against other currencies, which made imports cheap without igniting inflation.
The situation has not changed much, but the warning signs are clear. Americans depend so heavily on imports that they spend $1 billion a day more buying from abroad than they earn by selling goods overseas. It's the largest trade deficit relative to the overall economy in recent history.
Global investors will sooner or later decide that they can do better by putting their money in other countries. That would undercut the value of the dollar, make imports more expensive, and fuel inflation even as the economy slows. The key indicator to watch is the value of the dollar.
The dollar has already been weakening steadily against the euro and some other major currencies. It has remained robust against the yen, however, and foreign exchange markets have shown no signs of panic. That means the readjustment could come gradually.
"The decline against the euro is clearly a trend," said Wayne Lyski, who oversees emerging-markets bond funds at Alliance Capital Management. "Our baseline case is for a controlled decline in the dollar."
It seems almost inevitable that the new administration will have to manage a falling dollar just as it grapples with a sluggish economy and a still-gaping trade deficit. No one knows for certain how much those factors will feed on one another. But President-elect George W. Bush's administration is not taking any chances, pronouncing that it favors a resilient dollar.
"The position of this administration will be the same as the Clinton administration," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, designated to be director of Mr. Bush's National Economic Council. "We favor a strong dollar."
Coleman S. Kendall, Mr. Lindsey's former consulting partner at Economic Strategies, says he will be shocked if the administration retreats from the strong-dollar stance. But favoring a strong dollar does not necessarily make it so. "I think you can also imagine that speculators are going to test them to see whether they just acquiesce," Mr. Kendall said.
Policy makers can do only so much to control such trends, especially in the multitrillion-dollar foreign exchange market. Mr. Gordon of Northwestern asserts that the Clinton administration benefited from an "extraordinary coincidence" of favorable factors that kept the dollar strong even as investment flowed in. The Bush team could also face an extraordinary coincidence.
"All of these things could go into reverse," Mr. Gordon said, "and leave them with a set of dismal choices."

Electric Blues in La-La Land: Don't Blame Deregulation

BYLINE:  By VIRGINIA POSTREL; Virginia Postrel is editor at large of Reason magazine and the author of "The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress."

 BODY:
CALIFORNIANS are facing electricity blackouts, and the state's investor-owned utilities warned they are about to go bankrupt. Electricity-dependent industries, notably in Silicon Valley, are scrambling to buy generators. Consumers are up in arms over rising prices and disrupted service.
 How did something as basic, and previously reliable, as electricity become such a problem? The shorthand answer is "deregulation." 
 "We have lost control over our own power," declared Gov. Gray Davis in his State of the State address last week. "We have surrendered the decisions about where electricity is sold -- and for how much -- to private companies with only one objective: maximizing unheard-of profits." Railing against "out-of-state profiteers," the governor warned he might seize power plants by eminent domain.
Mr. Gray's oratory marked a sharp departure from his image as a careful, even boring, moderate. But it was in keeping with much of the initial reaction to the California crisis. In a typical take, Robert Scheer, a liberal columnist for The Los Angeles Times, declared the mess a sign that "capitalism is falling apart."
Not so fast, say economists and advocates of open markets. 
"Calling the California electricity market 'deregulated' completely changes the meaning of the term," says Clifford Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution. California changed its regulatory scheme, he said. It didn't free its electricity market.
Though it was called deregulation, the bill the legislature passed in 1996 was the size of a city phone directory, according to a report at the time, and it was extremely complex. 
The law cut consumer rates by 10 percent and established future price caps. It made utilities sell their power plants. It dictated that electricity be bought and sold only in a single spot market. And it banned all separately negotiated contracts, including long-term deals for lower prices, between power producers and utilities.
In a 1993 journal article, Dr. Winston defined deregulation as "the state's withdrawal of its legal powers to direct the economic conduct (pricing, entry, and exit) of nongovernmental bodies." By that measure, the California scheme doesn't even come close, he says. Neither, he says, do recent efforts to overhaul telecommunications regulation.
FAR from deregulating, California's new regime evokes the regulatory mindset of the "rational reformers" of the early 20th century.
Amid rapid technological and business evolution, they promised "kinetic change made stable," writes John M. Jordan, a historian, in his book "Machine-Age Ideology: Social Engineering and American Liberalism, 1911-1939" (University of North Carolina, 1994). Controlling economic transactions through technocratic oversight rather than unpredictable markets was the primary means to that goal.
SIMILARLY, Steve Peace, the Democratic state senator who pushed the utility bill through the California legislature, declared when it passed that the goal was to "bring stability to the system," while lowering costs for all consumers. 
He wanted, he said, to avoid the "kind of horror stories we saw in the telecommunications restructuring" -- the breakup of Ma Bell -- "where it took 20 years to make the transition and there were a lot of dislocations that occurred in the process."
This emphasis on stability and predictability is incompatible with real deregulation, since unregulated markets inevitably bring surprises, good and bad. No one knew the airlines would develop hub-and-spoke systems (which offer more destinations, but inconvenience some travelers) or frequent flier programs. No one anticipated the way trucking deregulation would combine with precision-timed inventory practices and other logistical innovations to revolutionize the flow of goods. 
Trucking and airline deregulation (with the exception of landing-slot controls) pass Dr. Winston's test. In those cases, the government really did get out of the market.
Veterans of those deregulations say one sign California's power plan wasn't the real thing was that it assumed knowledge of the future. "When they did this thing in California, they were thinking that they were in this world that would stretch out to infinity of falling prices," says Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute and administrator of regulatory affairs at the Office of Management and Budget during the Reagan administration. Capping consumer prices looked like "a sop that wouldn't make much difference," he says. But when demand for power rose sharply as supplies fell, that cap "made all the difference in the world."
True deregulation is rare for the same reason that the rational reformers almost never achieved truly disinterested technocracy. Political pressures inevitably intervene. The earlier reformers learned from experience, writes Dr. Jordan, that "there was no 'superpolitical' place to escape the logic of politics." 
And economists who have worked to deregulate industries note that there is always a struggle with advocates who want to turn "deregulation" into a more beneficial form of regulation.
Californians, though some of them may not realize it, are now learning that lesson the hard way.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Powell Gives Africa a Hard New Look

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AFTER almost a decade of much fuss about Africa by the Clinton administration but little to show for it, Gen. Colin L. Powell seems to believe there is room for improvement. He chose the Africa bureau as his first stop during his get-acquainted tour of the State Department, an interesting signal by the first African-American secretary of state-designate and a man best known for his hard-nosed military doctrine and sense of realpolitik.
 In sub-Saharan Africa itself, where most countries have seen things go from bad to worse in the last decade, and where leaders and intellectuals look at the West with increased mistrust, the signal was noted with a mix of cynicism and expectation. 
 According to one school of thought, perhaps General Powell is looking to build a domestic constituency among African-Americans for a future bid for political office. Alternatively, said others, perhaps he is serious about setting a new course for American diplomacy that would do more than produce grand visitations by presidents (Clinton twice) and secretaries of state (Madeleine Albright three times). With their presence in refugee camps and AIDS clinics, Mr. Clinton and Dr. Albright put Africa on the map of American concerns. But their visits, however strong on missionary idealism, seemed weak on developing the kind of state-to-state relationships that might produce real results. 
Under General Powell, the tone of the American relationship with Africa -- as with much of the world -- will almost certainly be overhauled. The specifics are not yet clear, but there are some tantalizing clues.
While the general has not spoken publicly about Africa as secretary-designate, one American diplomat in Africa said he leans toward the following theme: "Forget the rhetoric and boost the geopolitics." The diplomat contrasted this with the typical Clinton approach: "The United States is deeply concerned over the resumption of fighting in (blank)" -- whether the sentence was finished by the Horn of Africa in the east, Congo in central Africa, or Sierra Leone in the west. Instead, the diplomat said, the general is likely to seek a clear definition of national interests and to then use the relationships with Congress he built up as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to secure resources.
During his session with the Africa bureau, for example, General Powell listened politely to a briefing that covered AIDS, aid, conflicts, economics, trade and the smuggling of drugs and guns.
At one point, the general asked crisply: What about Nigeria and South Africa? These are the two powerhouses of the continent, large in size, rich in resources and situated like two anchors astride wars, poverty and disease. Both are democracies under stress: Nigeria, which has swung between military dictatorships and civilian leadership, is in a democratic phase but is deeply troubled by corruption and growing income disparity; South Africa is in economic doldrums.
In singling them out, General Powell was touching on two countries that could do more to bolster peacekeeping missions, which are in constant demand in Africa but which the United Nations finds difficult to staff and the United States doesn't want to join. But the armies of both nations need repair and help. 
One approach that might suit General Powell would be to send more American military assistance to these two governments to improve their peacekeeping abilities. The Clinton administration has just finished training two Nigerian battalions whose soldiers are supposed to go to Sierra Leone. But Congressional aides, who are enthusiastic about using Nigerian forces there, complain that the American training has been too meager.
IN pointing to Nigeria, General Powell was also recognizing a vital American interest: oil. Little is said about it, but Nigeria and Angola have become important suppliers of oil. Nigeria now is the United States' fifth biggest supplier, Angola the eighth. Their oil is highly desirable light sweet crude, and it is in offshore fields, making it relatively easy to drill for the major companies like Chevron. 
But the unstable political environments in both countries could produce a headache for the oil companies and an embarrassment for Washington. So, however much he is inclined to focus on realpolitik, General Powell may at some point have to weigh in on the question of how those countries govern themselves.
General Powell is not without advice as he considers Africa. In a stark paper for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Marina Ottaway, a senior associate, recommended more modest goals than the Clinton administration had. "Given the magnitude of the problems, the goals have been too far-reaching and the resources too inadequate to attain them," she wrote. The Clinton administration, she said, tried to pursue a "grand vision of what the continent should become rather than developing a policy to address in a realistic manner the problems that exist now." Some of her suggestions for the new administration: cancel bilateral debt and push international financial institutions to do the same; don't try to solve every African conflict, and when you do fashion a peace accord do not make it dependent on peacekeepers, who are in short supply. 
Even more basic advice came from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The director of its Africa program, J. Stephen Morrison, recommends beefing up the quality and quantity of American diplomats who deal with Africa. Even as the Clinton administration was paying so much attention to Africa, scores of positions in embassies and in the Africa bureau itself remained vacant, he said. In Angola, he pointed out, American diplomats work out of a trailer. Given General Powell's presumed power of persuasion in Congress, one place he could start would be to ask for money to put behind any new Africa policy.

Oil Abounds, Misery Too: A Case Study

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG 

 BODY:
EIGHT years ago, the United States established its first embassy in Angola's crumbling capital, Luanda, and erected a small bronze monument to mark the occasion. Coming after nearly a decade of cold war hostilities, the modest gesture ushered in an extraordinary new relationship.
 Today, the United States, which was spending some $60 million annually to arm Angola's rebel group, known as Unita, in the late 1980's, is the Angolan government's most powerful ally and the country's biggest investor. And Angola is America's eighth largest supplier of oil. Instead of bankrolling rebel tanks and AK-47's, Americans now spend millions of dollars on aid intended to relieve suffering -- and on the government's vast offshore oil fields. 
 Africa watchers say the attention, particularly to the oil sector, is likely to continue under the Bush administration as oil prices rise and demand for energy surges. Vice President-elect Dick Cheney ran the Halliburton Company, a multinational energy corporation. Condoleezza Rice, the pick for national security adviser, sat on the board of the Chevron Corporation. Both oil companies have significant interests in Angola.
So why aren't the Angolans cheering? 
The restive population is beginning to wonder how much the public has actually benefited from one of the most intense relationships between a sub-Saharan African nation and the world's remaining superpower. The answer, unfortunately, is not very much. 
Sixteen years after the United States began supplying annual military aid to the rebels (it agreed to end it in 1991 with the withdrawal of Cuban support for the government), most Angolans still live in desperate poverty in a country plagued by corruption, human rights violations and seemingly endless civil war.
In recent months, some human rights activists have praised the United States and the International Monetary Fund for quietly pressing the Angolan government to reduce poverty, to repair shattered infrastructure, to rescue the collapsing health and school systems and to respect press freedoms. 
For the first time, the government has also agreed to allow outside auditors to examine how it spends its enormous oil revenues, which critics allege have often ended up lining officials' pockets. If the government keeps its commitments, it may actually have a shot at winning low-interest loans from the I.M.F.
But in Angola, broken promises are as plentiful as the country's vast offshore oil reserves. And America's choice of quiet diplomacy instead of sharp, public condemnation of corruption and human rights abuses has prompted priests, journalists and academics to argue that American officials are as blinded by economic interests today as they once were by the cold war. 
And so, while other African countries cry out for Western investment and attention, some Angolans are warning that such attention is not always a blessing.
"The Angolan government and Unita have benefited from the relationship with the United States, but the Angolan people have yet to benefit," said Rafael Marques, a prominent Angolan human rights activist and journalist who was jailed for criticizing the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and whose passport was confiscated last month when he tried to attend a conference in South Africa.
On a policy level, however, much has changed. And in many ways, the changing relationship with Angola reflects how dramatically American policy toward Africa has shifted since the end of the cold war.
In 1985, when the Soviet Union and the United States were waging proxy battles across sub-Saharan Africa, Sudan, Somalia and Liberia topped the list of America's direct aid recipients. None had a democratic government. Today the leading recipients are all democracies -- Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The Angolan rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, who abandoned two peace accords in 10 years, are pariahs.
And in official statements last year, the State Department made a point of prodding Angola toward democracy, criticizing its government for arresting and trying outspoken writers like Mr. Marques.
BUT even architects of America's Africa policy find it hard to say exactly how American engagement with Angola has benefited ordinary people in recent years.
"The question of: Have Angolans benefited at all from the last seven years in the process that's unfolded -- that's a hard question," said J. Stephen Morrison, who left the State Department's policy planning staff last year after four years of working on Africa policy. 
"I don't think there's hard and fast proof that it has paid off yet," said Mr. Morrison, who directs the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "I think what we've done in the past few years is a defensible approach in an exceptionally difficult situation. We will only know in time whether this kind of engagement can deliver results."
Mr. Morrison says America's oil interests in Angola do not play a primary role in policy making. But there is no doubt that the United States will become increasingly dependent on West Africa for energy. In a December report, the Central Intelligence Agency predicted that by 2015 North America will import 25 percent of its oil from West Africa (up from 16 percent now), but that it was unlikely that the oil riches would benefit the people of West Africa.
"The pattern of oil wealth fostering corruption rather than economic development will continue," the C.I.A. report said.

Americans (a)Love (b)Hate Immigrants

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THE case of Linda Chavez illustrates the conflicting impulses, some say hypocrisy, many Americans face in dealing with illegal immigrants -- indeed with the whole subject of immigration -- today.
 Ms. Chavez, who withdrew from consideration to be Secretary of Labor last week following reports that an illegal immigrant lived and did some chores in her home in the early 1990's, said she was just helping a frightened woman in need. But she has also called for tightening the nation's borders against illegal aliens. 
 Under the politicized klieg lights of a presidential transition, it seemed a jarring combination of attitudes. But it is a combination remarkably typical of the way many Americans feel -- or at least act. Whether out of kindness or economic necessity, they look the other way when it comes to checking the legal status of immigrants in their daily lives, even as they encourage in principle government efforts to crack down on immigrants who enter the country illegally.
Especially in today's tight labor market, America can't function without immigrants -- and there aren't enough legal ones -- from its agricultural fields to Silicon Valley to the apartments and houses where nannies care for their children and clean their homes. 
"The conflict is between the traditions of America as a nation of laws and as a nation of immigrants," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a pro-immigration coalition. Put another way, Mr. Sharry said, "If illegal immigrants are so scary, why do America's mothers turn our children over to them every day?" 
About 800,000 immigrants enter the country legally each year. An estimated 300,000 enter illegally or overstay their visas. For the first time since the 1930's, one of 10 Americans is foreign born. 
Immigrants are increasingly coveted by corporate America; were the nation's estimated six million illegal immigrants expelled tomorrow, thousands of hotels, restaurants, meat-packing plants, landscaping companies and garment factories would likely close. At the other end of the salary spectrum, high-tech employers persuaded a Republican Congress last year to nearly double the quota for high-skilled immigrants, to 195,000. 
And society grapples with conflicting impulses about immigrants every day. Illegal immigrants' children may attend public school, but even the brightest among them are ineligible for public loans for college. In Arizona, armed ranchers patrol the border to stop immigrants from crossing the desert and entering illegally, while other landowners leave food and water along the route for the weary heading north. 
Employers face penalties if they hire undocumented workers, but many do so anyway, knowing they will lose out to competitors if they can't fill the jobs that most legal residents won't take. 
"We are encouraging a hypocrisy," said Senator Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican. "At the border we arrest, but once they get here everyone opens their arms and says we've got a job for you." 
This political ambivalence is rooted in personal ambivalence. As Ms. Chavez wrote in 1994: "So long as they stay out of trouble once they're here, most Americans ignore illegal aliens. I've yet to see a customer walk out of a restaurant because his dishes were being washed by an illegal alien." 
And unless you are nominated for a top Government job -- particularly enforcing the nation's labor laws, as Ms. Chavez was -- immigration experts say chances are good that hiring illegal immigrants will go unpunished. (That, of course, raises other concerns about employers exploiting undocumented workers.) 
Not long ago immigrants faced a political firestorm. In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson of California was re-elected on the back of Proposition 187, which barred illegal immigrants' children from public schools. In 1996, Congress approved harsh bills that barred hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants from receiving food stamps and federal disability assistance. Another required the deportation of legal aliens convicted of a variety of offenses, some of them minor, and made the statute retroactive.
Attitudes have softened since then. The big difference now, of course, is the strong economy. In California, for example, at least half the 40,000 workers who harvest the state's raisin crop are undocumented, said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. 
"In a growing economy, people are looking for low-cost labor with no questions asked," said Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes increased immigration. 
IN a Gallup poll last September, 44 percent of the respondents said immigrants mostly help the economy, while 40 percent said they mostly hurt. Asked the same question in July 1993, 26 percent said immigrants helped and 64 percent said they hurt. 
For years, American unions viewed immigrants with suspicion. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. saw them as a threat to jobs and wage levels. But last February, it called for a blanket amnesty for all illegal workers, arguing that in boom times, immigrants were potential members.
Both political parties have scrambled to woo foreign-born voters. The election of George W. Bush marked the ascension of the pro-immigrant wing of the Republican party, which still has powerful anti-immigrant critics. Mr. Bush speaks conversational Spanish, has a Mexican-born sister-in-law, and ran a parallel Spanish-language operation during his campaign. "New Americans are not to be feared as strangers; they are to be welcomed as neighbors," he told a Hispanic group last June.
After all that, Mr. Bush drew 31 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared to 21 percent for Mr. Dole in 1996. But he still fell a few points short of what Ronald Reagan drew among Hispanics in 1980 and 1984, and barely nosed out his father, President George Bush, who registered 30 percent in 1988. 
The issue's political sensitivity surfaced in the debate over Ms. Chavez's selection. The situation echoed that of President Clinton's first nominee for attorney general, Zoe Baird, whose appointment was sidetracked following disclosures that she employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny and had failed to pay Social Security taxes. Democrats, who opposed Ms. Chavez's appointment because they strongly opposed her views on labor policies in general, dealt gingerly with her case, sticking to legal issues and shying away from criticisms that could appear anti-immigrant. 
Even as many Americans accept illegal immigrants with a wink and a nod, Congress has taken only halting steps to loosen restrictions. Lawmakers and the Clinton administration struck a compromise last year to reunite 300,000 to 500,000 spouses and children with legal permanent residents. But Republicans rejected Mr. Clinton's broader proposals, including granting legal status to immigrants who fled wars and political chaos in Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. 
IMMIGRANT rights supporters vow to renew their fight in this closely divided Congress, but experts say adjusting the law to life's realities may have to wait. "It just hasn't been an item that's high on our priorities," Senator Feinstein said.

Mergers Most Foul?

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
It was a big week for business consolidation. After imposing some additional restrictions, the Federal Communications Commission gave a green light to the merger of AOL and Time Warner. Meanwhile, American Airlines announced a deal to take over ailing T.W.A., a deal that would leave American and United with half the domestic market, and would probably lead to further mergers among the remaining airlines.
 Are these deals likely to increase the combined profits of the merging companies? Maybe and yes. Are they likely to be good for consumers? Maybe and no. And there's a reason for that contrast. The AOL-Time Warner merger will take place under rules intended to ensure that the deal doesn't come at the expense of consumers. It's not yet clear whether American's takeover of T.W.A. will be subject to any comparable restrictions. And more generally, it's unclear whether the federal government will continue to police mergers to make sure that they are good, not bad, for the economy as a whole. 
 Broadly speaking, there are two business justifications for mergers. The one business leaders like to talk about is "synergy" -- the idea that the new whole is more than the sum of its parts, allowing profits to rise without hurting consumers. The other justification, which doesn't get mentioned in polite company, is market power -- the ability to restrict the choices of consumers and charge them higher prices.
The key fact about synergy is that it's elusive. It's very difficult to know in advance whether it's strong enough to justify a merger.
A case in point is the troubled marriage between Daimler and Chrysler, where market power hardly entered the picture, since their products barely competed. How many car buyers are wavering between a Mercedes and a minivan? But the savings from shared design and production that were supposed to make the deal worthwhile have yet to materialize, while the costs -- the usual clash of corporate cultures magnified by the difference in national cultures -- have been all too clear. 
By contrast, mergers based on market power don't depend on fuzzy math. There was nothing elusive about the benefits to John D. Rockefeller when his Standard Oil Trust took control of America's oil industry.
So how do we class last week's mergers? The rhetoric of the AOL-Time Warner deal has been all about synergy; but consumer groups have feared that it's really about forcing cable customers to use AOL for Internet access and forcing AOL subscribers to download Time Warner content. Fortunately, regulators have done a lot to limit the new media giant's market power. The merged company will not be allowed to discriminate in favor of its own content; it will be required to allow other Internet service providers to offer high-speed access over its cables; and future generations of AOL's popular instant messaging system will have to be made interoperable with those of rivals. These restrictions mean that AOL Time Warner's future profits will depend on whether it really is able to deliver the promised synergies; being big won't be its own reward. 
By contrast, as currently proposed the American-T.W.A. deal seems to have little to do with synergy, and a lot to do with market power. The deal would actually be part of an industry-wide consolidation that would also allow United to take over US Airways, and give both United and American more power to raise prices without fear that customers might choose another carrier. 
So should the deal be prevented? Unfortunately, it's not that simple: T.W.A. is on the edge of collapse, so some kind of takeover is inevitable. But one hopes that the regulators will look very hard at this deal, and try to move the ongoing restructuring of the airline industry in a direction that preserves at least some effective competition.
The point is that what's good for business is sometimes good for America, but not always. If a merger is about synergy, it's good if the synergy actually materializes -- and that's a judgment best left to the businessmen themselves. But if a merger is about enhancing market power, it should either be blocked or subjected to restrictions that turn it into something more benign. The price of good mergers is eternal vigilance.
One wonders, however, whether that vigilance will be maintained. Both Republicans on the F.C.C. were opposed to any restrictions on AOL Time Warner. A sign of things to come?

Wall Street, in Search of Meaning

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

 BODY:
Mixed economic signals, a big deal and more profit warnings left the markets searching for direction. 
 Investors bid down AMR, the parent of American Airlines, after it announced a deal to acquire T.W.A. Investors also punished AMR's rival, Delta, concerned that it was not doing enough to stay competitive. 
 On the technology front, more bad news. Nokia hit earnings estimates for the fourth quarter but reported a softening wireless phone market. Motorola, the No. 2, fared even worse, falling short of its estimates. 
 On Friday, two economic reports, retail sales and producer prices, came in stronger than expected, suggesting that the economy was not slowing as much as feared. Still, investors continued to believe that the Federal Reserve would cut rates at its next meeting.
 This optimism helped the Nasdaq finish the week at 2,626.50, up 9 percent or 217.85 points. The S. & P. 500 also advanced, ending at 1,318.32, up 1.5 percent or 19.97 points. Only the Dow industrials declined, finishing at 10,525.38, off 1.3 percent or 136.63 points.
 In the bond markets, concern that a Fed rate cut may be small drove prices down, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising to 5.24 percent, its highest level in a month. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Military Bestrides Turkey's Path to the European Union 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Turkey's powerful military, whose influence and economic reach are unparalleled in other democracies, is facing its toughest fight yet -- not on the battlefield, but in a struggle against those who want to remodel the country to enter the European Union. 
 Of all the reforms Turkey is being asked to undertake to join the European club, none would transform it as deeply as asserting civilian authority over the generals. 
 The outcome of the tussle between the military and those who demand change is important to more than Turkey. It will affect the balance of power in a strategic area between Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam. Turkey, a NATO and American ally, fields the region's strongest army and is regarded as a bulwark against instability. 
Still, a senior European Union diplomat said, "in its present military-civilian configuration, Turkey would be unacceptable to the E.U."
"The Turks, " the diplomat added, "have to find a way to get the pashas out of politics." 
That task confronts the generals with the prospect of losing their well-known dominance of civilian affairs and their much less publicized but no less influential role in the country's economy. Both are changes they are prepared to resist.
Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 by a general, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and his successors have staged coups three times in four decades, returning to barracks only after deeming affairs sufficiently secure to entrust to civilians.
After the most recent coup, in 1980, it was the military-backed government that drew up the 1982 Constitution that still governs Turkey. The document anointed the generals guardians of Turkey's secular government and territorial integrity, a mandate that has been interpreted broadly to cover almost any issue -- from the 15-year war against Kurdish separatists to pushing out an Islamic-led government in 1997. 
This week, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer -- whom opinion polls recently placed in the unusual position of being more popular than the traditionally respected military -- threw down the latest of several challenges to the generals, calling for the Constitution to be rewritten. 
Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has said that change in the role of the military is inevitable as the country approaches European Union membership, though he carefully added that reforms would take time.
But the generals and their many supporters in government are resisting any major realignment, arguing that the strategic importance of Turkey in a rough neighborhood demands a powerful military.
"The conflicts and relations in the Balkans, Caucasus and Middle East require us to maintain strong armed forces with a deterrence capability," Defense Minister Sabahattin Cakmakoglu said in an interview.
European countries face far less hostility from their neighbors and do not understand the need for a powerful military in Turkey, he said.
The potential for tension between politicians and the military was further illustrated this week when the army was accused of meddling in government affairs through an investigation of corruption in the state energy department. 
Mr. Yilmaz, the deputy prime minister, remarked that government under the military would be more corrupt. Stung, the general staff swiftly responded with a statement accusing Mr. Yilmaz of "the greatest slander."
Turkish military experts and Western diplomats said in interviews that Turkey's armed forces represent a stable and uncorrupted element in a society whose politicians are often weak and where scandals are routine. 
"Believe me, we are not happy to be involved in all kinds of problems of Turkey," said Atilla Kiyat, who retired 18 months ago as an admiral. "The lack of civilian authority is forcing us to be involved in those kinds of issues."
In a coincidence seen by some as symbolic, the offices for the new bureaucracy created to guide Turkey's candidacy for the European Union sit squarely in the shadow of the eight-story headquarters of the National Security Council in Ankara, Turkey's capital.
The 10-member council, including the president, four cabinet ministers and the five top military commanders, sets the agenda on almost every important issue. It is an arrangement that many say enables the generals to dominate, because they present a united front while the ministers are often divided by fractious politics. 
The European Union identified the reduction of the council's role as a top priority for Turkey's membership. Volkan Vural, the country's general secretary for European Union affairs, said that the military supports membership and that the security council is already the advisory body the Europeans demand. 
"How this can be clarified, I don't know," said Mr. Vural, a veteran diplomat who is preparing a 900-page outline on joining Europe for government leaders this month. 
Indirect pressure to curtail the military is also coming from the International Monetary Fund, which asked the government last month to trim the budget for the armed forces as part of reforms in return for $7.5 billion in emergency aid.
The annual defense budget is about $9 billion, about 3.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product and four times the amount spent on education. Analysts say billions more are spent through mechanisms that are not reported in the budget. 
Turkey is currently on a military buying spree, shopping for about $10 billion in tanks, helicopters and airborne early-warning systems -- an illustration of the military's economic resources that are almost never discussed, even as the military's political involvement comes under increasing scrutiny. 
Military-owned businesses -- including a bank, 47 percent of a leading automobile maker and 10 percent of Turkey's cement-making capacity -- are among Turkey's largest enterprises and exist free from taxes. The businesses operate outside government control and profits pay for pensions, resorts, and other benefits for members of the armed forces, helping attract and retain top personnel and cementing the soldiers' elevated social standing. 
Through a large holding company called Oyak, the military has financial interests in 24 companies involved in manufacturing, automobile production, agriculture, construction and finance. It owns a bank, a supermarket chain, extensive real estate and 47 percent of Oyak-Renault, one of the country's two dominant automobile makers. 
Many of these businesses are partnerships with the elite of the economic world, from powerful and wealthy families of Turkey like Sabanci and Koc to multinationals like Goodyear and DuPont. The effect is to align the economic interests of the military and important segments of the business establishment.
Oyak, the Turkish acronym for the Armed Forces Trust and Pension Fund, was established by Parliament in 1961, after the first military coup, to provide economic benefits for military officers. 
Competing with Oyak and its estimated 30,000 employees can be tough. Although it was set up outside the government, the company is exempt from taxes and financed by payroll contributions from military officers and land donations from the treasury.
Describing the history of Oyak in 1998, Taha Parla, a professor at Bosporus University in Istanbul, concluded, "The civil servant on horseback already turned politician was further to become merchant, industrialist, financier and rentier."
The military also controls the Foundation for Strengthening the Turkish Armed Forces, a sister corporation established in 1987 that has interests in 30 defense-related companies manufacturing everything from aircraft and artillery to missiles and telecommunications systems. It employs an estimated 20,000 people and 80 percent of its income is donated to the armed forces.
Critics like Mr. Parla and Eric Rouleau, a former French ambassador to Turkey who wrote about the Turkish military's power in Foreign Affairs last month, argue that Oyak and its sister foundation blur the line between the private and public economies and help militarize the society. 
The traditional respect for the military is underpinned by a yearlong class that every Turkish 10th grader must attend, taught by a current or retired military officer using a textbook prepared by the military. Besides inculcating the principles of Ataturk, the course covers political events from the military perspective, concentrating on threats posed by Turkey's neighbors.
"The course has helped internalize the idea that the military has a space in civilian life," said Ayse Gul Altinay, a cultural anthropologist who interviewed dozens of students and teachers on the topic. "Even students who are critical of what the officer says still believe he is the most qualified to speak about these issues."

HEADLINE: Power of U.S. Draws China And Russia To Amity Pact 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
China and Russia are working on a treaty proclaiming friendship, the strongest sign yet of their shared unhappiness with the supremacy of the United States and its plans to build a shield against ballistic missiles. 
 There is no sign that China and Russia plan to enter a genuine alliance, with mutual pledges of aid in time of war, say Chinese and Western scholars and diplomats. 
 Both countries have privately reassured American officials that they still seek close ties with the United States, which offers them far greater economic and technological advantages than they offer each other. 
But their unusual effort to craft a more formal "strategic partnership," as the Chinese describe it, reflects the intensity of their concerns about American global power and especially about the proposal for a national missile defense, which Russia and China fear will put them at a military disadvantage. 
And it is a tangible sign of the changing and complex landscape that will face the incoming Bush administration, which has vowed to increase defense spending, forge ahead with missile defenses and treat China as a competitor.
"When two major powers share an identical view that the United States is the biggest threat to global security and their own security, of course the United States has to be concerned," said David Shambaugh, a political expert at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution in Washington. 
"But what are they going to do about it?" he said, adding that the treaty under negotiation is likely to be "hollow rhetoric." 
Over the last decade ties gradually warmed between Russia and China as each has sought ways to offset the economic and military might of the United States. "The United States is pushing the two countries closer, despite their long tradition of mutual suspicion," said Shen Dingli, an arms control expert at Fudan University in Shanghai. 
Chinese-Russian border disputes have been settled, and each side gains from Russia's sale to China of jet fighters, destroyers and other high-tech military goods it needs. Last year, Chinese and Russian leaders made joint statements of protest against American plans for missile defenses, calling them destabilizing. Both countries are nervous about the expansion of NATO and vehemently opposed the war in Yugoslavia. 
Some time last year they began discussing a more general statement of amity, and since meetings in December, they have begun studying proposed treaty language, Chinese officials told Western scholars. 
The contents have not been disclosed, but beyond a general statement of shared goals, possible subjects may include arms sales, economic ties, cooperation in space and their shared border, scholars said. A document may be signed later this year when President Jiang Zemin visits Moscow. 
While treaty discussions began before the American election, the idea may have gained attraction after the Republican victory. The Chinese have said that they expect Mr. Bush, despite a sometimes hostile tone, to discover the same advantages his predecessors did in cooperating with China. Still, Mr. Bush's apparent determination to build a missile defense has caused great worry. 
One goal in China, scholars said, may be to make it harder for Russia to cut a separate deal with the United States over missile defenses, something many experts expect. 
The United States has contemplated defenses only to counter small numbers of missiles, presumably fired by the likes of North Korea or Iran. But for China, which now has perhaps 20 long-range nuclear missiles in place, even a small-scale defense would virtually negate its ability to threaten the United States. An American shield could thus force China to spend far more money than it can afford, fielding a larger nuclear force than it otherwise would in a spiraling arms race.

PERSON: Dr. Milton I. Roemer 

HEADLINE: Milton Roemer, H.M.O. Advocate, Dies at 84 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Dr. Milton I. Roemer, a physician whose research on public health systems helped to shape health policy in the United States and other countries, died on Jan. 3 at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 84 and lived in Los Angeles. 
 Dr. Roemer retired in 1986 as a professor in the U.C.L.A. School of Public Health's Department of Health Services. 
 Research that Dr. Roemer (pronounced ROE-mer) did at U.C.L.A. has been praised for encouraging people to think about the providing of health care in the United States as a single system, not as a galaxy of individual hospitals and doctors.
He also advocated the creation of a national health program that involved government, said Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Professor Roemer's advocacy in those fields was most notable in the 1970's when there were only a few health maintenance organizations in the United States. He was a supporter of H.M.O.'s, and he has been credited with encouraging their development.
He repeatedly spoke in favor of H.M.O.'s. In testimony in 1972 before the House Subcommittee on Public Health and Environment, he advocated the development of H.M.O.'s and federal support for them. He was a co-author of a 1972 study, "Health Insurance Effects: Services, Expenditures and Attitudes Under Three Types of Plan," which advocated more widespread use of H.M.O.'s in the United States. 
He was also known for what is called the "Roemer effect" or "Roemer's law" -- his view, articulated in 1959 and 1961, that, as The Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law put it in 1998, "when hospital insurance is widespread, increased utilization of hospital services seems to result from an increase in the supply of beds."
He compared medicine and health care systems in many countries, producing a two-volume work, "National Health Systems of the World" (1991 and 1993, Oxford University Press). 
He contended that national health insurance systems made for low inflation in medical care costs. In a 1987 interview, he said, "The idea of national health insurance has always been attacked as inflationary." But he said the rate of inflation for the United States health care system at the time was one of the world's highest, at 11 percent.
He criticized another aspect of health care in the United States in a paper he presented in 1978 at a meeting of the American Public Health Association. Noting that Los Angeles County had had a substantial drop in its death rate in early 1976 when numerous doctors there had withheld services to protest higher malpractice insurance premiums, he tied the decrease to a sharp drop in elective surgery and said there was mounting evidence that a decrease in elective surgery might improve life expectancy.
He was the sole author of 20 books and a co-author of 12.
A native of Paterson, N.J., he earned a bachelor's degree in public health from the University of Michigan, a master's degree in sociology from Cornell and his medical degree from New York University.
He joined the U.C.L.A. faculty in 1962, teaching health administration. Earlier he held various health administration posts with the United States Public Health Service, the World Health Organization in Geneva and the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health. He also taught at Yale and elsewhere.
He is survived by his wife, Ruth Roemer, an adjunct professor emerita at the U.C.L.A. School of Public Health; a son, John, of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth Roemer Lewis of Berkeley, Calif.; and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pataki Plans to Tap Into Reserve Fund for Highways 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, contending with voter rejection in November of a $3.8 billion transportation bond act, today proposed using one of the state's reserve funds to continue construction on two new highways upstate along with several other undisclosed projects.
 Mr. Pataki announced he would draw down about $250 million from a reserve fund for paying off debts to finance the projects as part of the transportation plank in his budget, to be unveiled Tuesday. 
 The governor and his aides declined to say which projects in New York City, if any, would be financed with the money, but Mr. Pataki made specific promises to upstate communities. Part of the $250 million reserve fund would be spent on the conversion of Route 17 into an interstate highway, as well as on construction of a new highway in western New York, the governor said.
"My plan keeps our commitment to key projects upstate, particularly the conversion of Route 17 to Interstate 86 in the southern tier and the construction of Route 219 in western New York," the governor said in a statement sent only to upstate reporters.
What the governor's plan will mean for New York City and its suburbs remains murky. Joseph E. Conway, a spokesman for the governor, offered vague assurances that city transportation projects would be included among "a variety of projects throughout the state."
"Specifics will be laid out in the days to come," Mr. Conway said.
In November, voters rejected a $3.8 billion borrowing plan that would have paid for a number of important projects both upstate and downstate. 
Among the city's projects were completion of the long-dormant Second Avenue subway and extension of the N train to La Guardia Airport. The list also included connecting the Metro-North railroad to Pennsylvania Station and the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.
The rejection of the bond act left a gaping hole in the capital plans of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the State Transportation Department. Altogether, projects in the capital plans are worth about $34 billion over five years. 
While the infusion of $250 million might keep some of these projects afloat next year, it would not address the lack of funding for the following years, transportation officials said. But aides to the governor said that spending the $250 million from the state reserves was only part of a larger plan that Mr. Pataki would lay out Tuesday to save transportation projects.
The governor's chief Democratic adversary, Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly, declined through a spokeswoman to comment on the proposal. Aides to Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader and the governor's chief ally, said the Republican majority in the Senate would wait to see the entire budget before deciding whether to support the governor's plan.
Aides on both sides said there would be fierce negotiations over which projects would move ahead.
In 1997, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature created the reserve fund for cutting debt. It grew to $750 million by December 2000, when the governor used $500 million to pay off some old state bonds. He is now proposing to spend the rest to shore up transportation projects. 
The hole in the transportation budget is not the governor's biggest headache in the spending plan he must release this week.
On Wednesday, a Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, Leland DeGrasse, struck down the state's complex system for financing local public schools, saying that they failed to give New York children a decent education and, thus, discriminated against minorities, who make up the bulk of students in the city.
The governor is still contemplating an appeal of the decision, which would buy him some time, but he has also promised to urge fundamental changes to education aid in his spending plan.
Despite the cooling economy, budget makers on both sides of the aisle say the state is awash in money, even without the debt-reduction reserve fund. Money is still pouring in on the revenue side because of large profits on Wall Street last year. The state is expected to carry $1 billion to $2 billion in surplus revenues into the next fiscal year, added to nearly $2 billion in reserve funds.
One large question looming over the governor's budget is how much of those surplus and reserve funds he will try to save to dole out in 2002, when he faces a re-election campaign.
If he spends down the reserves this year to finance transportation projects and new school aid, he will have less available for new programs in the election year. If he salts away a significant amount, however, he runs the risk of a reaction from voters expecting more money for city schools and transportation.
The governor also urged the Legislature today to make a debt-reform law passed last year an amendment to the State Constitution.
Last May, Mr. Pataki held up passage of the state budget until Assembly Democrats agreed to a law that limited the amount of debt the state could carry, capping it at 4 percent of taxpayers' income. The law also banned the practice of letting state authorities sell bonds backed by state revenues without approval the voters.
Now, as he has in the past, the governor is calling for the law to become an amendment to the Constitution. An amendment would have to be passed by a majority of two separately elected Legislatures and then be approved by voters.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
New Goalie, Old Result For the Sinking Rangers

BYLINE:  By DAVE CALDWELL 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Ron Low, the Rangers' coach, wearily leaned against a wall outside his team's dressing room this afternoon and said in a gravelly whisper that the latest loss in his team's fading season was not the rookie goaltender's fault.
 According to Low, the Rangers' problems, much like crab grass, have tunneled deeper and have spread wider than a leaky goaltending corps. The Boston Bruins whipped the Rangers, 4-1, before 17,565 at the Fleet Center today, and Low said afterward that he had noticed only a few players trying. 
 "The attitude of this hockey team sometimes scares me," Low said. 
Vitaly Yeremeyev, the 25-year-old goaltender from Kazakhstan who made his first National Hockey League start today, allowed Bill Guerin to score on Boston's first shot, which was not a shot in the classic hockey sense.
Guerin wristed the puck from a sideboard along the goal line toward the goal, and it rebounded off Yeremeyev's stick and the hip of Rangers defenseman Brian Leetch before trickling through Yeremeyev's legs. All of 33 seconds had been played.
"We didn't seem to respond very well after that," said Theo Fleury, who was one of few Rangers who played with any fire today.
That response, Low said, was why he was peeved: there were still 59 1/2 minutes remaining. What he saw after the goal, the first of two by Guerin, bothered him much more than the goal itself. "If we would have played our tails off and lost the hockey game, that would have been acceptable," Low said. "This was not."
The loss extended the Rangers' streak without a victory to nine games. The Rangers (16-24-2-1) are 0-7-1-1 since Dec. 18, 1-10-2-1 since Dec. 9 and 3-13-2-1 since Nov. 28. Their road winless streak is 11 games (0-10-1), the team's longest such streak since the 1965-66 season. They have slipped 9 points behind the surging Bruins (17-17-6-4), who reclaimed the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
The Rangers, who have scored on only one of their last 46 power-play chances, gave up a power-play goal 13 minutes 49 seconds into the first period to Guerin, who found a spot among four Rangers, took a pass from Jason Allison and beat Yeremeyev from what Low judged to be no more than 2 1/2 feet. "We were very stationary," Leetch said. "We followed them a lot."
Low said, "That's what's missing from this hockey team right now -- the physical element."
The Rangers got back into the game when Radek Dvorak beat the Boston defenseman Hal Gill, then goaltender Byron Dafoe 17 seconds into the second period. Four minutes later, the Rangers yielded a short-handed goal, the first of two goals today by Mikko Eloranta. It killed any momentum the Rangers might have had.
Leetch fell behind the Rangers' goal and had the puck plucked from him by Brian Rolston. Eloranta stormed the slot and scored. Leetch could have blamed his fall for the goal, but he refused to. "I've still got to be in the position where I can make the play," Leetch said.
Eloranta scored his second goal on a breakaway 7:38 into the third period, and Low seethed. He said Yeremeyev, who had 20 saves, never had a chance to stop any of Boston's four goals.
"I definitely don't think he played his way off the hockey team," Low said of Yeremeyev.
Low said Mike Richter, who had his surgically repaired left knee drained on Wednesday, would probably be back in goal for the Rangers' home game on Sunday night against Minnesota. 
If only Richter could chase the blues by himself.
"If you're winning consistently, you're still going to have that flat game," Mark Messier, the Rangers' captain, said, looking for an upside.
This, Low said, is not a team that can afford any more flat games. Today was the day to start something new, and Low said he found himself saying the same old things. "I was definitely expecting a lot different look from this hockey team than what I saw in this game," Low said.

SLAP SHOTS
General Manager GLEN SATHER of the Rangers said that he has had had "exploratory conversations" with TOM BARRASSO, the unemployed veteran goaltender. . . . The Rangers claimed left wing JEFF TOMS off waivers from the Islanders.

HEADLINE: Battle Over Developing a Scenic Mountain Tract 

BYLINE:  By LYN RIDDLE 

DATELINE: BREVARD, N.C. 

 BODY:
A 2,200-ACRE tract in the Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina that was the location for the movie "The Last of the Mohicans" is now the site of another kind of battle, this one between a developer of high-priced residential communities and the state of North Carolina. 
 Reaching across rounded-top mountains and accented with three celebrated waterfalls, the land has been condemned by the State of North Carolina, which took possession in October. 
 A South Carolina developer, James B. Anthony, the chief executive of the Cliffs Communities, had bought the property a year earlier, outbidding the Conservation Fund, a nonprofit group that was acting on behalf of the state. 
In the last decade Mr. Anthony has built three residential developments, some with lots selling for as much as $1 million, in the mountains of South Carolina. One of them is the Cliffs at Glassy, a golf course community at the top of the 3,000-foot Glassy Mountain in the northwestern part of the state. 
In August 1999, he paid $6.35 million for the 2,200-acre North Carolina tract, which had long been held by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company as a hunting and fishing preserve for entertaining clients. The chemical company sold the land in 1996 to the Brevard Land Company, a subsidiary of Sterling Diagnostics, a Houston company that makes X-ray film, and Brevard, in turn, accepted bids from prospective buyers. 
The Conservation Fund bid $5.5 million. When it condemned the property, the state agreed to pay Mr. Anthony $12.5 million. 
State officials say the land should be preserved because it includes Bridal Veil, High and Triple waterfalls (all featured in "The Last of the Mohicans," starring Daniel Day-Lewis). It is bordered by the 8,000-acre DuPont State Forest, which was sold by the company to the state at a discount in a number of transactions in the 1990's.
The state took over the land from Mr. Anthony after receiving thousands of letters reflecting both sides of the dispute, which also included an Internet campaign by a number of environmental groups.
The state is forming an advisory group to decide what to do with the property, which includes a number of buildings, including an unfinished lodge. For now, the site, which is about halfway between the cities of Brevard and Hendersonville, it is open to the public for hiking. 
Joseph H. Henderson, director of the North Carolina State Property Office, said the state had condemned the land when it became obvious it would not be able to reach agreement with Mr. Anthony on a whole range of issues, including a purchase price. 
Mr. Anthony said he had spent nearly $20 million to buy the property and make improvements to roads and buildings. He has repaired and built 10 miles of roads, started renovating a lodge and constructed an equestrian center. Several small vacant homes were restored as well. He intended to sell 100 homesites around 130-acre Lake Julia and 10 in another part of the property. 
He said he had proposed putting about 1,300 acres into a trust that would be run by three private colleges nearby. In addition, the land around the waterfalls would be protected and open to the public, he said. 
Within months of his signing the contract to buy the land in May 1999, about 150 people had placed refundable deposits of $1,000 each indicating interest in purchasing lots, he said. The sales prices for one- to three-acre homesites were expected to average $350,000. "The state had the opportunity to buy the property and didn't," said Mr. Anthony, who left a 20-year career as a lineman with a phone company in 1982 to become a developer. "It is totally unfair. This is politics at its dirtiest."
Mr. Anthony said he intends to fight the condemnation, not only because he considers the offer too low, but also because he believes losing the site will harm his business. "I want the land back," he said. 
ONE of the promises made to people who buy a lot in a Cliffs community is the opportunity to use the facilities at any of them, he said. He has sold 200 lots in other communities with the promise the owners could visit the North Carolina site. 
"We've never not delivered what we promised," he said. "This has really harmed our reputation and our name. How do we get that back?" 
The North Carolina property and a new concept of allowing property owners to use affiliated resorts in various places around the world were to be his company's focus for the next few years, he said. 
The first of these sporting clubs is to be in Chile. The company has purchased 6,000 acres with six miles of beachfront there, Mr. Anthony said, adding that his company does not intend to develop the resort sites beyond building places to stay. 
Mr. Anthony said sites in Belize and British Columbia would be included sometime in the next two years. The idea is to give owners a choice of winter and summer resorts year-round. 
Mr. Anthony said that the state's assertion that the property is pristine was disingenuous. "What they got was a development," he said, citing the construction his company had done. 
In addition, the site is bordered by one of Transylvania County's largest industries, the Agfa Corporation, situated at the western side of the property, separating Mr. Anthony's former land and DuPont Forest. Agfa, which makes X-ray film, bought the plant from Sterling Diagnostics but did not want the 2,200 acres that Mr. Anthony ultimately bought. 
The DuPont company owned all of the land in the area at one time, using it to entertain clients and also allowing a youth camp to operate there. DuPont officials and guests stayed in rustic lodges and cabins and hunted deer and wild turkey and fished for trout. 
Other resort communities are situated near public lands in the area. Lake Toxaway, a mountain lake community with homes valued as high as $3 million, is close to the recently created Gorges State Park. Transylvania County's largest employer, the Ecusta paper mill, a division of the P. H. Glatfelter Company, is at the base of Pisgah National Forest. 
Increasingly, western North Carolina has become popular for vacation homes and for retirees attracted by a climate that has four seasons but is temperate. 
Transylvania County officials had hoped the Cliffs development would be allowed to proceed. Already, nearly 41 percent of the county's land -- 99,481 acres -- is not taxed because it is state or national forest. Another 3 percent is owned by such other nontaxed entities as the county or schools, according to a report compiled by the county manager's office. 
Losing the Cliffs development, which would have been a $66 million investment, meant losing $425,000 in tax revenue a year. That represents about 1 percent of the county's annual budget of $33 million, said Arthur C. Wilson Jr., the county manager. "We fully agree that we need to preserve land, but we think we've done our part," he said. 
County leaders had spoken with state officials on Mr. Anthony's behalf, arguing that the state was needlessly spending money to preserve areas -- especially around the waterfalls -- that Mr. Anthony had agreed to preserve. 
Mr. Henderson said that state leaders felt that condemnation was the only option because under Mr. Anthony's proposal, public access to the waterfalls would have been limited to a 100-foot-wide path along the river. The proposal, he said, would also have resulted "in an upscale resort in the middle of a state forest."
The situation is of special concern, Mr. Wilson said, because the county's economy has been hurt in recent years by layoffs at its two largest employers: Agfa and Ecusta, which makes paper for tobacco products and Bibles.
"My personal feeling is we should have had an equitable situation where there could have been a development and some of the land was preserved," he said. "It would have been win-win." 
But others spoke just as forcefully against the development. Thousands of letters poured into state government offices from people all over the country encouraging officials to take possession of the land before it was ruined, according to Mr. Henderson. Many of the letters came from residents and leaders of environmental organizations in Henderson County, where a small part of the land is located. 
"We wrestled with what they offered," Mr. Henderson said of the development company's position, "whether it was truly acceptable to protect the natural resource and give the public access, and ultimately we concluded it wasn't."

HEADLINE: Compromise Plan Is Urged in Energy Talks 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Clinton administration officials pressed politicians, utilities and energy providers today to agree on a compromise plan to end the electricity crisis that has left California, the nation's most populous and richest state, on the brink of darkness.
 With Gov. Gray Davis and California lawmakers participating by satellite link, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers presided over an afternoon negotiating session here that participants said aimed to keep the state's main utilities financially solvent while arranging long-term supplies of power to address critical shortages. 
Participants said teams of negotiators had worked out compromise proposals to relieve the energy crisis by earlier today, potentially allowing the governor and power companies to reach a final agreement soon. But some participants in the talks warned that negotiations could continue through the weekend. 
"I don't think any of us expect to get to the finish line tonight," Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters gathered at the Energy Department for the talks. 
"I expect us to have continued work over the weekend and over the holiday," Mr. Sperling said.
The goal of the talks was to smash through the logjam that has paralyzed California's power industry after partial deregulation in 1996. Amid severe shortages, the PG&E Corporation and Edison International, the state's major utilities, are paying far more to buy power than they are allowed to charge consumers to use it. They face $12 billion in debt and possible bankruptcy.
The situation became critical last week when a storm reduced power production and increased demand to the extent that officials warned that it might be necessary to shut off power to parts of the state. Any intentional blackouts would have been the first in California since military officials ordered lights-out to deny Japanese bombers easy nighttime targets during World War II.
Because of the electricity shortage and the financial troubles of utilities, out-of-state companies that sell power to California are charging exorbitant prices on the spot market for immediate delivery. Utilities say they cannot afford to buy power at those prices because under the deregulation law they cannot pass the increased costs on to consumers.
The state has accused power producers of price gouging. The producers say that California's problems are home-grown and that the prices reflect widespread shortages and fears that the state's utilities could collapse without paying their debts.
Bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion is tricky, participants said. Mr. Davis will inevitably be faced with delicate political choices. On the one hand, he must work to lift the threat of power outages. On the other, California residents and businesses will ultimately bear the burden of any solution, perhaps by paying twice as much for electricity as they do now.
Consumers groups are fighting any agreement that would result in substantially higher electricity prices. They argue that the out-of-state producers have already pocketed a windfall from the state's power crisis and that residents should not pay more to help them profit more. 
Clinton administration officials said the federal government had no direct role in the matter. But the financial health of multibillion-dollar utilities and the threat of power shortages in the nation's technology center have raised concerns that California's problems could rattle the national economy, which already shows signs of slowing.
Mr. Summers, Mr. Sperling and other senior officials involved are helping to broker a compromise and to put pressure on both the power producers and the politicians to reach a settlement, administration officials said.
Mr. Davis, along with the governors of neighboring Oregon and Washington, have argued that the federal government should impose a price cap on wholesale power to rein in the volatile spot market.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said he favored a price cap. But that option was rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an agency that regulates electricity sales between states.
Under one possible compromise, the state would arrange long-term contracts to buy electricity on the wholesale market at fixed prices far below today's spot price. The state would then pass that power on to utilities to distribute to consumers.
Both utilities and power generators consider that idea workable, participants said. Utilities would be assured of recouping their costs under the plan, while generators would agree to sell power in coming years at prices well above those that prevailed a year ago, though far below panic prices today.
One outstanding issue is the length of those purchase contracts. Power generators have pushed for the contracts to last up to 13 years. The state would prefer that they extend for only a few years.
Negotiators have also considered a plan that would allow the utilities themselves to enter long-term contracts, participants said. Power generators would have to agree to allow the utilities to suspend debt payments for a grace period while they repair their finances.

 DREAMER, by Charles Johnson. (Scribner, $12.) The story of a poor man whose striking physical (if not spiritual) resemblance to Martin Luther King Jr. lands him a job as a stand-in for the civil rights leader becomes an exploration into the soul of inequality and a probing inquiry into King's life and times. "Johnson takes bold creative risks," Dennis McFarland wrote here in 1998. "He delivers a lively tale that leaves the reader with enormous concerns to contemplate." Scribner has also reissued Johnson's first novel, Faith and the Good Thing ($11), a philosophical "Pilgrim's Progress" fable about a black girl's search for the Good Thing in Hatten County, Ga. In 1974 our reviewer, Annie Gottlieb, called this "a flawed yet still fabulous book, at its best a many-splendored and ennobling weaving-together of thought, suffering, humor and magic."

GREETINGS, Carbon-Based Bipeds! Collected Essays, 1934-1998, by Arthur C. Clarke. Edited by Ian T. Macauley. (St. Martin's Griffin, $16.95.) Just in time for the new millennium, this collection serves as an intellectual autobiography of the author of "2001: A Space Odyssey," showcasing his early advocacy of space travel and many other ardently promoted causes. "Arguably, Sir Arthur (he was knighted in 1998) has done more than anyone in the 20th century to explain science to the multitude," Gerald Jonas wrote here in 1999.

IN SIBERIA, by Colin Thubron. (HarperPerennial, $14.) A seasoned chronicler of the former Soviet Union journeys alone to Russia's vast, desolate northern plains, dropping by former labor camps, abandoned laboratories and other outposts that dot one of the most inhospitable places on earth. The author "is a sensitive and observant traveler who clearly respects the Siberians for the hardships they have endured," Ken Kalfus wrote in the Book Review in 2000. The same publisher has restored to print Among the Russians (originally published in 1984 as "Where Nights Are Longest"), an account of Thubron's journey by car to western Russia a decade before the collapse of the Soviet empire. "A subtle and humane writer, Thubron is able to capture the fleeting words and gestures that define a culture," S. Frederick Starr wrote here. "This tourist-author offers a harvest of insights that would be the envy of any sociologist."

MEMORIES OF A PURE SPRING, by Duong Thu Huong. (Penguin, $13.) This darkly poetic novel tells of a Hanoi composer whose marriage to a celebrated singer unravels after he is mistaken for a boat person trying to leave Vietnam following the war with America. Duong "employs flashbacks, multiple points of view and a haunting interplay of narrative and interior voices to construct her sadly beautiful tale," Philip Gambone said here last year.

THE NEW NEW THING: A Silicon Valley Story, by Michael Lewis. (Penguin, $13.) The new-capitalist entrepreneur Jim Clark is the subject of this profile of an anti-Organization Man whose drive to shake up the old order transformed Silicon Valley -- and perhaps the American economy. The result is "a splendid, entirely satisfying book, intelligent and fun and revealing and troubling in the correct proportions, resolutely skeptical but not at all cynical, brimming with fabulous scenes as well as sharp analysis," Kurt Andersen said here in 1999.

GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING, by Tracy Chevalier. (Plume, $12.) This novel's 16-year-old narrator goes to work as a housemaid for Vermeer in the Dutch city of Delft and is invited into the artist's studio, where she learns to grind paints and sits for a portrait. "Chevalier's exploration into the soul of this complex but nave young woman is moving, and her depiction of 17th-century Delft is marvelously evocative," Ruth Coughlin wrote here in 2000.

THE BOOK OF REVELATION, by Rupert Thomson. (Vintage International, $12.) A young choreographer is abducted in Amsterdam, imprisoned and repeatedly raped and sexually abused by three masked women. After his release, his career and self-image are shattered. The novel's premise is "made terrifyingly real by a hugely talented writer," Anthony Bourdain wrote here last year.

THE MADWOMAN IN THE ATTIC: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination, by Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar. (Yale University, $19.95.) This feminist study of eminent 19th-century writers like Jane Austen and George Eliot caused quite a stir when it was published in 1979. The authors "present the first persuasive case for the existence of a distinctly female imagination," Le Anne Schreiber wrote in these pages. Scott Veale

HEADLINE: The Bush Years; 
C.E.O., U.S.A.

BYLINE:  By James Bennet; James Bennet is a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
As George W. Bush prepares to be inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States, those who have not studied him closely tend to divide into two camps: the inspired and the appalled. The first group sees him as Prince Hal, a natural leader seasoned by his rapscallion youth; the second sees him as smug and callow, a Richard II attaining power by accident of birth. But whether they are pulling for Hal or scoffing at Richard, they cite the same biography: that Bush was an incurious student and an unsuccessful young man who just 14 years ago was sitting on top of a collapsing oil firm; that he opted out of the ideological and military conflicts of his generation; that he drank too much for many years; that his experience in public service consists of six years in the bully pulpit of a state with a part-time Legislature -- and that he spent two of those years running for president. It is kind of amazing, these people all say, when you think about it. 
 Bush, who prefers to be underestimated, has not done much to revise that story. When I sat in on a couple of his meetings in Austin just before Christmas, he was still joking with visiting congressmen about how very unlikely a candidate he once was for the Oval Office. That narrative, about an almost accidental president, makes snobs of Bush's critics and so provides the ultimate establishment scion some counterestablishment street cred. At least in its Prince Hal version, the narrative gives Bush something of a compelling back story -- the kind that Americans want in their presidents and one that manages to make a virtue of the notion that the highest hurdle he had to overcome in life was his own fecklessness. The details of that story are true enough. Bush has less government experience than any president since Warren G. Harding, and it took a self-confounding opponent, Bush's own well-placed family members, the entire Republican establishment and five justices of the Supreme Court to heave him over the threshold to the Oval Office. Yet the arc of the story does not do him justice. It elides a basic truth: that Bush has become a methodical, disciplined candidate and officeholder. After eight years of a grand improviser, the voters (or at least those five justices) have chosen a man with a plan. 
 Unlike Bill Clinton, Bush has always had a model to follow, and despite his black-sheep image he has always followed one. Self-created men like Clinton or Ronald Reagan have had to yearn and work for decades to reach the White House, but Bush knew the presidency was a possibility the way the sons of other men know it is possible to be a doctor or a mechanic. So, unlike Al Gore, whose father was denied even the candidacy for the vice presidency, Bush could afford to wear his ambition lightly, in the manner Americans prefer it worn. Yet he traced his father's path, step by step. That he sometimes failed where his father succeeded has obscured the more telling reality: that he watched, painfully, as his father failed, and he learned.
Bush had thought for years of running for governor of Texas, and when he did, he not only had his charm, family name and connections to rely upon but also tough, loyal advisers. He developed a precise, easily communicated plan, a four-part agenda: education reform, juvenile justice, welfare reform and tort reform, all bound together with a theme of economic opportunity and development. Once he won, Bush knew exactly what he would do, so when he ran again for governor he was able to declare himself a success. "I have done in office what I promised to do," he pronounced. By then, a bigger opportunity had come along. With a five-part plan -- fixing schools, cutting taxes, bolstering defense, reforming entitlements and turning more care for the needy over to "faith based" organizations -- Bush started running for president. 
This pattern explains why disappointment awaits the editorialists and Democrats who are saying that Bush should read in the split election result a demand that he ditch some of his agenda. It explains why Bush has gone to such bewildering lengths to insist that he has a mandate for his plans. It helps explain the cabinet selections he has made. And it helps explain why no one seems to know just what George W. Bush believes.
Bushes are more loyal to people than to ideas, which is why the Reaganites, who had it the other way around, never trusted them. Unlike the Kennedys or even the Rockefellers, their dynastic politics are bottomed less on an ideology than on an assumption of superior management: if someone has to run things, it probably should be a Bush. (The notion that they see nobility in public service is somewhat undercut by their willingness to trash government workers.) Hence, Bushes tend to seek executive rather than legislative positions. A key corollary is that Bushes will appoint the right kind of people. With his degree in management from Harvard, George W. Bush is even more systematic about hiring than his father was. He says that good management -- like his selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate -- makes good politics.
As Bush has introduced his proposed cabinet, he has given the nation a rolling seminar on management, sounding at times as though he were reading from a primer for aspiring child executives. "A good executive is one that understands how to recruit people and how to delegate," he said after he presented three designees in Austin right after the New Year. "How to align authority and responsibility, how to hold people accountable for results and how to build a team of people. And that's exactly what we're going to do. This is a team of people who'll be dedicated to doing what is right for America." Who but the most unpatriotic shareholder could argue with that?
The joining of delegated authority to accountability is the theme that runs through Bush's ideas about policy, politics and governance. It almost rises to the level of the vision thing his father never had. It is a management theory, not a political ideology, and as such it receives its clearest expression in foreign policy, which is less cluttered by domestic politics. It is one reason for the gray, retro cast of Bush's appointees to national security posts. Another reason -- which is no coincidence -- is that the first President Bush was judged a success in foreign policy. The son has never shown a compulsion to reject his father's model merely for the sake of doing so. 
In domestic affairs, this trust-but-verify accountability theory has public-policy consequences that align with the Republican agenda: Social Security money should be returned to you to invest as you see fit, with a lavish or straitened retirement your own responsibility; parents, not the federal government, should be delegated the authority for spending the government's investment in their children's education. Where the theory inconveniently does not fit -- take, for example, abortion, gay marriage or recount decisions by local canvassing boards -- Bush has been willing to take the ideological leap to toe the party line. Doing so allows him to manage the party's conservatives.
While Bill Clinton ran as a New Democrat by challenging his party on crime, welfare and the budget, Bush ran as a new kind of Republican by challenging his party not on substance but on style. He ignored the conflict between his traditional Republican "accountability" agenda and its packaging as "compassionate conservatism." 
Except to believers in the toughest of tough love, real accountability is not compassionate. It is financial ruin, dismissal from school or a job, denial of welfare benefits, the headsman's ax. At its core, Bush's governing formula was the opposite of Al Gore's paternalistic promise to "fight for you," but that contrast -- and the inherent contradictions -- never emerged with clarity because Bush kept insisting that his approach was also compassionate. And also because Gore's campaign stank. 
People were left confused about what Bush believes for another reason as well: all that talk about holding his appointees accountable for results has helped him avoid spelling out what he wants those results to be, if he knows. 
Never had Prince Hal demonstrated his method more clearly than after he vanquished Prince Al and the transition plan clicked into place. Less than two weeks into his compressed transition, Bush had already caught up to where Clinton was after seven weeks, according to Paul Light, who is studying the transition from the Brookings Institution in Washington. With no immediate fuss, Bush yoked competent pragmatists in foreign policy to competent conservatives in domestic affairs. Methodically taking command of the news cycle with a leakproof series of events, Bush embarked on the same kind of "front-porch campaign" that he used to create a sense of momentum for his presidential candidacy. Lawmakers, businessmen and community leaders thronged to Austin to appreciate in person what does not translate to the small screen: the Bush charisma. Thanks also to the Bush family's version of compartmentalization -- which is to hire a Lee Atwater or a James Baker to do the dirty work -- the president-elect successfully presented himself as the humble soul of bipartisanship. The cruel partisanship of Bush's effort in Florida vanished like the desert dew.
Getting to see Dick Cheney is not easy these days, even if you do not want a job. Cheney's staff first said that I might be able to catch a flight with him, then that I could not. Then they canceled one appointment, followed by a second. 
"It's crazy -- it's not true," Cheney said when I finally got to ask him about those stories and jokes about how he was really running things. He argued that it just looked that way, because Bush had to stay at his ranch during the Florida recount while the vice president-elect began setting up the transition. "But there's no question about who's running the show," he continued. "And from the standpoint of my visibility, that'll quickly fade. When we go down and do these press conferences, you guys don't ask me any questions. You know, they want to talk to the president." True, the appearance that Cheney was running things was already dissipating by the time I sat down with him. The underlying reality was murkier.
Cheney had just moved into the official transition headquarters two blocks from the White House. His spartan office had an extremely transitional and un-vice-presidential feel -- standard-issue desk, standard-issue small, round conference table, disturbingly vivid green carpet. He had one stack of papers and notebooks more than a foot high on the desk and another half as tall. On a ledge behind his desk was a large photograph of himself and Colin Powell standing on either side of Bush, all smiling in bright sunshine. 
An hour earlier, Bush, with Cheney silently at his side, announced four more appointments. As we spoke, Gov. Tommy Thompson was in the next room going through the first throes of discussing the legal, legislative and press matters involved in becoming secretary of health and human services. From the small conference table, we could sometimes hear laughter through the wall. Outside, two more secretaries-designate cooled their heels.
The power of Dick Cheney's presence seems to come from his iceman demeanor; his voice-of-God delivery; his outsize hands, which are constantly in motion and belie his scarcely inflected bass; and his resume: White House chief of staff at 34, five-term member of the House, secretary of defense. The telephone rang.
Funny -- I thought guys like Cheney had secretaries. "Excuse me," Cheney said. "This may be an important call." He rapidly crossed the room and snatched up the receiver. "Hello? Yes, right." It was evidently an operator assuring that Cheney was on the line, which could only mean a presidential call. The door was just closing as I heard him say, "Yes, sir, how are you?" He suddenly sounded less like the guy who hurls the thunderbolts than the one who caddies for him.
Back in the office again, I asked Cheney what quality made Bush the president, given that he had arguably less government experience than anyone he had selected for his cabinet.
"Well, but think of what he's done," he began mildly, then cleared his throat and leaned forward across the table. "He's the guy who went out and put his name on the ballot, got into the arena, captured the Republican nomination, devised a strategy to beat an incumbent vice president at a time of considerable prosperity in the country. None of the rest of us did that. And that's the test." He paused, and an index finger that had been tapping the table's surface began driving into it. "And somebody who is able to envision himself as president of the United States and put together the resources and the strategy to make it happen -- that's a hell of a leader."
This is Cheney's fifth transition, coming or going, and the first for Bush at the national level. But it is not Bush's first transition. In Texas, Bush selected Clay Johnson, a friend from Andover and an earnest former businessman, to screen his appointments. He instructed Johnson to consider only competence and the demands of each position, saying that he, Bush, would worry about the politics. And having set up his system and put it in motion, Bush stepped back -- way back -- and let it work. When I visited Johnson, I asked him how many times Bush had overruled him in Texas. "I think in the 4,000 appointments, or let's say 3,500 appointments," Johnson began, then paused to consider. "I think fewer than 10." Johnson argued that that was not a sign that Bush rubber-stamped his recommendations but that Johnson learned what Bush wanted and delivered.
Bush began planning for his presidential transition way back in 1999, in his characteristic way: by assigning the work to someone else. "The governor said, 'I would like you to figure out what we need to do starting the day after the election,"' recalled Johnson, who became Bush's chief of staff in Texas. "Come up with a plan -- talk to people that have done this before, read what you can get your hands on, confer with people, pick their brains and come up with a plan."'
Bush and Johnson rarely spoke about the planning before the election. "Occasionally, he'd come in and say, 'How are you coming on your project?"' Johnson recalled. "Kind of randomly, he and I would chat about it." 
From the beginning, Bush saw in Cheney a man who could run the transition for him. Cheney told me that Bush was thinking about his role in the transition when he asked him to be his running mate. In August, Johnson flew to Wyoming and spent a day outlining for Cheney the progress he had made. 
During the interview, Cheney offered the instructions he received from Bush after the election as an example of the kind of "clear assignment" Bush delegates: "Go to Washington. Start the transition."
I said that did not sound too clear to me. "Well, but it is if you think about it," Cheney replied. "It wasn't foreign to me. I've been through the process a few times."
Bush is famous for reading only the executive summary of reports, if that. His aides say he does not show interest in details, except occasionally to test their thoroughness. The danger is that he can become simply a spin-processor, passing on the bottom line that each adviser has provided him. Therein lies the importance of Cheney; Cheney sweats the small stuff. It is no coincidence that the sloppiest episodes of Bush's transition and his campaign revolved around details concerning the chief detail man. Bush went on national television in November and declared that his running mate was just fine, when in fact Cheney had had a mild heart attack. Similarly, months earlier, Bush's campaign fumbled for explanations when Cheney's voting record was exhumed after Bush announced that the man leading his search for a running mate would be his running mate.
Cheney said that he and Bush spoke by telephone four or five times a day. Bush set no quota for recommendations for each post, and for some, like State, there was only one. Bush's aides insist that he has used the same straightforward method for finding nominees in Washington
as in Texas: starting with the qualities he wants in a particular officeholder, considering the department's needs and then taking recommendations. That is not to say that traditional politics has not played a prominent role. Bush initially rolled out moderates, minorities and women. After conservatives had helpfully begun squawking about how moderate Bush seemed, he gave them the appointment they most craved, attorney general. He waited to announce that choice, of former Senator John Ashcroft, until the Friday before the Christmas weekend, when even political junkies had other matters on their minds. Bush went on to give conservatives the other cabinet posts they were most concerned about, Health and Human Services, Labor and the Interior. 
Still, Bush's critics will have a hard time portraying any of his appointees purely as political hacks. In fact, this transition has painted a portrait of an administration in which the only official who will need on-the-job training is the president. Andy Card, Bush's chief of staff, said as much in November in a television interview, as he described efforts to prepare Bush for Jan. 20. "We have a responsibility to make sure that he understands all of the workings of the White House and how the cabinet will have to work," he said. 
Bush's aides see the imbalance in experience as a sign of their boss's equanimity. They talk about him as though he were some sort of Zen priest. They marvel at his inner calm. They describe him as providing "guidance," not giving orders. "He understands time," said Mark McKinnon, who was a media adviser to Bush during the campaign. "I think he sees time as a really valuable commodity. So he doesn't like empty space. He doesn't like time used unwisely." 
Having watched a strong chief of staff, John Sununu, restrict access to his father, Bush chose Card, a less forceful presence. Bush believes his senior staff members must have access to the boss or they will become dispirited. But he does not want to hear from them too often. In Texas, he ordered his top advisers to return one another's calls first, in hopes that they would hash out consensus among themselves and develop a team ethic. Clinton sowed division in his staff to achieve creative tension, but Bush puts a higher priority on teamwork. And of course on loyalty. One Bush adviser told me that he had been informed by Austin that he had been welcomed into the "family"; then he called a couple of days later and asked me not to print his name, lest he be ejected. 
Bush's inner triangle -- Karen Hughes; Karl Rove, his chief political strategist; and Joe Allbaugh, his campaign manager -- made sure their boss's aides did not build themselves up at the expense of the greater glory of George W. Bush. You saw no "War Room" about the Bush team. It will not be so easy to keep a Powell, Donald Rumsfeld or Christine Todd Whitman in line.
Yet who can quarrel with picking experienced, qualified people? "He's got plenty of self-confidence," Cheney said of Bush. "He's perfectly happy to go get a Colin Powell to be secretary of state or a Rumsfeld to be secretary of defense." Cheney says that his own role has not been spelled out but that he expects it to be "very significant." He added, "That's what he wants." In fact, Cheney is likely to be an even more influential vice president than Gore -- which is to say, the most influential ever.
Despite his awesome advantages in life, Bush does not seem to feel much need to prove anything about himself. In that quality, he is like Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, who is credited with making solid selections for his own administration. Neither politician knows a lot about a lot, but each gives the impression of knowing that about himself, and of not letting that knowledge make him insecure. 
I had a glimpse of Bush's self-confidence a week before I met Cheney, on a trip to Austin just before Christmas. Bush turned to me before leaving the governor's mansion for a meeting with Latino leaders and asked, in his grammatically challenged Spanish, "Puedes hablado espanol?" Caught off guard, I replied, "I can" -- though my Spanish is badly decayed. Bush felt no need to exaggerate. He screwed up his face, dragging one eyebrow down and hiking up the other. "I can't," he confessed breezily. Then he grinned and was gone through the door. 
That day, as part of his front-porch offensive, Bush had invited some Congressional leaders on education -- Republicans and Democrats -- to lunch to discuss the issue uppermost in his plan. The meeting was closed to the press, but at the last minute Karen Hughes, doubtless recognizing a chance to display her boss in top form, arranged for me to sit in. The president-elect did not seem thrilled to see a reporter in the room. "Welcome," he said stiffly, frowning. Then his eyes crinkled: "Don't steal any silverware."
What followed over the next hour and a half was a demonstration of how Bush hopes to apply his political method to governing in Washington. Cheney is likely to spend a lot of time devising legislative strategy, Bush advisers say. But Bush will not delegate everything. He will use his personal and presidential charms to function as the chief salesman for his plans. 
Three round tables covered with white linen were wedged into the room, which had blue walls and a 20-foot ceiling. Over the mantels at each end, plastic greenery studded with ribbons, lights and silver stars rose in triangles that framed dusky oil paintings of departed Texans. In all, 19 legislators were gathered there. Cheney was elsewhere. The only woman among the legislators, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was seated at Bush's left. At his right hand was the energetic, burly leader of House Democrats on education, George Miller of California.
As Bush rose to start the discussion, he seemed nervous, and he began almost breathlessly. But he quickly warmed to his subject. "I am convinced we can work together," he said. 
Education is Bush's strongest policy suit, and characteristically beginning with first principles, he laid out the familiar George W. Bush formula. His first belief, Bush explained, was that the federal government should trust states to do the right thing on education. His second was that it should hold the states accountable for results. 
"There's going to be great political pressure on issues such as vouchers," Bush said wearily, punching the last noun with the peculiarly hard emphasis that he and his father are prone to use for the main thought in a sentence. He stated his position: if a state chose to embrace vouchers, federal money should follow any child in that state who went from public to private school. Then, saying he would not "hog all the air time," Bush called on the others to speak.
And as salad gave way to burritos and finally to cr<heart>me brlee, the legislators got into it. They talked about the politics of education, but they also talked policy. Some gave obsequious tributes to Bush, and everyone laughed too hard at his frequent japes. But most dwelled on which government programs worked and which didn't. They talked about the dangers to children who get routed into special education, the benefits of early literacy programs, the best ways to finance charter schools. It dawned on me that Bush was playing to any politician's deepest vanity: he was taking them seriously as substantive people who wanted to do the right thing. And for the moment anyway, they were rising to the occasion.
Bush did not give the impression of listening with his entire body, the way Clinton does. Nor, like Clinton, did he repeatedly speak up himself, demonstrating his command of the subject. He did not take notes, and he slouched deep in his chair, his chin pressing down into his hand. But he kept his eyes glued to each speaker, and when he weighed in he moved easily through the issues. He called on each legislator by name, often, in his towel-snapping way, barking out just a last name. 
Though Bush catered to each legislator's concerns, he left no doubt as to who was in charge. Still, he kept saying that education reform would be a joint effort. When one senator promised to "help you get off to a roaring start," Bush demurred. "Senator, I appreciate it," he said. "With all due respect, I want to correct you. It's 'get us off to a roaring start."' 
Television is not kind to the president-elect, his own advisers admit. It shrinks him. The microphone exaggerates his hissing sibilance and odd emphases. The camera in close-up makes his restlessness at a lectern look juvenile. In person, those same tics make him seem, if not overwhelming, at least real rather than insubstantial. Bush's lack of apparent pretense is his greatest political weapon. It saves him from seeming like a complete operator; without it, Bush, who is not a humble man, would seem like Uriah Heep, or perhaps Al Gore. Watching him, I saw that a critical part of that weapon's effectiveness is that Bush does not pretend that he is not acting politically, at least in these settings. "Why do you think he's sitting next to me?" he asked, when one congressman mentioned how important Miller would be to Bush's plans. Bush's technique is to warn people that he is trying to charm them as he charms them, and to make that warning part of his charm. But he also does not pretend that charm is enough to erase their differences; to do so would be to insult the very intelligence he is trying to flatter. There would be times, Bush repeatedly said, when they disagreed. "But that's O.K.," he kept saying.
Although Bush was out to court everyone in the room, his No. 1 target was clearly Miller. Throughout the meal, he flirted with him, referring to him as Big George. When Miller rose to speak, he warned that vouchers could jeopardize the federal government's duty to support schools in poor areas. By the time Miller concluded, Bush was in sync with him. "We have to make sure that those federal dollars get driven to the kids," Miller began, when Bush stepped in to complete the thought, "where they need to be." "Where they need to be," Miller agreed.
In his subsequent comments, Bush seized on an argument Miller made about the need for testing to establish which groups of students were learning. Bush became passionate, leaning forward and tapping his fingers on the table, starting the silverware jumping. "If you do not measure, you do not know," he said. The victims of poor accountability "are not the suburban kids," he said. "They're the inner-city kids. They're likely to be African-American kids in my state. Or kids whose parents do not speak English as a first language. It is so easy to quit!" 
Outside, once the group had assembled for the press, Miller was asked if vouchers had come up. They had, he said. "But much more happened today at this lunch than a discussion of vouchers," he continued. "This was really about President-elect Bush speaking in a very candid manner and a very forceful manner about, as he said, his passion that all children have an opportunity at first-class education."
In Washington, Bush's method -- his combination of planning, delegated authority and concentrated charm -- is going to be tested as it never was in Texas. In Texas, Bush's main job was appointing people, not managing a bureaucracy with influence over everything from agriculture to Zanzibar. 
Immediately after Bill Clinton won in 1992 with 43 percent of the vote, Bob Dole, then the Senate minority leader, declared that he would represent the majority, who "voted against" the new president. "The good news is, he's getting a honeymoon," Bob Dole said. "The bad news is that Bob Dole is going to be his chaperon." And that was while Clinton was making many of the same sorts of noises about bipartisanship that Bush is making now. Bush, who lost the popular vote and won the electoral vote on what he in another context might call legalisms, has not encountered any such overt partisan hostility. But whether he will win real cooperation from the Democrats is another question. At the meeting in Austin, he stacked the deck with centrist Democrats, the ones most susceptible to his ideas as well as his charm. Ted Kennedy, a leader in the Senate on education, was not in the room.
So far, Bush has demonstrated himself to be a quick wit but a terrible substantive improviser. This comes across when he is asked follow-up questions and, instead of expanding on an idea, or even using the standard politician's trick of wrapping the same idea in different words and regifting it, returns to a preprogrammed message. "We have one president, and our nation will speak with one voice, and the voice with which we will speak is the voice of President Clinton." Next question. "The nation needs to speak with one voice. We have one president." 
Bush's limited range was also demonstrated once the election deadlocked in Florida and he was forced to go off-plan and improvise. The results were not pretty. Recall those clumsy fake-Oval Office meetings, which one senior Bush adviser described to me as "kind of a disaster."
This raises the question of what will happen when Bush encounters a crisis not anticipated by his carefully laid plans. Here, his management theory, as he repeatedly reassured voters, guarantees that he will have good advisers. He will be called upon to decide among competing views, but it is impossible to know if he will farm out such tough calls to Cheney or even his father or rely instead upon his own much-advertised judgment. His self-confidence could turn out to be an asset or a devastating liability.
When one of his proposals got in trouble in Texas, Bush revealed an ability to cut his losses and jump to the front of someone else's parade. Already, the Bush camp is sending signals that he might retreat from his position on vouchers. He has also been wise in his choice of inheritance: a prosperous and peaceful nation. For those reasons, the smart money in Washington is betting that the Bush administration will bring less change than advertised. "Incrementalism will be the watchword of the Bush administration," predicted Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute and a former appointee in Bush the elder's administration. "This is not zip-bam-boom. This is the gray-flannel, buttoned-down, corporate administration."
Bush's system of delegating authority will be put through its paces. For all his talk of accountability, I had a hard time finding any Bush adviser who could give me a concrete example of Bush penalizing someone who had failed to make proper use of delegated powers. As governor, Bush did not have the authority to fire department heads. In six years, he demanded the resignation of only one of his appointees.
Bush's disgust with the press will probably cause him more difficulty in Washington than it did in Austin. And particularly if the economy sours, the American public may not be as indulgent toward a 50-something president who keeps banker's hours as it was to an ancient king like Reagan. 
Though he may not think so, Bush does have a lot to prove. But Clinton grew in the job. He adapted it to himself and himself to it, and Bush, though less malleable, will probably do so as well. There are signs that he recognizes the possibilities of his office. After the meeting with Latino leaders, held at an Austin high school, I asked Bush what he had gotten out of it, expecting a Clintonian answer about the richness of policy proposals he encountered in such sessions. Instead, as he walked to his limousine, Bush talked politics. "It helps me set a tone," he said. 
I asked again: Wasn't there any specific policy idea that could come out of such a meeting? "There wasn't much to this, you heard today -- there wasn't a lot of specificity," he replied. Then he paused by his open limousine door and said he had had one interesting thought. It had occurred to him, he said, while he listened to an ophthalmologist in the group. "Maybe one of the things we need to do is to figure out how to get free eyeglasses to the poor," Bush told me. He made a eureka motion, touching an open hand to his forehead and snatching it upward and away. "That's just what popped in my head," the president-elect explained, "when I heard what he said."
Free eyeglasses for the poor? It sounded more compassionate than conservative. Maybe it was just an effort to charm someone he suspected of being an Eastern liberal. Still, it suggested that more than a new administration might be in transition. It may be that Bush will show that he can play outside his limits, both the limits he has placed on his agenda and his personal limits of experience and curiosity. Maybe he will show some imagination and take some risks. That, as Bush himself might say, is what a leader does.

HEADLINE: Giving a New Life To People and Plastic 

BYLINE:  By MARILYN SHAPIRO 

 BODY:
CELESTE M. JOHNSON, chief executive, chief financial officer, technology inventor, product designer, creative director and chief bottle sorter at Obex Inc., operates a business in Stamford that gives new life to other people's trash and also gives a hand to people that others may have given up on.
 Despite overcoming the odds of starting a new business, shortages of materials and the current bias of investors against manufacturing start-ups, her small plastics recycling and manufacturing business continues to grow, testing the limits of her 13,000-square-foot factory and warehouse. 
 Her line of products, called Novawood Products, includes composting bins, landscape garden tiles and landscape ties, which are produced with a technology that allows the mixing of several grades of plastic. Ms. Johnson, a former securities analyst at Salomon Brothers, also hires and trains men on parole and probation. She is determined to make a difference, socially and environmentally. 
"I believe in giving more than plastic a second chance," she said.
Albert Robinson, 39, who has worked at Obex since May, has been in and out of jail most of his life and is now on parole for armed robbery.
"My boss, she believes in me," he said. "She's giving me a chance."
Her products are carried by Home Depot, the Burpee Seed Catalog and next year they will be featured in the National Wildlife Federation catalog.
Ms. Johnson also recently received a pledge from Garden Magic Kids in California to use her products to provide raised garden beds for a project with the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
With a grant from the Kirk Douglas Foundation, the project already has 165 schools on its waiting list. The Garden Magic program chose Ms. Johnson's product because the nonprofit California corporation wanted to use only recycled plastic materials in their gardens, said King Hemple, whose wife, Linda, founded the program.
Ms. Johnson "rises quickly to the top because there are so few people who design for gardens with recycled plastic," Mr. Hemple said. "There are manufacturers that put together raised beds and trellises of virgin plastic, but we're pledged to put in the materials that are recycled."
Despite such successes, however, Ms. Johnson's business has lurched from one cash flow crisis to another over the last decade. 
Obex, Ms. Johnson realizes, is at a crossroad. Getting investment capital is crucial to the future of the company and its eight employees. In the face of what she said is a steadily growing demand for her products and the need to expand her plant, Ms. Johnson said she knows she must expand her sales and office staff to concentrate on product development. It is the classic, small business crunch.
But finding that manufacturing capital in a dot-com world is not easy. Ms. Johnson is learning that capital procurement is more difficult than finding an Internet start-up making a profit.
"She's got great technology," said Dennis Nemura, a business adviser to Ms. Johnson. "We just need to find her investors and a continuous source of supply. The whole recycling effort has been difficult for that."
Over the last decade, plastics recycling has not had a stellar track record with investors. Because of existing technologies, manufacturers of recycled plastic products were typically restricted to recycling only certain grades of plastic. Finding a supply of specifically graded material became a problem. In fact, many plastic recycling businesses, founded in the 1990's, are no longer in business.
Industry experts said many companies are battling to overcome what happened to the recycled paper business. Since the late 1980's, paper manufacturers have lost billions of dollars because the industry seized upon the idea of recycled paper pulp for an end-product that never materialized.
"A lot of financiers and service providers often equate recycling with environment, and with that comes the bad feelings of the lost money," said Mary Ann Remolador, the program manager of Northeast Recycling Council. "Recycling has a bad rap. They lump all recycling ventures together, and this has just snowballed into a reputation based on misinformation." 
Today, in many instances, if a product is made from recycled content, companies do not mention that fact for fear they will lose the financing they are seeking, said Ms. Remolador, whose group is a nonprofit organization based in Brattleboro, Vt., that promotes the environmental and economic benefits of recycling in the Northeast.
If a recycling products company wants financing, it hasto show investors that it is in business to make money. Good intentions cannot be the basis of a company, Ms. Remolador said. 
Economic data from the Northeast Recycling Council shows that, in 10 Northeast states, there are more than 13,000 recycling and re-use businesses. They employ more than 206,000 people and generate $44 billion in annual revenues, Ms. Remolador said. 
The continuing problem of source materials limits the amount of products a company can manufacture. More than 81 percent of the country's population in more than 20,000 communities has access to recycling programs, said Judy Dunbar, manager of technical assistance programs at the American Plastics Council. The council has tracked the plastics recycling and product manufacturing industry since 1994, and while plastics available for recycling have leveled out, the number of companies that make recycled plastic products has grown. As a result, the scramble for sources of recycled materials is intense.
"The economics are very tight," Mr. Nemura said. "But there is a place for this and the neat thing about Obex is the technology because Ms. Johnson can process co-mingled plastics," which is a mixture of different grades.
Rust Muirhead, a former board member of the Connecticut Development Authority, has been following Ms. Johnson's business since she first came to the authority nine years ago seeking a state grant. The authority granted her a loan and Mr. Muirhead became intrigued with the idea of plastic recycling and Ms. Johnson's technology. He now serves on the company's board of advisers.
Novawood Products, he said, is highly innovative with a potential to dominate the plastic lumber market business, but product manufacturing is not where the capital market is placing its money these days.
"At the end of the day, it's a manufacturing business and manufacturing as an industry has had a problem accessing capital, particularly in the niche markets," he said. "It's not a sexy product or a dot.com."
But he said that Novawood Products have a very impressive year-to-year growth in the areas where consumers can find them.
"When you look at the worth of the company you have to look at the product," he said, "You can take a sizable chunk of business from the deck business, compost bins and landscaping materials. Once she can settle the capital issues, you can have a profitable return."
Ms. Johnson admitted she's sacrificed "a lot" in the last 10 years to make her business work. Mr. Nemura called her efforts, "heroic" and Mr. Muirhead said Ms. Johnson has more energy and resourcefulness than most people he's run across in his business career.
"She is the company," he said.
For her part, Ms. Johnson said she's trying to do the right thing for her community and the environment. She has gathered a loyal legion of area garden club members, who routinely bring their used plastic to her door, as well as companies and towns that are now taking advantage of Obex's ability to reuse the variety of plastics that has stymied plastics recycling in the past.
"Community, environment, technology," she said philosophically, "It's the difference between doing things right and doing the right thing."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Interview With President-Elect George W. Bush 

 BODY:
 Excerpts from a 75-minute interview with President-elect George W. Bush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., on Friday.

Q. Do you think much about the historic nature of what will happen on Jan. 20 -- about being only the second son of a president to assume the office?

A. No. I mean, I think about assuming the presidency, of course. But I don't -- I don't think you can really define your position in history while you are alive. I mean, I am defining it, but I don't think it gets defined properly until people have passed on and objective historians start to take a look at how a presidency fits into the -- into the whole flow of history. So I don't worry about it. I view short-term history as generally political documents reflecting the prejudice of the writer. I don't think true history is -- that you really get a picture of history until a period of time has lapsed. And so I don't worry about standing and -- yeah, it's unique. I am more interested in what he and Mom will be thinking than some kind of stand.

Q. What do you mean by that?

A. Well, I love the thought that they are leaving in essence a legacy of people that have followed them into public service -- a son or two sons, governors of states, and now one is going to be the president. I think that is a great testimony to them.

Q. You think that makes them proud, too?

A. I'm sure it does, yeah. It's got to. I mean, we don't sit around and say, you know, "How proud exactly are you?" Laughs.

Q. Does it concern you at all, with the hullabaloo over the Ashcroft nomination, that no matter what you think of him, the choice has sent a message that may disturb some Americans?

A. No, because I think -- I know that this is the short term. I think he's going to do a good job. I mean, every press conference I have or press availability I have, his name always comes up. You've been there. You haven't been to them all, but every time, the same question arises, which is fine.

Q. Does it worry you at all that those questions mean there are some Americans reading into something about you from that choice?

A. No, because I know -- my point, Frank, is that I know that he's going to do a fine job. I mean, he's going to be the attorney general of all people. He will enforce the civil rights laws, and when it's all said and done, people are going to say, "Now I understand why President-elect Bush made the choice."

Q. Have you talked to him about the enforcement of civil rights laws?

A. Yeah. Listen, Frank, when I talked to John about the job, asking him -- in interviewing him, I knew that there was going to be some, you know, that there were going to be some questions. He could end up being a lightning rod. I mean, I felt that way on -- and if it had not been him, it would have been somebody else. That's just part of the process.

Q. Couldn't you have chosen someone else who would not have been a lightning rod?

A. For any -- for all positions?

Q. For that position. That's one that is a particular lightning rod.

A. What happens if I pick one for secretary of state? You know, my point is that somebody would be made a lightning rod. I am comfortable with my choice of John Ashcroft. I think he's going to be a very fine attorney general. Anyway, to answer your question, I have confidence in his ability to do the job, and therefore, believe people will begin to say, "Gosh, I understand." And I hope -- you know, you noticed me yesterday talking about that he had been elected five times. I can't remember if he had been re-elected as attorney general, but let's call it four times. I said that for a reason. Somebody who is -- in a state like Missouri, somebody who is, you know, common-sensical, down to earth, a decent person, is going to get elected as many times as he has. Somebody that is not that way will end up getting defeated. And the defeat of John Ashcroft against -- in his race against Mel Carnahan -- was just an unusual situation. Secondly, I believe that he handled the defeat in a gracious way, which speaks to the character of the man. He was unbelievably gracious in defeat.

Q. I think a lot of people said that. As people have begun looking back at his past statements, though, some have raised concerns. He spoke to the Southern Partisan magazine ----

A. Southern what?

Q. Southern Partisan magazine last year, and said, "You've got a heritage of defending Southern patriots like Lee, Jackson and Davis." He said, "Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more. We've got to stand up and speak in this respect or else will be taught that these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honor to some perverted agenda." It has circulated around a lot.

A. Well, what are they trying to say about John Ashcroft in that?

Q. The question, I think, was what was he trying to say?

A. You need to ask him that. I'm sure he will be asked that question. I suspect what he was saying is that there is something noble about the Southern history. That they were fighting for -- it's like what they tried to ascribe to Gale Norton. She was talking about states' rights, the ability of states to run their business. It's been a philosophical argument throughout our history -- the relationship between the federal government and the states. She was in no way, shape or form embracing slavery, and neither was John Ashcroft. . . .

Q. Is there any lesson from what happened to Linda Chavez?

A. From my perspective?

Q. Yeah. What's the moral of that story?

A. I think you ought to take her -- what she said. She said she made some mistakes.

Q. You agree with that -- she did make some mistakes?

A. Well, she's a fine person. I'm sorry she -- I truly am sorry she's not a part of my cabinet.

Q. Do you feel misled by her?

A. I wouldn't say that.

Q. You think she made some mistakes?

A. She said she made mistakes. That's all I can tell you. I'm glad Elaine Chao agreed to serve. She'll be good. I'm proud of our cabinet, by the way. I think it's going to be a very interesting group of people. It's a very strong group of folks. A lot of them have held office. Some of them haven't. I'm always mindful of what Sam Rayburn told Lyndon Johnson when he first saw the Kennedy administration. He said, "Gosh, I just wish one of them had run for sheriff." And that's why I'm very comfortable with an Ashcroft or a Norton. They not only ran for sheriff, they ran for statewide offices. Yeah, there's something about Gale Norton. She comes from an environmentally sensitive state and was elected twice in Colorado. But it should not surprise you, Frank, that I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration. It's part of that big swath of red on the map. . . .

Q. Gale Norton has talked about the property rights issue of having the federal government compensate land owners for loss of use.

A. The concept of the federal government taking people's property without compensation is something that I agree with Gale Norton on. It should not. There ought to be a balance between, obviously, the public interest and private property. And a lot of people in my state and in the Western states feel that balance is not there. Gale Norton's pick -- I talked yesterday about A.N.W.R. the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . I mean, I was amazed to read critics of her saying, "My goodness she is for drilling in A.N.W.R." Well, so am I. It should not -- I mean, people shouldn't be shocked that I'm picking somebody who agrees with me. That's what a president does.

Q. Are you interested in undoing President Clinton's policy of restricting logging in roadless national forests?

A. I'm interested in every one of these executive orders and regulations, reviewing them, which we will do, and I will let you know what I intend to do the day after I'm sworn, or the day of, or shortly after I'm sworn in. Let's put it to you that way.

Q. It's interesting you say that. A lot of presidents have come in and immediately in the first week or two done a whole bunch -- not just undone, but done a whole bunch of executive orders.

A. Right. In this case, it looks like the first task is going to be to review all the ones that are -- the avalanche of regulations and executive orders that have taken place in --

Q. But the avalanche disturbs you?

A. I wouldn't say disturbs me. It's an interesting exit strategy.

Q. On the roadless areas, do you have an instinct of where you're going to be going on this?

A. My instinct is I'm going to review it carefully, David. You know, it's interesting you said that. We've got lawyers. And I haven't been briefed recently on the law. But we do have lawyers analyzing the very, you know, premise that you just mentioned -- that is, nothing can be done. . . .
There's several ways to address these issues. But we're going to look at them all. . . . I would not have done that that way. I would have called in the governors and senators and local folks and said, "This is of interest to me. This is a fine piece of American real estate that I think we ought to protect. Why don't we come together to figure out how best to do so?" As opposed to unilaterally moving.

Q. But you've expressed a lot of concern, in the past, during the campaign, of balancing that preservation instinct against the livelihoods and other things.

A. Well, I will give you an example. This is where Ms. Norton, I'm confident, will probably come under fire. We need to drill for gas. We need to review -- and I said this in the campaign. None of this is new. But you didn't have to suffer through these endless hours of my speeches, my mangled syntax. Anyway, I've said that we are going to review parcel by parcel Western lands to determine the cost-benefit ratio for America. We need energy. There is a point of view sometimes expressed by the vice president during the campaign that "oh, don't worry; we will conserve our way out of the crisis." Or the pinch -- let me put it to you that way. Conservation is important. That's going to be an important ingredient . . . but we need energy. The California crunch really is the result of not enough power-generating plants and then not enough power to power the power of generating plants. We need to move natural gas, whether it be from Alaska or on our Western lands. All those properties need to be reviewed. There's going to be some in which it doesn't make any sense to drill. . . .

Q. There's another set of executive orders --

A. I must say, I'll be glad to tell you, we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity, and I have yet to sit down with them and review options yet. But you're right. To the extent that there are some of these promulgations that require reviews and then a piece of legislation to overturn them, which is ----

Q. Hard going.

A. It seems like it, particularly since it doesn't take much to block action in the United States Senate.

Q. There's another set of executive orders that actually aren't recent ones that date further back regarding abortion. I think one comes up Feb. 15. It's the "Mexico City rule."

A. I just have to -- I will look at all executive orders.

Q. This rule, this has been debated for a long time, but this issue is whether or not -- a philosophical issue of whether or not -- the United States government should be supporting international organizations that promote abortions in foreign countries. Do you have an instinct on this?

A. My instinct is I -- to the extent that organizations promote abortion, I -- let me start over. Organizations that promote abortions are organizations I don't want to support.

Q. With taxpayer money.

A. Yeah, right, with taxpayer money. I have not reviewed this particular order. . . . I mean, I'm having people review all these. One of the things that I am mindful of is not only picking people, but building a team. I hope history will say that George W. was effective at building a team. That not only means competent people, but it means forging them via the honest and open discussion that is necessary for decisions to be made -- forging the groundwork for honest and open discussions. So when I was in Washington, you know, I had a breakfast with the National Security Team and had a very frank discussion about a lot of issues. I've provoked it, because I wanted to see the interaction. And I didn't need to provoke it, because there was a lot of opinion.

Q. And you don't have a shy group.

A. No, they didn't. People got to understand something, David. A lot of them are talking about the Iron Triangle. Bruni and all them talked about loyalty and Bush demands loyalty. Here's loyalty. Loyalty is somebody who walks into my office and says, "Here is my opinion," or "I hear you are thinking this way. I don't agree with you." Loyalty is somebody who walks into the National Security Team and says, "You believe this. I believe this." And it's a two-way street, by the way. A loyal president, someone loyal to the team, the chief says, "I expect to hear from you. I don't want to muzzle you. I want to know." And that opinions be open, and that I listen, and I decide. And once the decision is made, everybody binds together and implements. In order for that to happen, people have to be comfortable with each other -- to succeed depends on our ability as human beings to relate. So spending time with the folks, just watching everybody interact and letting them see how I respond and my style. I want them to see the decision-making process and how it works.

Q. The Mideast: It seems clear President Clinton is not going to get a deal in the next week. Are you coming prepared to offer something different?

A. I really don't want to comment in your newspaper about his plan until peace has -- until it has run its course, and it hasn't finished yet. We're speculating that nothing will happen. We'll see. But I think it's important for our country to speak with one voice. Any plan has to be agreed upon by the parties. Any outline has to be something that the parties are comfortable with. Doesn't matter whether I'm comfortable with it. It matters whether they are comfortable with it. And that's going to be the definition of a successful outline ultimately, you know.

Q. Do you have any new ideas you bring into this?

A. If I do, I'm not going to lay them out now.

Q. On the Balkans, do you plan to raise with the allies soon your idea about reducing our presence in Kosovo.

A. I think they are very aware of it. . . . I'm in consultation with our allies. In other words, at some point during the campaign, people began to say, and I think the word got overseas, "Oh, he's just precipitously going to withdraw." And that's not the case. Yes, I'll make it clear to them. I think Colin Powell will make it clear to them that this is our intention . . . That we'd like for them to be the peacekeepers. And they know that.

Q. Do you have deadlines in mind?

A. No, I don't have deadlines in mind. I don't think it's fair to have deadlines. Listen, I'll honor the agreements that the president has -- that our country has made. And we've got an agreement to be in the Balkans. And it's going to take a while, and I understand that.

Q. The president is also leaving a partial deal with North Korea on the table.

A. Yeah, he brought it up to me. . . . You know, I am comfortable with the idea of using food to help nations in need. . . . Again, there is a lot of these deals where there is an outline with the deal, but part of any, seems like to me, agreement with North Korea must enable this country to be able to verify that they are upholding their end of the agreement.

Q. What worries you more when you think about China, a strong China that begins deploying more weapons, becomes more aggressive in the area, or a weak China that is internally having great difficulty?

A. That's an interesting question. I would hope that there would be a strong market-oriented country that does not feel the need to spend a lot of its G.N.P. on offensive weaponry. . . . China is not going to be weak. It is still going to have a military presence. . . .

Q. Internally weak?

A. Internally weak is going to mean that there is uncertainty and instability in the government. . . . The cultural revolution, for example, to me, is the kind of thing that the world would like to avoid because of the uncertainty of what China would look like after a cultural revolution. It was an unbelievable period of time in that country. It was a period of time where -- it was just an unleashing. It was chaotic. It was anarchistic in many ways. To me, particularly as China develops as the military power, a chaotic China would be something that should cause great concern to people in the region and to us. . . .
I would like to see predictability when it comes to people with whom we are dealing. That is not to say that I am not going to push for freedoms. And I agree with the president to trade with China. As a matter of fact, I agreed with him to the point that during the campaign I supported his initiative.
I'm trying to figure out if your question is a trick question.

Q. No, it was pretty straightforward.

A. We're just going to have a lot of work. . . . Redefining the role of the United States from enablers to keep the peace to enablers to keep the peace from peacekeepers is going to be an assignment. And national missile defense is going to be an assignment of the secretary of state. I am very aware of that.

Q. Would you go ahead even if it looked like the Chinese would build up their nuclear forces to overwhelm the missile defense system ?

A. They are building up their nuclear forces. . . .

Q. But right now, they are nowhere near what Russia, for example, has deployed. . . .

A. Correct. But nevertheless . . . Russia's nuclear force load is decreasing. They China are increasing. And we've just got to explain why we are doing what we are doing. National missile defense is -- let me start over. . . . The Chinese know and the Russians know that there will be no system developed in the immediate future or foreseeable future, is a better word, that can conceivably intercept a multiple launch regime. . . . You know that. They know that. . . . I'm kind of rambling on here. But I thought it was very interesting when at some point Russian President Vladimir V. Putin said, "You start talking about interception on the launch and theater-based protections." I found that to be an interesting statement. When I ever visit, I look forward to exploring that discussion with him, because it's precisely what I told Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov in my meeting with him prior to the election.
And they've raised great objections about missile defense, but I explained to them that I understand that the technology and the will, for that matter, of some in Congress will really mean that initially we will be deploying systems that will prevent the accidental launch of the ones and twos, with the ability for some nation like Iran to eventually say to us, "And we've got one aimed at Israel. And what are you going to do about it? . . . "
One thing I did talk about in the campaign that hasn't gotten much focus is our willingness to reduce our own nuclear capacity, to reduce the offensive nature of our inventory and enhance the defensive posture of America.

Q. Did that issue come up in your Pentagon discussions?

A. No, it didn't, interestingly enough.

Q. How low do you think you could bring the American arsenal?

A. That's what we are going to find out. I'm going to make our case to parties involved. . . . I have said that one of our top priorities with Russia is to work with them on the spread of technologies, as well as nuclear safety. . . . I also have said it's going to be up to Russia to decide whether or not it is a place for -- it's a welcoming place for our capital. They have to make the decisions on matters of real law and sound accounting principles. They have to assure capital that it is a safe haven. That you can get a reasonable rate of return. That's up to Russia.

Q. Are they heading in the wrong direction on that?

A. Well, you mean in terms of, for example, stifling free press? Yeah, that concerns me. As much as I'd like to stifle it occasionally. Laughter. He Putin has pledged to root out corruption. I think that's going to be a very important part, but it's his choice to make. That's the point I'm trying to make. It's hard for America to fashion Russia. . . .

Q. If you look back now at Russia, Mexico, the Asia crisis, clearly there will be financial crises in your time as president.

A. Absolutely. Yeah, particularly if our own economy continues to sputter. . . . As I understand, part of the issue in Russia was we kind of encouraged them to raise taxes on a system that people were avoiding taxes to begin with, and then the tax load became so unbearable that it was impossible to pay, as opposed to restructuring taxes, to have low taxes that would really encourage growth and more tax revenues into the economy. . . .
The I.M.F. at times has made kind of decisions that really have affected growth of economies and really have been clobbered savers and the middle class. The other thing I think the I.M.F. can do a better job of is anticipating issues. The problem is that that's easy to say, but I also recognize that globalization causes capital just to stampede throughout the world now like never before.

Q. You have said in some other papers you were increasingly pessimistic about the economy.

A. Yeah. Because the numbers are beginning to come in to show that there are layoffs. There's the energy crisis they're expecting. The California situation is going to affect the economy. People are not making their targeted forecasts. I'm not pessimistic for the long run. Quite the contrary. I'm very optimistic for the long run for the country. I just don't know the definition of short and long run yet.

Q. How quickly do you think the federal government needs to act on that in a real way?

A. That's part of the strategy that we're now developing. First of all, Alan Greenspan acted quickly. . . .

Q. In what way do you feel you can stimulate the economy ?

A. And that's tax cuts. Tax relief. . . .

Q. And are you willing then to have it go through Congress in some pieces, if it looks like that will do it faster or do it better?

A. Here's what I am willing to tell you. I am willing to tell you that to the extent that the entire package gets passed, I will work with Congress. I want the entire package passed. And I'm answering all kinds of questions about speeding up, slowing down. Those are all tactical decisions. The key is that the economic recovery plan be implemented. And I want to talk to you quickly about the merits of marginal rate cuts. The folks are paying in essence a tax because of high energy bills. When you couple that with -- and by the way, the home heating bills are now beginning to hit people's wallets. And you couple that with a potential slowdown and the effects on wages, what it places in jeopardy now is the ability of people to handle their own personal debt. There is a lot of focus on national debt, and that is a legitimate focus. Part of the national debt will be relieved as result of lock-boxing Social Security. But the overhang there is an overhang of personal debt on working people that is substantial. We had as one of the C.E.O.'s told us there in Austin, I think she said 61 million Americans have $10,000 in debt or more. That's a lot.

Q. Beyond their houses.

A. Yeah. Credit card debt. And we need to worry about that.

HEADLINE: Security for Inauguration to Be Tightest Ever 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
With thousands of demonstrators expected here next Saturday, the law enforcement authorities are planning the tightest security ever for a presidential inauguration.
 Police officers will be stationed every few feet along Pennsylvania Avenue. For the first time, people going to watch the inaugural parade will have to pass through checkpoints where bags can be searched. Signs with long handles will be confiscated. And most of the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument will be off limits. 
 "We don't know how many protesters there will be or what they plan to do," Charles H. Ramsey, the District of Columbia police chief, said in an interview. "Those we have talked with say they intend to be peaceful, but being peaceful and being lawful are different things."
Some of the protesters are expected to be among those who took part in the violent demonstrations during a world trade meeting in Seattle in 1999 and in the protests here last April during meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Others will be protesting what they believe to be faulty election procedures that led to George W. Bush's victory. Still others will be demonstrating on issues like the death penalty, the environment, the minimum wage and aid to Israel. 
During the swearing-in ceremony, the National Organization for Women will hold a rally several blocks away at the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue.
While the crowd is gathering at the Capitol for Mr. Bush's swearing in, the Rev. Al Sharpton plans to lead a march nearby, from Stanton Park southeast of Union Station to the Supreme Court. 
At noon, as Mr. Bush is taking the oath of office, Mr. Sharpton will take an oath, he said, to uphold the Voting Rights Act and to establish uniform voting standards across the country. Then, while Mr. Bush is delivering his Inaugural Address, Mr. Sharpton will give his own address.
Law enforcement officials said they had heard that counterdemonstrations would be mounted by conservative organizations, including Loud Citizen, which demonstrated outside Vice President Al Gore's home as the outcome of the presidential election was being contested. 
These will be the first substantial protests during an inauguration since antiwar demonstrators protested at Richard M. Nixon's second inauguration, in 1973. The National Park police said then that there were 60,000 protesters. The demonstrations were mostly orderly, with some minor scuffles and a few arrests.
Protest organizers who have come forward said they did not plan on civil disobedience next week. "We're going to be noisy, we're going to be seen, but we're not going to try to shut down the event," said Adam Eidinger, an organizer for a coordinating group called the Justice Action Movement.
Brian Becker, co-director of the International Action Center, a New York group that is organizing buses of protesters on the East Coast, said: "We don't want to be tear-gassed or create a war zone. As George Bush proceeds up Pennsylvania Avenue and as the eyes of the world focus on this, the world will see there is a very divided United States. We will be all along the parade route."
But police officials said they were prepared for more violent demonstrators like those who called themselves anarchists and were in Seattle in 1999.
For the first time, the inauguration has been designated a "national special security event," which means that the Secret Service is in overall charge of security arrangements. More than a dozen law enforcement agencies will be involved, including the Capitol police, the Supreme Court police, the National Park police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and police forces from suburban Maryland and Virginia.
But the biggest burden will fall on the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. The force generally received high marks in April when the financial meetings went on as planned and the city emerged unscathed, though some protesters complained of rough treatment.
All the department's 3,600 officers will be on duty. Chief Ramsey said the demonstrators would be free to exercise their right to say anything they wanted and display any hand-held sign as long as it did not have a long handle, but would not be permitted to interfere with the event or to threaten the safety of the spectators or those in the parade.
A point of contention is likely to be the decision of the authorities to prohibit demonstrators from using stilts or giant puppets, favorite props in recent protests. The notion, said Jim Mackin, a spokesman for the Secret Service, is that the stilts could be used as clubs and the puppets could be used to hide weapons.
The Capitol police rejected a request for a permit in the park between Union Station and the Capitol because military salute canons will be fired there.
The Mall will be closed to the public between Third and Fourth Streets and between Seventh and 14th Streets. These will be staging areas for the parade. Two Metro stations, Smithsonian and Archives-Navy, will be closed. This is the first time subway stops have been shut for an inauguration.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Fasten Your Seatbelt. This Ride Is Almost Over.

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE 

 BODY:
UNLIKE President Bill Clinton, I am not an overly sentimental sort. I do not generally bite my bottom lip at emotional moments. 
 But like Mr. Clinton, I will be leaving the White House on Jan. 20, and I am covering him as he makes his farewell tour in these waning days of his presidency -- his last trip overseas, his last trip to the Midwest, to New Hampshire, to Arkansas, and eventually, at midday Saturday, his last trip out of town. So, in recent days, both Bill Clinton and I have been biting our lips and looking back. 
 In his final presidential lap, Mr. Clinton has been drawing attention to the litany of accomplishments he believes his administration has achieved, everything from reducing the unemployment rate and wiping out the budget deficit to saving 138 lives by properly funding the United States Coast Guard. I, in contrast, have been thinking about the many lighter moments of the Clinton years.
Like when the president carried a spear to the back of Air Force One during a trip to Africa and quipped that he might bring it to his next news conference. Then, as reporters laughed, he mulled the realities of Washington and said it might make more sense for him to bring along the other gift he received during the trip -- a shield.
On those many presidential trips, Mr. Clinton could be rather zany as he stalked up and down the aisles of his plane between card games. Aides have been saying in these waning days of his presidency that Mr. Clinton regularly wore his seat belt aboard Air Force One and will thus not have any trouble abiding by Federal Aviation Administration requirements once he returns to commercial aviation. I know better.
He once stood in the aisle as the plane headed for the sky and showed me how his former press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, used to imitate a flying nun on takeoff. He flapped his arms wildly and leaned so far forward he could have tumbled down the stairs in front of him. 
Sentimentality is surging all around as Mr. Clinton's presidency fades.
Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser and one of his longest-serving aides, joined Mr. Clinton in New Hampshire last week and donned the fluorescent yellow and purple winter jacket he wore while campaigning with Candidate Clinton in the snow in 1992. His wife had banished it to the back of the closet for the last eight years, but it came out for Mr. Clinton's goodbye tour, for old times' sake.
The president has been as busy as ever shaking hands and signing autographs for those well aware that his days are numbered. In a diner in Manchester, N.H., a Clinton backer eager for an 11th hour presidential signature resorted to desperate means to secure something for him to sign. The man tore off the corner of an Out of Order sign hanging on the urinal in the men's room, and presented that to the president.
Mr. Clinton's team of speechwriters certainly have their unforgettable moments. One aide has framed the speech he helped prepare last month when the president first reacted to Vice President Al Gore's concession. The president had rewritten the speech, crossing out every line in the original draft, except the words vice and president and Gore.
COVERING the White House, I was in on a little secret of Mr. Clinton, and most other politicians. The president frequently said the same thing to audience after audience, making each think it was something fresh just for them. He gave the same introduction. He told the same jokes. He delivered the same applause lines.
In one of the classics that continues into his final days, he recalls the criticism that former President Bush used to level against him: "I was so naive when my predecessor referred to me, in rather derisive terms, as the governor of a small Southern state, I thought he was paying me a compliment," Mr. Clinton said in Chicago on Wednesday. At this point, as the audience laughed, he paused for a moment -- as he always does. Then he said, "And I still do." The applause then increased a decibel or two -- as it always does.
The most oft-repeated line of the Clinton presidency was not "I feel your pain," which the president may have uttered only once. It was "It's a big deal," which he said about virtually everything he talked about.
Elections were big deals, and issues were big deals, and whatever happened to be on his mind at the moment was a big deal. Mark Knoller, a CBS News reporter who has covered presidents on and off since 1976, found one speech, a fund-raiser for Representative Ron Klink of Pennsylvania, in which the president used the phrase nine times.
There were other Clinton-isms, too, that would come out of his mouth regularly, confounding his speechwriting staff. "This dog wont hunt." "Like a turtle on a fence post." "As tight as a tick." And the phrase that popped into his head in New Hampshire in 1992 when his candidacy was nearly doomed and he declared that he would keep fighting for the voters "until the last dog dies."
He recalled that one last week, as he returned to Dover, N.H., and declared, with a smile, that the last dog is still barking.

HEADLINE: An Appraisal; 
Bill Clinton's Mixed Legacy

 BODY:
A recent editorial cartoon by Matt Davies of The Journal News showed Bill Clinton trying to make a diving catch of a huge ball. The ball, labeled "Greatness," lands just out of his reach. The drawing provided a haunting visual metaphor for the near-miss quality of a presidency that never quite measured up to the potential that every supporter and most critics knew resided within Mr. Clinton. Yet simply stating the fact that Mr. Clinton is not destined to enter the pantheon of great, universally respected presidents does not capture the richness, complexity and drama of these eight years. No citizen is likely to forget them or, for that matter, to quit debating the man's remarkable gifts and the narcissistic indiscipline that diminished them. 
 His White House years have been been marked by prosperity, rancor, achievements, disappointments and something approaching a national psychodrama involving Mr. Clinton himself. Trying to separate Mr. Clinton from the times he presided over is like trying, in Yeats's phrase, to tell the dancer from the dance. Mr. Clinton presented himself as an agent for change. But with or without him, the 90's were bound to be a decade when change rolled across the economy, international relations and the political culture with a grinding inexorability. Historians will surely record Mr. Clinton as the first president to be impeached since 1868 and as having presided over America's longest economic expansion. That's the easy sentence to write. But they may also come to see him as the shaper of some main themes of governance for the 21st century. President-elect George W. Bush, who gained a lot of votes from Clinton fatigue, will not be able to ignore the policies Mr. Clinton installed or the expectations he created. 
 Clinton fatigue is a catch phrase for the public disenchantment engendered by Mr. Clinton's lapses. When he failed, he failed big. First came health care and its secretive process run by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. The refusal to be open about Whitewater was a joint responsibility, but Mr. Clinton's later fateful decision to deceive Mrs. Clinton, a grand jury and all Americans about sexual adventurism in the Oval Office was a mistake for which he alone was responsible.
By contrast, when Mr. Clinton achieved, it was in increments. Historians may never discern a grand architectural edifice of achievements on the scale of the New Deal or Great Society. Yet those increments add up to an impressive benchmark.

Setting a Course
In his book on President John F. Kennedy, Richard Reeves argues that a presidency can be measured by a handful of fateful decisions. For Mr. Clinton, a string of decisions on the economy belies his reputation as a poll-driven politician. In many cases, Mr. Clinton relied instead on gut instincts and was proved right. In 1993, for instance, he rejected the advice of many Democrats to stick with a liberal agenda of spending programs. Instead, he listened to his chief economic adviser, Robert Rubin, and went with fiscal restraint. His tax increase on the top brackets angered conservatives and led to the loss of Congress to the Republicans in 1994. But without a stringent fiscal policy, the United States would not today be trying to decide what to do with surpluses instead of deficits.
Another bold move came when he stood up to his party's orthodoxy and embraced opening trade barriers with the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, the accord to create a new World Trade Organization and the upgrading of trade relations with China. It is too soon to be positive that these will bring the benefits Mr. Clinton promised, but there is no doubting that he planted himself on the right side of history.
Mr. Clinton has been at his best and most memorable in advocating engagement in the world in order to lift everyone's hopes for freedom and economic growth. If Ronald Reagan reasserted America's military power, Mr. Clinton reasserted its economic power in the information age. His growing confidence enabled him to act audaciously, first intervening to save the Mexican economy and later to prevent a collapse in Asia. These steps were among the president's finest moments.

Days of Battle
As a new president, Mr. Clinton did not truly find his identity until adversity struck. It came like a thunderclap in November of 1994 when the voters handed the Congress over to Newt Gingrich and the Republicans. Mr. Clinton seemed wobbly at first, and perhaps overly obsessed with polls. But Mr. Clinton's pride in his ability to bounce back after a heavy punch was justified. Early in 1995, he stood up to the Republican leadership and later allowed the government to close rather than accept the Gingrich revolution's punitive budget cuts.
Two of Mr. Clinton's biggest achievements flowed from that standoff. First, on the environment, the president was persuaded by Vice President Al Gore and others to fight Republican efforts to eviscerate the Clean Water Act. Thereafter he vetoed repeated Congressional attempts to weaken environmental standards and compiled the best conservation record of any president since Theodore Roosevelt. Among his achievements were tighter air pollution controls, new protections for wilderness areas, national forests and national parks, and the negotiation of a still-unratified global warming treaty.
The second outgrowth of the confrontation with Congress was Mr. Clinton's determination to build a progressive record step by step. Among the accomplishments are an expanded earned-income tax credit for millions of poor families; a health initiative covering 3.3 million poor children; welfare-to-work aid enacted in the years subsequent to his signing of welfare reform; a doubling of Head Start and school aid for the disadvantaged; and an expansion in college tuition aid for low- and moderate-income students. The administration estimates that in all an extraordinary $64 billion is now newly channeled annually to working-class and poor families, far more than might have been enacted in one big program. None of this can outweigh the failure to install the universal health care he promised in 1992. But for the first time in at least two decades, the lowest-income families have gained from good times, and indeed have gained the most.

A Dangerous World
As the first post-cold-war president, Mr. Clinton has had difficulty finding a theme to sum up his approach to the world. He was slow to engage, in part because his first two years were spent on the economy and health care. His inattention led to missteps in the Balkans and Africa. But nowhere, this page not excepted, could one find flawless guidance and predictions on Serbia and Rwanda. Yet the president got his footing and developed a distinctive style, and he leaves office as the most authoritative figure in international diplomacy. He often succeeded by becoming involved personally with other leaders. The most dramatic instance was his effort to advance democracy and free markets in Russia by allying the United States with Boris Yeltsin, despite the Russian president's erratic leadership. That was a tough call that came with a cost as international indifference to corruption encouraged criminalization of the Russian economy and soured many Russians on American leadership. But the decision helped thwart a resurgence of Communism and secure crucial Russian support for a negotiated end to the bombing campaign that forced the Serbs out of Kosovo and hastened the departure of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia.
Mr. Clinton's personal involvement with Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak of Israel, and with Yasir Arafat and King Hussein of Jordan, surely speeded the possibility of a settlement in the Middle East, even though a final deal has eluded him. Less noticed was his willingness to make some tough decisions to try to bring trust to combatants in Northern Ireland and between India and Pakistan and to ease tensions with North Korea. Mr. Clinton's early emphasis on human rights in China did not achieve results and led to a confrontation over Taiwan. He salvaged relations with the Chinese by emphasizing economics. But the overarching theme of his presidency has been the twin impulses to embrace economic globalization and to get warring countries in various regions talking.
Finally, there was the bold decision to wage a bombing campaign in Kosovo. It was this campaign that expanded the role of NATO for the first time to include combatting ethnic and genocidal conflict at its European back door, which united European powers around American leadership. In general, Mr. Clinton has rightly broadened the definition of national security to encompass the spread of disease, poverty and ethnic strife, ending his term with honorable involvement in the world and revitalization of the United Nations and regional peacekeeping alliances.

Moments of Truth and Untruth
Of course if these decisions were moments of truth in which Mr. Clinton faced a tough set of choices and made the right call, his biographers can never ignore the catastrophic ethical lapses that punctuated his tenure. The conduct ranged from overt lying about Monica Lewinsky to inhibiting the Whitewater real estate investigations to flooding his 1996 campaign with foreign money. By allowing his attorney general, Janet Reno, to block a full investigation of the 1996 fund-raising abuses, he blotted both their records. The impeachment will always stand as the emblem of Mr. Clinton's character flaws and failure to achieve the greatness inherent in his better self.
Yet his self-indulgence and self-pity and recklessness have come, like it or not, intertwined with great empathy, especially for those who have been victims because of their race, gender or sexual orientation. As he leaves the presidency, we hope Mr. Clinton will find a way to use those gifts on the national and world stage. He will likely have a different role than Jimmy Carter's strictly humanitarian one of opposing poverty and disease. But Mr. Clinton, at 54, will be a very young ex-president. If he disciplines himself to be as intent on enriching the world as on enriching himself, he could write a constructive and surprising last chapter to this most novelistic of modern presidencies.

HEADLINE: An Island With a History of Change Awaits Its Latest Transformation 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
Twenty-six years after the first residents moved into a cluster of new apartment towers on Roosevelt Island -- transforming what had been an isolated warren of asylums and hospitals into a planned mixed-income community -- backhoes are about to begin digging foundations for a new burst of housing on the island.
 Called Southtown, the new development will eventually have nine buildings ranging from 16 to 28 stories, with 1,956 apartments, most of them rentals. Three buildings are expected to rise during the first phase of new construction, with two-thirds of their 677 apartments to be rented to employees from three medical institutions -- a tram ride or one subway stop away -- on the Upper East Side. 
 "We start excavation this month," said David Kramer, a principal of the Hudson Companies, which in partnership with the Related Companies is developing the $500 million project on 19 acres just north of the Queensboro Bridge. Completion of the first phase, costing $135 million, is expected by the middle of 2002. 
"It's very exciting after so many years of planning that backhoes are now on the site," Mr. Kramer said.
David Wine, vice chairman of the Related Companies, said: "The strength of the project is that it harmonizes with Northtown" -- the existing residential complex -- "and relates to this being an island, so you feel the presence of the water through wide-view corridors."
Of the first three buildings, all 16 stories high and located in the northwest quadrant of Southtown, one will house staff members from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the second, workers at Weill Cornell Medical College. Employees from the Animal Medical Center will occupy three floors of the third building.
Mr. Kramer said that Sloan-Kettering intended to buy its building after construction -- but would not say for how much -- and then rent the apartments to its employees. The two other institutions are leasing, with an option to buy within a year, he said.
"It's for people who need to be in close proximity to the hospital complex," said Michael Gutnick, senior vice president for finance at Sloan-Kettering. "It will house nurses, scientists-in-training and other professional staff, as well as postdoctoral students." 
There is opposition to the plan, especially among many of the approximately 8,500 residents of Northtown -- most in state-subsidized, middle-income housing. They are concerned that the new development does not meet specific requirements of the island's master plan, particularly to preserve open space, and that it will gentrify their community.
"We're not against development of this island; we need the revenue," said Matthew Katz, president of the Roosevelt Island Residents Association. "But we contend that it must be in conformity with the small, planned, mixed-income community envisioned by the developers in the 60's."
Called Minnehanonck, by the Canarsie Indians, Varcken Eylandt (or Hogs Island) by the Dutch and Blackwells Island by English settlers who quarried rock and grew apples and peaches there starting in the 1670's, the two-mile sliver between 50th and 86th Streets in the East River was bought by the city for $32,500 in 1828. Renamed Welfare Island, it became over time the site of the New York Lunatic Asylum, the New York Alms House, a penitentiary and several hospitals.
In the 1960's, under the leadership of the noted planner Edward J. Logue, the New York State Urban Development Corporation leased the island from the city for 99 years and began an ambitious plan for what Mr. Logue called "a town in the center of New York."
Construction of Northtown -- now a complex of nine buildings with the tallest rising along the community's only street, Main Street, and the others stepping down toward both riverbanks -- began in 1970. Five years later, the first tenants moved in.
The island's master plan called for the creation of Southtown. But decades of contention, laced with downturns in the real estate market, frustrated building plans. A detailed plan for Southtown, requiring developers to build the complex as specified and all at once, was proposed in 1989 by the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, known as R.I.O.C., just as the market went into a tailspin. There were no bidders.
"By the mid-1990's," Mr. Wine of Related said, "R.I.O.C. adopted the position, 'Let's form a joint effort to get Southtown redefined and constructed in a way that makes more sense for a private developer.' "
Robert H. Ryan, appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki as president of the operating corporation in June 1999, said the Hudson-Related proposal "fits beautifully" with the island's master plan. "The feeling of this administration of R.I.O.C.," Mr. Ryan said, "is that the developer knows best and government should take a back seat." 
The Hudson-Related plan was chosen on Sept. 22, 1999. It calls for the extension of Main Street from the southern end of Northtown to the Queensboro Bridge, with the three tallest buildings -- 21, 25 and 28 stories -- on the east side of the street. Six 16-story buildings would line the west side, splaying out toward Manhattan to create fan-like courtyards and a public commons.
"Everything is not square," Mr. Kramer said. "The balance we were seeking was to bring the buildings to the street so you felt a familiar urban streetscape, but to maximize views to the skyline."
The plan also calls for creation of a field for soccer and baseball in the southeast corner of Southtown, replacing athletic fields that are now part of Blackwell Park, a river-to-river expanse at the southern end of Northtown. The reduction of Blackwell Park to three acres from six is another point of contention.
Last year, a group called Roosevelt Islanders for Responsible Southtown Development filed suit against R.I.O.C. and the developers, saying the Hudson-Related proposal violated the island's master plan, called the General Development Plan, or G.D.P., and that a new environmental impact study was required.
"The master plan says there must be six acres of open space dividing Northtown and Southtown," said Linda Heimer, secretary of the islanders group. "If we allow them to violate the G.D.P. with Southtown, that sets a precedent for them violating it with other development." The operating corporation is considering a proposal by the Marriott chain to build a hotel consisting of two 26-story towers at the island's southern tip. 
Mr. Kramer of Hudson said that construction of Northtown had already encroached on Blackwell Park, and that "the people who filed the lawsuit are worried about their views being obstructed." A State Supreme Court justice dismissed the case in May, saying that R.I.O.C. had satisfactorily considered the project's environmental impact. The islanders group has filed an appeal.
But the larger issue for many residents, and for their elected representatives, is maintaining the mission of the community. 
"The grand plan out there was to have an economically and socially integrated community," said State Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, whose Upper East Side district includes Roosevelt Island. "Obviously, that could be seriously compromised if these new buildings are going to be heavily weighted for the well-to-do, and for the staff of the various institutions negotiating with the developers."
Ms. Heimer of the islanders group said a recent survey showed that rents in two of the subsidized buildings in Northtown averaged $732 for a studio, $993 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,294 for a two-bedroom apartment. 
Mr. Kramer said that market-rate rents in Southtown would start at $1,550 for a studio, $1,900 for a one-bedroom apartment and $2,800 for two bedrooms. 
About 40 percent of the apartments, the developers say, will be classified as affordable housing under programs that require income ceilings for tenants, though actual agreements to do so have not yet been negotiated.
Such apartments, Mr. Kramer said, would be available, for example, to families of four earning from $25,000 to $75,000 a year, making the price "probably less than half the market rents."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Playing Musical Chairs With Airlines

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
THROUGH deals of dazzling complexity, the nation's biggest airlines, American and United, are trying to become bigger. American hopes to swallow Trans World Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week to ease a takeover. United, a unit of UAL, is trying to buy most of US Airways, which has also had financial trouble. To eliminate some anti-trust concerns, American has agreed to buy one-fifth of US Airways, which serves Washington, D.C., and other areas where a merger with United could smother competition.
 All of this raises many questions for investors. Julius Maldutis, a managing director and analyst at CIBC World Markets who has followed the airlines for 30 years, used breaks among meetings last week to answer them. Following are excerpts from the conversations. 

Q. Where should an investor place bets?

A. I have basically said I do not want to own the shares of a carrier that is doing the acquiring. Consequently I have downgraded AMR, the parent of American Airlines.

Q. Should investors buy United?

A. Since I believe the merger between United and USAir will not go through, I continue to recommend United. And I have a hold on USAir.

Q. Why don't you think the United-US Airways merger will be completed?

A. Because of the General Accounting Office report on the negative impact of such a merger and the opposition of Congressman Jim Oberstar Democrat of Minnesota .

Q. Where else in the aviation field do you recommend putting money?

A. I continue to recommend Southwest Airlines with a strong buy as well as Westjet out of Calgary, Canada, a clone of Southwest -- which, as you know, is a no-frills, low-operating-costs, low-fare carrier. I also like Atlas Air, a cargo airline based in Purchase, N.Y.; Canada 3000, a full-blown international carrier in Toronto, and CHC Helicopters, which shuttles oil and gas workers to offshore rigs around the world. They're all growth companies. Southwest and Westjet should do well in a period of economic slowdown. The other three have unique opportunities. Overseas, I recommend Ryan Air in Dublin, which is based on the Southwest model.

Q. Why are you so bearish on the acquirers?

A. No. 1, if you look at the 18 airline mergers that were completed in the 1980's, you find that only one had positive incremental benefits. This was the Delta acquisition of Western Airlines. And there were two reasons: It was an acquisition of assets and, second, Delta fired all the people at Western excepting the operating people -- the pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and so on. The management and supervisors were all gone. Neither American or United plan to do that.

Q. What happened to the other mergers?

A. All the others proved to be either zero-sum games, which produced no benefits for the acquirers, or absolute financial disasters. Keep in mind that USAir acquired PSA and then shut it down literally two years later. It acquired Piedmont and shut down about a third of Piedmont and nearly went bankrupt over the exercise. Which is where US Airways stands now.

Q. What do you see happening to the other major airlines?

A. I expect Continental, Delta and Northwest and maybe even Alaska Air will be involved in their own round of musical-chair combinations in a matter of weeks.

Q. If so, where do you place your bets?

A. I would bet on Northwest because it could become a takeover target. Last summer, Northwest had discussions about a merger with American. As for the others, it depends on who is doing the acquiring. I'd put my money on the acquirees. At this point, the only one I would buy is Northwest.

Q. What about buying the shares of regional airlines in hopes that they will be acquired?

A. I don't think the mergers will touch the regionals, because all the regionals are dependent on the majors. They have contracts to fly passengers for them. They're in effect captives. There was a minimerger movement in which Delta acquired two regional airlines, Atlantic Southeast and Comair. But I don't expect that the other major carriers will acquire their respective captive regionals. I also wouldn't expect a wave of mergers among the regionals.

Q. What happens to T.W.A. shareholders?

A. They get nothing. The stock gets canceled in bankruptcy.

Q. Say there is a series of merger proposals among the second-tier major airlines. How does that play out?

A. I think Washington would then be faced with the dilemma to either approve all of them or reject them all. If Washington rejects the mergers, the stocks of the airlines that were doing the acquiring should rise, and those of the acquirees should fall.

HEADLINE: The Bush Years; 
W.'s World

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Foreign policy has not played a decisive role in electing a president since 1968, the height of the Vietnam War. And since 1992, when Bill Clinton recognized that the end of the cold war made George Bush's victory in the Persian Gulf very nearly irrelevant as a political asset, foreign policy has become an electoral afterthought. In this past campaign, Al Gore and George W. Bush delivered the speeches on diplomacy that are still required in order to scale Mount Gravitas, and in their second debate they engaged in a blurry, amiable 45-minute discussion of foreign affairs. After a brief, failed attempt to get Bush to concede that he would not necessarily intervene abroad even to prevent genocide, Gore essentially gave up trying to draw sharp distinctions with his opponent, apparently reasoning that deploying his immensely superior knowledge of the world might make him seem pedantic rather than seasoned. (Bush was held to have won the debate after successfully reciting the names of four large Middle Eastern countries.) In their closing statements, Gore and Bush hurried back to the home front, focusing on education and tax policy. 
 Perhaps we should feel grateful that foreign policy has lost its political prominence. The sense of menace that once made the world matter urgently to us has subsided with the end of the cold war. But if today's world is less dangerous, it is also more complex. Just think of the foreign engagements that virtually forced themselves on President Clinton: two military interventions, in Bosnia and in Kosovo, and two economic ones, in Mexico and in Asia. The first pair involved the new phenomenon of disintegrating states, the second the new phenomenon of economic globalization. Forces both smaller and larger than the state now play a crucial role in foreign affairs. And as the terrain has changed, so have the terms of the debate. During the cold war, there was one axis and two poles -- hard or soft on Communism. But it's no longer obvious what it means to be "liberal" or "conservative" on foreign policy. Does it mean anything at all? 
 At the outset of that second debate, Jim Lehrer asked each candidate about his "guiding principles" for the exercise of America's extraordinary power in the world. George Bush said, "The first question is what's in the best interests of the United States." Al Gore then pointedly said, "I see it as a question of values." But Gore's subsequent attempts to appear affable blurred the very real philosophical disagreement between the two men. Bush made it plain that he would be far more reluctant than Gore to use the military to prevent mass killing abroad and to promote "nation building"; he even said, in language that would have sounded distinctly "left" during the cold war, that "one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly American is for us to go around the world saying, 'We do it this way, so should you.' "Gore, on the other hand, insisted that acting according to our values is profoundly in the national interest.
The self-conscious use of the words "interest" and "values" points to one way in which the foreign-policy debate has realigned itself since the end of the cold war. The words correspond roughly to the realism of traditional European diplomacy and to the idealism associated, for good and for ill, with Woodrow Wilson. And although the Gore side would not have accepted the Wilsonian label, the Bush team was eager to don the mantle of realism. In fact, Condoleezza Rice, Bush's principal foreign policy adviser during the campaign and soon to be his national security adviser, expressed this distinction with great clarity last year in an article in the journal Foreign Affairs. When foreign policy is centered on values, she explained, "the 'national interest' is replaced with 'humanitarian interests' or the interests of 'the international community.' The belief that the United States is exercising power legitimately only when it is doing so on behalf of someone or something else was deeply rooted in Wilsonian thought, and there are strong echoes of it in the Clinton administration. To be sure, there is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits all humanity, but that is, in a sense, a second-order effect." There is an unsettling coldbloodedness in that "second-order effect," though it doesn't read as if Rice is trying to shock. She simply does not believe in humanitarianism as a goal of foreign policy.
"Realism" may sound like nothing more than an honest assessment of a dangerous world, but it is important to understand how far this stands outside the American tradition. In his recent book, "Diplomacy," Henry Kissinger writes that from Woodrow Wilson to George Bush, "American presidents have invoked their country's unselfishness as the crucial attribute of its leadership role." Wilsonian idealism was so deeply in the American grain that party affiliation scarcely mattered: with his imagery of a "shining city on a hill" versus "an evil empire," and with his interventions all over the globe, Ronald Reagan was Wilson's most unabashed follower. George Bush the elder toned down the evangelism, but his foreign policy was grounded in Wilson's language of mutuality and cooperation -- above all in creating the coalition that waged the gulf war.
What is striking about George W. Bush and his inner circle is not how different they sound from Bill Clinton but how different they sound from the first President Bush. The New World Order is as distant a memory as the evil empire. Helping humanity is suddenly a second-order effect. As Rice put it sardonically in an interview last fall, "We don't need to have the 82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten" in Bosnia and Kosovo. And it isn't only the moralism, but also the mutuality, that has become passe. Most of Bush's top advisers oppose the principal international compacts that our allies have adopted in recent years: the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; the Kyoto Protocol on global warming; the International Criminal Court. What one feels, in talking to the people who are likely to determine foreign policy in the Bush administration, is a worldly pragmatism but also a preoccupation with threat, a suspiciousness about negotiations, a willingness to go it alone.
It's no coincidence that the central theme of the new administration's military policy will be national missile defense, which holds out the tantalizing promise of instant security in an inherently insecure world. This defensive posture, combined with a willingness to withdraw from the global community, leads a former high-ranking official in the Clinton State Department to describe a probable Bush foreign policy as "a strange mix of timidity and arrogance." Even Kissinger, a realist himself, might wonder whether so narrowly drawn and unsentimental a policy could inspire the American people. Perhaps the most hopeful thing one can say is that administrations rarely stick to the abstract principles they lay out during the campaign.
It is precisely because we no longer live in a status-quo world that George W. Bush will be subjected to a question that must irk him and certainly infuriates the people around him: "Does he get it?" The president-elect really does know a lot about education, and about faith-based initiatives, and no doubt about some other domestic issues as well. But pretty much everything that he knows about the world beyond our borders, with the exception of Mexico, he has picked up from bull sessions with Condoleezza Rice and the band of advisers she assembled in 1999. The advisers say that Bush proved to be a diligent student, but you have to wonder about even that. When an interviewer asked him about the Taliban during the campaign, Bush drew a blank. Only when given a hint -- repression of women in Afghanistan" -- did Bush say, "Oh. I thought you said some band. The Taliban in Afghanistan! Absolutely. Repressive." 
Critics often describe Bush as "incurious" about the world, but that word hardly does justice to what feels almost like a principled provincialism. Here was someone who by age 13 was mingling in the country-club set of Houston, who then went on to Andover, Yale and Harvard Business School -- and did so in the age of cut-rate international air fares -- and yet he rarely traveled abroad. Bush was in his mid-20's when his father became ambassador to the United Nations, and still he stayed home. He must have had to resist actively his parents' blandishments. He visited China in 1975, when his father was U.S. liaison; Gambia, at President Bush's behest, in 1990; and the Middle East in 1998, when he had begun thinking about his own run for the presidency. (He also traveled to Europe several times in the 90's with the Young Presidents' Organization, a group for corporate executives.)
People close to Bush dismiss his past as irrelevant; he has, they say, both the experience and the character to direct the affairs of the free world. Condoleezza Rice argues that as governor of Texas, Bush gained a familiarity with foreign affairs from his dealings with Mexico. "He has on-the-ground experience there," she says, "which I would say is much more valuable than if he had been attending seminars at the Council on Foreign Relations for the last five years." Rice also turns the insularity argument on its head, arguing that the president-elect "comes at this as an American with very, very American values." These arguments seem reassuring mostly to Bush's own allies. Many Europeans, for example, see the president-elect as an all-American boob. Olivier Duhamel, a respected and usually restrained French commentator on foreign affairs, described Bush in Le Monde as a symbol of the "cretinisation" of American politics. 
The core issue is not whether Bush is smart enough to grasp the nuances of a complex world -- he has smart advisers for that -- but whether he cares enough. His party is led by figures, from Trent Lott to Tom DeLay, who view much of the foreign world with outright suspicion. Brent Scowcroft, Bush the elder's national security adviser, describes a "mood change" in Congress since his time in office toward a view that is "much more conservative, much more hostile to multilateralism." Will Bush speak unambiguously to these figures, and to the public, about the virtues of active diplomacy? It doesn't seem very likely. 
Of course, Bush's capacities wouldn't matter terribly much if he chooses to function as a figurehead in foreign affairs. Talking to diplomats and foreign-policy scholars both here and abroad, the same refrain occurs again and again: thank God he'll have the father nearby - or Dick Cheney, or Colin Powell, or the advisers who told him what to say during the campaign. In fact, Bush will clearly be turning to his father for advice, as he always has, though one family friend says that Poppy will offer his counsel only if W. specifically asks for it. Vice President-elect Cheney is almost certain to play an important role in defense issues, especially since his former mentor, Donald Rumsfeld, has been nominated to head the Pentagon; but Cheney may be too preoccupied with Congress to play a major role in formulating foreign policy.
If there is to be a regent in foreign affairs, it will thus be Colin Powell, Bush's nominee for secretary of state. It is, in fact, hard to overstate the power that comes with Powell's stratospheric, almost absurd, standing with the American public. It is as if he had done the new administration a favor by joining it. Dov Zakheim, a Defense Department official in the Reagan administration and one of Bush's foreign policy advisers during the campaign, says, "Any doubts about the coherence or vision of a Bush foreign policy will immediately dissipate" when Powell takes office. That's hyperbolic, but it is true that the same Europeans, and for that matter the same Democrats, who ridicule Bush speak respectfully of Powell, even when they disagree with his views.
At the same time, it's not altogether obvious why that's so. Powell is a career military man -- he also served briefly as Reagan's national security adviser -- who until now has needed to understand the world as soldiers do. He may well be deeply versed in world affairs, though it would be hard to say on the strength of the 45-minute off-the-record telephone conversation that I was permitted to have with him and Rice. Powell was measured, soft-spoken, deferential and somewhat prone to lofty sentiments of the after-dinner-speaker variety, while Rice fired off a steady ack-ack of particulars. Indeed, it may be Powell's diplomatic temperament, rather than the acuity of his views, that accounts for the emollient effect he has on critics. And yet, thanks to his standing in the world -- and Bush's lack of it -- Powell will be able to operate with tremendous latitude, if he wishes. It's not easy to see how Bush could fire him or perhaps even overrule him. Powell could well turn out to be the most powerful secretary of state since Kissinger.
If Powell will be the Bush administration's Mr. Outside, Condoleezza Rice, as national security adviser, will be Ms. Inside. A former official on the Security Council in the Bush administration, she met W. in 1995, and the two bonded when Rice talked baseball. Bush quickly found that he was comfortable asking her the most elementary questions. Rice is crisp, knowledgeable, self-assured and quite possibly bionic. She has spoken in the past of having no time for a wide range of otherwise normal human activities, including recreation, family, introspection, "life crises." While Powell will almost certainly be the key figure in the formulation of policy, Rice seems likely to wield a whip hand inside the National Security Council. It was Rice who insisted that she and Powell would speak to me only by conference call; and after we had our conversation, she e-mailed colleagues informing them that they need not -- meaning, ought not -- talk to me, though several did so.
Rice assembled Bush's team of foreign-policy advisers for the campaign, passing over moderate Republicans in favor of what Robert Gallucci, the dean of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, describes as "intelligent hard-liners." Rice is an intelligent hard-liner herself. There's a delicious twist in the fact that her mentor at the University of Denver, where she earned her doctorate, was Josef Korbel, the father of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Albright's flights of moral passion, her description of the United States as the "indispensable nation" and her eagerness to use the military for humanitarian purposes appear to Rice and her colleagues as the very text of reckless Wilsonianism. 
On many issues, a bush administration will probably not behave very differently from its predecessor, campaign rhetoric notwithstanding. True, it will not publicly lecture our less democratic allies in Asia about their human rights violations, as the Clinton administration was wont to do, and it will expect the Russians to reform their economy without so much international help; but these are differences in emphasis, not in kind. Bush's advisers insist that they will isolate Iraq and keep it from making weapons of mass destruction, but some of them concede that it is easier to criticize the current policy than to come up with a workable alternative. As for our policy toward Israel, the main difference may be who's involved in negotiations. George Bush is not going to be pulling all-nighters going over maps of the West Bank. Any peace brokering will be handled by Colin Powell. As Dov Zakheim puts it, "One of the biggest shortcomings in the way we've handled the Middle East is that the president was his own secretary of state." 
Overall, a Bush administration is likely to have the kind of foreign policy the corporate community likes -- less focus on human rights, more on free trade. Bush will be meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada as well as with various Latin American leaders at the Summit of the Americas in April. A principal topic on the agenda will be removing barriers to trade. As one of Bush's advisers says, "Clinton and Gore understood the benefits of open markets, but they had a real political constituency problem" -- labor and environmental groups that insisted on trade restrictions. Bush will be able to unambiguously extol free markets, as he will again with the Chinese at an Asia-Pacific regional meeting next fall. At the same time, "free markets," like "strong defense," is a shibboleth, not a policy. Europeans take a far more restrictive view than Americans do on, for example, the marketing of personal information, or the sale of genetically modified food; these will be among the difficult trade issues of the future.
But the great difference between Bush and Clinton will most likely have to do with military and defense policy. Bush and the people around him believe ardently that only by constructing a national missile defense, or N.M.D., can the United States offer security in a world where not only Saddam Hussein but Osama bin Laden may gain access to weapons of mass destruction. Security in such a world may in fact be a fantasy; the Pentagon has suffered one embarrassing setback after another as it has tried to create a functioning missile-defense system. But Bush's advisers argue that the Clinton administration made only a halfhearted commitment to developing N.M.D. However, the political problems with missile defense may prove even more intractable than the technical ones. N.M.D. would require a major rewriting of the 1972 ABM treaty with the Russians. Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, has gone around the world organizing opposition to the N.M.D. plan and has enjoyed a great deal of success. I called half a dozen foreign-policy figures in Europe and Canada without finding a single one who thought it would enhance security.
Bush's advisers say they believe that Clinton made no attempt to mollify the Russians or persuade the Europeans on N.M.D. During the campaign, Bush said he would consider making major unilateral cuts to our stock of offensive missiles, in the hope of making it clear to the Russians that N.M.D. is not designed to win a nuclear chess game with them but is rather in our mutual interest. He also stated that the missile-defense umbrella would cover our allies as well as ourselves. However, few Europeans worry about rogue missiles nearly as much as about the threat of an angry Russia, and the Russians -- as well as the Chinese -- may well feel that they can get far more mileage out of depicting the United States as a global aggressor than out of acquiescing to Bush's terms. 
So what happens if the Russians refuse to rewrite the ABM treaty? The Bush team will unilaterally abrogate it. Our allies would accept the inevitable, with greater or lesser grace. But public opinion throughout the West would almost certainly be inflamed. And we would have confirmed some of the darkest fears of our allies. Dominique Moisi, a French foreign-policy commentator, says: "There is a feeling that there will be some kind of uncoupling between the American destiny and the European destiny. For a Republican administration, the United States is the only global actor on the world screen; they accept Europe, but as a regional actor." Moisi says that he expects "more arrogance and more unilateralism."
And that arrogance and unilateralism are what, at bottom, our allies fear most. The doctrine of national interests offers a permanent rationale for going your own way -- no matter what the world says. Condoleezza Rice has written that it is not "isolationist to suggest that the United States has a special role in the world and should not adhere to every international convention and agreement that someone thinks to propose." It may not be, but ordinary citizens in much of Europe and Canada, as well as many diplomats and statesmen, are quite committed to peacekeeping and nation-building and war-crimes tribunals and indeed the entire moral panoply that Rice and others speak of dismissively. 
The scorn for the emerging framework of international norms looks especially disturbing when combined with a pugnacious commitment to missile defense. "On the one hand," says Janice Stein, director of the Munk Center for International Studies at the University of Toronto, "there's a disengagement from most of the issues and most of the international frameworks; on the other hand, a willingness to say to the Russians: 'You don't like it? That's too bad.' That's not a comforting view for close neighbors and friends." 
This growing anxiety burst into view in October, when Stephen Hadley, a member of the Bush team, had to reassure Lord Robertson, the secretary general of NATO, after Condoleezza Rice said that Bush favored "a new division of labor" among the allies that might have led the United States to withdraw its troops from the Balkans. Hadley delivered the message that a Bush administration would not act unilaterally; in fact, Bush came to Clinton's aid when he publicly opposed the Byrd-Warner bill, which would have placed a specified date on the withdrawal of American troops. Still, Europeans fear that, as with N.M.D., the Bush administration will act unilaterally if persuasion fails. This is an issue of overwhelming importance to many Europeans, who watched with horror as Bosnian irregulars took their peacekeeping soldiers hostage when NATO engaged in "pinprick" bombing in 1994. There were no American forces on the ground at the time. "The lesson we all drew from Bosnia," says Mats Berdal, an analyst at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, "is that Europeans being on the ground and Americans not is a disastrous combination." 
But the Bush team does not believe that American soldiers should be escorting children to kindergarten, in the Balkans or anywhere else. American soldiers will be preparing for global engagements like the gulf war, even if that means that the world's greatest fighting machine never fights, while lesser forces can face the perils of peacekeeping around the globe. In the new division of labor that Rice and others envision, regional forces would keep the peace in local hot spots, while the U.S. military provided intelligence, airlift, command and control, but not ground troops. The European Union has been talking about creating a 60,000-man "rapid deployment force," and some Bush advisers believe that this force could replace the Americans in Bosnia and Kosovo. "If the European military force is going to have any role," one aide says, "why wouldn't this be one?" It's both a plausible strategy and a fair question; but at least at the moment, the rapid deployment force is wholly hypothetical. So if the Bush administration withdraws, what becomes of the Balkans?
George W. Bush has said that he favored the bombing in Bosnia in 1995 and Kosovo in 1999; nevertheless, just as he opposes the use of the American military for peacekeeping and nation-building, so he thinks that, with extremely rare exceptions, it should not be engaged in humanitarian interventions. In an interview with Sam Donaldson last January, Bush said that if another Rwanda occurred on his watch, he would not send American troops, though he would speak with the United Nations and "encourage them to move." This was not far from saying, "It's none of our business." Clinton, of course, kept out of Rwanda, and in fact blocked Security Council action, though he later apologized for his inaction. Bush, presumably, would not have apologized, because Rwanda, and Africa generally, do not make the list of vital interests. 
There is a spectrum of opinion on humanitarian intervention that stretches from "almost always" to "virtually never." A number of Republicans have tried to come up with theoretical formulations for positions somewhere in the center. Richard Haass, a former colleague of Rice's on the National Security Council, has argued in a book called "The Reluctant Sheriff" that intervention may be appropriate in order to protect lives or to promote nation-building in cases when vital interests do not dictate otherwise. Arnold Kanter, who was an undersecretary of state in the Bush administration, has made a similar argument. "We as Americans," Kanter writes, "must face ourselves, live with the consequences of our action or inaction." 
Most of Bush's advisers, however, can live with themselves quite well without Haass's or Kanter's formulations. Dov Zakheim, for example, has written that the scale of atrocities in places like the Balkans is often exaggerated, and that in any case violating another nation's sovereignty threatens "to unravel the entire fabric of international relations." Zakheim concludes that we should intervene "only when our own interests are clearly at stake, or when genocide is so manifest that refusal to act would destroy our moral leadership of the free world." In other words, if we can preserve our moral leadership without acting in the face of genocide, that's fine. The Zakheim Doctrine brings moral considerations about as close to zero as humanly possible. 
Zakheim, Rice and others say that we should rely on regional actors, as we did in East Timor and Sierra Leone. There is nothing wrong with this, in theory, but countries with highly professional armies, like Australia, do not generally live next door to tormented places like East Timor. And much less professional armies cannot be counted on to intervene effectively and to stick around as long as needed, as the example of Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone has made clear. Some moderate Republicans have suggested that the United Nations should dispatch forces in such circumstances. It is, however, virtually impossible to get a member of Bush's inner circle to utter a positive word about U.N. peacekeeping. And so if an effective regional actor doesn't happen to be available during the next mass slaughter, the Bush administration may have to decide whether or not to violate its principles.
And this brings us back to Colin Powell and his famous doctrine, which stipulates that military force should be used only to support a clear political objective and with sufficient resources to ensure success. The paradox of Powell's career is that he opposed the one war that satisfied his own stringent terms, arguing that we would suffer hundreds or even thousands of deaths in Iraq, and that the American people would never accept casualties to keep the price of oil down. But since the war made him a hero, his misjudgment was forgotten. Powell then began applying the Iraq test to other interventions and found them wanting. He played a major role in preventing the Clinton administration from acting in Bosnia in 1993, while he continued to serve as chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. He was convinced that the Balkans were Vietnam redux. The Serbs, Croats and Muslims, he wrote, "are committed to fight to the death for what they believe to be their vital interests," while the West "has not been able to find its vital interests or matching commitment." Powell turned out, fortunately, to be wrong on this score as well; he seems to be so reluctant to commit American forces in unconventional circumstances that he underestimates their ability to prevent suffering and provide a measure of stability. He appears never to have acknowledged his mistakes nor to have changed his views. 
You hear a lot, in the theorizing by the Bush camp, about the supposedly harmful effects of "low intensity" interventions on the U.S. military; you don't hear much about the actual human beings on the other end. Timely intervention by U.N. forces could have saved countless lives in Rwanda. The Bush administration's failure to act in Bosnia in 1991 "wasted the opportunity to save over a hundred thousand lives," Warren Zimmerman, then the ambassador to Yugoslavia, later wrote. The Clinton administration's dithering was equally responsible for that catastrophe, perhaps more so. Now a new Bush administration is talking about withdrawing those troops. What would that mean to the Bosnians and Kosovars themselves? "Ordinary people look at Americans as the people who brought peace to them," says Senad Pecanin, editor of Dani, the largest political weekly in Bosnia. "If the Americans leave, it would be a signal to the nationalists that they could resume their policy to divide Bosnia." In Kosovo, Veton Surroi, publisher of Koha Ditore, the leading political daily in the area, says that the news that a Bush administration might gradually withdraw American troops "was a welcome message for extremists on both the Serb and the Albanian side." American troops constitute less than 20 percent of the total in Bosnia and Kosovo, but Bosnians and Kosovars both talk about the psychological importance of their presence; the commitment seems real as long as the global superpower is there, on the ground.
Not very long ago, an American president said, "We have a vision of a new partnership of nations . . . based on consultation, cooperation and collective action . . . whose goals are to increase democracy, increase prosperity, increase the peace and reduce arms." A chairman of the joint chiefs said: "In every corner of the world our troops are at work. These warriors of freedom, these men and women who love peace, who are prepared to die for its preservation, are doing their important part to help fulfill the concepts of the United Nations Charter." The president was George Bush -- the other George Bush -- and the military man was Colin Powell. It seems almost incredible that, only a decade later, that faith in the moral purposes of American power could come to seem so softheaded, so ill suited to the real world. Perhaps the old language, in retrospect, was too big; but the new language is very, very small. Has the world changed so very much since then? Or is it we who have changed?

HEADLINE: IN HIS FIRST DAYS, BUSH PLANS REVIEW OF CLINTON'S ACTS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex., Jan. 12 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush said today that he planned to review and possibly roll back some of the most ambitious initiatives that President Clinton has taken in recent days, including regulations that put nearly 60 million acres of the nation's forests off limits to development. 
 "I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration," Mr. Bush said of his own land use policies. In an interview, he emphasized that "we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity" to reverse actions Mr. Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency. 
 He also described what could well become a new, tougher approach toward Russia, limiting aid for its conversion to a market economy, and he elaborated on several other foreign policy issues. Previewing one of the most closely watched decisions he will face in his first month in office, he signaled that he was inclined to use an executive order to stop the flow of American money to any international organizations that provide abortions in foreign countries. 
"Organizations that promote abortions are organizations I don't want to support" with American taxpayer dollars, Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush's remarks came in a 75-minute interview in his renovated farmhouse here, followed by less formal conversation during a 90-minute tour of his ranch and a hike up a limestone canyon to his favorite waterfall. Excerpts, Page 22. 
Along the way -- stopping at moments to admire the middle fork of the Bosque River rushing through his land or to point out a buzzard -- the man who will become the 43rd president of the United States on Saturday also talked about his legislative priorities, his Inaugural Address and the diplomatic troubles he anticipates with Moscow and Beijing over his plans to deploy a national missile defense system.
Mr. Bush was dismissive of the Clinton administration's eight-year-long use of direct financial aid to Russia, part of a broad Western effort to coax the country toward a market economy. He suggested he would try to stop the money -- except for that used to dismantle nuclear weapons -- until Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, cleaned up corruption and enacted far-reaching economic and legal reforms.
"It's hard for America to fashion Russia," Mr. Bush said. "It just seems like to me that we don't want to be lending money and/or encourage the lending of money into a system in which the intention of the capital is never fulfilled," he said. "The intent of the capital was to encourage entrepreneurship and growth and markets."
According to the General Accounting Office, the United States has spent roughly $2.3 billion since 1992 promoting democracy, the rule of law and market reforms in Russia, but the annual disbursements have tailed off steeply since the Russian financial crisis of 1998. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, institutions in which the United States is the largest single shareholder, have issued loans to Russia over the same period worth approximately $30 billion.
Taken together, Mr. Bush's comments amounted to a sketchy road map for his first 100 days in office. By making it clear that he would rigorously review Mr. Clinton's environmental orders and suggesting he might reverse the Clinton administration's position on aid to family planning groups working overseas, he was embracing some favorite causes of his conservative base, especially the Western states he called "that big swath of red on the map" -- a region of contiguous states he swept as he took the presidency in the narrowest of victories.
In the case of reversing President Clinton's forest policy, which was made final this month, after years of painstaking review and public comment, Mr. Bush would face many legal restraints. He acknowledged that his lawyers would have to look carefully at what options were open. 
His comments on Russia, if converted into policy, could lead to a fundamental change in the way the United States seeks to influence the behavior of a nation that was once its chief superpower rival -- and it risks heightening suspicions in Russia of how America is leveraging its economic and military power. 
In the interview, Mr. Bush also made the following points:
*He said his Inaugural Address, which he hopes to keep to a short 12 minutes, would carry the message that "we can be a unified America." But he insisted that this theme was not the product of his slim victory in the Electoral College and loss in the popular vote. 
*Mr. Bush said he planned to quickly introduce his plan to cut taxes by an amount now estimated at $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years as a single bill, perhaps modifying it to deepen the tax cuts in the next few years so that it could spur a slowing economy. Asked if he was willing to negotiate the size of his proposed tax cut with a sharply divided Congress, he shot back: "The answer is no. I think it's the right number."
*He suggested he might be willing to pick up on Mr. Clinton's framework for a deal with North Korea to control its production and export of missiles but said it must include provisions to "verify that they are upholding their end of the agreement." If North Korea no longer threatens its neighbors, he said, he would "take a look" at reducing American troops on the Korean Peninsula, but only in consultation with South Korea and other Asian allies.
*Mr. Bush acknowledged that the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq since the Persian Gulf war have so collapsed that "they resemble Swiss cheese." But while he was critical of Mr. Clinton's handling of Iraq, he declined to say what tools he might use to pressure Saddam Hussein. 
*Mr. Bush said he may have erred in commenting on the Federal Reserve's action early this month to cut interest rates, and suggested that to preserve the Fed's independence he would not publicly evaluate its actions as president. "I kind of read the feedback and tended to agree with it, frankly," he said of the criticism he received for enthusiastically backing the half-point cut in short-term rates.

From Ranch to Frying Pan
Throughout the conversation Mr. Bush looked relaxed. He was clearly enjoying a day off puttering around his ranch, brewing coffee for visitors and interrupting the conversation repeatedly to admonish his two friendly but occasionally disobedient dogs, Spot and Barney. But he leaned forward and turned intent when the subject turned to his choice for attorney general, former Senator John Ashcroft, a religious conservative who he said he knew "could end up being a lightning rod" for criticism.
He said he expected that Mr. Ashcroft's confirmation hearings, which begin on Tuesday, would be focused on the designee's comments on civil rights, his fierce opposition to abortion and comments he made supporting leaders of the Southern side of the Civil War. "They are going to dig up every word the guy uttered," Mr. Bush said. "He's going to get to explain them. He explained many of the words he uttered to me."
The president-elect professed to be unfazed by the withdrawal this week of his choice for labor secretary, Linda Chavez, who had failed to tell the Bush transition team that she had once had an illegal immigrant live in her home and perform occasional house chores. Mr. Bush would not say that he had been misled by Ms. Chavez, but noted, "She said she made mistakes," and he seemed to agree with that assessment.
Mr. Bush described his cabinet as "a very strong group of folks," made stronger by their extensive experience in government.
"I'm always mindful of what Sam Rayburn told Lyndon Johnson when he first saw the Kennedy administration," he said, referring to the famously gruff former speaker of the House. "He said, 'Gosh, I just wish one of them had run for sheriff.' " And that's why I'm very comfortable with an Ashcroft or a Norton. They not only ran for sheriff, they ran for statewide offices."
Talking like a professor of management at Harvard Business School -- which he attended decades ago -- he said he was working hard to turn his cabinet choices into a cohesive team that is accustomed to his own style. In his two visits to Washington in recent weeks, he noted, he was "spending time with the folks, just watching everybody interact and letting them see how I respond and my style. I want them to see the decision-making process and how it works." He wanted, he insisted, no yes-men or yes-women.
"Here's loyalty," he said. "Loyalty is somebody who walked into my office and says, 'Here is my opinion,' or 'I hear you are thinking this way. I don't agree with you.' " He made it clear, however, that once he had chosen his path, he expected his cabinet members to voice unanimous support for his decisions in public.
At one point Mr. Bush said that he had cautioned his press secretary, Ari Fleischer, that at times he would withhold information so that Mr. Fleischer could truthfully profess ignorance to reporters -- hardly a new strategy for occupants of the White House. Mr. Bush recalled telling Mr. Fleischer recently, "When I tell you you are not going to know something, you say, 'Yes, sir.' "

'I Love Land'
Mr. Bush made little effort to hide his interest in reversing some of Mr. Clinton's recent executive orders and rules. But he cautioned that his aides were still researching whether reversals would be legally or politically possible, noting at one point that some of his actions would require legislation and "it doesn't take much to block action in the United States Senate," where there are now 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.
Mr. Bush's views on the administration's recently completed effort to block the development of roadless areas of federal lands, essentially putting those areas off limits to loggers and oil drillers, was complex. Mr. Bush himself clearly treasures his natural surroundings -- "I love land," he said while driving around the 1,600 acres he acquired in 1999 -- but he instinctively bridles at the thought that the federal government would trump local officials or private landholders in deciding how that land should be used. 
"What I would seek to do is to make sure that our bureaucracies were not trampling the interest of the people -- and the president himself would work with local stakeholders before takings -- such as what the president has done with the roadless areas, for example." The word "takings" is used to describe government action to limit the use of land, with minimal or no compensation.
"The concept of the federal government taking people's property without compensation is something I agree with Gale Norton on," he said. "It should not. There ought to be a balance between obviously the public interest and private property. And a lot of people in my state and in the Western states feel that balance is not there."
He reiterated his determination to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said: "People shouldn't be shocked that I'm picking somebody who agrees with me. That's what a president does."
But he stopped short of saying that he would reverse the forest policy wholesale, suggesting he would consult with "governors and senators and local folks" to determine which lands should remain off limits and which should be developed. "There's going to be some property in these giant chunks of land that we can use and not damage the environment," he said. "There are some in this country that have wanted zero exploration or zero activity. And I just don't think it's in our national interest to take that approach."
He was more definitive about his opposition to federal aid for family planning groups that promote or perform abortions abroad. One of Mr. Clinton's very first acts, two days into his presidency in 1993, was to sign an executive order scuttling a Reagan-era policy that prohibited these private organizations from receiving public funds.
Under a compromise reached in October to avoid a confrontation between Congressional Republicans and Mr. Clinton, Congress allocated $425 million for such family planning activities -- but said it could not be spent until Feb. 15. That clears the way for Mr. Bush to return to the Reagan policy, and while he said that he had not yet thoroughly reviewed the matter, he suggested he was inclined to head in that direction.
He also gave a sense of his other priorities, suggesting that in addition to education reform legislation and his tax bill, "we may be able to move a little faster on Medicare" reforms, including prescription drug coverage for elderly Americans. But he tacitly conceded that an overhaul of Social Security, a major subject of debate in the campaign, would take time.

Looking Abroad
In discussing foreign policy, Mr. Bush again said he would not allow American military forces to engage in what he called "nation-building" -- converting countries to stable democracies -- because it was a distraction from their main mission. That was a critical difference with Vice President Al Gore, who repeatedly cited the experience of American forces in helping remake Japan and Germany after World War II.
He said allies in Europe were "very aware" of his desire to gradually reduce America's presence in Kosovo and Bosnia, and said Secretary of State-designate Colin L. Powell would make it clear that Washington wanted Europe "to be the peacekeepers." (In fact, the United States provides less than 20 percent of the peacekeeping forces in the Balkans.) But, Mr. Bush said, "I don't have deadlines in mind" and "I honor the agreements that the president has -- that our country has made." 
"It's going to take a while" to pull back, he said.
He endorsed much of Mr. Clinton's core strategy toward China, using economic engagement to promote more freedom, but he seemed unable to decide whether China posed more of a threat to the United States because of its growing military strength or its internal weaknesses.
"I'm trying to figure out if your question is a trick question," he said with a smile. After a digression on the chaos brought about by the Cultural Revolution, he concluded, "To me, particularly as China develops as the military power, a chaotic China would be something that should cause great concern to people in the region and to us."
He said he was prepared for objections from Moscow and Beijing to his plan to build a national missile defense, but he insisted it should not be seen by either capital as a threat. 
"We've just got to explain why we are doing what we are doing," he said. "The Chinese know and the Russians know that there will be no system developed in the immediate future or the foreseeable future, is a better word, that can conceivably intercept a multiple launch" of missiles at the United States. 
"You know that. They know that," he said. His real intent, he said, was to intercept an accidental launching of one or two nuclear weapons, or to deprive "some nation like Iran to eventually say to us, 'And we've got one aimed at Israel.' " He would not discuss what kind of incentive he might offer China or Russia to accept the system, other than decreasing the size of America's own nuclear missile fleet. And how many warheads could he eliminate from America's arsenal?
"That's what we are going to find out," he said.

HEADLINE: Hunger in America: A Mark of Shame 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "U.N. Report Maps Hunger 'Hot Spots' " (news article, Jan. 9): 
 Hunger does not plague only developing countries: it is a problem here in the United States. 
America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest domestic hunger relief organization, reports that nearly 30 million Americans will go to bed hungry tonight. 
The country's poorest citizens have remained largely untouched by the economic boom of the 1990's and are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain adequate food.
Hunger is tragedy for any nation, but it is unforgivable in a country as prosperous as the United States.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
EMC's Big Bet On Explosion In Data Storage

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Thanks to the Internet and the rapid global expansion of computing, humans and their machines will create more information in the next three years than in the 300,000 years of history dating to the earliest cave paintings and beyond.
 That was what researchers at the School of Information Management and Systems at the University of California at Berkeley forecast late last year, much to the delight of the EMC Corporation, the data storage giant that sponsored their work. 
 EMC was quick to pitch the study to Wall Street, adding it to analysts' projections that spending on data storage products is drawing even with spending on computers themselves and that it will account for 70 percent of information technology budgets by 2005. EMC also included its own projection that an individual -- EMC likes to call him Tommy in its advertisements -- could easily have a terabyte (the equivalent of 250 million pages of text) of stored personal records, photos and other data by 2005.
The obvious outcome of such trends, of course, would be mind-boggling growth for data storage products and, more to EMC's point, full-scale storage systems intelligent enough to support the Internet's need for constant access to data. "Data needs to live someplace," says Michael C. Ruettgers, EMC's chief executive. "There's almost no value if it's just put away." 
EMC's need to keep Wall Street awed is directly linked to its track record. It became the biggest gainer on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1990's by grabbing leadership of the market from I.B.M., producing both astonishing profits and sizzling growth. Then, as other technology giants stumbled in 2000, its shares gained another 10 percent to finish the year at $66.50. From such a pinnacle, convincing the Street the best is yet to come will be no mean feat.
But there are plenty of other companies beating the same drum, from giants like I.B.M., Compaq Computer and Sun Microsystems to fast-growing newcomers like Network Appliance, Brocade Communications and Veritas Software.
"Storage is becoming the heart and soul of all business," said Linda Sanford, senior vice president for I.B.M.'s storage group. "What you know about your customers, suppliers and partners will differentiate you at the end of the day."
Trouble is, even if the vendors and analysts are right about the growth, investors may well have become unrealistically optimistic about how easily it will translate into profits. The publicly traded industry leaders tumbled last fall but are still trading at nosebleed levels that leave little room for earnings disappointments.
The impact on data storage of a general slowdown in technology spending is Wall Street's current fear, but storage companies also have to contend with tougher competition. New technology is driving down prices, just as in traditional computer markets. In addition, networking giants like Cisco Systems and discount computer specialists like Dell Computer are moving in, while rising interest from venture capital firms is spawning a steady stream of start-ups scrambling to define niches.
They are fighting over a rapidly shifting landscape that the International Data Corporation estimates was worth at least $70 billion in 2000, depending on which technologies and services are included.
"Storage is getting to be as complex as servers and networks," said Dave G. Hill, an analyst at the Aberdeen Group, an information technology research firm in Boston.
One sector of the storage market focuses on data used in computations that is stored in caches on microprocessors, on memory chips or inches away on disks inside a computer. At the other end of the technology spectrum is tape-based storage, which provides a low-cost if somewhat less convenient alternative to disk storage.
But the heart of the action these days revolves around disk-based storage systems outside the computer. The newest hardware building blocks are specialized file servers, some not much bigger than a VCR, that allow users to add storage capacity directly to Internet networks without buying full-scale server computers. The workhorses for big enterprises, though, are refrigerator-size storage arrays of disks that support one or more mainframes or networks of smaller computers.
Steady advances in the disks and the software that manages them are producing astonishing performance gains. Remember Moore's Law, the longstanding rule that shrinking circuitry allows chip companies like Intel to double the speed of processors every 18 months? Well, that amazing progression -- from the room-size computing monsters of the 1950's to far more powerful fingernail-size chips -- pales in comparison with advances in data storage. EMC, for example, says that the volumes of data it will stuff into shoebox-size devices by 2005 would have required covering an area the size of Argentina if 1950's technology were still in use.
For all that, the hottest storage battleground is not storage hardware but software, switches and other components that meld the storage devices into intelligent networks and keep them online. Brocade Communications' market leadership in Fiber Channel, a specialized protocol for designing such storage networks, drove its shares from an initial public offering price in May 1999 of $2.38, adjusted for splits, to $133.72 last October, though it has since retreated to Friday's close of $90.13. Veritas's strength in software to manage incompatible storage products from numerous different vendors helped its shares climb from a split-adjusted initial price of 53 cents a share in 1993, to a secondary offering in August 1999 at $22.14 and a peak of $174 last March. It closed on Friday at $96.19.
Storage services are also booming as big data users hire consultants, rent outside capacity or simply turn over the entire problem to technology management experts like I.B.M. Global Services or new specialists like StorageNetworks, a two-year-old start-up based in Waltham, Mass. International Data estimates that the service sector had revenues of more than $24 billion last year and says its sales should top $40 billion in 2003.
If there is anyplace where the sometimes conflicting visions of storage's future intersect, it has to be the headquarters of EMC in the Boston suburb of Hopkinton. EMC, like I.B.M. in the past, strives to design equipment that performs best with EMC software, so that customers become locked into it as a vendor. And, like I.B.M.'s mainframe business in the 1960's, EMC counts on its reputation for reliability and service support to make it the safe, if premium-price, choice for information managers. But company officials say any resemblance ends there and that no one will catch EMC off guard as EMC itself did I.B.M. in the storage business.
"We live in the graveyard of the complacent," Mr. Ruettgers said, noting that his commute from his home north of Boston takes him past offices once occupied by now departed industry leaders like Wang, Digital Equipment, Prime Computer and Data General.
EMC's strategy assumes that information pipelines -- bandwidth in the industry's jargon -- will become so huge and fast that it will no longer be necessary to store data locally to ensure quick access. Such bandwidth, in EMC's estimate, will allow as much as 90 percent of data to be centralized in the kind of big businesses that have been EMC's prime customers. From medical files to movies to financial records, data consumers would download what they need when they need it, but would not necessarily store it on their own computers. 
The best architecture for such data reservoirs is still up for grabs, however. Some data will reside in dedicated, maximum-security systems linked to particular computers. Some will be in cheap file servers attached to the Internet, known as NAS for network attached storage. A lot of it is likely to end up in networks of storage devices known as SAN's (for storage area networks) that would be linked to the Internet, computers and tape storage systems through specialized servers.
How things develop depends on evolving network equipment and software as much as on the storage devices themselves. "In areas where the landscape isn't as clear as we'd like, we're placing multiple bets," said Frank Houck, EMC's executive vice president for products and offerings. 
Big bets, too, judging from EMC's vow to invest $2.5 billion over the next two years in research and development, more than 75 percent of it in software.
What if projections like the Berkeley study prove to be wildly inflated? What if people become smarter about saving only what they really need? The industry's answer is another question: why would they bother? With storage prices headed from about 40 cents a megabyte today to less than a cent in 2005 and the industry moving toward making access to storage as easy as the universal dial tone on the telephone, Mr. Ruettgers says, "It's going to take too much energy to throw things away."
Besides, he points out, the Berkeley figures may well be too conservative, since they exclude any estimates for duplicate storage of information once it is created, one of the fastest-growing segments of the business.

HEADLINE: Inventor Calls Grand Rumors Distorted and Out of Context 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
An inventor who has been the subject of much excited speculation over a new device said to be as important as the Internet has stepped forward to deny that he has any such "earth-shattering" project in the works.
 "We have a promising project, but nothing of the earth-shattering nature that people are conjuring up," Dean Kamen, president of DEKA Research, based in Manchester, N.H., said in a statement. 
 Mr. Kamen, the inventor of devices like a portable insulin pump and a wheelchair that climbs stairs, said he felt compelled to comment on speculation arising from an "unfortunate, unapproved leak" in a proposal for a book about him. 
Mr. Kamen's invention is reportedly the subject of a book from the Harvard Business School Press.
The planned book about the mystery invention -- reportedly code-named "ginger" -- described it as having the backing of high-technology leaders like Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, and to be of great social and economic importance, according to an article published last Tuesday by Inside.com. The report also said the invention was said to be as important as the World Wide Web or the personal computer.
The report set in motion a wave of speculation in media as to whether the invention might be some revolutionary type of computer or some sort of personal transportation device that functioned like a hovercraft.
Mr. Kamen, who remained quiet initially, issued a statement late on Friday saying that several of the comments cited in the book proposal had been taken out of context.
The Harvard Business School Press declined to comment.
"The leaked proposal quoted several prominent technology leaders out of context, without their doubts, risks and maybes included," Mr. Kamen said. "This, together with spirited speculation about the unknown, has led to expectations that are beyond the mere whimsical."

For Cablevision, Asset Sale Is Addition by Subtraction
While most independent cable companies have been expanding in the last two years, Charles F. Dolan, the founder of Cablevision Systems, has bucked the bigger-is-better trend by shrinking his company. Stockholders seem to endorse his strategy and have pushed up shares 249 percent since January 1998.
 Now, in what could become Cablevision's biggest asset sale, the company will begin receiving bids for its 74 percent stake in Rainbow Media, whose services include Bravo, American Movie Classics and the Independent Film Channel. Market Place. Page C8. 

Group-Buying Company to Close
MobShop, one of a handful of companies that offer group buying on the Internet, in which consumers pool their buying power to purchase goods at lower prices, is closing its consumer operations on the heels of the recent announcement that its chief competitor, Mercata, was going out of business. C2.

Web Link to Old Media Struggles
When Digital Convergence introduced a device called the CueCat last summer, it promised to revolutionize the way people interact with the Web through technology designed to link print and broadcast media to the Internet. Users could swipe a special scanner across bar codes in publications or on TV, and their computers would call up Web pages with more information. But Digital Convergence has run into a few obstacles, including criticism about its technology, a security breach at the company's Web site and a downturn in the stock market. New Economy. C4.

VerticalNet Shifts Its Strategy
The departure of VerticalNet's chief executive comes at a critical time for the company, which was established to help set up online marketplaces. Last month, the company began re-inventing itself as a software company whose products help corporations buy goods online. VerticalNet executives said their business might be in a better position than it was a year ago because some of the confusion surrounding corporate e-commerce had dissipated.

Press Baron Heads to Taiwan
Jimmy Lai, the Hong Kong press baron, has just moved to Taiwan, where he wants to start a weekly magazine modeled on Next magazine, his successful publication. Mr. Lai became infamous first for his anti-Beijing politics and later for running some of Hong Kong's most gossip-driven journalism. C8.

Group Quiet About Beating Security
Edward W. Felten, a computer science professor, was part of a group that says it disabled a digital music copyright protection system. But he said he was reluctant to go public with details of how the group did it because a 1998 law makes it a crime to make or "offer to the public" a way to gain unauthorized access to any copyright-protected work that has been secured by a technology like encryption.

A Wild Ride With TheStreet.com
Just after TheStreet.com offered its stock to the public in May 1999, its 32-year-old editor, Dave Kansas, was worth at least $9 million. His net worth has plummeted since then along with the company's stock price, to less than $500, 000. But Mr. Kansas says that wealth was never his intention. He could have sold his entire holding a year ago for more than $3 million. He has not sold any shares though, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. C8.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Job Growth Begins to Slow 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Growth slowed in Silicon Valley's job market last year, even as housing shortages and transportation bottlenecks became worse for the region that is often held out as the world's model for economic development. 
 At the same time, the gap widened between the region's richest and poorest households. 
 Those are among the findings of an annual economic and environmental report to be released on Monday by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit regional planning group.
Silicon Valley -- Santa Clara County and the adjacent parts of Santa Cruz, San Mateo and Alameda Counties -- added 39,000 jobs last year, the report found, raising the region's work force to 1.35 million. But the estimated growth rate of 3 percent was below the 3.8 percent increase in 1999 and the 3.9 percent in 1998. 
And the number of what the report called "gazelle" companies, publicly traded companies that have seen revenues grow at least 20 percent for four consecutive years, declined to 66 last year from 86 in 1999.
Yet it is the region's ability to provide sufficient housing and transportation for its 2.5 million residents that worried the economists who wrote the report. 
The economists noted that an increasing number of employees cannot afford to live near their jobs and must commute from more rural and less expensive communities that may be several hours away.
The planning group also found that 30 percent of the freeway miles in Santa Clara County last year were severely congested, up from 15 percent in 1991.
"The boom has brought an enormous challenge in terms of housing and congestion and the general quality of life," said Steven Levy, an economist at the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto, Calif., who is an adviser to the report.
"It threatens the quality of life here and, ultimately, the economy," Mr. Levy said.
While wages in Silicon Valley continued to exceed the national average, the area remained one of the world's most expensive places to live. And the wealth has not been equally distributed. 
"It makes it very difficult for younger people to live here," said Douglas Henton, an economist at Collaborative Economics in Palo Alto, and one of the authors of the report. "We're in danger of losing our middle class."
The report showed that wages in Silicon Valley rose by 9.2 percent in 2000, bringing the average income to $62,600. That figure is 73 percent above the national average of $36,200.
While household income for the region's most affluent 20 percent increased an inflation-adjusted 20 percent from 1993 to 1999, to $149,000, the bottom 20 percent had household income decline 7 percent, to $40,000, when adjusted for inflation. 
The report cited the housing shortage as a worsening problem. 
Last year, only 16 percent of houses were affordable to median-income households, down from 31 percent in 1999. Nationally, 60 percent of housing is affordable to households with median income.
Compounding the region's problem last year was the falloff of more than 50 percent in the number of new housing units approved by local governments: 5,370 in 2000, down from 12,060 the year before.
To keep pace with job growth, Silicon Valley would have needed 160,000 additional housing units last year, the report's authors said.
The report also illustrated the diversity of high-technology employment in the valley, where job growth continued despite the collapse of the dot-com industry in the second half of last year.
Growth in software-related companies continued to top the list, with 30,000 new jobs last year. The semiconductor industry added 4,900 jobs and bioscience added 3,100.

PERSON: Jack McVea 

HEADLINE: Jack McVea, 86, Bandleader With a Noteworthy Novelty Hit 

BYLINE:  By BEN RATLIFF 

 BODY:
Jack McVea, a tenor saxophonist and bandleader who was a writer of the 1947 novelty hit "Open the Door, Richard," died on Dec. 27 in Los Angeles. He was 86.
 Mr. McVea started out playing ukulele in a band led by his father, the banjoist Isaac (Satchel) McVea, who was the first black radio host in Los Angeles, with an early-1920's show on KNX called "The Optimistic Doughnut." 
 Jack McVea graduated from Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, which at the time was producing a number of important jazz musicians, including Dexter Gordon, Melba Liston and Ernie Royal.
He worked in the house band at the Club Alabam on Central Avenue in Los Angeles, where jazz sizzled in the 1940's, played with Eddie Barefield's big band, and by 1940 had begun a three-year stint with Lionel Hampton as a baritone saxophonist. In 1944 he took part in the first presentation of Jazz at the Philharmonic, the popular touring revue produced by the impresario Norman Granz. 
Mr. McVea's place in the history of American music was determined largely by two events, one popular and one obscure. One was his role in creating "Open the Door, Richard," a song based on a comedy routine by the entertainers Dusty Fletcher and John Mason, who performed it in black theaters in the 1930's. Mr. McVea, along with Fletcher, Mason and Dan Howell, changed the words of the routine to eliminate racial stereotyping and set them to a rhythm-and-blues melody. 
Mr. McVea had the first hit version of the song in 1947. Other recordings followed almost immediately: by Fletcher, by Count Basie and finally by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five.
The success of the song ensured Mr. McVea work with his band around the country for the next several years, after which he became a sideman for hire, working briefly for MGM and leading a band in Las Vegas.
The other milestone in his career was his participation in a slight but memorable studio jam-session track, "Slim's Jam," recorded with Slim Gaillard and Charlie Parker, when Parker was playing on the West Coast in 1945.
In the record's jokey routine -- released under Gaillard's name on the small Bel-Tone label but reissued regularly since because of the evergreen interest in Parker -- Gaillard, with his loopy sense of humor, introduced Mr. McVea as "Jack MacVouty," and Mr. McVea proceeded to play a sweet, economical and archetypal rhythm-and-blues solo.
In 1966 he started working at Disneyland, hired by Walt Disney himself, playing clarinet with the Royal Street Bachelors band in the theme park's New Orleans Square. He kept the job for 27 years, retiring in 1992.
Mr. McVea is survived by two daughters, Lyta McVea-Abdullah of Los Angeles and Jacqueline Grant of Rolling Hills, Calif.; a son, Robert L. McVea of Hawthorne, Calif.; 10 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Legacy of Achievement, And Also of Investigation 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
When Bill Campbell stood before the City Council this month to deliver the final State of the City address of his eight-year mayoralty, he declared Atlanta "one of the nation's leading cities in which to live and do business." 
 He then proceeded to explain how he had helped make it so: by bringing new housing, an arena and business development to downtown, by rehabilitating some of the most decrepit public housing in America, by reducing the crime rate, by modernizing the city's overtaxed waste-water system, by expanding Hartsfield International Airport, by presiding over the first population growth in three decades. 
 But as Mr. Campbell sought to define his legacy, he left unmentioned one particular that could ultimately obscure many of those achievements. For six months, City Hall has been roiled by a sweeping federal investigation that seems to have Mr. Campbell as its primary target. 
The investigation is so expansive, examining everything from Mr. Campbell's gambling habits to the city's minority contracting practices, that the mayor's allies readily compare it to the federal Whitewater investigation of President Clinton.
The steady leak of details to the news media has clearly frustrated Mr. Campbell, who is known for his smoothness on the stump and an occasionally wicked temperament.
"If there are indictable offenses, then you indict," said Councilman Derrick Boazman, a Campbell ally. "But you don't engage in this kind of scorched earth policy. His integrity and reputation are being impugned daily."
The investigation also has affected this year's race to succeed Mr. Campbell by making ethics a vital issue. "People want honest, open government," said Shirley Franklin, a former City Hall aide who is a leading contender along with Robb Pitts, the City Council president. "That definitely has heightened in the last six months."
The case already has yielded several convictions of city contractors on bid-rigging charges. And last month, Fred B. Prewitt, a Campbell friend and the mayor's appointed chairman of the city's civil service board, pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges.
The case related to Mr. Prewitt's practice of serving as a minority front for white-owned companies seeking city business. Mr. Campbell, who integrated his elementary school, has been a zealous defender of Atlanta's three-decade commitment to affirmative action. 
The investigation also has yielded some pretty odd tales. One involves a a former mayoral assistant named Dewey Clark who lived for six years in Mr. Campbell's basement apartment. Mr. Clark has reportedly said he and a strip club owner, Michael Childs, bribed Mr. Campbell to renew a liquor license for one of his clubs.
When Mr. Campbell did not grant the license, Mr. Childs apparently tried to pay an associate $20,000 to rough up the mayor. The associate, a federal informant, taped the conversation over a game of cards in November 1999. When the informant noted that Mr. Campbell would have to leave office before long, Mr. Childs responded, according to an F.B.I. transcript: "Yeah, but I still want to make a lesson. I want a statement to the next one." 
Mr. Campbell, his aides said, remains irate that federal officials failed to notify him of the threat until three months later, and only then because the tape was revealed at a hearing for Mr. Childs on unrelated arson charges.
Federal officials refuse at this point to even publicly acknowledge an investigation against the mayor. But they have subpoenaed voluminous documents at City Hall and have interviewed mayoral aides and associates.
News reports have asserted that federal agents are investigating Mr. Campbell's gambling forays to Mississippi and Las Vegas with attention to whether city contractors supplied him with betting funds. They are also looking at fees for speaking engagements paid to Mr. Campbell by at least two city contractors.
The president of one of the companies, Sable Communications, pleaded guilty in June to bribing a county commissioner here. He paid Mr. Campbell $5,000 to deliver a 30-minute luncheon speech at a time when Sable held one city contract and was pursuing another. Mr. Campbell has said he did not know Sable was a city vendor at the time.
The mayor received nearly $150,000 for speaking engagements from 1994 through 1999. But he did not disclose that income until October, after news reports revealed the speaking fees and the state Ethics Commission voted to investigate them.
Last week, the city's own ethics commission ruled that Mr. Campbell violated city ordinances by not disclosing the income, but it chose not to fine him.
Mr. Campbell, 47, a former federal prosecutor, has had little to say about the investigation in recent days, and he declined to be interviewed for this article.
But the mayor had plenty to say in September when he referred to federal authorities as "the forces of evil" and compared the F.B.I. to the K.G.B. Recalling the F.B.I.'s surveillance of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the mayor asserted that the bureau "has never been a friend of the African-American community" and accused investigators of asking "racially provocative and politically motivated questions." He also suggested that the F.B.I.'s tactics had caused Mr. Prewitt's wife to have a fatal stroke.
"There is no evidence, nor will any be found, of any illegal conduct because I have not acted illegally," Mr. Campbell said then. He added, "I've worked for 20 years to build a good name and to serve the public, and I will never allow anyone to tarnish it."
This is not Mr. Campbell's first experience with such an investigation. In 1994, the star witness in a city corruption trial testified that he routinely paid bribes to Mr. Campbell as a city councilman.
Mr. Campbell denied the accusation, took a lie detector test as reinforcement and was never charged. But several of his allies said they believed the lead prosecutor in that case, Sally Quillian Yates, has never shaken her suspicion of Mr. Campbell and has waited patiently for the chance that presented itself last year. 
Mr. Campbell has long maintained that he has not received adequate credit for his accomplishments, largely because of what he contends is unfair treatment from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the city's only daily newspaper.
He can claim some impressive achievements, including the construction of Philips Arena, which kept the Atlanta Hawks in town and created a home for a new National Hockey League team, the Thrashers. Several promising new developments are sprouting downtown, most notably a vast mixed-use center on the site of a former steel plant.
Under federal pressure, he pushed through a pair of bond referendums that are paying for major improvements in roads, bridges and the city's sewage system. And, as in most major cities, crime is down with help from both a booming economy and community policing, though the police force is understaffed.
But it is not just the investigation that has diminished Mr. Campbell's record. Many city leaders, and even some Campbell aides, contend that his legacy has been tarnished by his inaccessibility, his vindictiveness and his quickness to dismiss his opponents as racists.
The mayor no longer releases a public schedule. In an October speech, he referred to the city's white power structure as "Mister Charlie." As for his feud with the newspaper, it may not have helped that he once disagreed with a position taken by The Constitution's editorial page editor, Cynthia Tucker, by telling her that in South Africa blacks like her are "necklaced" with burning tires.
"He's charismatic, he's extremely bright, he's articulate," Councilwoman Julia Emmons said. "But he is extremely sensitive to criticism and has let that really get in the way of being the great mayor he could have been. It's been a flaw that really mattered."

HEADLINE: Containing Colombia's Troubles 

 BODY:
While the myriad problems of Colombia dominate the headlines from South America, most of Colombia's neighbors in the Andean region are experiencing less dramatic forms of turmoil. The problems are different in each nation and vary in their immediate causes. But all could be exacerbated by a spillover of the war from Colombia -- and from Plan Colombia, Washington's new military aid program. 
 The Andean nations have always been troubled, and lag behind the Southern Cone of South America in developing efficient state institutions. The lack of rule of law has led to autocratic leadership in Venezuela, Bolivia and, until Alberto Fujimori's recent resignation, in Peru as well. Ecuador struggles with constant economic crisis and its fifth government in five years. Brazilian officials worry that they cannot fully control their thousand-mile Amazon border with Colombia. They have already begun to move police, river patrols and airplanes into the region. 
 The spillover from Colombia's war could gradually threaten the stability of its neighbors. Already, nearly two million people have fled battle zones to settle in the slums around Colombia's major cities. Now some are beginning to cross into other nations. Rebels have long crossed into Panama, Ecuador and Venezuela to resupply and rest, but Larry Rohter recently reported in The Times that fighting between Colombian guerrillas and paramilitaries has now surfaced in Ecuador. In October, Ecuador accused the Colombian guerrillas of kidnapping 10 foreign oil workers. 
The cocaine trade that has fueled Colombia's war is also becoming more internationalized. Cocaine processing and coca growing have often shifted from nation to nation. When Bolivia and Peru began to have success in reducing coca under cultivation, the crop moved to Colombia, which now grows more than half the world's coca leaf. Cocaine processing is even more portable. In at least one border town in Ecuador, Colombians are buying land and the chemicals used to process cocaine. 
New American-trained and equipped antidrug battalions in Colombia plan to enter Putumayo, the zone of southern Colombia that is both a battlefield and a coca-growing region. Their mission is to destroy labs and eradicate coca plantations. Ironically, the more successful they are, the worse the headache they are likely to cause for Colombia's neighbors. 
Increased military action will likely intensify the war, producing more refugees. But if the plan is successful in reducing coca cultivation in Putumayo, coca will simply move to other areas of Colombia and to other nations. Peru and Bolivia may see areas they thought were coca-free go back under cultivation, and Ecuador, Venezuela and Brazil may see their first significant coca crop. 
That would expose these countries to the destructive side-effects of coca production. Wealthy criminal groups are sure to move in, corrupting officials, killing off police and each other, and eroding the state's control. In anticipation of such a spillover and resistance from the other Andean countries, Plan Colombia contains $180 million for the neighbors. Just over half the money is in the form of security aid.
This aid is insufficient. Ecuador, where the police frequently cannot afford bullets for their guns, needs far more than $20 million. Drug trafficking, squashed in one region, simply pops up in another. The United States needs a regional plan -- one that gives Colombia's neighbors more aid to strengthen their police and courts and help peasants stay away from coca.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Cablevision, prosperous from shrinking, will welcome bids this week for Rainbow, its big programming asset.

BYLINE:  By Geraldine Fabrikant 

 BODY:
MOST independent cable companies have been expanding in the last two years, all the while throwing around terms like economies of scale, vertical integration and that catchall, synergy. 
 But Charles F. Dolan, the iconoclastic founder of the Cablevision Systems Corporation, has bucked the bigger-is-better trend by deliberately shrinking his company. 
 Shareholders seem to endorse his strategy. Since January 1998, Cablevision's stock price has risen 249 percent, outpacing other cable independents like Cox Communications and Comcast. The shares closed on Friday at $90, up $1.31. 
Tomorrow Mr. Dolan, chairman of Cablevision, the nation's seventh-largest cable company with three million subscribers, will begin receiving bids for the company's 74 percent stake in Rainbow Media, the cable programming operation whose brand-name services include Bravo, American Movie Classics and the Independent Film Channel. NBC, a General Electric unit, owns the rest of the company. 
Viacom, NBC, Sony, Comcast and the USA Networks are the likely bidders. And even though USA's chairman, Barry Diller, said he would not take part in an auction, some industry executives expect him to be involved in some way in the negotiations, with the price possibly exceeding $3.5 billion.
Mr. Dolan declined to be interviewed. But his timing may have something to do with the rich price that Viacom paid last year for BET Holdings, the parent of Black Entertainment Television. That $3.4 billion sale made a number of other cable programmers eager to capitalize on the value of their own programming assets. 
Yet while Rainbow could become Cablevision's biggest, flashiest asset sale, it would not be the first one. Without fanfare over the last three years, Mr. Dolan has sold cable systems in cities including Boston, Cleveland and Kalamazoo, Mich., raising a total of roughly $3 billion. Compared with a peak of 3.4 million subscribers in 19 states, Cablevision now has 3 million subscribers in only three states. 
Mr. Dolan's downsizing deals have fetched top dollar -- as much as $5,000 a subscriber for the systems he has sold. But for Cablevision, the bigger value is in the subscribers it has retained: relatively affluent households in tightly clustered markets in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that have been willing to sign up for expanded packages of service in response to the company's active marketing. 
Revenue for the first nine months of 2000 was up 11 percent, to $1.47 billion, compared with the first nine months of 1999. Although the company lost $3.1 billion in that period, operating cash flow, the more relevant indicator for a cable company, rose 9 percent, to $624 million. 
Mr. Dolan "is betting that bigger is not necessarily better," said Tom Eagan, an analyst who follows cable for UBS Warburg and who supports the Cablevision strategy. "That is especially true if a cable operator becomes more vulnerable to satellite or has to overpay for subscribers."
Several analysts say the rising share price is also based on investors' hopes that Mr. Dolan, who is 73 and whose family controls Cablevision, will sell the company within a few years. By this theory, the Rainbow auction is the first step toward preparing Cablevision for sale. 
Wall Street's current support is in striking contrast to 1997, when Mr. Dolan raised investor hackles by making an enormous bet on the metropolitan New York market, buying the half of Madison Square Garden the company did not already own. The deal made Cablevision the full owner of the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers, as well as the MSG cable network. 
The purchase, coming when the company was already saddled with debt, exasperated some powerful investors who were weary of what they saw as Mr. Dolan's overly aggressive risk taking. But the bet has paid off. TV sports fans have helped give Cablevision the industry's highest monthly revenue per subscriber -- $53, compared with an industry average around $43, according to Karim Zia of Credit Suisse First Boston.
Despite all the good news, Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill Lynch noted that Cablevision's stock still trades at a discount to estimated cash flow for 2001, when compared with the stocks of several other cable companies, including Charter Communications and Comcast. That discount may be a result of investors' qualms about another big, iconoclastic bet that Mr. Dolan is about to make. 
Cablevision intends to spend roughly $1 billion over the next three years to give each of its customers -- free of charge -- highly sophisticated digital, set-top boxes that will offer various interactive services, including video on demand, e-mail and enhanced TV. Capitalizing on the tight cluster of Cablevision systems, the company is also hoping to use the boxes to provide ticketing for sports events for its New York teams, as well as school information and other local services. 
The boxes will cost Cablevision $350 each. The plan to give them away is radically different from those of other cable operators, who charge about $10 a month if a customer wants a digital box, in addition to any fees for the services. But Cablevision is betting that a sufficient number of its subscribers will be willing to buy enough of the additional services that the boxes will pay for themselves.
"Our theory is that by rapidly deploying the technology, the company can amortize marketing costs over a broader base," said James L. Dolan, 45, who is Mr. Dolan's son and the president of Cablevision. That strategy, based heavily on local attractions and programming, partly explains why the company is willing to sell a national service like Rainbow. 
To be sure, the asset sales will help pay down a portion of the company's $8 billion in debt and preferred stock, reducing the financial impact of the big digital investment. And corporate bond specialists say that Cablevision's debt levels are not dangerously high and that its coming capital expenditures do not appear as risky as Mr. Dolan's earlier bets.
Bob Berzins, who follows the bond market for Lehman Brothers, said Cablevision could "borrow additional money without any problem."
Mr. Berzins said cable companies were not like telecommunications companies, which have been burning through cash with no certainty that their technology investments will pay off. With Cablevision's digital strategy, he said, "you can see a three-to-five-year path to getting free cash flow."

HEADLINE: Moscow 'Spy' Case Is Still a Mystery 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: STATE COLLEGE, Pa., Jan. 9 

 BODY:
Aside from his wife, Edmond D. Pope probably had no greater advocate proclaiming his innocence on charges of spying in Russia than Representative John E. Peterson.
 In a telephone conversation, Mr. Pope described the congressman as "one of the two heroes" in winning his release in December after he was convicted of espionage. The other was his wife, Cheri. 
 Yet ask the congressman today whether Mr. Pope was spying, and the answer might be surprising. "I am going to be candid with you: I didn't know," said Mr. Peterson, a Republican former supermarket owner who represents the rolling woodlands here in central Pennsylvania where the Popes live. 
"I checked with a lot of people, with the military and with the C.I.A., and everybody said he is not a spy," he said. "Personally, I don't think he is, but I don't care. If you were spying for the United States government, would you want us to desert you?"
Mr. Pope, 54, was pardoned by President Vladimir V. Putin and is back at home on the outskirts of this college town, where until 1997 he worked for a research lab at Pennsylvania State University that specializes in defense contracts. 
A former Navy intelligence officer, Mr. Pope is only the second American in 40 years to be convicted of espionage in Russia. The first, Francis Gary Powers, the pilot of a U-2 spy plane that was shot down in 1960, was exchanged for a convicted Soviet spy.
Throughout Mr. Pope's ordeal, which began with his arrest in a hotel in Moscow last April, supposedly for trying to buy classified military information, American officials declared that he was an innocent businessman not interested in state secrets. They also insisted that his life was in danger because he suffered from a rare form of cancer that had probably worsened in prison.
A month after Mr. Pope's return home, considerable uncertainty surrounds both assertions. He is not dying. And although he may not have been a spy in the classic James Bond sense, he was a wheeler-dealer who was friendly with intelligence officials and who associates say would readily sell Russian military technology to the Defense Department if he could. 
Among his biggest clients was a former employer, the Office of Naval Research, which coordinates technology needs for the Navy and the Marine Corps. "It is where business and espionage meet," an intelligence official in Washington said of Mr. Pope's Russian endeavors.
Mr. Pope acknowledged during two telephone conversations that his cancer, in remission for some time, had not recurred during his eight months in Lefortovo Prison, just as his Russian physicians had said. 
He also indicated that he had not been mistreated in prison. "The media attention and public awareness is what saved me, not the State Department," Mr. Pope said, declining to give a broader interview.
Mr. Peterson acknowledged that no one knew during Mr. Pope's detention whether his cancer had returned, but that raising the likelihood was part of a strategy to win his freedom. "Having been a retailer, I know that good advertising is something boring, because you keep saying it until it becomes habit," Mr. Peterson said.
No American officials have suggested that Mr. Pope was employed by an intelligence agency as the Russians charged, but it is clear that the circumstances of his business dealings were not as free of suspicion as his supporters sought to portray them.
Since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, there has been a push in the United States to obtain Soviet-era technology and to ensure that important Soviet military know-how does not end up in the wrong hands.
Military, intelligence and business people who deal regularly with Russia said Mr. Pope's interest in cutting-edge Russian military technology placed him in a murky world where business people and academics sometimes do the bidding of the American military for profit.
If the Russians were nervous about sensitive military research getting into Western hands, as many Russian analysts contend, cracking down on someone like Mr. Pope, who had visited Russia more than two dozen times and had a broad network of contacts, would send a chilling signal.
"You have to recognize that the boundary is increasingly blurred between technology which has primarily peaceful purposes and technology which is dual use, military as well as civilian," said Sam Wilson, a retired general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
Mr. Pope's goal was to make money for himself and his contacts in Russia, associates said. And while he endeavored to work through approved channels, the nature of his dealings entailed walking a shifting line of authority.
His own lawyer in Moscow indicated that Mr. Pope could well have purchased classified information without even knowing it. Representative Peterson said he had received bizarre offers to assist Mr. Pope, including some from international armaments dealers. 
It was not uncommon, one of Mr. Pope's partners said, for Mr. Pope to be inundated with 100 unsolicited proposals from scientists on his arrival in Moscow.
"The typical negotiation over there went like this," said Keith McClellan, a lawyer and business partner. " 'We want a million dollars.' 'We will give you $30,000.' 'Sold.' "
Shortly before his arrest, Mr. Pope complained about being the object of pressure from the Russian mafia. And he was accustomed to being trailed by Russia's Federal Security Service.
Last year, one of Mr. Pope's companies, TechSource Marine Group, had a $178,000 contract with the Navy to study the propulsion system used in the Squall, a Russian torpedo. A spokesman said that the Navy was interested in the benefits for the military, but that Mr. Pope would be free to market his findings. Business associates said Mr. Pope was hoping to adapt the technology for passenger ferries.
Russian technology transfers had not yet amounted to a big money maker for Mr. Pope. Associates described his three firms as "virtual companies," with no permanent staff or offices and only a bare-bones budget for travel.
To keep afloat, Mr. Pope wore several hats during his Russian trips, negotiating deals for everything from titanium golf clubs to corrosion-resistant coatings. He even had a licensing agreement with Penn State to import Russian dolls with the college's insignia.
By the time he was arrested, Mr. Pope was pursuing information about an advanced fuel used in the Squall torpedo, which the Federal Security Service said crossed into the realm of state secrets. The information, associates said, related to a metal fuel that scientists believe could propel a variety of vessels -- not just torpedoes -- in oxygenless environments underwater or in space.
His client was the Applied Research Laboratory at Penn State, founded by the Navy after World War II and Mr. Pope's employer from 1994 to 1997. Last year the lab received nearly $70 million in contracts through the Office of Naval Research.
Throughout the eight-month campaign to free Mr. Pope, Representative Peterson said he had never spoken about Mr. Pope with officials at the lab, known as ARL. Mr. Peterson said he had not wanted to find out that Mr. Pope had been spying and thereby compromise his relationship with the lab or his efforts to free Mr. Pope.
"I represent ARL in the budget process in Congress and lobby every year for their contracts," he said. "They didn't contact me and I didn't contact them."
Was the research sought by Penn State classified? "I don't know that answer," he said.
The lab's director, L. Raymond Hettche, said Mr. Pope's mission had been to establish academic contacts for nonmilitary purposes, but he acknowledged that the lab was always on the lookout for technology with military uses. "The big thing now is spinning technology into the Department of Defense," he said.
Despite their long relationship, Dr. Hettche said, lab officials had no idea what else Mr. Pope was pursuing in Moscow. He said the university had not given Mr. Pope the money that the Russians said he had offered, on Penn State's behalf, to a scientist at the Bauman State Technical University in Moscow for classified research related to the Squall.
Dr. Hettche has on file four receipts signed by Mr. Pope, totaling $28,000, for technical reports purchased from Bauman, with titles like "Thermodynamic Analysis," but they are dated 1997.
One of the research lab's top scientists, Daniel Kiely, was with Mr. Pope when he was arrested. Dr. Kiely was questioned for several hours, and documents in his briefcase were confiscated. He was released only after he signed a statement in Russian, a language he does not speak. It was used against Mr. Pope in his trial.
"I knew a little of Ed's background and that stuff, and that the Russians probably think he is some kind of a suspicious character," Dr. Kiely said. "But I had no reason not to believe that everything we were doing was approved."
Mr. Pope is not talking about his ordeal. He has hired an agent and signed a book deal. He said on the telephone that the arrangement precluded him from speaking publicly about his experiences.
His friends say that the last year has exacted a heavy financial toll, and that Mr. Pope has one last shot at striking it big with his Russian connection.
"Right now, we all want to make sure his economic opportunities are optimized in getting this book published," Mr. McClellan said.

HEADLINE: Risks of Aid for Africa 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "How to Keep Peace in Africa Without Sending Troops," by Michael O'Hanlon (Op-Ed, Jan. 8): 
 President Clinton's Africa Crisis Response Initiative, which shifts resources to a few African militaries in the hope that they will take care of the region's humanitarian and peacekeeping responsibilities, has several risks despite its advantages. 
Because the resources will go to some militaries and not others, American aid could create or exacerbate regional military imbalances and insecurity. Since there are few international military threats, much of the hardware the United States provides could be used for domestic repression. American aid and the mission of regional peacekeeping could be used to justify the militarization of economies that can ill afford the expensive military forces. 
These risks can be lowered, and the problem of regional peacekeeping addressed, if the next administration chooses to do so.

HEADLINE: A Battle for Control Of the Runways 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Mayor Presses Port Authority for Control of Airports" (news article, Jan. 10): 
 In the 1940's, Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Moses formed an unlikely alliance with the aim of developing modern airports for New York City. 
The authority they set up foundered because the city's capital capacity proved insufficient. The task fell to the bi-state Port of New York Authority, which summoned the resources needed to develop the largest regional airport system on earth.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's fulminations regarding a city takeover of Kennedy and La Guardia Airports break down for the same reasons La Guardia and Moses failed. With New York's huge backlog of critical infrastructure needs, the city will be hard pressed to come up with adequate capital for the airports' continuing renewal programs.

HEADLINE: JAZZ REVIEW; 
All-Stars Of Italy In Standards Of America

BYLINE:  By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
Italy has no shortage of serious and accomplished jazz players. In the United States, the ones we've heard of tend to be the avant-gardists; that probably says more about the natural aesthetic affinities of Italians than it does about how well they know mainstream American postwar jazz.
 But Italians can play straight-ahead jazz as well as anybody. That was amply demonstrated in the long first half of Friday night's concert at Town Hall, "Italian All-Stars," a non-avant-garde triple bill with guest stars organized by the directors of Umbria Jazz, the 23-year-old Italian jazz festival with a reputation as one of the best in the world. But playing it with distinction -- well, that didn't really happen. 
 The first half was given over to the Trio, made up of the bassist Giovanni Tommaso, the drummer Roberto Gatto and the pianist Stefano Bollani, augmented by a couple of young horn players as guests, the alto saxophonist Rosario Giuliani and the tenor saxophonist Daniele Scannapieco. Together they played American standards, Italian songs and originals by Mr. Tommaso, and their set brought to mind an average night at Small's: studious and classical, good as far as it was meant to go, but well shy of aesthetic clarity. The most individual voice was Mr. Bollani, who occasionally loosened his time and played in a floating rubato, then tightened up again to play fast. But there wasn't any original harmony to grab hold of or any captivating ideas of space in the rhythm section. Most of the playing was as efficacious and numbing as data entry.
That changed a lot with the next group, Doctor 3, one of those rare jazz groups that figure out a way to hit crowds where they live, semaphoring their crescendos in advance and then lobbing them out slowly and heavily. Their short, fizzy set wasn't profound, but they had the benefit of a rhythm section that made you listen. The drummer Fabrizio Sferra's patterns weren't nailed-down archaisms; they hung open, as if half the number of percussive hits were edited out. But material was a problem -- their medley included Elton John's "Your Song," which stays maudlin even with ingenious alterations to it.
In the concert's final segment, the trumpeter Enrico Rava made the Trio a quartet. He played a new work, the three-part suite "Federico e Giulietta," dedicated to Federico Fellini. For all of Mr. Rava's reputation and ability -- he was a serious avant-gardist until the 1970's, when he became a lyrical, economic player -- the piece quickly grew dull. Its themes were basic, built on nublike, singsong ideas, but they weren't enough. What gave the set any sort of teeth was the friction in harmonized lines and accompaniment between the young trombonist Gianlucca Petrella and Mr. Rava. Mr. Petrella, one of the evening's needed refreshers, had a sense of himself, playing desultory chatter and then switching to the clipped, rhythmic, annunciatory phrasing that showed he'd absorbed his Louis Armstrong.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs; 
Powell's Perspective

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has his Senate confirmation hearing this week. I doubt Mr. Powell will say much about specific policies. What I'd listen for is whether he offers a big-picture view of the world, as we really don't know what his views are since he left Army service in 1993. 
 One way to think about Mr. Powell is this: He spent 35 years of his life with America Onduty, as a military officer. But for the past two years he's been associated with America Online, as a member of the AOL corporate board. So which perspective will Mr. Powell bring to his job as secretary of state -- the perspective he gleaned with America Onduty during the cold war or the perspective he gleaned with America Online in the post-cold-war? 
These are two different perspectives: America Onduty tends to see the world as being built around walls and America Online tends to see the world as being built around webs.
That is, America Onduty believes that U.S. foreign policy has been, and continues to be, about defending, erecting and bringing down walls. That means building walls of containment around enemies or rivals, from North Korea to Iraq to China. It means being largely indifferent to what goes on behind the walls of countries as long as they are not bothering us -- e.g., not really caring how Russia's internal reform plays out -- and it means working to bring down the last few walls of Communism around North Korea and Cuba.
America Online, by contrast, sees America at the center of an increasingly integrated global web -- a web of trade, telecommunications, finance and environment. For America Online U.S. foreign policy is about protecting that web from those who would disrupt it, strengthening that web and expanding it to others -- because, after all, America is now the biggest beneficiary of that web, since American products, technologies, values, ideas, movies and foods are the most widely distributed though it.
One way you preserve that web is by being prepared to defend it from those who would disrupt it, such as Saddam Hussein. Another way is by being ready to promote the expansion of free trade, to join with others in protecting the global environment, or to help with bailouts when key strands of the web -- such as Mexico or Thailand -- are threatened with financial crises that could infect the whole network. Still another way is by putting a higher priority on working with Russia to solve web problems that endanger us both -- such as nuclear or missile proliferation -- rather than expanding NATO's wall to Russia's border, thus making cooperation with Moscow impossible. 
The wall people, the America Onduty people, love the movie "A Few Good Men," particularly the closing scene where Jack Nicholson, the tough army colonel, sneers at Tom Cruise, the army lawyer who has Mr. Nicholson on trial for the death of a weak U.S. soldier on a U.S. base in Cuba during the cold war. Mr. Nicholson says: "Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? . . . Deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall."
The web people, the America Online people, love the movie "You've Got Mail," because they know that in today's more integrated world we can, and do, get mail from all kinds of strangers that can suddenly change our lives. When Russia has a financial crisis now, we've got mail. When a networked world enables small terrorist groups to become super-empowered so they can blow up a U.S. destroyer in Yemen with a dinghy, we've got mail. When two Filipino computer hackers put their "Love Bug" virus on the World Wide Web and melt down 10 million computers and $10 billion in data in 24 hours, we've got mail.
For the America Onduty people, the world is divided between friends and enemies. For the America Online people, it is divided between members and non-members of the network. The America Onduty people focus on who's on America's terrorism list. The America Online people focus on who's on America's buddy list. 
Yes, these are caricatures. But there's something to them. They reflect two different ways of looking at the world. So which lens is Mr. Powell wearing -- the one he developed with America Onduty or with America Online?

HEADLINE: California's Energy Crunch 

 BODY:
As politicians in Sacramento struggled to find a stopgap solution to California's energy crisis, other parts of the United States began to wake up to the possibility that what was happening on the West Coast could happen to them. To the extent that California's crisis results from a uniquely disastrous set of miscalculations, it is unlikely to be repeated elsewhere. But it is a cautionary tale nonetheless, especially in big energy-consuming states like New York.
 There are two main problems in California. One is that demand from ordinary consumers and energy-hungry commercial sectors like Silicon Valley has stretched California's energy resources to the breaking point. The second is that California's two biggest distributors of energy, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, are nearing bankruptcy because the wholesale prices they pay for electricity vastly exceed the retail prices they can charge their consumers. 
A desperate Gov. Gray Davis has now asked his legislature to approve a state-run scheme that seems the reverse of the free market promised by deregulation. The state, acting as middleman, will buy electricity at prices far lower than the producers of energy are charging now. Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison would then be allowed to sell that power to the public at slightly higher prices. 
That should help the utilities avoid bankruptcy. But it will not touch the underlying problem of supply and demand. As the Times columnist Paul Krugman recently observed, California's power crisis is "first and foremost a crisis of underinvestment." Some opportunistic politicians have blamed the state's strict clean-air rules, which they say deterred construction of new power plants and shut older ones down. But the real reason for the energy shortfall is that no new plants were built in the 1990's because prices were low, supplies were plentiful and producers wanted to wait until they better understood the new era of deregulation.
Since April 1999 almost 6,300 megawatts of new plants (equivalent to about 13 percent of California generation today) have received approval from state authorities, despite those allegedly onerous environmental rules, and at least 7,000 megawatts are poised to follow. But while this flurry of investment activity will ease shortages down the line, it has come too late to avert the present mess.
The second crisis -- the squeeze on the big distributors -- also stems from poor decision-making. California's deregulation law freed the wholesale market from government price constraints. But the prices that local utilities could charge consumers remained under state control. So when a surging economy and a spike in natural gas costs sent wholesale prices through the roof, companies like Pacific Gas and Electric could not pass these costs on to their customers. This, in turn, meant that consumers had no incentive to economize.
New York has not made the same mistake. Con Ed, for example, which mostly abandoned the generating business so it could become a retail distributor, is permitted to pass along increases in costs to consumers. Except for a painful "spike" last summer, these increases have so far been modest. But New York still has a potential supply-and-demand problem. At the moment there are more than 50 applications to build new power plants here. The state must move these projects along expeditiously while insuring that they are constructed and situated in an environmentally responsible manner. 
Meanwhile, Albany must find ways to increase energy efficiency. Programs to encourage energy-efficient buildings, appliances and generating equipment, which thrived in the Cuomo era, have lapsed under Gov. George Pataki, who has otherwise been attentive to environmental matters. On this score, California has done a far better job than New York. About 10 percent of its energy comes from "renewable" sources like wind power, and its legislature has created a $5 billion fund for energy-efficient investments. Albany can learn as much from California's innovative strategies as it should learn from California's appalling mistakes.

HEADLINE: Before Leaving Health Agency, Shalala Offers a Little Advice on a Big Job 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
After eight years as secretary of health and human services, Donna E. Shalala has a little advice for the Republicans who will soon replace her and thereby inherit vast responsibilities for the nation's health and welfare.
 Medicare reform, as promised by the Bush administration, "is not so easy," Dr. Shalala said with a rueful laugh. 
 Transforming Medicare into a largely private health care marketplace of competing health plans sounds great in the abstract, she said, but the devil is in the details: how it will affect the lives and finances of the elderly, their doctors and hospitals. And what once seemed like sure-fire solutions no longer look so promising. 
"Do I think there are some different approaches that are worth taking a good hard look at? Yes," Dr. Shalala said. "But I also want to know what the impact is, in very different areas. 
"And I'm not as sure as everybody else is about managed care any longer. And I started out as their biggest fan."
In just a few days, Dr. Shalala will leave the office she has held longer than anyone else, overseeing a 61,000-employee agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid, the basic welfare programs and an array of health research institutions. She will turn it over to Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, someone she worked with in her days as chancellor of the University of Wisconsin.
"It's sort of nice to turn it over to someone you know," Dr. Shalala said, adding that she would leave him the painting of the Wisconsin Capitol that hangs over her desk.
Mr. Thompson has a reputation as an innovator in overhauling welfare, and as a champion of giving states more flexibility and discretion in the management of social welfare programs. But what is important, Dr. Shalala suggested, is not that Mr. Thompson comes in with the mind-set of a governor, but that he comes in with the mind-set of a Wisconsin governor.
"He comes from a state that's very progressive, that has had quality delivery systems and that's very creative," Dr. Shalala said. "What I would say to him is be careful that you don't make laws for the Wisconsins of the world."
While President-elect George W. Bush spent much of the fall campaign attacking the Democrats for a love of big government and promising to turn more responsibilities over to the states, Dr. Shalala said that she made no apologies on that front.
"To me, it's a fundamental debate about federalism," she said. "It depends on what you believe you should have a national government for. I believe that justice and opportunity ought not to be determined by geography -- or by country of origin or by your parents' income."
The federal role, she argued, "is to reduce variation."
To conservatives, of course, that sounds like redistribution of resources.
"That's exactly what we're talking about," Dr. Shalala said, with nary a flinch. "Redistribution defines us as a country. That's what the national government does. But it ought to be in a limited way, just for the fundamentals. And in debating what those fundamentals are, we define what the country is about, what our character is about, what we care about."
One definition, she noted, was provided by former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, and is now emblazoned in the lobby of the health and human services headquarters building that bears his name: "The moral test of a government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life -- the children; the twilight of life -- the elderly; and the shadows of life -- the sick, the needy and the handicapped."
Dr. Shalala, who is 58, was long considered one of the last liberals in an administration often dominated by the so-called New Democrats. She urged President Clinton to veto the welfare overhaul legislation passed by a Republican-led Congress in 1996, but he did not. 
When asked her greatest regret on leaving office, Dr. Shalala replied, "That we didn't put health care for low-income working families, and child care for them, in place before we did welfare reform. If we had done those things universally for all low-income workers, child care and health care, it would have been so much easier to do welfare reform. It would have reduced the unevenness in welfare reform."
With the country seemingly headed into an economic slowdown, the first under the new welfare law, with its strict time limits for assistance, does she worry?
"Oh, I think everybody's worried," she said. "Even those who wanted the bill signed. We need to make sure we have something in place, preferably not the old welfare safety net, but something new and more imaginative that bounces people into training, for example, as opposed to back into a welfare system."
Dr. Shalala, known for maintaining her ebullience throughout eight years of partisan turmoil in the Clinton era, said she was leaving with a clear sense of accomplishment.
"I like to say American children are healthier and wealthier as a result of the president's actions," she said, citing an array of initiatives including immunization efforts and the Children's Health Insurance Program.
Dr. Shalala also noted that during the Clinton years, "we invested in the scientific infrastructure in this country in ways that will pay off for years to come." The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the other "great scientific agencies of this country" are, she maintained, "in the best shape they've been in in years."
She added, with a smile, "I'm proudest of the things that my successors will take credit for."
The most ambitious undertaking of the Clinton administration in domestic policy was the failed effort in Mr. Clinton's first term to pass national health insurance, which would have guaranteed every American the right to health care. Dr. Shalala said she thought the idea would become politically viable again only if "there's a coalition of American medicine and American business" demanding it.
She added that she believed there would probably be some kind of overhaul of Medicare, the 35-year-old insurance program that is the last bastion of traditional, fee-for-service medicine. Many analysts inside and outside the Clinton administration agree that it needs to be modernized before the great wave of baby boomers begins to retire.
But Dr. Shalala suggested that the model embraced by Mr. Bush during the campaign -- giving older people a fixed amount to buy coverage from traditional Medicare or a competing market of health maintenance organizations -- had real problems.
The amount that the elderly would get would be tied to competitive bidding among the plans, and critics say it would very quickly fall short of the cost of joining traditional Medicare, meaning the elderly would be forced into managed care.
"You can't drive up the cost of fee-for-service as a way of shoving people into managed care and say that's fair competition," Dr. Shalala said. "Because there are many places in the country and many individuals who need that fee-for-service option.
"Managed care has not yet demonstrated that it can handle very complex -- handicapped and disabled -- people, for example, and it's not every place."
She still believes in "organized care," she said, but "it may be a different model of organized care than we have now," perhaps with more control and leadership by doctors. Moreover, Dr. Shalala noted, the turbulence among health maintenance organizations in the Medicare market in recent years has "turned off" the elderly. Many such organizations have pulled out, saying the Medicare market was not profitable enough.
She added that she believed the Medicare program should have more competition in it, as long as traditional Medicare was protected. But, she said, efforts in the Clinton years to set up demonstration projects to explore a more market-driven Medicare were routinely opposed by local health care providers in alliance with their congressmen.
As befits a survivor, Dr. Shalala has already offered some practical advice to Mr. Thompson.
"I told him when he went to the White House for a meeting he should go early and stay late," she said, adding that his relations with White House staff could be as important as his relations with members of Congress.
During Dr. Shalala's tenure, the White House kept a close grip on both the health care and welfare initiatives. She acknowledges the pulling and tugging of that relationship, but added, "Once we got through the health care reform period, it smoothed out."
Dr. Shalala, who had a long career in academia, including eight years as president of Hunter College in Manhattan, is to become president of the University of Miami this spring.
"I've had a great time," she said, with a smile, and then she headed off to another going-away party.

HEADLINE: The Yoke of Capitalism; 
Czechs Coming to Terms With a Heap of Bad Debt

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
Eleven years ago, the Velvet Revolution brought Communism to an end in the Czech Republic. The way Kamil Ziegler figures, it will take another six years to dig out from the excesses of capitalism.
 Mr. Ziegler is the departing chairman of this country's biggest and fastest-growing financial institution: Konsolidacni Banka, the government-owned bailout agency. Thanks to an ambitious effort to clean up and sell off the country's bankrupt state-owned banks, Konsolidacni and various affiliates are sitting on a mountain of $8.62 billion in nearly worthless loans. 
 The assets here include more than $200 million that one bank lent to an Austrian investment firm that turned out to be a Ponzi scheme. They include millions of dollars squandered at Zetor, which sold tractors at below cost to a distributor who was also the company's biggest shareholder. And they will soon include more than $1 billion in bad loans from a bank that was raided and seized last June by government antiterrorist squads. 
Very little of this stems from the Communist era. Most flows from the mistakes made in the first heady wave of Czech capitalism, when Czech leaders portrayed themselves as devout believers in free markets and chided Western European governments for being rigid and bureaucratic. State-owned banks lent freely to well-connected industrial companies, only to discover years later that about half their money had been wasted.
Today, almost all the big Czech banks have been taken over by foreign institutions, from Erste Bank of Austria to GE Capital. But the mess the Czech banks left behind remains in Czech hands -- specifically, on the books of Konsolidacni Banka -- and nobody at the bank or in the government is quite sure what to do about it. Indeed, foreign bankers complain that the government is undermining the fiscal SWAT team it recently created to save or dispose of the most troubled companies. Konsolidacni is now the biggest creditor and often a major shareholder in some of the Czech Republic's largest conglomerates. Beyond that, it holds thousands of smaller loans on hotels, restaurants, office buildings and even car-repair shops. Its portfolio of debris has more than doubled the last two years, to about one-quarter of the Czech Republic's gross domestic product. And the numbers are expected to swell by an additional $2 billion, to $10 billion, in the next few months, as the Czech government sells the last of its big banks.
"Our mission is simple," said Mr. Ziegler, who has run Konsolidacni Banka for two years and plans to leave next month for a senior job at an Austrian bank in Prague. "We want to destroy ourselves as quickly as possible. We want to dispose of our assets in the shortest time possible, minimizing the cost to taxpayers. The job should be done in six to eight years."
But running Konsolidacni Banka is like trying to sell off a pile of rubble even as the dump trucks keep coming. Compounding the problem, many of the biggest debtors are also among the country's biggest employers, making it politically difficult to force much-needed restructuring.
Selling the loans to outside investors has been painfully slow. That is because the agency's antiquated information systems make it hard for investors to know what is actually available and because the government is reluctant to sell its loans at a tiny fraction of their nominal value, which is all the market will bear.
Last month, the government abandoned one of its most innovative efforts. Hoping to create something akin to a SWAT team to fix up and sell the nation's most troubled conglomerates, the government hired two investment banks, Lazard Freres and Latona Associates of Hampton, N.H. They were put in charge of a new entity called the Revitalization Agency and told to make their money from the profits of restructuring.
Just one year later, the bankers are threatening to pack their bags because the government refused to let the agency acquire the conglomerates' debt. Besides worrying about being properly compensated, the investment bankers fear that the restructuring plans will be subject to political interference again.
"We will not continue working with the companies unless we are certain that we will have enough decision-making autonomy," said Michael Saran, executive director of the Revitalization Agency. The the bankers and the government are trying to negotiate a new agreement by the end of January.
The problems of cleaning up Czech industry provide a sobering lesson for other Central European countries. After the peaceful overthrow of Communism in 1989, the center-right government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus embarked on a rapid privatization program, in which it distributed shares in big national enterprises to Czech citizens. Mr. Klaus, an articulate and witty former professor, portrayed himself as a devout believer in deregulation and free markets. But he had little interest in creating the legal infrastructure.
Czech companies were allowed to remain opaque to creditors and shareholders, and opportunists quickly snatched up the shares at rock-bottom prices from fellow citizens unfamiliar with equity ownership. They seized control of companies like Skoda Plzen, the big engineering conglomerate, and Tatra, a truck manufacturer.
Not to be confused with Skoda, the Czech automaker taken over by Volkswagen, Skoda Plzen, with 11,000 workers, had been a reasonably healthy company with products ranging from nuclear power turbines to machine tools. After being privatized, it bought companies that produced locomotives, heavy trucks and sugar mills and built a factory to make aluminum cans. By 1999, the company was losing millions of dollars a day and was delinquent on most of its bank loans.
Other major companies experienced similar declines. Those problems weighed heavily on the banks, largely because Czech bankruptcy laws made it almost impossible for banks to seize property that had been used as collateral for loans. The banks were also woefully inexperienced about analyzing a company's underlying financial strength and based their decisions largely on its record of previous repayment.
"People didn't have any system for early warnings," said Radovan Vavra, chairman of Komercni Banka, the country's biggest bank, which is in the process of being privatized. "The old system did not encompass questions about financial stability. It only took into consideration the payment morals of the customer. But if the first time you get nervous is when a customer misses a payment, it's probably already too late."
Mr. Vavra, a former senior executive at Citibank in Prague, joined Komercni last April, when the bank was losing about $240 million a year and had a huge portfolio of problem loans. Its biggest customer was an Austrian company called BCL, which said it was a fast-growing commodities trader but was actually losing money and borrowing to repay old loans. By the time bank officials recognized the problem, Komercni had lost about $200 million.
Komercni's problems are not unique. The worst case may well be Investicni a Postovni Banka. Nomura International, a subsidiary of Nomura Securities in Japan, acquired 49 percent of I.P.B. in February 1998, with much of the balance apparently held by people linked to I.P.B.'s Czech management.
Czech officials charge that top management systematically looted I.P.B., which had about $7 billion in deposits in 1999, by making questionable loans and transferring more than $1 billion of assets to shell companies worldwide. For example, regulators said that the bank sold shares in the country's leading brewery to a company controlled by Nomura, which Nomura later sold along with another Czech brewer to a South African brewer.
Last June, rumors about I.P.B.'s precarious condition caused a panic among depositors, who lined up by the thousands to withdraw their money. On June 17, antiterrorist police surrounded its headquarters as government officials seized control. A few days later, the Czech National Bank and the Czech finance minister transferred all of I.P.B.'s assets to the Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, which is controlled by KBC Bancassurance Holding of Belgium.
Nomura executives have denied they did anything wrong and have announced plans to sue the government for illegally seizing Nomura property. And they have strong support from Mr. Klaus, the conservative former prime minister, who has denounced the government's action as a "bank robbery."
Government officials say I.P.B. was utterly bankrupt. A preliminary audit suggested that its bad loans totaled at least 40 billion korunas ($1.08 billion), but most analysts say the total will be almost twice that. Those sour loans will be transferred to Konsolidacni Banka.
"It is very unpleasant, but I knew that these actions were necessary," said Pavel Mertlik, the finance minister. "The bank had served like a grant agency. There were customers who hadn't been paying on their loans for years. It was incredible."
Most industry executives agree with Mr. Mertlik and praise him for moving swiftly to clean up the banks. "I think the cleanup has been quite thorough and professional," said Zdenek Bakala, chairman of Patria Finance, one of Prague's biggest brokerage companies.
It has come at a price, however, and the price keeps growing. Before Erste Bank agreed to buy a 52 percent stake in Ceska Sporitelna last summer, the Czech government agreed to assume more than $800 million in bad loans, about 45 percent of Ceska's entire loan portfolio -- and to accept bad loans that had not been discovered at the time.
The privatization of Komercni Banka will be even bigger. The government has already bought about $2 billion of the bank's bad loans and recently agreed to guarantee another $500 million. Four Western European banks -- Credit Agricole and Societe Generale of France, HypoVereinsbank of Germany and Unicredito of Italy -- are now bidding for the government's 60 percent stake in Komercni, which could sell for more than $1 billion.
Such sums will do little to cover the mountain of rubble left behind. Thus far, Konsolidacni has sold off only a sliver of its loans. To speed things up, Mr. Ziegler, the chairman, is for the first time bundling loans into a single package of 20 billion korunas ($538.8 million) and taking bids from foreign institutions.
But even if that works, it would amount to only a fourth of the new bad loans that would be added to the pile this year. Officials say they would be happy to recover just 10 percent of the missing money. But even that raises anxiety because the bailout bank paid about 60 percent of face value for many of its loans.
"They can't just sell the loans for 5 cents on the dollar, because it would be politically unacceptable," said Paul Gilbert, a senior manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Prague.
Jan Hanousek, director of the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education in Prague, is convinced it will be many years before the government works its way through the mess.
"I would be more optimistic if Konsolidacni went and sold some assets lock, stock and barrel, but they haven't done that yet," he said. "With them, it's always like waiting for Godot."

Bring On the Nanobots

BYLINE:  By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Our topic for today is the State of the State speeches. This month virtually every governor in the nation takes to the podium, surveying the past, proposing plans for the future, and boring the audience into insensibility. I have just read this year's addresses from about half the states, and the experience was far less enjoyable than my previous project, which involved going to North Carolina and flying in an extremely small plane over lakes full of hog manure. 
 No wonder the average citizen of the United States regards state government as the political equivalent of tooth-flossing. Most of these speeches sound like a meeting of the Bad Bureaucrats Club. Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, in a typical effort, announced that: "In math, nearly one-third of our kids are at or above proficiency. That's higher than the national trends unless you consider that the national trends and the Wyoming results are the same under the NAEP." The governor of Virginia insisted on referring to his state as "the Digital Dominion." 
 There must be a secret organization that dictates the way these things are supposed to go: 
* Quote Abraham Lincoln (alternate choice: Thomas Jefferson). 
* Recall past triumphs: taxes cut, criminals incarcerated, etc. Congratulate self for not getting state into a mess like California (alternate choice: Florida). 
* Announce that education will be the most important priority. Mention that Bulgarian students are beating us in math. Introduce Algebra Initiative. 
* Call something "bold." 
* Stress plans to bring state into the New Economy. Brag about Web site. Mention genetics and, if possible, "nanotechnology." 
* Conclude that the state of the state is . . . strong! Anything more than one or two words here smacks of desperation. ("Opportunity is the state of the state in Mississippi, America's State of Promise.")
When you read a whole bunch of these speeches at once -- which of course nobody in her right mind would ever do -- you wonder how so many states can accomplish the same goals at once. Are there enough nanotechnological researchers to go around?
To be fair, some governors did seem to put a little extra effort into perking up their delivery. John Hoeven of North Dakota (Theme: The New Economy) opened with a welcome historical reference to his last formal speech "a few days after getting butted in the head by a horse at the Taylor Horse Fest." Jesse Ventura (Theme: Bold Reforms for a New Economy) was, not unexpectedly, more lively than your average chief executive. He delivered a very energetic explanation of why it was particularly unfair to tax people on the basis of the amount of money they made or the property they owned. He also won the Most Unusual Citation award by quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Christie Whitman (Theme: I'm Outta Here) used a Revolutionary War musket as a prop, and there is nothing that recaptures a somnolent audience's attention more forcefully than a governor waving a weapon. But the winner in the visual aid category had to be Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who went through the contents of a school bag. Mr. Huckabee was particularly interesting on the subject of paste. ("It was good to eat when everything else failed.") 
Mr. Huckabee actually had a few moments when he appeared to be trying to make a real connection, recalling how when he was a raggedy little kid, he wanted to be a teacher because teachers had decent cars and nice clothes. And for predictions you don't hear every day, you've got to hand it to the governor of Iowa, who envisioned a world where "rosemary is used for more than adding flavor to food." 
The rest of the governors were generally interesting only when they were mad about something. "I will not let some bureaucrat in Washington give away our power because California wasn't smart enough to plan ahead," said Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, in an impressive display of ability to work and play with others. And the governor of Idaho must have perked up some ears when he denounced the Clinton administration for trying to reintroduce "flesh-eating grizzly bears" in the wilderness.
In conclusion I can only say that the children of today are the adults of tomorrow. And some, one hopes, will grow up to become speechwriters.

HEADLINE: Screenwriters May Walk Out Over Film Credit and Respect 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Since Hollywood's golden days in the 1930's and 1940's, writers have often earned extravagant sums but little respect. 
 The most famous writers -- F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Raymond Chandler, Dorothy Parker and Ben Hecht -- reported the horrors of Hollywood to their friends in New York. They told of being rewritten by producers, ignored by stars, abused by studio executives and robbed of respect by directors who took credit for the entire film. 
 Actually, writers' grievances in Hollywood haven't changed that much.
But now a new generation of writers is placing the old complaints on the negotiating table. They are prominent among the issues on which their union, the Writers Guild of America, is threatening to strike on May 1. 
To the fury of directors, the writers are seeking to end the kind of dismissive treatment symbolized by the comment in the 1930's of the legendary studio executive Irving Thalberg: "What's all this business about being a writer? It's just putting one word after another."
What the writers demand would create nothing less than a sea change in the culture of Hollywood, where studios go to great lengths to placate directors. The demands themselves are a testament to the lowly status of the writers, more than ever. They want to overhaul a way of life that elbows them out of the possessory credit -- the credit that directors take that reads "A film by . . ." They want to limit the use of such credits, and they want to be employed while a film is in production so that they can make changes in the script -- and not have directors and stars tinker with their lines.
They also want to watch the "dailies," the scenes that were made that day. On a more symbolic level, they want their names to be included on the cast and crew lists for their films so they will be invited to events like premieres.
Complicating the negotiations, film and television company executives are seeking to walk a delicate line between the demands of the writers and the objections of the directors. In Hollywood's heyday, great producers like David O. Selznick and executives like Thalberg and Darryl F. Zanuck ruled over film production. More recently, with the studios' power in decline, directors have taken over virtually full control.
Accordingly, studios and television networks, in the current negotiations, take the views of directors very seriously. And now with at least a half-dozen cable television networks aggressively making the kinds of middle-budget films that studios once made, the conflict between directors and writers has flared in that arena, too.
The grievances stem in part from the influx of younger directors into films from the worlds of television commercials and music videos, where writers play minimal roles. Screenwriters feel even more marginalized.
For example, possessory credits are routinely taken not only by a top director like Steven Spielberg but increasingly by first-time or unknown filmmakers whose agents demand it. Studios happily give the credit as a sop instead of paying a young director a higher fee.
"Writers have been saying for several years that the way they've been treated in films has actually been getting worse, not better," said John Wells, the president of the Writers Guild of America West and a highly successful executive producer of television series like "E.R." and "West Wing."
"The assumption that the writers should be part of the creative process has deteriorated," he added.
To some degree, the writers themselves are to blame for their plight, because of their historical contempt for the screenplay form. Robert Towne, who wrote such classic films as "Chinatown," has said that this attitude began when novelists and playwrights came to Los Angeles to "condescend to knock out a script in a couple of weeks for big bucks so that they could go back to their daytime job and do some really serious writing."
Tales of writers' woes in Hollywood are embedded in the culture. Top writers may sell scripts for $2 million -- or earn $150,000 a week to add some humor or sex or action to a script. But they are often treated poorly. Robin Swicord, a screenwriter, told of a reading of her script adaptation of the 1994 movie "Little Women." Before filming, she said she was asked to sit outside the closed door of the room where the actors rehearsed. At various points, she said, the director stepped outside and gave her notes on what to change.
"I finally left -- it was too insulting," said Ms. Swicord, who also wrote "The Perez Family" and other films. The director, Gillian Armstrong, is in Australia making a film and was not available for comment.
A number of screenwriters, fearing retribution, said they would only discuss their experiences if their names were not used. One said he was allowed to attend a reading of his script but the director warned him not to look at the actors. The director, he said, feared that the actors would look to the writer for approval of how they were reading their lines.
Another writer told of two-page advertisements in large newspapers that listed the positive comments of critics about a recent blockbuster film. But whenever the critics cited the name of the writer, it was omitted. The reason? The director had disagreements with the writer during filming, and was getting even.
Some grievances among writers may seem petty, but underscore their sense that in the caste system of Hollywood they are treated like untouchables. At events like the Golden Globes, writers often sit in Siberia. When a film ends production, and the cast and crew celebrate at a nightclub or restaurant, writers are often forgotten in the invitation list. At parties after film openings, tables are traditionally reserved for the stars and their hangers-on, as well as producers, directors and studio executives. Never the writer. On a more significant level, top writers never earn a percentage of the film's earnings -- or "first dollar gross" -- in contrast to top stars, directors and producers.
In fairness, not every writer feels beleaguered. Eric Roth, an acclaimed and highly successful screenwriter who won an Academy Award for "Forrest Gump," said he had generally strong, collaborative relations in recent years with directors like Robert Zemeckis, Michael Mann and Robert Redford. "Sure, I've had bad creative experiences with a director, but we just part company," he said. "That's the end of that."
At this point the directors, who clearly see their dominance in making movies threatened, are outraged. Last week Jack Shea, president of the Directors Guild of America, sent a letter to his 12,000 members, citing the "severe and far-reaching implications" of the writers' demands. The proposals, Mr. Shea said, "would seriously impact a director's ability to deliver a product on time, on budget and within his or her creative vision."
Brett Ratner, who, at 30, is one of Hollywood's most successful young directors ("Rush Hour," "The Family Man"), is not about to share his prerogatives."I'm a collaborative person; I always work with the writer," he said. "But the only person in the process who is on the film from the very beginning to the very end is the director. The writer delivers the script and his work kind of ends. Yes, making movies is collaborative, but the director is the one who leads the troops. When there's someone else also making critical decisions, then it starts to get confusing about whose vision it is."
But Woody Allen, the contemporary director who arguably most deserves a possessory credit, refuses to take one, even though he writes and directs his mostly personal films. Mr. Allen called such credits "pretentious and not necessary."
Some directors defend the possessory credit up to a point. Barry Levinson said he did not take a possessory credit on his first film, "Diner," even though he wrote and directed it. "I didn't take it until later on -- it's something to be earned," he said. "It should mean something. A credit that reads 'A Martin Scorsese film' means something."
Similarly, Irwin Winkler, who directed such films as "Guilty by Suspicion" and "The Net," said that the credit had been "terribly misused," and he had qualms about taking it on his second film, a remake of "Night and the City" written by Richard Price. "I shot the script that he wrote -- I didn't develop it," Mr. Winkler said. "Frankly, if possessory credits were not given out as freely as they are, I wouldn't have taken it."
The writers' demands are part of a menu of issues as the entertainment industry faces a series of potential strikes that could cripple film and television production, starting in the late spring.
Besides the writers' threatened strike, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, representing 135,000 actors, are scheduled to walk out on June 30. The Writers Guild and the executives of the studios and television networks -- called the Alliance for Motion Picture and Television Producers -- are set to begin two weeks of talks on Jan. 22.
The writers also have a series of financial demands, mostly involving pay increases for videocassette and DVD sales, as well as payments from overseas markets for television writers.
But the nonmonetary issues are driving the protests of the Writers Guild, representing 11,000 writers on the East and West Coasts. "The major issue is about respect," said Daniel M. Petrie Jr., a former president of the Writers Guild on the West Coast and the screenwriter of, among other films, "Beverly Hills Cop" and "The Big Easy."
"There's a culture in Hollywood that devalues the contribution of the writer to a film," Mr. Petrie said. "In some ways, it's more dysfunctional today than it's ever been."
Barry Meyer, the chairman and chief executive of AOL Time Warner's Warner Brothers, and Robert Iger, the president and chief operating officer of Walt Disney, who are serving as spokesmen for the studio and network negotiating teams, said they expected the overall strike talks to be arduous.
"Many of the issues are resolvable, but I don't think we can have a resolution of the creative issues without the full consultation of the Directors Guild," said Mr. Meyer, a low-key and respected Hollywood figure. "A dialogue between the writer, the director and the production companies is the most productive way of getting things going. Is it complicated? Of course it is.".
Mr. Iger is bracing himself for an ordeal. "This is going to be a long and difficult process," he said. "I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic."
Not all directors, of course, are averse to keeping writers on the set and listening to their suggestions. Louis Malle, the late French director, once insisted to his producers on "Atlantic City," the 1980 film, that he wanted the screenwriter, John Guare, on the set. "If you have someone on the set for the hair," Mr. Malle said, "why would you not have someone for the words?"

HEADLINE: CLINTON IS CALLING FOR MORE SCRUTINY OF MAJOR AIRLINES 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

 BODY:
In the wake of recent deals that would consolidate the airline industry in the hands of a few giant carriers, the Clinton administration plans to issue a last-minute call to police the industry more closely. 
 In a speech this evening in New York and at a news conference tomorrow, the departing Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater intends to release three studies criticizing the state of competition in air travel and laying out a blueprint for how the government can improve the situation, according to senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 But after receiving strong criticism from the airlines, some academics and the White House itself, and with less than a week left in the Clinton administration, Mr. Slater will stop short of issuing guidelines first proposed three years ago that would have put airlines on notice about how aggressively they could respond to low-fare competitors. 
The officials and others who have read or been briefed on the studies said that they argue that the airlines use a wide variety of tactics to suppress competition, including frequent-flier program bonuses, payments to travel agencies and exclusive corporate contracts. 
The studies also contend that the big airlines exploit their dominance of many major metropolitan airports to charge high fares, rebutting arguments by the airlines and some academics that such premiums have been overstated.
Mr. Slater is expected to say that the new research lays the economic and legal foundation for the Transportation Department to use its authority more aggressively to promote competition. 
"They are now making the claim that they understand the problem much better and plan to use the department's enforcement powers," said one person who was briefed by administration officials.
The original guidelines proposed in 1998 were intended to prevent large carriers from driving weaker ones out of business by temporarily lowering fares and adding capacity.
The major airlines may breathe a sigh of relief that the administration has decided not to issue the guidelines, but they are not likely to be happy with Mr. Slater's parting shot. 
Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the industry's principal lobby, said yesterday that the domestic airline industry was among the most competitive in the world. 
"Anticompetitive actions are against the law, period," he said. "Our members have and will continue to comply with the law." 
Several of the small carriers and consumer advocates who long backed the original guidelines said yesterday that they were not disappointed by the administration's decision to abandon them. The administration's new approach, they said, identifies a broader set of unfair practices by big airlines and therefore could be more effective.
"The D.O.T. has it within their authority to do something," said David Neeleman, the chief executive of JetBlue Airways, a new low-fare airline based at J.F.K. in New York. "As the industry consolidates and there are fewer and fewer players, I would hope the D.O.T. would step up and be a little more vigilant."
Of course, that will be up to the incoming Bush administration. A spokesman for the Bush transition team, Scott McClellan, would not discuss details of plans for promoting airline competition. 
But some people think that the new administration will have difficulty avoiding the issue of airline competition, even if it wants to. 
Several representatives and senators in both political parties, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, have taken a strong interest in the industry, spurred on by angry constituents and, in some cases, by their own unhappy travel experiences. 
In addition, Norman Mineta, a Democrat and Mr. Bush's choice for Transportation Secretary, has extensive experience with aviation, including the issue of competition.
Last week's announcement that American Airlines plans to buy Trans World Airlines and some of the assets of US Airways as part of a plan to smooth the purchase of the rest of US Airways by United Airlines raised an outcry from many lawmakers. 
The deal would leave American flying about half the domestic passengers at Kennedy. "Anytime you have a competitor that controls 50 percent of the market, you worry about them controlling the market," Mr. Neeleman said. 
The Bush Justice Department will also inherit the first predatory-pricing lawsuit against an airline since the industry was deregulated 22 years ago. The suit, filed in 1999, contended that American Airlines drove competitors out of its Dallas-Fort Worth hub in the mid-1990's by cutting prices below cost and offering more flights. After the competitors left, the government said, American promptly raised fares and reduced flights. American has denied the accusation. The trial is scheduled to begin in May. 
Since deregulation, the Transportation Department has had strong powers to police the industry. But it has been reluctant to use them. The agency first decided to devise new competition rules after the airlines themselves asked for guidance in the late 1990's. But after a draft of the guidelines was announced by Mr. Slater, the big airlines strongly attacked it, arguing that the department was exceeding its authority and usurping the antitrust laws. 
The airlines spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress in 1998, which directed the Transportation Department to delay issuing the rules until the Transportation Research Board, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, conducted a study.
The resulting 1999 study by a committee of 11 academics, lawyers and former airline executives "noted some alarming trends against healthy rivalry" in the industry and urged the government to take "decisive steps" to increase competition. But it also concluded that the proposed guidelines were flawed and warned that they "could lead to regulations that would stifle competition more than encourage it."
Some White House advisers agreed. They were joined by the Justice Department, which feared the guidelines would muddy its authority as the enforcer of antitrust laws. The administration had the added incentive that labor unions, which Vice President Al Gore was counting on in his bid for the presidency, also opposed the guidelines. They viewed them as a bailout for nonunion airlines that could hurt the major carriers, which are highly unionized.
Finally, after nearly three years, the Transportation Department came to agree last month with the critics who said the guidelines were too narrow and too rigid. "To come out with hard-and-fast rules has been discarded as not right for the industry," one administration official said. "It could be harmful to the very people we are trying to assist."
But one study Mr. Slater is expected to cite concludes that relying on antitrust laws alone cannot preserve competition and that the department has the authority to act.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Politicians Stand in Way Of Harlem

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
THE good news for Harlem, as you may have read on Martin Luther King's Birthday, is that people are still eager to fix up homes there despite the neighborhood scandal involving the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The bad news is that politicians and bureaucrats still want to lend a helping hand.
 Local politicians and HUD officials are still committed to giving preference to nonprofit groups over private developers and speculators. Instead of simply auctioning off buildings and vacant land to the highest bidder, officials are determined to pursue larger social goals. As Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, put it last year, "The highest bidder does not necessarily know what's best for a community." HUD officials say they're trying to "do the right thing." 
 What is the right thing for the community? To New York politicians, the answer is always "affordable housing," and their developer of choice is a nonprofit group. Never mind that the current scandal in Harlem involves nonprofit groups that milked a HUD loan program and then abandoned the properties they were supposed to be fixing up. Since the scandal broke, city politicians have been promising to spend more money on subsidies to nonprofit developers.
Never mind that the neighborhoods being revived were built without HUD loans or the efforts of nonprofit groups. Politicians and housing advocates assume that private developers can't do the job anymore. The conventional wisdom is that the market can't provide affordable housing because it's not profitable to build or renovate housing in poor and working class neighborhoods.
But the conventional wisdom doesn't jibe with the current reality in Harlem. Now that housing prices in nearby neighborhoods have shot up so dramatically, buyers are willing to spend more than $500,000 for a Harlem brownstone. The market wants to redevelop Harlem. It's politicians who are standing in the way. They say gentrification reduces the supply of affordable housing, when in fact just the reverse can happen.
If a couple from, say, Morningside Heights buys a boarded-up brownstone in Harlem, it starts a chain reaction. A couple from Kingsbridge in the Bronx might move into the family's old apartment, and then the Kingsbridge place is occupied by someone from a slightly poorer neighborhood, and the chain reaction continues, affecting poorer and poorer people at each step.
BEFORE long, a dozen families might move into better housing thanks to that one rehab job in Harlem, all at no cost to the taxpayer. All the families have climbed what Howard Husock calls the housing ladder, a process that encourages people to acquire bourgeois values instead of hoping to luck into a subsidized home.
"Why do we think it's a good idea to arbitrarily reward a few low-income people with homes they couldn't afford themselves?" asks Mr. Husock, a housing scholar at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
"Our society is structured to give you an incentive to work and save and stay married so you can climb to a better home in a better neighborhood," Mr. Husock said. "We shouldn't send the message that the way to do that is to win a lottery."
Mr. Husock also faults housing reformers for trying to permanently designate certain buildings and blocks as low-income housing. "There's a cycle of decay and regeneration of neighborhoods just as there is in forests," he said, "and a city will die if you disrupt that process."
That process gradually transformed Harlem as Dutch farmers gave way to Irish squatters and then to developers catering to Germans and Eastern Europeans. An "improvement organization" of whites (who probably claimed to speak for "the community") tried to keep out blacks, but landlords were too eager to rent rooms to the highest bidders of any race.
Today the high bidders could help reintegrate the neighborhood, economically as well as racially, yet the prospect does not have local politicians rhapsodizing about a gorgeous mosaic. Maybe they really are just dedicated to neighborhood preservation.
Or maybe there's also another kind of preservation at work. Politicians who fight for affordable housing, after all, are accustomed to being remembered at election time by the tenants and nonprofit groups that get the subsidies. People who pay for their own homes might not be so grateful. What's good for Harlem is not necessarily good for Harlem's politicians.

An Impact Player, in Life and in Death

BYLINE:  By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
IN the modest, red brick First Baptist Church in the tough part of Far Rockaway, Queens, the organist and the drummer struck up "The Sidewalks of New York" as the mourners for the funeral service yesterday began to file in. It is a bouncy tune, recalling sweet old days, but to the ears of some, and amid the tears, the song never sounded so sad. 
 It was on a sidewalk of New York, after all, not far from this church, that the 17-year-old boy lying in the half-open coffin in the wood-beamed church was shot to death. He had been trying to be a peacemaker in a neighborhood dispute last Wednesday when he was shot in the face by a 19-year-old fellow he had never before met. 
 The boy in the coffin was Thomas Kareem Johnson Jr. He was a senior at Christ the King High School. He was the football team's captain and star running back and an all-league selection. He was an excellent student. He had received recruiting letters from colleges like Harvard, Yale, Penn, Navy, Temple and Hofstra. The principal of the school, Michael Lynch, said that on Tommy Johnson's last math test, he received a 99, a score he never got to see.
Inside the coffin, Tommy Johnson wore his maroon Christ the King football jersey, with the white No. 5.
Three busloads of students arrived from Tommy's school and filled the balcony of the church. Hundreds more family members and friends crowded into the pews and stood along the side aisles. Others jammed into the basement or stood outside on Redfern Avenue, listening to the service over speakers. There were also a few reporters on hand, as well as some television crews on the street.
"If Tommy hadn't been a football player," said the clergyman Rubin Mitchell, who delivered the eulogy, "he would have been just another statistic, one of many young boys and girls who get murdered on these streets regularly. Something has to be done about it. The communities have to work together. 
"Some of the children have parents who are only 14 years older than they are. Some are raised by grandparents and great-grandparents. And there's this whole culture of admiration for the thug life, as they call it. What's happening is a tragedy beyond description."
A reading teacher at Middle School 198, across the street from where Tommy Johnson was shot, Mary Dever, said, "Even for parents who are at home for the kids -- and most want the best for their children -- some are afraid to even come to P.T.A. meetings because of the drive-by shootings." 
Tommy Johnson's parents, however, were very much involved. 
"They gave order to Tommy Johnson's life in an environment of disorder," said Maxine Schack, who represented the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care center, where Thomas Johnson Sr. was a driver and attendant. "And you always knew when it was 3 o'clock, because Mr. Johnson was calling his home. He was a father who needed to know where his children were."
Tommy Johnson had said that his dream was to get an education, maybe play pro football, too, but earn enough to buy his parents a home away from this neighborhood.
His parents, Thomas Sr. and Juanita Johnson, sat in the front row, within a yard or so of their son. They sat with their other children: a daughter, Tierra, 15, and two sons, Travis, 10, and Tysean, 4. An usher in nurse's white stood in front of Juanita Johnson, sometimes fanning her with a small fan, other times dabbing the tears from her eyes.
Juanita Johnson is a civilian worker in the nearby 100th Precinct. And members of the precinct were in attendance, to pay their respects.
One person who spoke during the service, Congressman Gregory W. Meeks, began by looking at the parents. "Thank you for a job well done," he said. And the congregation erupted in applause. "You raised a young man who's a shining example of life. You raised a young man who will have made an impact on our lives henceforth. Just look at all the people here who have been moved by him."
The murder of Tommy Johnson occurred after he and three cousins had tried to settle a misunderstanding over a girl. According to the police, Charles Sealey, unemployed and with four arrests, pulled out a .380 semiautomatic handgun and fired a series of shots. One struck Tommy Johnson, killing him immediately.
Early Saturday morning, Sealey gave himself up to the police. He was accompanied by his parents.
"Now we have two families destroyed. Why?" Thomas Johnson Sr. had been quoted as saying. "The whole community is torn up. We're loving people. We go to church, we did the right things, but when you're living with thugs and hoodlums it's hard."
The choir sang gospels. The congregation provided harmony. The eulogies from community, clergy, family were moving. And a young man with a world of potential and possibilities lay dead. There were more tears as mourners filed past the open casket.
The organist and drummer began to play the spiritual "By and By." An elderly woman, Lucille Foster, was given the microphone and began to sing, with a beautiful, powerful voice that rang out through the church:
In the land of perfect day, 
When the mists have rolled away,
We will understand it better by and by,
By and by.

HEADLINE: Seeing Hardship Through a Windshield; 
Truck Drivers Feel a Recession Coming, Mile After Weary Mile

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE LeDUFF

DATELINE: MANADAHILL, Pa. 

 BODY:
They wandered in off the road reeking of diesel and themselves. They had driven in from around the country, from the stockyards and the swamps and the steel mills. Some had driven 800 miles all day and night to land in this truck plaza.
 The highwaymen were nail-bitten and listless, their eyes half closed from cigarette smoke and fatigue. They sat in the "tweakers' lounge," a dreary room with rows of chairs and a large-screen television. This is where truck drivers -- some strung out from the road, others from pills and most from cigarettes -- wait to wind down. They try to sleep only because the government makes them stop. After eight legal hours of sitting idle, they were off again to another town, another load, on roads linking everything together but their lives. It was 1 a.m. 
 These drivers were the lucky ones. They had a load and a destination, and the only thing that was really wrong with them was overeating. It was the other truckers standing out by the electronic strip poker machines who were in the straits. Some had been waiting a day and a half here, just outside Harrisburg and about 160 miles southwest of Manhattan. They were stuck at the major routing hub for all goods moving from points north, south and west, goods destined for the metropolis. 
They were waiting for a load and they were rested. But the digital load board near the lounge, advertising jobs in the area, told them what they already knew; there was nothing to carry.
When you are paid by the mile, there is one law of the road and one law only, said Robert Strong, a road-worn Cajun from Shreveport, La. "If the wheels ain't turning, you ain't making money." 
Many of these working Americans, like Mr. Strong, have no education beyond some high school. They might read a book now and then when they can't sleep or the weather shuts them down. They might read a little of the newspaper, usually the sports pages. They get some of their information from television, but most of it comes from around the coffee counters at the truck plazas. They couldn't tell you who Alan Greenspan was, but they could tell you this. If this is not a recession, it is close to one.
"I ain't seen it this bad in years," said Rick Hummelbaugh, 52, a barrel of a man whom the other drivers call Dead Eye. "You got so many guys here sitting longer between loads. And out there on the highway I'm noticing less car carriers, less rolled steel, less lumber and less insulation. It don't look good is all I'm saying." 
Economists are not ready to call it a recession. The economy is still growing, but at a slower pace. Automobile sales were off 18 percent last month from a year ago; single-family-home starts fell by nearly half a percentage point in November, their third straight monthly decline. Moreover, 178,000 manufacturing jobs were lost last year, 62,000 in December alone. 
The trucking industry is one of the first to notice the signs when the American economy is retreating. "We knew the economy was in trouble six months ago," said Donald Broughton, a transportation analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
"Eighty percent of all goods in this country move by truck," Mr. Broughton said. "If you're looking for an indication of where the economy is going, take a look at what's going on on the highway."
Mr. Broughton said that more than 1,350 companies with five trucks or more went bankrupt in the third quarter of 2000, nearly double the record set in the previous quarter.
Industry experts attribute the failures to rising diesel costs, insurance rates and wage pressures. But a decline in goods being shipped is a major factor.
In tonnage, the trucking industry was off 7 percent from July through September compared with the same period a year before. One fallout from the downturn is that people making a marginal living hauling these goods are being pushed to the brink, idling longer in truck stops like this, hoping to make ends meet.
"I don't worry about going home no more," said Texas Terry Adams, a truck owner who wears a beard and cowboy hat and leases his labor and rig to a trucking company. "The dispatcher don't even try to route you home no more. They just want to keep you chained to the wheel. Keep you moving. So I don't worry about it no more. When I got to go home I just go home. I'm my own man."
J. R. Bartz, who has been running his own truck since the 60's, said: "I used to worry about that too -- going home. But my ex-wife took the house, so I don't worry about having a home." 
Truck drivers tell their children about the good part of the job, forgetting to tell them about the bad. They talk about freedom and call themselves the last of the cowboys. They make their world sound as if it were an extension of the Wild West, and it is, in some ways. They see themselves as the last of the unhenpecked heroes, willing to go anywhere at any time. They are willing to thumb their noses at the law and make 2,500 miles in two days if the money is right.
That is the good part. There is plenty of bad. The broken marriages. The kidney stones. The loneliness. The pay. Their world is through the windshield, and when they see a young couple pass them by, they wish they had a bit of that, too. They might think about that couple for the next 50 miles.
Since the industry was deregulated in 1980, the wages and the quality of life has spiraled downward for the trucker while the hours worked have doubled. The new rules allowed free entry into the carrying market, eliminated indirect routes, to protect the carriers, and at the same time did away with collective rate-setting.
Before deregulation, the industry worked much the same way the airlines work now, by a hub-and-spoke system. A driver might run from Gary, Ind., to Detroit and back, and be home in time for dinner. Another driver might then take the cargo from Detroit to Cleveland and so on.
Hub-and-spoke drivers are now just a small part of the overall carrying market. The rest, called long-haul drivers, might now load up in Jacksonville, Fla., drive to Harrisburg, drop a load there, pick up another in Pittsburgh and continue to Los Angeles. Most are required by their companies to work three weeks straight before getting a day off.
Deregulation has resulted in lower shipping prices, but it has also brought down the wages of the drivers. Although employment in the trucking industry has increased by 3.9 percent since the early 80's, real annual earnings for drivers, adjusted for inflation, have dropped 30 percent, said Prof. Michael H. Belzer, associate director of the Trucking Industry Program at the University of Michigan.
Truck drivers are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning they are not entitled to overtime. The average driver now makes about $40,000 a year.
"Typically these guys make about 31 cents a mile," Professor Belzer said. "By law they can only work 10 hours straight. Then they must rest 8, and then they can work 10 hours again. They have to cheat to make it."
Federal law says that all work time falls under the 10-hour rule. So, in order to save driving time, a truck driver will typically omit loading and unloading time. When you get paid by the mile, four hours at the loading dock leaves just six driving hours, so many drivers do not log these hours in the book.
About 400,000 long-haul trucks are on the road, 160,000 of them owned by individuals. For these owner-operators, whose expenses come out of their own pockets, life has become a faucet of misery with no stopcock. 
There are a few rules in the trucking world. Never run out of tobacco. Keep emergency food and water stored in your rig. Stay out of New York City; the traffic will eat you and your time up.
Wayne McMillan, 50, an owner-operator, was sitting around the truck plaza drinking quarts of coffee while waiting for a call about a job.
"Times are real tough," he said. He is barely meeting the payments on his rig. "I'm waiting for the times to get better." He thought about what he had said for a moment. 
"Come to think of it, they said these were the best times we ever knowed. But when I got into it 30 years ago I was making the same money I'm making now and I was home on the weekends."
Mr. McMillan scratched it out on a napkin, basing his calculations on a four-and-a-half-week month.
Expenses (per month)
Truck payment: $1,600
Tires: $190
Oil and Filters: $200
Permits/Taxes: $200
Truck Insurance: $150
Load Insurance: $100
Fuel: $2,500
Tolls: $200
Misc.: $200
Total: $5,340 per month
Revenue: 10,000 miles a month @ $1 per mile = $10,000
Net Income = $1,036 per week @ 90 hours per week = $11.50 an hour.
"That's not a whole lot considering I live in my rig 24 hours a day, seven days a week," he said. "And now I'm sitting here with no work. I'm going to lose that truck if it keeps up."
And they talked around the coffee counter for hours, moaning about the economy and their bank notes and the unappreciated plight of the worker. The waitress let them know they were not the only ones suffering. Her tips are down 20 percent.
It went like this late into the evening until Mr. Strong's pager went off. It was his company calling.
He soon came back with his head down. He had a load. Long Island. 
The men at the counter laughed at him. "You gonna make $78 for 10 hours' work, boy."

HEADLINE: Keeping the National Light Bulb Turned On 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: LOVELAND, Colo., Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Shortly before 11 a.m. today, a red phone rang here at the Rocky Mountain Regional Office of the Western Area Power Administration. Someone was calling to notify officials that California had just gone to a Stage 1 energy alert. Fifteen minutes later, the red phone rang again, with worse news: Stage 2.
 The calls did not exactly generate sweat on the brows of John Moore or Tom Woods, the duty officers at the time who were managing the flow of electricity across the region they serve, which includes parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Nebraska and Kansas. The same thing has happened often during California's current energy crisis. The alerts mean that California's energy surplus at the moment has grown so thin that energy companies are looking to buy additional supplies to meet unanticipated demand. 
 But in a larger context, the calls served as the latest reminder that energy problems in one state can affect others, owing to the intricacy, complexity and inter-connectedness of America's energy grid. 
If it seems that consumers in California are the only ones screaming about soaring energy costs, that is only because there are more of them -- California uses one-third of all the energy produced in the West. The same steep price increases are occurring nationwide because no matter where electricity is produced, most of it costs about the same and it all flows through the same regional grids of electrical lines.
"It's always a problem of stability," said Mark Fidrych, a security specialist whose staff monitors the operations here and at similar regional centers in California and Oregon. "If the next bad thing occurs, the problems cascade."
The flow of power produced in the western third of the country is controlled by 31 centers like the one here. All but four are operated by private utility companies or local governments. The operations here and those in three other regions are run by the federal Energy Department. But they all perform, essentially, the same functions, and that is to manage the flow of energy in such a way that supply and demand remain about equal.
In Western states, it has become an increasingly large challenge in recent years for reasons that include unexpected weather patterns like drier winters in the Pacific Northwest and longer hot spells in the Southwest, population shifts to California and the Southwest, a strong economy that has encouraged new businesses to start and old ones to expand and, of course, the glitches in California's efforts to deregulate its energy system.
Those conditions have taken on greater influence at a time when the construction of power plants has waned -- especially in California -- and the rising demand for power is taxing the existing plants throughout the West. All are taken off-line periodically for routine maintenance. But now, more of the older plants are developing problems that require unscheduled maintenance.
Those factors have led to a sharply rising demand on energy supplies and rising prices, which are borne by most utility companies, no matter what the demand may be in the area they serve.
While the economics of electricity are played out among energy producers, middlemen, utilities and increasingly angry consumers, the mechanics of delivery occur in the quiet of control rooms like the one here, a high-technology maze of computer screens, wall-mounted monitors, telephones, illuminated grids that represent power lines across the region and television screens tuned to the Weather Channel. Imagine NASA without the rockets.
The center here manages the flow of electricity generated by 50 power plants. Whether produced by hydro-electricity, nuclear fuels, natural gas or coal, the energy they generate is pumped into the grid and, ultimately, drawn off by utility companies according to schedules of estimated need that the companies submit to energy brokers by the hour.
For the center's workers, the trick is to match the need with the supply, which is done through computerized adjustments. A constant flow of data, which appears on the wall of monitors, shows them how successful they are. At an adjacent bank of computers, other people monitor the performance of equipment.
Most days progress smoothly, but problems arise, as when a falling tree or ice storm snaps a line, causing a disruption. That requires adjustments to the system so that electricity can spread evenly across the grid, rather than overload other lines, causing more disruptions.
But as demand for energy is growing so are problems.
"We're seeing outages that we've never seen before," said Joel Bladow, manager of the center here. "With changes in the market the way energy is bought and sold, more and more we're seeing bulk transactions of energy over longer distances, like California buying energy from Wyoming. We had one instance recently where a plant in Utah tripped off-line, overloading a line between Utah and Colorado that was rated to carry 680 megawatts. All of a sudden, it was over 800, so we had to take quick action."
"If we hadn't," he added, "another line might have tripped out, and we can only plan for so many things going wrong. If too many things go wrong, we're in trouble."
Perhaps the surest measure of the monitoring operations is how often the digital clocks at the operations center have to be recalibrated. When too much energy is flowing through the regional grid, the clocks speed up. When the flow is down, they slow. In either case, when the clocks are off by as much as two seconds, they are adjusted.
"We adjust them very, very, very frequently," Mr. Fidrych said with a laugh. "Now, maybe 20 times a month."

HEADLINE: Hopes Fade That More Salvadorans Will Be Found Alive 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Hopes dwindled here today for finding more survivors trapped under tons of earth in a suburb after the earthquake on Saturday set off a landslide. 
 Officials said that by their estimates more than 600 people had been killed, and some reports said the number still missing was as high as 4,000. 
 Many of the dead were in Las Colinas, a neighborhood of Santa Tecla, a suburb of San Salvador where a housing development was obliterated by a wall of earth that came crashing down a hillside. 
In the town of Comasagua, an area southwest of here that has been inaccessible to rescue workers, local reports said there had been a landslide that might have buried many more victims. The government of El Salvador asked Colombia to donate 3,000 coffins to help bury the dead. 
There was also widespread damage, clearly visible during helicopter flights by relief workers, in several towns in Usulutan Department, southeast of the capital. With many towns still without running water, public health specialists have begun to provide assistance and post-disaster counseling.
In the town of San Agustin, the red tile or zinc panel roofs of many houses have partly or completely collapsed, exposing the interiors to the elements. On every block, one or more houses have been reduced to adobe and wood, and the interior of a church has crumbled behind its facade. Throughout the streets and fields, residents sought shelter under sheets of blue plastic propped up by poles.
"Except for this area, I think some houses have held up well," said Kenneth Ellis, the director of the local mission of the United States Agency for International Development. "But I think that there is a strong disaster in Usulutan."
Aftershocks continued throughout last night, although they have grown shorter and weaker. At least five of the aftershocks since Saturday have had a magnitude of 5.4 or more.
Rescue workers, including specially trained units from other countries, continued to comb through the dirt and debris in Las Colinas today. The scene was more orderly and without as many gawkers or well-intentioned volunteers as during the first two days.
Bullzdozers and backhoes pried loose clumps of earth as rescue workers shoveled into crannies and craters in a vain search for survivors. Every so often, bodies were plucked out of the ground, placed on stretchers and taken away for identification by relatives or sent to a morgue.
Concern over a series of tremors in Las Colinas led officials to evacuate the residents of several damaged houses on the edges of the huge landslide that buried about 80 percent of the neighborhood's houses. A scooped-out area on the hillside marked the place where the deadly landslide began.
The police also secured a four-block zone in the area to protect household belongings, although reports of theft or looting have been virtually nonexistent.
"The most important thing right now is to save lives," said Interior Minister Mario Acosta Ortel. "It is a matter of time before there is a new avalanche on the houses that have been left standing."
Officials, who have begun to compile damage reports from about 80 percent of the country, said the temblor had left no part of the nation untouched, although compared with the number of deaths in Santa Tecla, loss of life elsewhere was minimal.
Emergency shelters have been set up in health clinics. And bodies, some of them mangled from the effects of the quake and the bulldozers that worked to clear the area, have begun to be sent to morgues.
A sprawling tent city has sprung up at El Cafetalon, a recreation field in Santa Tecla where volunteers have been sifting through piles of donated clothing and distributing food and setting up medical care. 
Two and three families huddle under each hastily built tent of plastic and split bamboo, some of them finding their way to the camp after having had to sleep outdoors since the quake. All day, television stations broadcast appeals for food and clothing, as well as reports from stranded residents of villages who have yet to be visited by relief workers or who are desperately trying to contact relatives.
With rampant -- and unfounded -- rumors of tidal waves or worse, officials have issued appeals for calm.
The United States has sent five helicopters from an American military base in Honduras to assist with aerial damage assessments and recovery efforts. With emergency housing becoming a priority, American relief officials met this morning with representatives of private aid groups to begin planning for rebuilding efforts.
Local work has been hampered, rescuers and others said, by a lack of coordination among the various agencies and volunteers who showed up to help. The national emergency center got off to a slow start when it had to be relocated after its original site suffered structural and other damage.
Communications have also been spotty, since cellular phone service has been intermittent in some areas.
The damage from the earthquake may surpass that from Hurricane Mitch, which devastated much of Central America in 1998. It is a heavy burden on this country, which emerged from a 12-year civil war in the early 1990's.
"It's not just Mitch," said Rose Likins, the ambassador from the United States. "Many Salvadorans are still recovering from the conflict. The peace accords were signed in 1992, and Salvador is a model in making that a reality. Salvadorans are very resilient. I have every confidence they will weather this as they have other crises."
Maria Arely Abrego and her four children now wonder where they will go since their house collapsed on Saturday. They spent last night outdoors before setting up a makeshift home on a Santa Tecla soccer field.
"I really have no idea what we are going to do," she said. "Maybe we can go back and rebuild the house, but I think there isn't any opportunity for us there, so maybe we should do something different."
Nearby, her 9-year-old son, Luciano, knew one thing was already going to be different.
"There won't be any football games this Sunday," he said, chomping on a piece of chocolate.

HEADLINE: Struggling Salvadoran Workers Try to Aid Homeland in Crisis 

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: GLEN COVE, N.Y., Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The Salvadoran day laborers of this Nassau County city are learning that winter is the worst time for a natural disaster to hit their homeland. These are the months when there is little or no work, so they try to live off their summer savings. Now they are also trying to scrape together help for their families, some of whose homes and lives were destroyed in an earthquake over the weekend.
 Fermin Martinez, 33, from Santa Ana, El Salvador, learned from his wife that his family's home was destroyed in the earthquake Saturday, which measured 7.6 on the standard seismic scale. Luckily, he said, his family was outside the house at the time. 
 Mr. Martinez had just wired $300 to his family -- his wife, six children, eight brothers and father -- to help them survive and rebuild, he said today. Now he is left wondering how he will pay for rent and food.
The work that sustains him during the warmer months, when he cuts lawns and does landscaping, has dried up, and he has not been able to find a job in 15 days, he said today, as the Rev. Allan Ramirez, who was speaking to immigrants about the quake, translated. 
"We lost everything, just down to the ground," Mr. Martinez said. "Now we will try and rebuild, if God allows us to. Now we will have to see, we will have to start all over again. I want to sleep, but I can't even close my eyes. I keep thinking someone has died and they don't want to tell me, and I wonder." His eyes were shining, and he looked away.
Mr. Ramirez, of the Brookville Reformed Church, later offered to help Mr. Martinez pay his rent.
Around Long Island and the New York region, groups are organizing to send help to El Salvador, where 600 people were killed in the quake and perhaps thousands more are missing.
Merchants in Hempstead have been collecting canned goods to send. Cayetano Moran, who owns La Union restaurant in Hempstead, said he had spoken with the Salvadoran Consulate about holding a benefit at his disco to help the earthquake victims.
And Danilo Guirola, vice consul of the Salvadoran Consulate on Long Island, held a meeting tonight in Hempstead in which private and governmental groups formed a committee to raise money for the earthquake victims.
The vice consul urged people to donate money through the American Red Cross by calling (800) HELP-NOW and earmarking gifts for El Salvador. 
Because of downed phone lines and widespread electricity disruptions, many Salvadorans in the metropolitan area have not yet heard how their relatives have fared.
"I don't know anything about my family because calls are not getting through there," said Lucindo Bonilla, 38, a day laborer from Anamoros who is worried about his three sons. "I need to know what happened."
At My Store on School Street in Glen Cove, the shopkeeper, Carlos Barajas, said only one or two of 20 callers there had succeeded in speaking with family members in El Salvador. "They're frustrated," he said. "This is two days without knowing anything." 
Henry Villatoro, 19, who works at El Tazumal, a restaurant on Glen Street here, said that his parents had left New York on Wednesday to visit family members in Santa Tecla, where the worst landslides occurred, but that they had been turned back because the area was considered too dangerous. 
The Salvadoran Mass at St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in Glen Cove was packed on Sunday, he said, and he could tell from the number of customers he had that the economics of the immigrants had changed over the weekend.
"Right here it has been kind of slow, because a lot of people are sending money," he said, looking around the restaurant. He suspected that members of the one family eating there had no relatives in the earthquake because they looked happy, he said. He was right; they are Honduran.
In Hempstead, at the Musica Latina store on North Franklin Avenue, Gloria Roca said the only way to get in touch at first with her Salvadoran relatives in their town of Santiago y Maria was through cellular phones. 
"My family had a bakery, and the whole thing went down," she said, adding that a grocery was also destroyed. "Supposedly, the bank and the hospital had pretty bad damage. 
"Every time we talk to them, they say things are still moving right now, 6 or 10 times a day. People don't go inside because they're scared." 
In Glen Cove, Mr. Martinez said he would like to visit his homeland now but could not afford to. "How would I come back here?" he said. "At least here I can work and make money." 
Mr. Martinez learned that the cathedral in Santa Ana had been destroyed, as well as the Church of the Calvary. But he was relieved to hear that his family had survived. "Thank God that they are O.K., it's just that they are so frightened," he said.
"I feel very afflicted," he said. "What am I going to eat now that I had to send them what little I have?"

 The laudable decision by Justice Leland DeGrasse of the State Supreme Court requiring a new system of financing education in New York State (front page, Jan. 11) needs to be supplemented with funds for a study to determine which educational programs provide the most "bang for the buck" in improving student achievement in reading and in mathematics. 
 We need to compare the improvement attributable to increased spending on books to that attributable to increased training of teachers; to compare providing school buildings in good condition to providing preschool or free lunch; to compare providing special reading or mathematics programs to providing computers in classrooms; to compare reducing class size to providing in-service teacher training.

Re "State Judge Rules School Aid System Is Unfair to City" (front page, Jan. 11):
 New York has created high-stakes Regents' exams in many subject areas, thus creating standardized educational ends across the state. 
The means, or educational financing, to reach these ends are anything but uniform, resulting in less money for the students who needed it most -- the economically disadvantaged minority students from New York City. 
 Unfortunately, any movement toward equality of financing will undoubtedly face opposition from suburbanites, who pay a disproportionate share of the taxes. However, suburbanites should support any effort toward equality of financing, not only because it fulfills the American ideal of equal opportunity, but also because it will likely result in lower taxes later to pay for child welfare agencies, law enforcement, prisons, drug intervention programs and Medicaid.

HEADLINE: MANHATTAN RENTS STARTING TO DROP AFTER LONG CLIMB 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Manhattan's skyrocketing apartment rental market has turned around and started drifting back toward earth. For the first time in seven years, many landlords are reducing prices and some are even offering to pay broker fees, allowing tenants to save thousands of dollars.
 Real estate brokers say there are many more apartments languishing in their computers, unrented. And to many of them, the city no longer seems to be immune to the economic slowdown that has been affecting other parts of the country. Vacancies started accumulating in the fall, the brokers say, after the Nasdaq plummeted and dot-coms began failing. 
 Right now, agents say, many people who would have been looking for bigger and better apartments are biding their time. 
Even as prices begin to stabilize or drop, rents remain higher than they were two or three years ago.
But suddenly, "owners will be negotiable," said Ruth McCoy, executive director of Feathered Nest, one of Manhattan's largest rental agencies. Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, agreed. From Park Avenue palazzi to East Village walkup studios, he said, rents are "absolutely more negotiable throughout the marketplace." 
The change in rental prices and negotiability follows a leveling off of co-op and condominium purchase prices reported over the summer. But many agents say the trend is even more pronounced for rentals.
At the Halstead Property Company, Brian G. Edwards, the director of leasing, said that activity -- people looking and renting -- has "fallen off fairly severely" in the last six months. "The wheels haven't fallen off the bus," he said of Manhattan's rental market. "But they're pretty squeaky right now."
Douglas Elliman, a major city brokerage firm, reported that prices for one-bedroom rentals had fallen 10 to 12 percent and that two-bedroom rents were down 8 percent, according to Marge Pearson, the executive in charge of residential rentals at Elliman. 
At Citi Habitats, the city's largest rental agency, one-bedroom apartments that were once $3,300 a month are now listed near $2,700; studios that once brought $2,200 to $2,400 now bring $1,950 to $2,000. The agency has about 5,000 listings, said Andrew S. Heiberger, the company president. "That's double what we had about six months ago," he added.
Most brokers agree that since October, "special offers" to tenants and rental agents have increased. Mr. Edwards said Halstead's 54 agents had been barraged by landlords' offers of markdowns and bonuses. One recent flier offered $1,000 off the first month's rent for apartments in a new building at Rutgers Street and East Broadway on the Lower East Side.
"Not a day goes by when we don't get a pile of e-mails or faxes from landlords, reducing prices," Mr. Edwards said on Thursday, brandishing a stack of markdown offers from that day. "And every day, I get calls from the owners of new buildings, asking where the agents are. The agents are sitting at their desks, waiting for the phones to ring."
Just last Thursday, Joseph Moinian, the developer of 1 West Street, a new building, gave a catered party for agents and tried to persuade them, with promises of bonuses, to bring their clients.
Within the last few months, the number of discretionary renters -- those who are not forced to move but want a bigger or nicer apartment -- fell off significantly, Mr. Edwards said. "The majority of our renters are now people who have to move: people who are relocating, selling their apartments here or getting married, or divorced."
Landlords who last June could pick and choose tenants, along with which calls to take from agents, now fax listings across Manhattan. "Bring Offers!" shouts a faxed listing for a loft on East 12th Street. "New Lower Price!" reads a landlord's fax for a parlor floor in a brownstone on West 9th Street.
"As per our conversation," one Upper West Side owner wrote in longhand, "please lower our rental to $2,900 for this weekend's ad" -- down from $3,100. 
At the still-unfinished Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, one broker is offering a $2,000 bonus to the agent who finds a renter for apartment 10E, a two-bedroom, for $9,500. Across town, Lee Moncho, an English investor who owns one of Donald Trump's new condominium apartments on the Upper West Side, said that last spring, he could have rented his two-bedroom for $6,950 a month. Last week, Mr. Moncho settled for $5,000. "I wanted a warm body -- and secure money," he said. "I'll take that any time."
Though the number of leases signed typically declines around the holidays -- Mr. Heiberger estimated an average of 10 percent -- this year it is down 15 to 25 percent at several brokerage firms that keep statistics on rentals (many do not).
Agents are quick to point out that not every building or apartment has been affected. Buildings in secondary locations, neighborhoods that have less of the cachet and amenities of Greenwich Village, the Upper West Side, Carnegie Hill or other prime areas, were among the first to feel the tug toward price reductions. But even in those prime areas, agents say, landlords have become negotiable, lowering rents in individual deals. "The biggest drops are in the older buildings, where one-bedrooms were overpriced at $3,700, $3,800," said Ms. Pearson of Douglas Elliman. Ms. McCoy of Feathered Nest emphasized that apartments were still renting, although prices were "more conservative." 
Some real estate agents say they welcome the price adjustments. Marilyn Harra Kaye, president of Prudential MLBKaye International Realty, said the reductions, which she documented in a score of examples, were "a healthy thing."
"We've been losing renters to Westchester, to New Jersey and to the other boroughs for so long that rents coming down in Manhattan is good news," she said.
As newcomers frightened by Manhattan's high rents turned toward the outlying boroughs and other locations, prices rose significantly there, but still remained lower than in Manhattan. In the prime Park Slope section of Brooklyn, prices soared, but one-bedrooms were still 25 percent lower than in Manhattan, said Mark L. Pipes, a rental agent with William B. May Real Estate. In the commuter neighborhoods of New Jersey, rents may be even cheaper. While prices may be starting to stabilize in these outlying areas, they have not started to drop, brokers say. Only in the high-rent parts of Brooklyn Heights are landlords slightly more negotiable these days, Mr. Pipes said.
In Manhattan, one bedrooms that rent for less than $2,500 move fast. "Anything under $2,500 for a one bedroom still flies off the hook," Mr. Heiberger said. "Studios under $1,800 fly, too." 
Mr. Heiberger told cautionary tales of landlords and co-op owners who wanted to sublet last year, but who held out too long. "One guy on 11th Street between Fifth and Sixth thought he could get $20,000 a month," the agent said. "He held out all summer. He turned down offers of $16,000 and $17,000. In December, he took $9,800."
In July and August, Ms. Pearson said, rental prices were still climbing 15 to 17 percent over the previous year's figures through most of Manhattan -- with gains of 20 to 22 percent in buildings downtown. "Rises like that are definitely a thing of the past," she said last week. "And the owner paying the fee? We haven't seen that in years."
Rents will probably go up again eventually, predicted Michael Moran, the listings and operations manager at the Corcoran Group -- but probably not before they have further dipped, especially in certain areas. "Within the next 12 months, there will be close to 10 new buildings opening in the downtown-west area," he said of the Chelsea section, between West 20th and 30th Streets. "This will surely bring down rents, and I am sure landlords will be more flexible in lease terms."
After stock values tumbled in the late 1980's, rents stayed high for two years. "This time, the landlords are responding much more quickly," Mr. Edwards said. 
Manhattan's landlords are "positioning themselves to avoid surprises," Ms. Pearson said. "The market will shake itself out."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Nestle Seen as Ready to Buy Ralston Purina

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Nestle, the world's largest food company, has agreed to acquire the Ralston Purina Group, the leading producer of pet food in the United States, for $10.1 billion in cash, executives close to the negotiations said yesterday. 
 The boards of both companies approved the deal yesterday, the executives said, and the transaction is expected to be announced today. 
 Under the terms of the deal, Nestle, whose products range from Perrier bottled water and Alpo dog food to the candy bars that bear its name, will pay $33.50 for each share of Ralston, a 36 percent premium over the closing price of $24.63 on Friday. The markets were closed yesterday in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday. 
Neither company would comment on the deal, which gives Nestle control of well-known brands like Purina Puppy Chow and Meow Mix. But analysts agreed that it provided Nestle, of Vevey, Switzerland, which had more than $46 billion in sales in 1999, with a way of weaning itself away from dependence on comparatively slow-growth foods like candy while strengthening its hold on the promising pet food business.
The prospective deal was reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.
In the last year, a flurry of mergers has reduced the food industry to a handful of primary competitors, all seeking to establish strength through scale. But Nestle's acquisition of Ralston, which had $2.76 billion in revenue in 2000, is the first major consolidation in what has been, until now, a relatively fractured and competitive pet food industry.
By adding Ralston's nearly 27 percent share of the pet food market to the 18.6 percent it already commands, Nestle, the maker of Fancy Feast and Mighty Dog, leaps from a fairly distant second place to the industry's dominant company. Its closest competitor, Mars Inc., the family-owned company that makes Pedigree and Whiskas, holds less than a 15 percent share -- potentially raising red flags with regulators. 
"I think Nestle is going to have a big problem with antitrust issues on this one," said Kieran Mahon of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. "Their market share is going to be far too high for the Federal Trade Commission's liking." Such concerns might be allayed, were Nestle to sell some of its brands.
Underlying the deal is the reality that cat food and dog biscuits represent some of the best prospects for growth in a struggling food industry. With consumers cooking less and snacking more, companies from Kellogg to Campbell have watched with dismay as some of their simplest meals to prepare, like cold cereal and condensed soups, steadily lose their standing in a marketplace hungry for convenience.
But the trend toward eating out more often hardly applies to pets, and with the dog and cat population growing around 4 percent a year -- roughly twice the rate of humans -- the market to feed them has blossomed. In the last year, pet food sales have grown 5.3 percent, according to Information Resource Inc., a market research firm in Chicago. That is more than twice as fast as the sales of food for people.
One reason for the pet food boom is that pet owners, feeling flush in the strong economy, have been more willing to indulge their animals with the market's tastier, more nutritious and, of course, more expensive offerings. And even though consumers are buying more generic sodas and cereal for their families, they have turned premium brands and pet treats into one of the fastest-growing segments of the pet food industry. 
"There's a lot of pampering going on," said Jaine Mehring, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "But we don't know whether if and when there's an economic slowdown, that will change." 
Ralston Purina, one of the few big food companies to sit out the industry's consolidation trend last year, is particularly well positioned in the shift toward premium-price nutrition. Sales of the company's stalwart but somewhat mundane brands like Puppy Chow and Dog Chow have fallen in the last year, but its premium line of dog food, Purina One, was one of the industry's best performers, with sales that grew almost 10 percent. Purina's dog biscuit and treat business also grew nearly 10 percent, bolstered by the ever-greater inclination to do well by the family pet. 
Once a diverse company itself, with everything from cereal to ski resorts, Ralston, based in St. Louis, has spent the last several years paring itself down to focus on pet food and kitty litter. In 1998, it spun off its animal-feeds business as Agribrands International, then did the same with its Eveready battery division last April.
Newly winnowed to its fast-growing pet food business, Ralston became a potential takeover target almost immediately. Although Nestle had spent the last two years casting off its ancillary brands and backing away from acquisitions at a time when most of its rivals were seeking them out, analysts say it was now forced to move swiftly. 
"If Ralston Purina went to Procter & Gamble or Colgate, that would be potentially damaging for Nestle," said Sylvain Mossat of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
Buying Ralston provides Nestle with a chance to realize the 4 percent annual growth that it has chased for almost a decade, but has narrowly failed to achieve. Only 20 percent of Ralston's sales come from overseas markets, and analysts widely expect Nestle to use its presence in virtually every country to turn the Purina name into a global powerhouse. 
Nestle would also be expected to strengthen its bargaining position with retailers, one factor that has driven food companies to consolidate. Pet food is an important item for supermarkets and discount stores like Wal-Mart because it can be hard to find elsewhere and, thus it brings consumers into the store. But unlike some other drivers of store traffic, like eggs, pet food sales offer a sizable profit to retailers, a factor they are likely to consider when negotiating prices with major producers like Nestle.

HEADLINE: Designee Takes a Deft Touch And a Firm Will to Treasury 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
When Paul H. O'Neill, the treasury secretary-designate, became chief executive of Alcoa Inc. in 1987, the Rust Belt company's prospects were so dim that it had one foot out of the aluminum business and was facing an uncertain future, if it had one at all. 
 A dozen years later, when Mr. O'Neill retired, Alcoa was the world's biggest and richest aluminum producer, its new headquarters were winning architectural raves, its bottom line was fat and its shareholders were happy. Alcoa's stock was Wall Street's hottest performer that year, besting such investor darlings as the Microsoft Corporation and the Intel Corporation. 
 Just how Mr. O'Neill, a bureaucrat turned businessman, revived Alcoa's fortunes provides a glimpse into the man who has been designated to carry out -- and influence -- the Bush economic plan at a time of increasing financial uncertainty and general business unease. 
At Alcoa, Mr. O'Neill engineered a financial turnaround through such deft moves as promoting worker safety as a way of improving productivity, setting corporate goals that seemed unrealistically high but were ultimately attained, breaking down bureaucratic walls with a minimum of corporate bloodshed and melding new technologies with old ones as he expanded the Alcoa empire across the globe.
At times so quiet as to seem almost meek, Mr. O'Neill displayed a firm determination to pursue long-term strategic goals even if it meant forsaking short-term profits or breaking with industry practice. On the flip side, this single-mindedness gave Mr. O'Neill a reputation for not suffering fools easily and for displaying a doggedness that could, at times, border on the inflexible and made it hard to build consensus. 
"Paul O'Neill took a very difficult situation and turned it into a winner," said Ira Millstein, a New York lawyer and an adviser to corporate boards. "And he did it through a number of bold steps."
When other companies lowered aluminum prices to make a quick dollar, Mr. O'Neill instead cut Alcoa's production. Where other companies were run by fiat, he managed by articulating shared corporate values and building internal consensus. Where other companies made profits their No. 1 goal, Mr. O'Neill chose productivity and worker safety. And where others begged Washington for protectionism, Mr. O'Neill offered creative alternatives.
"Paul is a very strategic thinker," said Judith M. Gueron, an Alcoa director. "To move an ocean liner like Alcoa in a new direction, he had to have an overall message that would inspire, and he had to build coherence and enlist the passions of his staff. He was very canny in all that."
His strategy paid off. Alcoa reached new heights of profitability, and Mr. O'Neill pulled off the remarkable feat of making money in an industry that was losing it.
"Many on Wall Street look like heroes because they made money when the market was rising," said John Tumazos, an industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street broker. "Paul took Alcoa's stock from $5 to $40 at a time when aluminum prices were falling. He created enormous shareholder wealth when everyone in the industry was on a downhill slide."
On the surface, Mr. O'Neill, who dropped out of college at 19 to marry (he later graduated from Fresno State College), hardly seemed destined for the executive suite. A bureaucrat for 16 years, he rose through the arcane world of systems analysis to become President Gerald R. Ford's deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. While there, Mr. O'Neill, who declined to be interviewed for this article, cemented friendships with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Dick Cheney, the vice president-elect, and Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary-designate, all of whom were Ford administration officials.
"We were working on god-awful economic problems and everything looked bad," said Paul W. MacAvoy, a Ford economic adviser who is now a Yale University professor. "Greenspan. Cheney. Rumsfeld. They were all there. Time and again, Ford would turn to Paul and say, 'Is that right?' And in his quiet, direct way, Paul had the answers. He could be asked about shoe imports and Paul would know the number."
Those Oval Office connections paid off, 10 years later, when Mr. Greenspan, then an Alcoa board member, was part of a group that recruited Mr. O'Neill to become the first outsider to head Alcoa in its hundred-year history.
At the time, Mr. O'Neill was a new director on the Alcoa board and president of the International Paper Company. In a quiet boardroom coup orchestrated, in part, by Mr. Greenspan, Alcoa's top managers were all taken to lunch at an elegant Manhattan club and ousted. Mr. O'Neill was tapped to perform the alchemy of turning Alcoa aluminum into cash.
"We wanted someone with fresh eyes," said Franklin Thomas, an Alcoa board member. "Paul was someone who asked targeted questions, was persistent in his attention to the issues and wouldn't take an answer he thought was mechanical or prepared. He wanted people to think on their feet and anchor their thoughts with data."
Immediately Mr. O'Neill took Alcoa's focus away from an ill-fated diversification plan and back to its core business. He broke up Alcoa's "command and control" structure and replaced it with 20 autonomous units to respond to customers and report to him directly. He wiped away symbols of corporate excess, eliminated the corporate limousine and began to fly commercial class.
He immediately turned down a membership in a prestigious Pittsburgh golf club because it banned women and blacks, and he forbade the use of Alcoa money for dues at clubs that discriminated. He moved out of the executive suite and into a cubicle like everyone else.
But mostly, he figured out how to make money -- not by cutting costs or the payroll, but by improving factory productivity and making worker safety his top goal. In addition to being an altruistic goal, his push on worker safety had bottom-line benefits. He argued that a production process that was so flawed that workers got hurt was one that could not turn out high-quality products efficiently and cost-effectively.
"Every speech he made began with a discussion of safety," said one Wall Street analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He'd go visit investors and talk about safety. They could care less and he's off for 20 minutes on it. But he would say, 'I'm trying to create a cultural change. If I can unify employees on the obvious issue of safety, I can unify them behind return on investment and assets.' "
Mr. O'Neill's attention to safety was so acute that he would often begin speeches by pointing out where the fire exits were.
He won over the unions by telling workers that if they worked smarter and more efficiently, productivity gains would not cost them their jobs. He promised to expand Alcoa's business to keep them employed, and he did so through joint ventures, international acquisitions and new aluminum product lines. When he came to Alcoa, the work force numbered 59,000; when he left, the company had 140,000 employees in 36 countries.
"The unions feared that if productivity improved, half the workers would get fired," said Daniel A. Roling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company. "O'Neill told them he would grow the business. They grudgingly accepted and then improved productivity dramatically and cut costs."
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America, said Mr. O'Neill's emphasis on worker safety was "very sincere" and "one of his strong points." Mr. Becker said he also welcomed Mr. O'Neill's selection since "he understands the need to manufacture things and he's not from Wall Street."
In addition, Mr. O'Neill aligned everyone's financial interest with Alcoa's. He devised an innovative "floating dividend" program providing shareholders with higher dividends in years of exceptional profitability. Rank-and-file factory workers received profit bonuses, and executive pay was tied to profitability.
Once Alcoa gained financial stability, it went on a buying spree, picking up depressed former state-run aluminum makers in Hungary, Italy and Spain as well as taking over the No. 3 domestic producer, Alumax Inc., and then buying its main rival, the Reynolds Metal Company, in August 1999. The Reynolds deal was made three months after Mr. O'Neill retired as chief executive, although he was still the company's chairman. 
Everyone got rich under Mr. O'Neill's tenure -- including Mr. O'Neill. Alcoa's revenues grew to $16.3 billion in 1999 from $9.8 billion in 1988, and the company's market capitalization -- the value of its outstanding shares held by stockholders -- rose to $30.5 billion from $4 billion. 
Last year, Mr. O'Neill took home $36.1 million from Alcoa: a $950,400 base salary, a $2 million bonus and $33.1 million in stock options that he exercised. He also holds options on millions of Alcoa shares that the company values at $86.3 million in government filings.
Most important, Mr. O'Neill bucked the boom-and-bust cycle of aluminum prices by not cutting prices when the competition did -- even if it cost Alcoa in the short run. And he did not raise prices when others did, fearing that customers would seek cheaper alternatives. He correctly reasoned that Alcoa would do best with stable prices.
"Paul turned Alcoa into a company that would be profitable, even when the other companies in the industry weren't," said Marina Whitman, an Alcoa director and an economist. "He wanted to adopt pricing policies to even out the hills and valleys and convince customers it was in their best interest to to have stable pricing. Paul was convinced that not only were big drops in prices a problem, so were big rises."
He also reached out to the United States government. In 1993, when a ravaged Russian industry began dumping cheap aluminum on world markets and prices plunged, Mr. O'Neill went to Washington.
His argument to the Clinton administration was that Alcoa could bring an antidumping suit against Russia and probably win. But, fearing protectionism, he suggested an alternative. Mr. O'Neill voluntarily cut Alcoa's annual aluminum production by 25 percent and urged the administration to press European countries to cut production voluntarily as well. He reasoned that if global output shrank, prices would rise.
In order not to violate international antitrust law, the effort had to be taken government by government. In the end, six nations, including Russia, signed a memorandum of understanding to cut aluminum output, and prices stabilized. The cutbacks had the added benefit of causing many inefficient European aluminum plants to close.
"Paul had to convince the government to do it, so he wouldn't go to jail for restraint of trade," Mr. Tumazos said. "What he proposed was not unlike the kind of agreements made during currency crises and monetary fund bailouts."
In 1994, Mr. O'Neill joined with four other industrial chief executives to meet with White House officials and argue that the economy could be allowed to grow at a faster pace through lower interest rates without triggering inflation. It is a position Mr. O'Neill repeated in his first news conference as treasury secretary-designate -- and one certain to please corporate America.
But on other questions he would face as treasury secretary, his corporate background offers few clues. While he sharply cut Alcoa's debt, he has made no statements on the debate over tax cuts versus deficit reduction. As an exporter he would be expected to favor a weaker dollar, but he has made no statements on this question either.

HEADLINE: Forstmann, Buyout Firm, Agrees to Buy Citadel Communications 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Forstmann Little & Company, the leveraged buyout firm, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire Citadel Communications, one of the nation's largest radio broadcasters in midsize markets, for about $1 billion in cash, executives close to the talks said.
 The board of Citadel, which owns 143 FM stations and 66 AM stations in 44 markets nationwide, approved the sale late last night. The transaction is still subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission and shareholders. 
 The deal, which includes the assumption of $1 billion in debt, should be a boon for Citadel, which has been on an acquisition spree. The injection of capital from Forstmann Little will help Citadel continue to gobble up stations and refinance the substantial debt it built during its buying binge. 
Still, Forstmann Little will face enormous challenges with its first investment in more than a year. It is buying into an industry that is dependent on a strong advertising market just as the economy is beginning to sour and companies begin to trim their advertising budgets.
For Theodore J. Forstmann, however, buying at the bottom is the only way to buy, and he is ready for a possible downturn in advertising.
"We're prepared for a not exactly exciting patch here," Mr. Forstmann said in an interview. "We've accommodated it. But we've got a lot to do and now we can do it in the peace and security of a private company. It couldn't get a lot bigger as a public company."
Indeed, Larry Wilson, Citadel's founder and chief executive, said he began considering a sale after he spoke with Mr. Forstmann in October about the company's future as a public company. "The choppy public market, the debt level and facing the possibility of a slowing economy made me consider selling out," Mr. Wilson said.
Under the deal, Forstmann Little will pay $26 a share in cash for each share of Citadel, a premium of 48.6 percent over the stock's price of $17.50 on Friday. The stock market was closed yesterday in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday.
Forstmann Little plans to finance the transaction with $1.5 billion from its equity and subordinated debt funds in addition to a $500 million loan from affiliates of J. P. Morgan Chase. Mr. Forstmann's capital structure allowed him to take on Citadel's debt at a time when most other leveraged buyout firms are struggling to finance deals with junk bonds.
For Mr. Wilson, who founded Citadel in 1984 with two radio stations in Tucson, the sale will allow him to "not worry" while he stays on to "build this thing." Indeed, Mr. Wilson, a former lawyer and accountant, may be more like a investment banker than a broadcaster, wheeling and dealing his way into control of 209 radio stations.
Mr. Forstmann has completed 27 major deals, including buying Gulfstream Aerospace, General Instrument, Topps baseball cards and Dr Pepper. He said he thought that more acquisitions through Citadel could be possible. "If a big opportunity comes along, it might be a whole different company in two years," he said.
But for now, at least, it may be tough going. In fact, the strains on the advertising climate may already be showing. Citadel missed its third-quarter earnings estimates as its loss widened to $11.2 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $2.8 million, or 9 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. However, sales rose 55 percent, to $78.2 million from $50.5 million.
But Mr. Forstmann insists he is a long-term player. When asked what his exit strategy might be, he said he had not thought of one yet.
Citadel was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston.

HEADLINE: Killing for the Glory of God, In a Land Far From Home 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER

DATELINE: PANJSHIR VALLEY, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Muhammad Khaled Mihraban, a polite, soft-spoken 26-year-old Pakistani, thinks he has already killed at least 100 people. Maybe more; he isn't really sure.
 "My goal was not to kill," he said. "But I had a line to follow, an Islamic ideal. I knew that Muslims needed their own country, a real Islamic country." 
 Mr. Mihraban found that country when he came to Afghanistan in 1992. Having decided "to consecrate my life to jihad" while studying Islamic law at Punjab University in Lahore, he said, he joined a Pakistani militant group that was fighting India in the disputed province of Kashmir. His training took place in Afghanistan. 
"We learned how to plant mines, how to make bombs using dynamite and how to kill someone quietly," he recalled.
A gifted student, he was soon asked to train others in group camps near Khost. "But I wanted to act, not teach," he explained. So after a stint waging war in Kashmir, he returned to Kabul to fight alongside the Taliban forces that control most of the country.
Mr. Mihraban, who was captured by the rebels fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan, said in an interview in a bleak prison that if he were released, he would "stay right here and fight again for Kabul." If he were asked to do so, he said, he would go to London, Paris or New York and blow up women and children for Islam. "Yes, I would do it," he said quietly, without hesitation.
If the international terrorism that has haunted Americans for the last decade has a home, it is Afghanistan, the place that comes closest to the extremists' ideal of a state ruled by the strict code of Islamic law.
Afghanistan is an inspiration, an essential base of operations, a reservoir of potential suicide bombers and a battle front where crucial ties are forged. It is also, American officials say, where Osama bin Laden is experimenting with chemical weapons.
Participants in nearly every plot against the United States and its allies during the last decade have learned the arts of war and explosives in Afghan camps, authorities say, including the defendants in the 1998 bombings of two American Embassies in East Africa.
The Central Intelligence Agency estimates that as many as 50,000 to 70,000 militants from 55 countries have trained here in recent years. The agency says the Taliban permit a wide range of groups to operate in Afghan territory, from the Pakistani militants who trained Mr. Mihraban to Mr. bin Laden's organization Al Qaeda (Arabic for The Base). Middle East officials said that as many as 5,000 recruits have passed through Mr. bin Laden's camps.
American and Middle Eastern intelligence officials believe that Mr. bin Laden maintains a network of a dozen camps in Afghanistan that offer training in small arms and in explosives and logistics for terrorist attacks. The officials said the embassy bombings, which killed more than 200 people, were rehearsed on a model built to scale at one of Mr. bin Laden's Afghan camps.
One camp, according to those officials, is educating a new generation of recruits in the uses of chemicals, poisons and toxins.
Within the last year, trainees at the camp, which is called Abu Khabab, have experimented on dogs, rabbits and other animals with nerve gases, the officials said. Recruits have also fashioned bombs made from commercially available chemicals and poisons, which have been tried out on animals tethered to outdoor posts on the camp test range, according to surveillance photographs and informers' reports. 
"The role of Afghanistan is now absolutely clear," said Michael A. Sheehan, the former coordinator of the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism, who in late December became assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations for the United Nations. "Every Islamic militant we've looked at goes scurrying back there for sanctuary. Afghanistan, and to a lesser extent Iran, are the only major sanctuaries left."

The Training
Where Recruits Study Tactics and Explosives
Middle Eastern officials estimate that in the last six months, more than 100 men recruited by Mr. bin Laden's and affiliated groups have been trained at the camp, which is named after the Egyptian militant who runs it, Midhat Mursi -- whose nom de guerre is Abu Khabab.
The camp is part of a large complex of such training sites known as Darunta, about eight miles from Jalalabad, an Afghan eastern provincial capital, down a dusty road that runs atop an old stone dam of the same name. According to Western and Middle Eastern officials, a cache of chemicals is stored in the reinforced caves of nearby mountains and naturally protected underground tunnels.
Abu Khabab's graduates in the last year include Raed Hijazi, the Jordanian-American whom Jordan has convicted in absentia as a ringleader of the failed plot to attack tourists in Amman during the millennium celebrations. 
Mr. Hijazi, whom the Syrians arrested in October and sent back to Jordan, has described his advanced training on explosives to Jordanian investigators, according to Western officials. He has told investigators that a key lieutenant of Mr. bin Laden helped arrange his trip to Afghanistan.
A rare reference to the explosives training at the Abu Khabab camp appears in the sealed indictment of Nabil abu Aukel, a Palestinian arrested last June by Israel.
Israel has accused Mr. Aukel of collaborating with Hamas, or the Party of God, the militant Palestinian organization, and several Arab-Israelis on plots aimed at military and civilian targets inside Israel. The indictment, a copy of which was provided by Steven Emerson, an American expert on Islamic terrorism, states that Mr. Aukel, a Palestinian, received advanced training in explosives using chemicals at the Abu Khabab camp in March 1998.
The camp leader warned Mr. Aukel "never to discuss the nature of the training," the indictment says. Israeli officials said Mr. Aukel's arrest marked first time Israel had uncovered an Al Qaeda cell inside its borders.
At the urging of the United States and Russia, which also sees a threat from Afghan training camps, the United Nations recently imposed the harshest economic sanctions on Afghanistan to press the Taliban not only to evict Mr. bin Laden and his senior entourage, but also to close down all the militant camps to foreigners.
The Taliban, or "students of Islam," who rule all but a sliver of Afghanistan, deny that they harbor terrorists or those who train them. Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, the Taliban foreign minister, said the pressure to expel Mr. bin Laden was both "insulting and useless." Mr. Mutawakil denied in an interview in November that Mr. bin Laden was financing the Taliban, saying he had become a "very poor man." Mr. bin Laden, the foreign minister said, could not possibly be planning terrorist operations since his activities were "closely supervised by Afghan guards."
Mr. Mutawakil recently invited a New York Times reporter to visit any location in Afghanistan identified by Western officials as part of Mr. bin Laden's network.
But Taliban officials in Afghanistan ultimately barred the reporter from visiting any of the locations. At Darunta, the reporter was stopped several miles from the gates of the complex. After five days in Kabul, Jalalabad and environs, the reporter and her Afghan-American interpreter were politely escorted to the border and told to leave Afghanistan.

The Inspiration
Afghanistan's Appeal As a War Zone
The Afghan cause has inspired several generations of young men determined to wage holy war. Thousands came here in the 1980's to fight the Soviet forces in response to a fatwa, or religious order, from leading Islamic scholars. Thousands more have come since then to help the Taliban expand their power, or to be trained for jihads elsewhere. 
Taliban officials boast that they have imposed true Islamic rule, cleansing Afghan society of Western influence. Since their capture of Kabul in 1996, they have among other things banned education for girls and most work for women, and instituted harsh punishments for blasphemy, playing cards, watching television, listening to music and trimming one's beard.
Mr. bin Laden arrived in Afghanistan in 1996 after he was expelled from Sudan. American officials and Afghan opponents of the Taliban say their loyalty to him has been well earned. The officials say Mr. bin Laden provided the Taliban with some of the cash they used to buy off local warlords in their march to power.
His financial support of the Taliban is said to continue. Several diplomats and aid workers in Afghanistan estimated that he had put up millions of dollars -- one diplomat's estimate was $40 million -- to rebuild roads destroyed in the war against the Soviets and the ensuing civil war. 
Mr. bin Laden is also said to be providing the Taliban with military help.
Ahmed Shah Massoud, commander of a group of rebels in northern Afghanistan, said in an interview at his headquarters that he was fighting a unit of soldiers specially trained by Mr. bin Laden, the 55th Brigade, which includes some 700 Arabs and other militant Muslims. Mr. Massoud said he had captured brigade members, whom he called the most seasoned fighters.
Despite financial aid and weapons from Iran and Russia, Mr. Massoud's alliance lost ground to the Taliban last year. His forces are now confined largely to the northern region's impregnable Panjshir Valley with its soaring, snow-tipped mountains and dazzling vistas.
Mr. Massoud said his soldiers were holding some 1,200 Taliban prisoners, 122 of them foreign Muslims. There are Pakistanis, an immigrant to Pakistan from the Burmese province of Arakan, Yemenis, Britons and Chinese Uigurs, among others. Interviews with several of them illustrate the attraction that Afghanistan still has for militants around the world.
Mr. Mihraban, the young Pakistani, comes from the town of Chaghi, in the province of Baluchistan. His gentle eyes and polite manner gave no hint of the fervor that had led him to this stark prison in the harsh, craggy mountains of the Hindu Kush. 
His trip to Afghanistan began when he joined Harakat ul Mujahedeen, a group whose dedication to unlocking India's grip on Kashmir has landed it on the State Department's list of terror groups. He trained first in 1992 at the Salman i Farsi camp in Baktiah, Afghanistan, which was run by Harakat. He said he also fought in Tajikistan.
Obeida Rahman, 21, a Yemeni from Sana from a poor family of 10 children, had his living and training expenses in Afghanistan paid for by the teachers at his madrassa, or religious academy. They had urged him to fight in Afghanistan against his family's wishes, he said. He had relished his training. "When you have a gun, you're free," he said. "You feel as if you can do anything."
Abdul Jalil, 21, from Kashgar in Xingiang Province, China, said that despite his capture, he was glad that he had come and fought in Afghanistan on the $1,000 his father, a farmer, gave him to study. "I still want to create an Islamic state all over the world, God willing," he said. When he is released, he said, "I will go fight a jihad in China."
The goal of returning home to continue the jihad is common among the prisoners. Julie Sirrs, a former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst who has interviewed many of the non-Afghan prisoners held by Mr. Massoud, said nearly half belonged to groups that the State Department has designated as terrorist. None had ever met Mr. bin Laden, they said, but he was their hero. Ms. Sirrs, now an independent consultant, financed her own studies of the prisoners. 
In an interview at one of his camps in the Panjshir Valley in late summer, Mr. Massoud said his prisoners had been deluded into believing that they were fighting a jihad in Afghanistan by helping the Taliban.
The prisoners, he said, are in fact "sinners" for conducting terrorism and violating Islam's injunction against fomenting division within Muslim ranks. "My message to those fighting in Afghanistan now is that they will never get God's blessing for what they are doing in my country," he declared.

The Enablers
How Islamic Schools Urge Students On
American officials acknowledge that they have limited influence over the Taliban, who they say have a powerful regional ally in Pakistan.
Relief officials and Afghans said they saw soldiers in Pakistan Army uniforms fighting for the Taliban last summer and fall. The witnesses reported that Pakistani Army buses with blackened windows and burlap-covered trucks filled with weapons and supplies routinely crossed into Afghanistan heading for the front near Taliqan, a northern town that the government captured last fall. 
Mr. Massoud and relief officials in Afghanistan said the Taliban were finding it ever harder to recruit fighters for the civil war and had even encountered armed resistance to their recruitment missions in different towns and villages. The Taliban forces, he asserted, are increasingly dependent on Pakistani soldiers and students sent to the front to fight for the Islamic cause. 
Pakistan denies that it has sent soldiers to fight alongside the Taliban. But diplomats, relief workers and Afghans interviewed in Kabul and Jalalabad insist that Pakistan has provided not only weapons, logistical and other assistance, but soldiers as well.
"Some soldiers apparently came to fight; others for just a look-see at real fighting," said a United Nations official who visited areas near the front during the offensive. "The Taliban were doing quite badly at first. But there is no doubt that Pakistani support gradually turned the tide."
There are also suggestions that Pakistani authorities have pressed students to fight for the Taliban. One relief worker who visited the Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul in late June said that all of its 400 beds were filled by Pakistanis wounded at the front, some as young as 15. Several patients said that they had been sent to fight by their religious academies, many of which closed for the summer battle season, leaving impoverished students with no place else to go. A doctor at the hospital said Chechens, Yemenis and Saudis were among the patients.
American officials say they have little leverage over Pakistan. The United States cut off military aid in 1990 after the Pakistanis detonated a nuclear bomb.
With no ally in the region to help, the Clinton administration has mounted a wide-ranging diplomatic campaign to isolate the Taliban militia from the world community. The effort bore fruit late last year when the United Nations, prodded by the United States and Russia, expanded economic sanctions on Afghanistan -- a change that will take effect on Jan. 19.
Senior American officials said that for all their concern about the threat of terrorism, the administration never explicitly offered the Taliban what they most want: formal diplomatic recognition. In its dealing with the Taliban, officials said, the administration promised only that relations would dramatically improve if they expelled Mr. bin Laden and Al Qaeda's leaders and barred foreigners from the camps. 
Officials said they decided against directly offering recognition, because, they said, the administration had profound reservations about the Taliban's abuses of human rights, particularly of women. 
Senior officials also felt that they could not trust the Taliban to deliver on their promises, citing what they called repeated "lies" from the Afghan leadership about Mr. bin Laden's status.
In late December, President Clinton's top national security advisers gathered in Washington to consider the next steps against the Taliban, including possible military action.
A senior C.I.A. official told the group that the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October 2000 appeared to have been organized by Muhammad Omar al-Harazi, a longtime member of Al Qaeda also involved in an earlier attempt to destroy an American warship, The Sullivans, as it passed through Aden in January 2000. Mr. Harazi founded the first Al Qaeda cell in Saudi Arabia and was arrested in 1997, accused oftrying to smuggle antitank missiles into the kingdom. Between the failed attack on The Sullivans and the bombing of the Cole, officials said, Mr. Harazi fled to an Al Qaeda guest house in Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold. The C.I.A. said this evidence did not conclusively establish that the group ordered the attack.
Several officials at the meeting opposed military action on the ground that it would achieve little and would make Americans targets of further terrorist attacks. And officials said a military strike could even be counterproductive, enhancing Mr. bin Laden's public standing among militants. "Making him a hero is the last thing we want to do," said one senior American official.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 21, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about Islamic militants who train in Afghanistan misstated the reason the United States cut off military aid in 1990 to Pakistan, which supports the government of Afghanistan. The United States suspected Pakistan of developing nuclear weapons; Pakistan's detonation of nuclear devices did not occur until 1998.
Because of an editing error, the article mistranslated Hamas, the name of the militant Palestinian organization linked by the Israelis to a man they arrested, who trained in Afghanistan. The name, an Arabic acronym, stands for Islamic Resistance Movement, not Party of God. Hamas is also an Arabic word for zeal or enthusiasm.
The article also misspelled the name of the region in China from which some members Uighur ethnic group have gone to fight in Afghanistan. It is Xinjiang, not Xingiang.

HEADLINE: Tears and a Confession From Another Rev. King 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The pressures of being the youngest daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were sometimes too intense for her to bear, the Rev. Bernice A. King told a reverent crowd at her father's old church today, in an unusually frank confession marking Dr. King's birthday.
 "It is difficult being the daughter of such an awesome man, to be his child and to live with the criticism and the ridicule, the persecution and the misunderstanding," said Ms. King, 37, speaking at her family's annual King Day service in the historic pulpit of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. "Sometimes I feel like backing off and honestly saying to hell with it all. But God has commissioned and commanded that I be true to what he has given me in this great legacy." 
 Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and four children have come under criticism in recent years for what is sometimes seen as a stingy guardianship of his legacy, in particular for suing news organizations and scholars who use excerpts from his speeches without paying the family. Members rarely discuss the issue, but today, in a passionate and apparently impromptu address in the old church that set other family members weeping, Ms. King forcefully defended the family's actions.
"It's difficult and it's challenging when people desire in their own way to exploit the message and the mission of Dr. King for their own personal gain," she said. "Yet when we seek to perpetuate the legacy in the way the Holy Ghost has told us to perpetuate it, and we just so happened to be blessed financially by it, it saddens me that people are confused. If it were your daddy, what would you do?"
The family's only desire is to ensure that Dr. King's legacy is presented properly, Ms. King said -- not to gain financially from its merchandising.
"It ain't about the money," she said. "If it were about the money, I would be wealthy today. If it were about the money, we wouldn't be here today. It's really about a heart to serve."
Ms. King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated in Memphis, is the only one of the four children to have followed her father into the ministry, and is often said to have inherited his oratorical gifts. She is assistant pastor at the Greater Rising Star Baptist Church in Atlanta, and travels widely delivering speeches and sermons on issues relating to Dr. King's message of justice and nonviolence.
Other family members who spoke at the service, along with prominent elected officials, stuck to more traditional themes of political action and economic justice. Coretta Scott King called for an end to mandatory minimum sentences, the elimination of the death penalty and the cancellation of Africa's debt to the West.
Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia said that Maynard Jackson, the former mayor of Atlanta, should be chairman of the Democratic National Committee, a post Mr. Jackson is seeking. Senator Max Cleland of Georgia said a flawed voting system was undermining Dr. King's goal of universal enfranchisement, and said he would introduce a bill providing grants to states to eliminate punchcard voting machines.
The keynote speaker, Andrew Young, the former Atlanta mayor and United Nations representative, said it was time that supporters of Vice President Al Gore recognized that George W. Bush was about to become the country's legitimate president, even as they continued to criticize a flawed balloting system that might have produced that result. That does not mean, Mr. Young said, that blacks should support Mr. Bush's ideas or nominees.
"I know John Ashcroft," he said, speaking of Mr. Bush's choice for attorney general. "He really is a nice guy. We've worked together on some things pertaining to Africa. But he just isn't supposed to be attorney general at a time like this."
Mr. Young called on the Bush administration to work harder to bring the country together, and by the same token he called on black leaders to pay more attention to the problems and concerns of white people living in poverty.
None of the Kings at the service spoke about the current effort to change the Georgia flag, which is dominated by the Confederate battle symbol, although Jack F. Kemp, the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, said it was time to end such symbols of disunity. Dr. King's oldest son, Martin Luther King III, was at a ceremony in Philadelphia today, and told reporters that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, his father's civil rights organization that he now leads, would call for economic sanctions against Georgia if the flag was not changed in the current legislative session.
But it was Bernice King who had the most emotional effect on the crowd. While others may miss the teachings of a great civil rights leader, she said, she had to struggle with simply wanting her father back.
"Daddy, I'm going to try my best to let you go and allow God to have his way in my life," she said, as many on the pulpit wiped away tears. "Even though from time to time I have a little anger and bitterness and a little disappointment, and feel a little bit abandoned, I'm going to press on to the mark of a higher calling in Christ Jesus, and I'll see you soon on the other side. And we will have a great and true celebration."

HEADLINE: Clinton's One Big Idea 

BYLINE:  By Robert Wright; Robert Wright, a columnist for Slate, is author of "The Moral Animal" and, most recently, "Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
According to one standard view, President Bill Clinton began his presidency with big ideas and ended it with little ones. After health care reform collapsed and welfare reform began working its way through Congress, he had run out of ambitious proposals and so confined himself to crowd-pleasing, small-bore policy initiatives: school uniforms, cell phones for neighborhood watch groups, a zillion targeted tax cuts.
 As the season for appraising Mr. Clinton's legacy reaches its climax, this stereotype shows signs of sticking. Some pundits explicitly complain about the lack of a grand unifying theme in his presidency, while others just fail to find one. 
 But I think that future historians will have no trouble finding a unifying theme in the Clinton years, and that its importance will become only clearer as the decades pass. At a pivotal moment in history, Mr. Clinton steered the Democratic Party through a dangerous crossroads, shaping its identity as momentously as Franklin Roosevelt did. 
I'm not talking about Mr. Clinton's much-discussed pulling of the party toward the center of the ideological spectrum. Welfare reform was important, and so was the administration's overall fiscal discipline, but these things are reversible. 
I'm talking about the party's choice between economic nationalism and global economic engagement. Here Mr. Clinton has put Democrats on a course that will be hard to abandon and that could ultimately serve their constituents in ways many prominent Democrats still don't appreciate.
It is easy to forget how deeply the Democratic Party was divided over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the subsequent creation of the World Trade Organization. Today, seven years after Nafta was supposed to have begun ruining the American job market, the unemployment rate is so low that only the stiffest of recessions could boost it to pre-Clinton levels. And the low inflation rate -- which leaves Alan Greenspan free to fight any recession -- is due largely to imports from low-wage countries. So, naturally, Democratic protectionists in Congress -- or "fair traders," as they call themselves -- have quieted down.
But even as old-style Democrats admit that Mr. Clinton's free-trade agenda proved sub-apocalyptic, they still don't acknowledge his larger accomplishment. By ushering in the W.T.O., he has laid the rudiments of a system of global governance that, if wisely nurtured, will decades from now protect America's low-wage workers and its natural environment.
Before the World Trade Organization, the regime that "governed" global trade -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- had no teeth. Today the W.T.O., by adjudicating trade disputes and authorizing sanctions against violators, arguably constitutes the most effective body of world governance in the history of the planet.
Of course, this is exactly what some on the left have faulted Mr. Clinton for. The W.T.O., in addressing subtle, non-tariff barriers to trade, can trample on cherished liberal policies: export subsidies designed to help American workers, laws aimed at saving sea turtles from the nets of foreign fishermen.
Yet in the long run, this very intrusiveness is the best hope for preserving the values of liberal Democrats. Free trade, left ungoverned, can yield the infamous "race to the bottom," dragging down environmental standards and wages in affluent nations. The way to blunt this effect is to append labor and environmental standards to trade agreements. But unless those agreements have teeth in the first place -- as in the judicial machinery of the W.T.O. -- there is no point in appending anything to them.
It will be years before meaningful labor and environmental accords are part of the world trade system. But they are being talked about much more seriously now than eight years ago, and powerful political actors, ranging from labor unions to international environmental groups, are mobilizing behind them. 
This is the big difference between now and 1993. Back then, liberal demands that Nafta include tough labor and environmental accords were largely disingenuous -- a way of torpedoing the whole accord. Today, people on the left increasingly accept that America is embedded in an international trade regime and realize that steering the regime itself leftward is the object of the game.
Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, symbolizes the transformation. When he ran for president in 1988, I couldn't have supported him, for fear that he would be a captive of his protectionist constituency. But I could see voting for him in 2004, because a Gephardt presidency would now be locked into global economic engagement. Not joining the W.T.O. was a realistic political option, but leaving it isn't. 
By thus shrinking the policy menu, Mr. Clinton has saved the Democratic Party from an increasingly marginal existence as the anti-globalization party, a party that denies the world's destiny rather than shape it, a party faithful to its ideals but unable to realize them.
It's paradoxical that the wing of the Democratic Party Mr. Clinton confronted and subdued calls itself "progressive." The progressives of a century ago, like Teddy Roosevelt, recognized that technology was inexorably expanding economic activity from the regional to the national level, and they responded by carrying economic regulation to the national level. They passed national antitrust laws and food-and-drug laws and gave new forms of government support to national labor unions.
The analogous insight today is that with technology driving economic organization well beyond national scope, progressive governance has to catch up. Many on the left still haven't seen this, but Mr. Clinton has.
To be sure, he may not have seen it right off the bat. Even as late as 1998, he supported legislation that would have prevented the administration from including broad environmental and labor standards in "fast track" trade agreements. But he has since spoken approvingly of equipping the W.T.O. with such standards. And, in an important, if largely symbolic, precedent, the free trade agreement with Jordan, signed last year, is the first American trade agreement to include labor and environmental protections in the main text. (Such provisions are also part of an inchoate trade deal with Chile that the new administration will inherit.) 
If Mr. Clinton's progressive internationalism took a while to crystallize fully, it was nonetheless a natural expression of his identity. From the beginning, his embrace of technological change and of economic engagement with the world reflected his longstanding credentials as a New Democrat and, in a vaguer sense, his instinctive optimism and inclusiveness. 
And, anyway, presidents who do great things rarely have them clearly in mind on Inauguration Day. F.D.R. threw a bunch of policies against the wall, and the ones that stuck became the New Deal. Lincoln didn't enter office bent on freeing the slaves, and his early performance as commander in chief of the union forces was hardly auspicious. In the presidency, as in most jobs, being smart and persistent will go a long way.

HEADLINE: Bush Plans to Stress Effects Of Economics on Security 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush plans a major change in his National Security Council, adding economics experts to involve it far more in the economic changes that have caused upheaval around the world.
 Mr. Bush, who described his plans on a hike on his 1,600-acre ranch on Friday in Texas, said he had asked his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and his chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, to "share a desk" that would work to coordinate America's foreign policy objectives with its economics strategy. 
 "It's a way to make sure the economic people don't run off with foreign policy and vice versa," Mr. Bush said, apparently referring to the major role the Treasury Department has had over the last eight years in setting policy toward China, Japan and, to a lesser degree, Russia. 
"Globalization has altered the dynamics in the White House, as well as between the White House and the Treasury," he said. "We have to respond to that." 
In a telephone interview today from her home in California, Ms. Rice said that she and Mr. Lindsey would jointly run a staff that would deal with two sorts of issues, international economic policy and coordinated responses to the types of crises that have erupted in Mexico, Asia and Russia, crises that have frequently brought down governments. 
The staff would be "physically located within the N.S.C. offices," she said, but would report both to her and to Mr. Lindsey.
Mr. Bush's plan appears to be an effort to build upon, but also substantially alter, President Clinton's crack at the same problem.
In 1993, Mr. Clinton created the National Economic Council, a White House unit that he initially described as an equivalent, and a counterweight, to the long-established National Security Council. The N.E.C., as it was called, became a strong force in developing domestic economic policy, and was particularly powerful under its first chairman, Robert E. Rubin.
But when Mr. Rubin became Treasury Secretary in 1995, some of that agency's influence moved with him. In size, budget and influence, it never grew to rival the security council, and often both agencies engaged in classic Washington turf battles.
A version of the economics council will still exist, and Mr. Lindsey will run it. But international economic issues will belong to a separate staff, run by a deputy assistant to the president, reporting to the heads of both councils. 
"International economic issues are still not as integrated as they should be in the national security process," Ms. Rice said today. "So we are going to try to do this in as seamless a way as possible." 
But she added, "we are still thinking through the details."
Before Mr. Clinton took office, other administrations talked about making the national security directorates more savvy about economic forces. But that effort was often halfhearted, and forgotten as soon as a military crisis arose that focused attention elsewhere.
The pressure has grown, however, as it has become obvious that the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department have been slow to reorient themselves toward the challenges of economic interdependence -- and slow to hire or promote staff members with economics skills. 
The C.I.A. was widely criticized for having failed to identify the internal economic rot that contributed to the breakup of the Soviet Union in the administration of Mr. Bush's father. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, senior officials of the agency talked a great deal about reorienting their mission to protecting America's economic lead, and they devoted considerable resources to studies of how foreign governments use under-the-table payments to steal business from American companies. 
The intelligence officials also provided more resources to American trade negotiators, at one point going as far as listening in on the telephone conversations of Japan's minister of international trade and industry during tense negotiations in 1995 over American access to the Japanese automobile market.
But the United States has repeatedly been taken by surprise by economic crises that created political risks. 
The Mexican peso crisis crept up unnoticed here, and in 1997 and 1998, the C.I.A. and the State Department's economics officers also failed to detect early signs of the currency crisis in Asia that ultimately spread to Indonesia and brought down President Suharto, the country's leader for more than three decades.
But investors with billions of dollars at stake in Mexico and Asia missed the same signals.
"Mexico and Indonesia are very good examples of areas where we needed more overlap with the National Security Council," said Mr. Lindsey, who opposed the Mexican bailout -- though Mr. Bush supported that move -- and the American efforts to contribute to the Asian bailouts. 
"Indonesia was complex economically," he said. "But clearly the results have not worked out very well for security and stability in Southeast Asia. That's a case where we needed more security policy views from the start."
Ms. Rice said the Treasury Department would continue to play a major foreign policy role and noted that Paul O'Neill, the treasury secretary designate, has extensive business experience in international markets. 
Republican officials said the leading candidate to be Mr. O'Neill's deputy was Kenneth W. Dam, a law professor at the University of Chicago. Mr. Dam was a top economics official in the Nixon White House and, at one point, executive director of a group intended to coordinate domestic and international economic policy. He was also a deputy secretary of state in the Reagan years and a senior executive at I.B.M.

 BODY:
Different Bush, Same Bible
Like father, like son; and like Jimmy Carter, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Warren G. Harding and George Washington.
 A Masonic lodge in New York expects the Bible that will be used when president-elect GEORGE W. BUSH takes the oath of office on Saturday to be one used at five previous inaugurations, including his father's in 1989. That Bible, a 234-year-old King James version published in London, is owned by St. John's Lodge No. 1 of the Ancient York Masons. JULES GARFUNKEL, a past master of the lodge and one of three members of its Bible Committee, will carry it to Washington for the inauguration. 
 Mr. Garfunkel said that the lodge offered to let Mr. Bush use its Bible as soon as it became clear that he would be the 43rd president. "We had some inkling that he would say yes because his father had used it," he said. "Barbara Bush held both Bibles, their family Bible atop ours. The historical context is that it's the very Bible that was used by our first president at his inauguration in Federal Hall in Manhattan in 1789. We're just carrying on that tradition."
The Bible's velvet-lined carrying case got a new handle at the White House 12 years ago. The old handle broke apart on the way to the inauguration of Mr. Bush's father, Mr. Garfunkel said. "They sent it down to their workshop and replaced it," he said. "Try to get that kind of service anywhere else."
Mr. Garfunkel said he would leave for Washington on Friday and return late Saturday. No parties?
"No, we haven't been invited," he said. "Our function is to transport the Bible. We'd like to view the parade, but that's about it."

Alone in a Booth
Some portrait photographers have their subjects sit in a cavernous studio while they aim their spotlights and focus their lenses.
Not Andy Warhol, it turns out. HOLLY SOLOMON, the subject of a huge Warhol that went on display at the International Center of Photography at 1133 Avenue of the Americas at 43rd Street last week, said Mr. Warhol worked from images taken in a coin-operated photo booth.
"I met him at 47th and Broadway," she said. "He picked the machine in the photo booth. He wanted the one with the highest contrast. Then he left me there, with about $60 in quarters. I brought those photo-booth pictures to him at the Factory. And let me tell you, it's pretty boring to do that many photo-booth photos."

Designs on Space
ARIE L. KOPELMAN, the president of Chanel. and the chairman of the Winter Antiques Show, laughed off the notion that dot-com jitters and Wall Street turbulence might hurt sales at this year's show, which opens Thursday.
"The dealers are up for it," he said at a warm-up party for the show's Young Collectors Committee the other night, "and despite some glitches, the economy is in good enough shape that it will not impact the dealers." 
So people can still afford to shop at the show?
"It is important that the price range isn't limited to $300,000 tables," he said. "One of the things that distinguishes this show is that many, many people come to this show thinking, 'This may be the year I'll go home with a little goody tucked under my arm.' "
What little goody might he be looking for?
"Something I can't live without," he said. But he added, "We really don't have room for anything else. I see something I like and my wife asks, 'Where are you going to put it?' If I can't answer that question to our mutual satisfaction, then it's a pass."
Across the room, COCO was asked about what her husband had just said. "We do have veto power over each other's choices," she said. "And we really don't have room for anything else."

HEADLINE: Chrysler Said To Map Plan For Recovery 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler's strategy for reviving its troubled Chrysler unit will involve eliminating thousands of white-collar jobs, canceling the development of marginally profitable vehicles and sharing auto parts between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, people involved in the automaker's planning said.
 But the strategy, scheduled for presentation to DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board in Germany on Feb. 23, is likely to call for the closing of few if any factories, nor will it rely on blue-collar layoffs, company executives said in interviews today and over the last week. 
 Chrysler could announce some cost-cutting steps before Feb. 23, as the automaker seeks to improve its financial performance, said Dieter Zetsche, Chrysler's new chief executive. "We will need the impact for this year as soon as possible." 
DaimlerChrysler is under acute pressure to shore up Chrysler's results quickly. The division lost $512 million in the third quarter and is estimated to have lost as much as $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter.
As reported two months ago, a few of the company's top executives would like to sell part or all of Chrysler, essentially undoing the merger two years ago of Daimler and Chrysler. But Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, ruled that out againtonight at the Automotive News World Congress, a trade conference.
The net cash reserves of DaimlerChrysler's auto production units dropped to zero at the end of the year from 6 billion euros, or $5.71 billion, at the end of September. The company attributed the drop to one-time expenses, including acquisitions.
Mr. Zetsche, a former Mercedes executive sent to Chrysler two months ago from Germany, declined to discuss any details of the plan he would present to the supervisory board next month. But other executives involved in Chrysler's planning said that deep job cuts were certain, particularly after the decision by General Motors last month to eliminate 10 percent of its white-collar jobs. What is not clear yet, the Chrysler executives said, was the precise number of jobs to be eliminated and whether actual layoffs would be involved, as opposed to relying on buyouts and attrition.
DaimlerChrysler executives who insisted on anonymity said that the company's leaders were also leaning toward the adoption of a new vehicle design and engineering strategy that would make greater use of Mitsubishi, in which DaimlerChrysler took a one-third stake in October.
Under the new strategy, which has been rumored for several weeks, vehicle development staffs would probably be divided into four teams: a luxury- and large-car team dominated by Mercedes, a midsize and small-car team shared by Chrysler and Mitsubishi, a sport utility vehicle and minivan team mainly run by Chrysler and a commercial vehicle team overseen by Freightliner, a DaimlerChrysler subsidiary based in Portland, Ore. But in an interview tonight, Mr. Zetsche said any overhaul of corporate structure would not be allowed to dilute the distinctiveness of each company's brands and designs.
Mr. Schrempp said tonight that Chrysler and Mitsubishi might share some car underbodies. Pierre Gagnon, the chief operating officer and executive vice president of Mitsubishi's North American sales division, said that discussions on cooperation were under way in Tokyo between Mitsubishi and Chrysler but had not yet produced specific changes in the United States.
A big problem ever since Daimler and Chrysler merged in November 1998 has been the refusal of Mercedes executives to share vehicle underbodies and other parts with Chrysler so as to achieve greater economies of scale. The assignment to Chrysler of two longtime Mercedes executives, Mr. Zetsche and Wolfgang Bernhard, the latter as Chrysler's chief operating officer, has prompted a renewed effort to find synergies that will not dilute the Mercedes brand.
For instance, Mr. Bernhard said, Mercedes produces seat subframes in a more efficient, less costly way than Chrysler, so Chrysler will adopt the Mercedes approach. The savings could reach $46 a seat, he said.
In early December, Chrysler asked its auto parts suppliers to reduce by 5 percent the prices they charge on all shipments, starting at the beginning of this year. The demand has provoked resistance from some suppliers -- and even threats to stop shipments as soon as the end of this month, which could cause assembly lines to shut down. Mr. Zetsche said tonight that this would not happen.
Mr. Zetsche said that Chrysler would not take any hasty steps to close factories permanently, because it is very hard to switch the production of a vehicle from one factory to another. "Potential changes in the structure of our plants are not for next month," he said, but will depend on long-term changes in Chrysler's product lineup to make it easier to produce any vehicle at more factories than is now possible.
Chrysler faces this problem most acutely in the production of the PT Cruiser. The gangster-styled vehicle is assembled only at one plant in North America, in Mexico, that can meet just a small fraction of demand. Yet the Chrysler factory in Belvidere, Ill., that assembles the Dodge Neon, on which the Cruiser is based, has been idled repeatedly this winter because of slow demand.
The problem is that the Cruiser is seven inches taller than the Neon, making it two inches too tall for the Belvidere assembly line.
The strongest candidate for closing over the next several years remains the nearly century-old Chrysler factory in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler. Chrysler has built a new factory nearby to assemble the Jeep Liberty, which will replace the Cherokee this summer. The new factory is close to the old one, partly to allow workers to transfer easily. 
Another candidate for closing is a light truck assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, where Chrysler used to build large Ram wagons. Until recently, it planned to build a large Dodge sport utility vehicle at the plant that would compete with the Chevrolet Suburban. Under a 1999 labor agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers union, Chrysler committed itself to spending several hundred million dollars to construct a large building for the high-speed automatic painting of big vehicles.
The building was almost finished, and most of the money spent, when Chrysler abruptly stopped most construction on it recently, said a DaimlerChrysler executive who insisted on anonymity. Chrysler has not decided what to do with the factory, the executive said. The labor agreement required that the paint shop be erected, he joked -- but the automaker was not required to use it.

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 John Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, defends the administration's record on global warming (letter, Jan. 10). But it is true that economic globalization, and the resulting shift of manufacturing to less regulated regions beyond our borders, has increased the total generation of greenhouse gases on our planet.
