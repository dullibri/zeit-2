HEADLINE: Comptroller's Report Reveals Drop in State Revenues

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Revenues for April through June fell nearly $4.1 billion, or 25 percent, compared with the same period last year, according to a report issued Monday by the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. 
 Mr. DiNapoli said the revenues for that quarter were $305 million below what state budget officials had projected.
 The comptroller's report is significant because it includes the first round of estimated income tax payments for the year, giving officials their first glimpse of how much revenue they can expect over the coming months. 
 Mr. DiNapoli's report suggests that without a significant turnaround in the economy this year, Gov. David A. Paterson and the Legislature will probably be forced to embark on midyear budget cuts this fall.
 ''Obviously, the state needs to watch spending closely because the state's economic picture remains uncertain,'' Mr. DiNapoli said in a statement.
 That task could be complicated by the fragile truce recently established in the State Senate, where Democrats and Republicans spent most of July disputing control of the chamber after the defection of a Democratic senator, Pedro Espada Jr. Even after that crisis was resolved by Mr. Espada's return to the Democratic fold, major issues, such as legislation to legalize same-sex marriage and to extend mayoral control of the New York City schools, remain unresolved, and the Senate has adjourned for the summer.
 The Paterson administration spent $1.2 billion less over the first three months of the fiscal year than it originally projected, according to Mr. DiNapoli. But much of that money will probably have to be spent over the rest of the year, as pending claims from local governments and other entities are paid off.
 Moreover, the budget passed by lawmakers in April, amidst the throes of a major economic crisis, rested on revenue projections that were already fairly conservative. And although Wall Street has shown some signs of resurgence in recent weeks, few expect a return to the days when profits and bonuses in the financial sector provided Albany with a steady gusher of tax revenue. 
 The administration is scheduled to release an updated financial plan -- essentially a month-by-month detail of how the state expects to spend money -- by the end of the month.
 In a statement, Matt Anderson, a spokesman for the state budget office, said:
 ''While careful fiscal management has helped New York meet its payment obligations and maintain a secure cash position through the first quarter, we have continued to see substantial declines across many of our revenue sources. As he demonstrated last year, Governor Paterson will take whatever steps are necessary to responsibly manage the state's finances during these difficult times.''
 The state's fiscal picture would be far worse, Mr. DiNapoli's report revealed, were it not for a technical error discovered by budget officials this spring. The officials found that the state had been improperly crediting New York City for some tax revenues, and subsequently required the city to reimburse the state $387 million. 
 That money represents a one-time infusion that was not counted in the state's financial plan for the year.

HEADLINE: Selling Cruises to Couch Potatoes in Real Time

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
WITH apologies to Andy Samberg of ''Saturday Night Live,'' JWT never thought it would be on a boat. 
 But a client, Royal Caribbean, looking to add a sense of urgency to its advertising, decided to take a team of six JWT employees on three weeklong cruises this summer. The employees, who call themselves JWT@Sea, are creating a series of quick-turnaround TV commercials that show couch potatoes the fun they are missing as it happens. ''Our challenge is to make people feel and understand that it is O.K. to take that weekend vacation,'' said Michael Stoopak, business director of JWT N.Y. (or, as he prefers, president of JWT@Sea). 
 Seeing film of a cruise in progress ''makes it feel more than O.K. It makes it feel immediate and urgent and, most importantly, attainable,'' he added. 
 For the ads that began showing last week, a camera crew roamed the ship by day shooting candid film of actual Royal Caribbean guests and bits of scripted material, then edited the film after dark in a makeshift studio on board. They then e-mailed the files to JWT's New York office after midnight, where another team worked through the night to complete the spots, which were delivered to the TV networks at 4 a.m. to appear that day on ''Good Morning America'' and ''Today,'' among other shows. 
 The real-time approach to advertising, which required doubling the bandwidth of the ship's Internet connection, is a response to changes in consumer behavior in a time of financial uncertainty. People now are less likely to plan a two-week vacation several months in advance, and are instead waiting until the last minute to take shorter trips, Betsy O'Rourke, senior vice president of marketing for Royal Caribbean, said.
 ''Booking windows are getting shorter and shorter in this economy,'' she said. ''What we have found is that people are nervous to make the commitment.''
 The first batch of ads, which Royal Caribbean refers to as ''postcards,'' were shown last week and can be viewed on the company's Web site. They were shot in the format of a newsreel, with an actual Royal Caribbean guest acting as news anchor, narrating film of other guests boxing, singing karaoke and floating down a river in an inner tube. 
 ''Debbie from Rhode Island laced up the gloves in the fitness center, and late-night explorers climbed mountains under the stars,'' said Erica in the ad shot on July 15 that was shown on the 16th. ''That's the news, and I'm Erica cruising with Royal Caribbean. Why aren't you?'' 
 JWT, which is part of the WPP Group of companies, is planning to repeat the process on at least two more cruises in the next few months. But because the postcard ads have a shelf life of only 24 hours, the agency is also using the cruise film to produce longer, story-driven commercials that will be shown regularly. One such commercial features an 80-year-old woman who rode a zip line, at one of the ship's private destinations. ''This was something on her bucket list,'' Ms. O'Rourke said. 
 The postcard ads are running on national network television -- with a heavy concentration in New York and Miami, where much of the cruise industry's business originates, and on travel-oriented cable networks like the Discovery Channel, the Travel Channel and TLC, the Learning Channel. For an industry with high fixed costs, companies like Royal Caribbean have ''done a good job of filling their ships'' since the economic downturn began, but need to maintain a sense of urgency if they want to keep them full, said Robin Diedrich, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones.
 ''Pricing has been the big lever that these companies have been pulling,'' she said. But ''companies have to be more dynamic with all their offerings, including advertising'' to ''persuade people to spend money on something they don't really need.'' 
 (Not surprisingly, the industry has seen no lift from the viral popularity of Mr. Samberg's ''I'm on a Boat'' video, which satirizes the cliched use of yachts in hip-hop culture. The video, which was first broadcast as an ''SNL Digital Short'' on ''Saturday Night Live'' in May, has 30 million views and counting on YouTube.) 
 Ms. O'Rourke said that Royal Caribbean had slashed prices by as much as 50 percent and had even begun offering deals on transportation to and from ports of departure. ''As I like to say, it's now cheaper to go on a cruise than it is to stay home,'' she said.
 The postcard ads are intended to be about more than good timing. The hope is that by showing guests partaking in more modern, youthful activities -- strumming guitars on deck, for example, or working out in a state-of-the-art gym -- Royal Caribbean can update the public's image of what it means to go on a cruise.
 ''People's perception of cruising had been a bit sleepy,'' Mr. Stoopak said. ''But when you go on vacation with Royal Caribbean, you encounter things like the rock wall, or the Flowrider, which is a surf-simulating machine, or ice skating.''
 Not that everything about the cruise industry has changed. Shuffleboard is still available on Royal Caribbean cruises, Mr. Stoopak said, though it is not likely to appear in the current crop of commercials.

 Ads in the series resemble newsreels, with cruise guests as anchors, narrating film of other guests enjoying cruise activities.

HEADLINE: Georgia: Plan To Pay For King Papers Is Approved

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Atlanta City Council has cleared the way for a civil and human rights museum to pay off $11.5 million on a loan so it can acquire display rights to thousands of documents of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Private fund-raising had slowed efforts in a bad economy to pay off the original $32 million loan. The council voted 12 to 0 to approve a plan to pay off the loan with the help of millions of dollars in bonds.

HEADLINE: Washington Publishers Set To Merge, but Stay Separate

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Two of the leaders in blow-by-blow Washington news will join forces, with the Roll Call Group buying Congressional Quarterly for an undisclosed price, the companies announced on Tuesday. 
 The companies have been competitors, with considerable overlap in what they cover, but their various print and online publications will be preserved, said Laurie Battaglia, who will retain the title of managing director and executive vice president of the Roll Call Group when it becomes the CQ-Roll Call Group. 
 ''Those are all products that have very separate and distinct voices and they need to maintain separate and distinct voices,'' she said. Some duplicative jobs could be eliminated, she said.
 Coverage of official Washington is an increasingly competitive field, with operations like National Journal, The Hill and Politico, as well as newspapers and other mass media.
 CQ was owned by The Times Publishing Company, owner of the St. Petersburg Times; Times Publishing is itself owned by the nonprofit Poynter Institute. CQ publishes CQ Weekly, the daily CQ Today when Congress is in session and electronic newsletters like CQ Budget Tracker. It also produces a monthly magazine, Governing, about state and local governments, which Times Publishing will keep.
 While the flagship newspaper has been struggling, Times Publishing executives have said that Congressional Quarterly is consistently profitable. 
 The Roll Call Group, owned by the Economist Group, publishes Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, and has bought Capitol Advantage as well as GalleryWatch.

HEADLINE: N.C.A.A. Sued Over Licensing Practices

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Lawyers for the former U.C.L.A. basketball star Ed O'Bannon filed a class-action lawsuit against the N.C.A.A. on Tuesday, claiming former athletes should be compensated for the use of their images and likenesses in television advertisements, video games and apparel. 
 The lawsuit, which did not include a dollar amount sought, will bring into focus how the N.C.A.A. handles player images, especially after players leave college and are no longer bound by N.C.A.A. rules, and its vast licensing deals, which are estimated at about $4 billion. None of that money goes to the former players whose images, jersey numbers and likenesses are used. 
 ''We really couldn't believe that these compensation practices still existed in any kind of industry,'' said Jon T. King, a partner at Hausfeld, a Washington-based law firm that is representing O'Bannon. ''We do antitrust cases in all sorts of industries, and when we learned about this disparity, it was literally shocking to us.''
 The N.C.A.A. declined comment, saying it needed time to review the lawsuit. But the N.C.A.A. spokesman Erik Christianson said, ''The N.C.A.A. categorically denies any infringement on former or current student-athlete likeness rights.''
 O'Bannon said he was approached about becoming the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit about a month ago by Sonny Vaccaro and his wife and business partner, Pam. Vaccaro is a longtime sneaker executive who has thrived on tormenting the N.C.A.A. and fighting for the interests of young athletes.
 Vaccaro said that Tuesday was ''one of the happiest days of his life'' and that he expected numerous former college football and basketball players to join the suit. 
 ''I'm not looking to overthrow the government or the N.C.A.A.,'' Vaccaro said. ''I'm looking to do the right thing. They don't own them and they're going to have to explain it.''
 O'Bannon played parts of four seasons in the N.B.A. and now works in marketing and sales for a Las Vegas-area car dealership. O'Bannon said he was financially secure but did not earn enough money during his basketball career to retire. 
 He said that he agreed to become the face of the lawsuit more for issues of fairness than for money. The lawsuit said that the N.C.A.A. was using images of O'Bannon on ''numerous DVDs and photographs offered for sale by the N.C.A.A. and its business partners.'' 
 O'Bannon said: ''My biggest thing really and truthfully is making sure that every student-athlete gets compensated for what they've done. If your likeness is being sold, you should be compensated.'' 
 The N.C.A.A. will be going against a team of lawyers that includes Michael Hausfeld of Hausfeld and William A. Issacson of Boies, Schiller & Flexner. Hausfeld has recovered billions of dollars for clients worldwide on cases ranging from slave labor during World War II to price fixing. Boise, Schiller and Flexner has been involved in cases like United States v. Microsoft and Bush v. Gore. 
 Hausfeld said that the lawsuit would end up seeking a ''huge sum of money'' because the N.C.A.A. and its licensing partners are booming businesses that are only getting bigger. For the N.C.A.A., the crux of the issue will be the ''08-3a form'' that student-athletes sign, giving up their names, likenesses and rights to receive compensation from the N.C.A.A. and its third-party partners. 
 ''It's a one-year contract that ends when the student is no longer a student-athlete,'' Hausfeld said. Two former college football players have previously filed suits over the use of athletes' images in video games.
 Andrew Zimbalist, an economist specializing in sports at Smith College, predicted that the case would give the N.C.A.A. an opportunity to re-evaluate its views on amateurism. 
 ''I think this is a fairly clear-cut ethical issue here that the N.C.A.A. is asking for trouble on,'' Zimbalist said. ''They need to retreat and reassess what they're doing. As they do that, they have to look at the phony and false way they try to delineate what amateurism is.''
 He added: ''This is a wedge issue here. It's a foot in the door to open all sort of question about the hybrid model of the N.C.A.A.''

HEADLINE: Who Rules the Mobile Bands?

 BODY:
It is gratifying to see that the leviathans of mobile telecommunications in the United States are finally drawing the attention of regulators and Congress. 
 Exclusivity contracts, with which the Big Four cellphone companies lock in the hottest new phones, are a good place to start looking. But the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice also should look broadly at whether competition is being stifled among mobile providers. 
 Because of exclusivity, unless you are willing to be a hacker, you can use the iPhone only on AT&T's network, the BlackBerry Storm on Verizon's and the Palm Pre on Sprint's. Cellphones from Samsung and LG are also tied up. If you live in a rural community that the large companies aren't interested in serving, exclusivity generally means you get an outdated handset.
 With the pattern of exclusive deals extending to new netbooks, smaller companies warn that mobile Web access could be tied up entirely. In the past 10 years, the big cellphone companies have gobbled up smaller ones while regulators looked on. The Big Four -- Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile -- account for 90 percent of cellphone subscribers. Verizon and AT&T alone have 60 percent. Dozens of areas have but one wireless provider. 
 And they haven't been shy about using that power. The F.C.C. mandates carriers, for example, to sign roaming contracts for voice services. But data, the fastest-growing and most innovative segment of telecommunications, isn't covered. Small carriers complain that the big ones won't enter into data roaming contracts.
 Verizon and AT&T also control so much of the country's land-line market that it could hamper the development of new services like mobile Web access, which requires use of wire-line networks. Consumer advocates and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, have warned about scant competition, high prices and onerous contracts in this area.
 Phone companies point out that exclusivity agreements are commonplace in other industries. For example, they say, it is not often that one finds a restaurant serving Coke and Pepsi. They argue that the iPhone and its imitators are testament to a competitive and innovative market.
 But many of their practices hinder consumer choice. Consider the decision to block the Skype application on the iPhone from working on AT&T's 3G network or cellphone contracts that get extended every time you buy a new phone or change your plan. 
 In 2007, the average American cellphone subscriber paid $506 for the year, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. This compares with $374 in Britain and $293 in Spain. The average of all countries in the O.E.C.D. was $439. 
 Regulators' attention may already be prompting some changes in behavior. Verizon announced it would shorten the exclusivity contracts for some handsets to six months so that rural providers can have them. More is needed, however. The F.C.C. is directed to foster a competitive wireless marketplace, which is an important gateway to the Internet. It warrants close examination.

HEADLINE: A Meaningful Contribution Toward Health Reform

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Not So Generous'' (editorial, July 12) denigrates the significance of the $155 billion that hospitals agreed to contribute toward meaningful health reform. 
 Our contribution is the largest good-faith effort to date for advancing health reform and comes at a time when hospitals are struggling with chronic Medicare and Medicaid underpayments and the ever-increasing costs of labor and supplies.
 Agreeing to these payment reductions, particularly during an economic downturn, is a substantial commitment by hospitals, and we hope that all stakeholders will demonstrate similar leadership and commitment to reform. 
 Through this agreement, the Obama administration and the Senate Finance Committee have pledged to work toward expanding health coverage to nearly 95 percent of people while keeping America's hospitals strong enough to provide high-quality care to patients and communities.

HEADLINE: Whirling Dervish Drivers

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 One night several years ago, my mom slipped and broke a bone in her neck. I stayed late at the hospital with her. Driving home on a mostly deserted road, I checked my cellphone messages.
 I didn't notice either the red light coming up or the car stopped at the light. I banged into the back of it, and even though the damage was minor, it was a scary moment.
 I admitted that I was upset and distracted, took the blame and swore to myself I'd never use a cellphone in a car again. But, of course, I did. D.C. police will pull you over if they see you using a cellphone that you're holding up to your ear, but not if you're hands-free. 
 Ominously, research by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration -- suppressed for years and released on Tuesday after petitions were filed by advocacy groups -- shows that there are ''negligible differences'' in accident risk whether you're holding the phone or not. Hands-free devices may even enhance the danger by lulling you into complacency.
 It is the conversation that pulls focus. My greatest fear is that I'm going to be in a taxi when the driver gets a call from his wife to tell him that she's run off with his sexy cousin.
 In a March New Yorker profile, Tony Gilroy, the screenwriter of ''Michael Clayton'' and ''Duplicity,'' told the nightmare tale of being in a New York taxi when the cell-chatting driver ran a red light and hit another car. 
 ''So they're lifting the other guy out of the car, and I'm thinking, I'm lucky,'' he said, adding: ''Then I see them come at my cab with those things, the Jaws of Life.'' He'd fractured his rib and hip.
 Studies show that drivers who talk on cellphones are four times more likely to be in a crash and drive just as erratically as people with an 0.08 percent blood-alcohol level.
 In one study cited by the highway safety agency, ''drivers found it easier to drive drunk than to drive while using a phone, even when it was hands-free.''
 The agency buried its head in the sand, keeping the research to itself for years and ignoring the fact that soon nearly all Americans would own cellphones and that the phones are always getting smarter and more demanding, putting a multimedia empire at your fingertips while you're piloting a potentially lethal piece of artillery.
 Americans are so addicted to techno-surfing that they've gotten hubristic about how many machines they can juggle simultaneously. One reporter I know recently filed a story from his laptop while driving on the Pacific Coast Highway. 
 As John Ratey, the Harvard professor of psychiatry who specializes in the science of attention, told The Times's Matt Richtel for his chilling series, ''Driven to Distraction,'' using digital devices gives you ''a dopamine squirt.'' 
 That explains the Pavlovian impulse of people who are out with friends or dates to ignore them and check their BlackBerrys and cellphones, even if 99 out of 100 messages are uninteresting. They're truffle-hunting for that scintillating one.
 Americans woke up one day to find that they were don't-miss-a-moment addicts who feel compelled to respond to all messages immediately.
 The tech industry is our drug dealer, feeding the intense social and economic pressure to stay constantly in touch with employers, colleagues, friends and family.
 It also explains why Christopher Hill, a 21-year-old from Oklahoma who killed a woman last September when he ran a red light while on his cellphone and rammed into her S.U.V., tried to keep dialing and driving with a headset his mother gave him two months after the accident. 
 He ''found his mind wandering into his phone call so much that 'I nearly missed a light,' '' he told Richtel. Now he says he rarely uses the phone.
 Hollywood offered a cautionary story with the depressing ''Seven Pounds,'' which begins with Will Smith spoiling his perfect life when he BlackBerrys while driving in his fancy car with his gorgeous new fiancee. He crashes into another car, killing six strangers and his girlfriend. The movie ends with a poisonous jellyfish in an icy bathtub. Don't ask. 
 Left, literally, to our own devices, we spiral out of control. States should outlaw drivers from talking on phones -- except in an emergency -- and using digital devices that cause you to drift and swerve; or at least mandate a $10,000 fine for getting in an accident while phoning or Twittering.
 Auto companies are busy creating new crack hits for our self-destructive cravings. Ford is developing a system that would let drivers use phones and music players and surf the Internet with voice commands and audible responses.
 Sounds like a computerized death machine. But, as our dealers know, we'll never disconnect.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Call for Tighter Reins on Bailout Program

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two senior Democratic lawmakers called on the administration Tuesday to make the $700 billion bailout program more visible and accountable to taxpayers.
 Representative Edolphus Towns of New York, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, called on the Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner to adopt recommendations from a government watchdog that the department has resisted. 
 The criticism came as the oversight committee heard testimony from special inspector general Neil Barofsky, who oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Mr. Barofsky delivered a quarterly report to Congress that was sharply critical of Treasury's reluctance to better track how the bailout money is being spent.
 In his report, Mr. Barofsky said Treasury had accepted some of his recommendations for greater accountability, but that the department had not taken steps to require all TARP recipients to report on their actual use of funds. He said Treasury should report the values of its investments in banks and other financial institutions, disclose the identity of borrowers under a nonrecourse loan program and disclose trading activity under a public-private investment fund.
 Mr. Barofsky also cited accountability weaknesses in a new public private investment fund initiated by Treasury that is intended to purchase mortgage-backed assets that have clogged bank balance sheets. The federal share of the program is $30 billion. Under the program, Treasury selected nine financial firms as partners in the securities purchase plan.
 Summing up the effectiveness of the $700 billion TARP, he said: ''If the goal was to remove $700 billion of toxic assets off the books of financial institutions, that clearly has not happened. If the goal was to increase lending, I think that, too, unfortunately has not happened. If the goal was to avoid a complete systemic collapse of the financial industry, that may very well have happened.''
 But he defended his conclusion that the government's total potential exposure to assist the financial sector could total $23.7 trillion -- about $10 trillion more than the size of the entire United States economy.
 Mr. Barofsky acknowledged that actual spending on the financial sector peaked at $4.7 trillion and now stands closer to $3 trillion.
 Still, a Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams called the figure ''inflated'' and said the estimate ''does not provide a useful framework for evaluating the potential cost of these programs. ''

HEADLINE: A Colorado Town Thrives as It Places Its Bets on Gambling

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: BLACK HAWK, Colo. 

 BODY:
A 33-story hotel tower is rising here, in a little mountain town where anything taller than three or four stories in any direction for probably 30 miles would be safely in the skyscraper category. Call that what you will -- audacious, ambitious, perhaps even a bit Freudian -- the tower represents Black Hawk at its clattering, capitalistic, casino-driven heart. 
 The town, bolstered by a huge expansion of legal gambling that was approved by Colorado voters last fall as a constitutional amendment, and recently put into effect, is alive and pushing the frontier. 
 Some local politicians and residents say they think Black Hawk, with its big corporate casinos built beginning in the early 1990s, is poised to capitalize from the new gambling expansion, more than the two other towns that allow gambling -- Central City, just down the road from here, and Cripple Creek in the southeast part of the state near Colorado Springs. Both of those towns are dominated by smaller casinos. 
 Already, the volume of bets and state taxes paid in Black Hawk is more than twice that of the other two towns combined. Around-the-clock wagering, and hundreds of new hotel rooms for sleepy gamblers, many people say, will only further that trend.
 ''It was put on the ballot by the big guys, and it's going to work great for them,'' said Ann Dodson, the general manager of the Famous Bonanza, a family-owned casino in Central City, housed in a 133-year-old former dry-goods building (and brothel in one past incarnation).
 Ms. Dodson said she supported the gambling expansion, even though her business could not fully benefit from it. Her casino lacks the space or the staff to open any tables for craps, as the new law allows, she said, and without a hotel for guests to retire to, staying open past 2 a.m., or 3 a.m. would probably not pay.
 ''We're evaluating,'' Ms. Dodson said of the new rules, ''and hoping to make it work.''
 Historic preservation rules are also helping Black Hawk, which had 118 residents in the 2000 census, take advantage of the new law. Central City, for example, has a historic district that has kept its mining-town feel intact -- with narrow, winding streets, Victorian-era buildings, and perhaps in consequence, a sometimes-tough search for parking. A 33-story, $235 million hotel tower, like the one being built in Black Hawk by Ameristar Casino, would be laughed out of the room by planning officials. 
 Black Hawk, by contrast, where fussy history rules were never applied, has huge parking garages and industrial-strength casinos that look like factories for the processing of bets. 
 And the efforts toward charm in Black Hawk are directed entirely inward, for the benefit of the gamblers. The giant tropical banyan tree at the Isle Casino, for example -- an extreme incongruity at 8,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains -- cannot be seen from the street, only on the casino floor. 
 The gambling expansion provides that state tax revenue -- from new table games, a 20-fold increase in betting limits, to $100 from $5, and around-the-clock wagering -- will flow to Colorado's 13 community colleges, which ring the state like a necklace. And so the colleges have been important supporters of the law. 
 They need the money, college officials say. As in many other states, the recession focused the minds of students and their parents on more affordable choices, and community college enrollment has surged, up 32 percent for the incoming class this fall, compared with last year, even as Colorado's budget has been battered by deficits.
 ''We were gratified that voters saw us as important, and that they felt this was an appropriate source of funding,'' said Dr. Nancy McCallin, president of the Colorado Community College System. A tax increase this year to support the schools, she added, even with the surge in enrollment, ''would not have passed.''
 It is a bargain being struck, or negotiated, in many parts of the country as states face huge budget deficits. From Delaware, which legalized sports betting and table games at casinos, to Ohio, which recently agreed to let slot machines expand at racetracks to help fill a $3.2 billion budget gap, gambling has offered a bear hug, and many states are walking into the embrace. Critics of gambling say people will live to regret that.
 ''It's not only individuals addicted to gambling, we now have state governments addicted,'' said Tom Grey, field director for Stop Predatory Gambling, a nonprofit group based in Washington that opposes the spread of casinos.
 Here to gamble in Black Hawk on a recent morning, Alex Marin, a lawyer from Denver, said he thought that the town would remake itself completely in the coming years, riding on the new revenue stream, and that towers like Ameristar's are just the beginning of the creative destruction.
 ''They've gotten the 24 hours and the raised limits, now they'll start after the Western flavor -- it will lose that after a while, too,'' said Mr. Marin, visiting with his wife, Annie. But that is what gambling towns do, he added. They reinvent. ''It will all be more like this,'' he said, glancing up at the Ameristar.
 Some gamblers said that they were aware of the new link to the colleges, and that the knowledge might make the pain easier when the tumblers or the cards fall the wrong way.
 ''With everything being cut and shortfalls and the whole bit, if I lose a hundred bucks here, maybe I'll help somebody buy a book,'' said Pat McCarthy, a retired engineer from Longmont, north of Denver.
 One executive at Ameristar who worked on the expansion effort, Troy A. Stremming, said the gambling industry had done polling in Colorado and found that education would be popular with voters as a recipient of new tax revenues. Colorado ranks 49th in the nation in support for higher education, per thousand dollars of personal income. Getting the colleges on board as active campaigners for Amendment 50, as it was called, was the next step, said Mr. Stremming, a senior vice president for government affairs.
 ''The Colorado Community College System was a great partner,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Their outreach into the many communities where the colleges are located was critically important in passing the amendment.''

HEADLINE: The Makings For Authentic Tortillas

BYLINE: By DAN SALTZSTEIN

 BODY:
IN Mexico, cooks have always believed that the best tortillas and tamales were made with masa -- a dough made only of soaked and ground corn. There's been no place to buy masa in New York, so even the best Mexican chefs use the dried and powdered version -- called harina. 
 ''There's no comparison,'' said Zarela Martinez, owner of the restaurant Zarela in Midtown Manhattan. 
 Sue Torres, the chef and owner at Suenos in Chelsea, makes fresh masa for her special dishes. ''It has an earthier, more intense corn flavor than the corn flour,'' Ms. Torres said. ''It smells doughy and vibrant and brilliant.'' It would be too much work, though, to make it for all the tortillas she prepares. 
 Shauna Page and Fernando Ruiz searched over a decade for fresh masa in New York. In December the couple took matters into their own hands. On a side street in Corona, Queens, they opened Tortilleria Nixtamal, apparently the only place in the city that makes and sells masa; it also sells fresh tortillas, tacos, tamales and other dishes.
 Irma Morales stops by every morning for tortillas, and occasionally masa for tamales and gorditas. She and her husband, Ricardo, originally from Mexico, have lived in Corona for 17 years. 
 ''After all these years,'' Mr. Morales said, ''this is the first time we've tasted the real stuff in New York.'' 
 Ms. Page and Mr. Ruiz admit that they are unlikely saviors for the masa-deprived. Neither is a cook by training (Mr. Ruiz is a New York City firefighter). Both were born in the United States, though Mr. Ruiz spent much of his childhood in Veracruz, Mexico. 
 ''We didn't know what we were doing, to be quite honest with you,'' said Mr. Ruiz, 37. Ms. Page, 35, agreed. ''We've had several learning curves,'' she said.
 The two have gotten help from Mr. Ruiz's uncle, Pancho Manitas, who grew up in Veracruz, and Cecilia BolDovinos, a Mexican-born New Yorker who worked in a tortilleria in Michoacan. 
 Using machinery from Mexico, Mr. Ruiz and Ms. Page produce about a ton of masa every three weeks, using kernels of a natural corn hybrid bred specifically for tortillas, grown in Illinois.
 In a big tub in the shop's basement they boil the corn for about an hour in a solution of calcium hydroxide -- or slaked lime -- that breaks down and loosens the hull, softening the corn and making it easier to digest. (The Aztecs used limestone-rich lake-bed sediment.) The corn is soaked in the liquid overnight, rinsed, then lifted up a corkscrew conveyor into a grinder. The process is called nixtamalization. A fine grind becomes tortilla dough; mixed with stock and lard, a coarser grind is used for tamales.
 Though they have had a steady demand for their masa and tortillas, without the economies of scale, their products are relatively expensive -- $1.25 a pound for the masa, which yields about a dozen tortillas, and $2.25 a pound for the tortillas made from the masa (a pound is about 16). As of now, they use no preservatives, so the masa lasts for only about two days. 
 The number of customers from the neighborhood has been growing, but the products remain too expensive for area restaurants. ''We're doing something for the locals,'' Mr. Ruiz said of his Mexican-American neighbors, and he added that he's struck by how many non-Mexicans show up on weekends.
 It's not unusual, he said, for their narrow street to be lined with Zipcars, whose drivers have heard about the shop on various food-related Web sites. 
 During a recent visit to Nixtamal, Ms. Martinez said she was impressed with the operation, but added that the couple didn't quite have it figured out. 
 ''Their main problem is uniformity,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''They haven't gotten the form exactly down.'' She said the lime mixture didn't seem quite right, but she liked the masa's texture. She said she would like to buy from them regularly but goes through too many tortillas for it to make economic sense. 
 Ignacio Carballido, an owner of Casa Mezcal, a Mexican restaurant and cultural center that is set to open soon on the Lower East Side, said he hopes to buy Nixtamal masa for tortillas. 
 Mr. Ruiz acknowledged that they are still fiddling with the production process, and with their business plan -- do they focus on the fresh masa and tortillas or the house-made food?
 Since they opened, at 104-05 47th Avenue, they've made tortillas using a machine on display behind their windows. By March they had tamales and tacos, using pork from a local Italian butcher. (While Corona has become a predominantly Mexican area, many Italians remain.) They even offered a sausage-and-pepper tamale to draw in Italian-American locals. It hasn't worked. 
 Despite all these challenges, the couple have supporters. As she was leaving, Ms. Martinez expressed her thanks. (Ms. Martinez estimates that 70 percent of the queries on her Web site are about where to get masa or how to make it.)
 ''I've been waiting for this,'' she said. 
 Ms. Page smiled and said, ''Well, we've arrived.''

HEADLINE: Getting A Boost, Just in Time

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Six months ago, Mike Fisher was in the same position a lot of small-business owners are in these days: all but done for. A few years earlier, Mr. Fisher had sold his home on Long Island to take over an auto repair shop and start a towing business in East Harlem, but neither venture was thriving. Come the economy's meltdown, he and his wife were raising their two children in a small apartment they considered a depressing step down and contending with back rent he owed on his business lease and a mountain of debt that seemed insurmountable.
 This is the point at which many a business owner might try to sell, to maybe pick up and start over somewhere cheaper -- in Mr. Fisher's case, that would have been Florida, where he has a lot of family. Instead, Mr. Fisher, at 43 a strong, physical presence with a shaved head, decided to bring froufrou to East Harlem. 
 Were someone to write a guide to the loveliest automotive repair shops in New York, it is safe to say that Mr. Fisher's, Precision Auto and Fish-Bones Towing, would rate several stars. The location, on 106th Street between First and Second Avenues, is not the most glamorous: the shop is flanked by boarded-up storefronts, which, in turn, are bordered by a botanica (closed at 11:30 on a recent morning) and a pharmacy (also closed all morning).
 But Mr. Fisher's shop more than makes up for the surroundings with its obvious energy: a waving blue flag on its roof, a bright L.E.D. screen with images of red bouncing cars, and, on the sidewalk, Mr. Fisher himself, a waving, chatting, gesticulating greeter of customers, passers-by and neighbors.
 Inside, the walls are hung with Andy Warhol posters (of cars, of course). Black faux-leather stools and tables -- ''pub tables,'' Mr. Fisher said -- dot the waiting area, offering an easy view of the plasma television with surround sound. Near the desk is a pile of fresh muffins and doughnuts, wrapped lovingly every morning and sealed with a sticker that says, ''Thanks, please come again.'' On a magazine rack are copies of Architectural Digest and Wine Spectator. ''Those are from my in-laws,'' said Mr. Fisher, who prefers Tow Times.
 AUTOMOTIVE repair is not a foot-traffic business. Mr. Fisher took no half-measures, in design terms, to impress someone else: AAA, for whom he was hoping to become an affiliate, which would give his towing business the boost it desperately needed (not to mention the auto repair). Every time he bought a new truck, Mr. Fisher would send a photo to his AAA liaison. When the agency called to request help as a backup service, he never said no, even if it meant driving to Brooklyn or Queens late at night. And when he saw his AAA contact's face fall upon viewing his original waiting room -- a cramped, grim cave right off a driveway -- he did not just renovate, he went all the way. 
 ''He keeps inviting members from headquarters to come down for one of his fresh-baked David's cookies,'' said James Lewis, who was Mr. Fisher's point man at AAA. 
 This is what panic can do: inspire near-manic bouts of excellence. 
 Mr. Fisher has a history of this. As a Long Island teenager, he fell asleep at the wrong party and woke up with his right leg on fire. He did not walk for six or seven months, then went on, later in high school, to become a nationally ranked pole-vaulter. After high school, he started showing up at the wrong parties again, and ended up addicted to crack cocaine for seven long, tortured months. After rehab, he started fiddling with transmissions and fixed his own life by fixing other people's cars.
 ''If everyone curled up into a little ball, this country would just tank,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''You got to stand up and do what you can do.''
 By late May, Mr. Fisher and his wife had resolved that they had no choice but to pack up -- give up -- and move. Someone in lumber was going to buy him out, and the family would have just enough money to buy a place in Florida; Mr. Fisher would find work in someone else's shop.
 Then, in early June, a few days before sealing the deal with the lumber business, he got the call from AAA. An opening became available, and he landed a contract for a big chunk of Upper Manhattan, guaranteeing him more than enough towing business to stay in New York. Mr. Lewis said Mr. Fisher's future ''looks very good.'' A few months back, a man in serious distress, Mr. Fisher may make his fortune rescuing others who have temporarily stalled. Once a pole-vaulter, always a pole-vaulter: He clears high bars in a single bound, takes a fall, then gets up and does it again.

HEADLINE: A Hotel's Past vs. a City's Future

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
When Century City was built in the 1960s, it was a stab at urbanism amid Southern California's sprawl. A 176-acre enclave in West Los Angeles, the development resembled the New York World's Fair of 1964-65, with its futuristic buildings and its parklike setting.
 At its heart was the Century Plaza Hotel, a 19-story building designed by Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the World Trade Center towers in New York. The hotel had a distinctive curved facade that appeared to unfurl across the landscape.
 But these days, the structure -- now known as the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza -- feels hemmed in, with much taller buildings surrounding it. ''The entire context has changed,'' said Michael Rosenfeld, a local real estate investor. 
 Last year, Mr. Rosenfeld bought the hotel for about $366 million, or around $500,000 a room. Six months later, he announced that he planned to tear it down and replace it with two 50-story towers designed by Henry N. Cobb, a principal of the New York architecture firm of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. One of the buildings would contain a 240-room hotel; the rest of the space would be offices and residential condominiums.
 The plan alarmed preservationist groups. The National Trust for Historic Preservation added the hotel to its list of the ''most endangered'' sites in the country. The actress Diane Keaton, a board member of the National Trust, made the announcement in late April at a news conference in Century City.
 In a later telephone interview, Ms. Keaton said she was determined to save the hotel, in part because of its distinctive shape, which she compared to a ''sexy woman surrounded by ogling men -- Sophia Loren in the 1960s.''
 The effort also has to do with her love for hotels, which she described as places where history and social connections were made. In 1980, Ms. Keaton published ''Reservations,'' a book of photographs of hotel lobbies.
 The Century Plaza served as a home away from home for President Ronald Reagan and has been the scene of many important entertainment industry events. ''We need to honor our city's history more than we need two new towers,'' Ms. Keaton said.
 When he bought the hotel last year, Mr. Rosenfeld seemed to agree that the Century Plaza was special. ''This is a rare opportunity to buy a jewel in my hometown,'' he said. ''The Century Plaza has been an L.A. icon since it opened in 1966.''
 But in the wake of Ms. Keaton's news conference, his company issued a terse statement, saying it was ''disappointed to see the Century Plaza Hotel politicized in this way, particularly at a time when the city of Los Angeles is suffering from extreme economic hardship and is in dire need of new jobs.'' It added, ''This is not considered one of the more significant Minoru Yamasaki buildings and is not characteristic of his style.''
 A spokeswoman for Yamasaki Associates, the Troy, Mich., firm founded by the late architect, declined to take a stand. Kim Anderson, who handles marketing for the firm, wrote in an e-mail message, ''As much as we are saddened by the news of our project's loss, we must respect the rights of the new owner.''
 In an interview, Mr. Rosenfeld, who can see the hotel from his office in Century City, said that when he bought the building (with backing from the D. E. Shaw Group, a hedge fund), he had no plans to demolish it. The idea, he said, came from the Los Angeles City Planning Department, which is working to make Century City more pedestrian-friendly.
 Right now, getting from one part of Century City to another can require ''going down an alley, through a loading dock and across a parking deck,'' he said.
 The hotel, which has a huge semicircular driveway, ''actually serves as a physical impediment'' to people trying to walk through Century City, Mr. Rosenfeld said.
 Replacing it with a pair of thin towers would free more than two acres for gardens. Reached by telephone in London, Mr. Cobb, who designed the proposed towers, said his goal was to ''improve public space and public life'' by ''giving Century City a heart.''
 Mr. Rosenfeld said the buildings would be built to high standards of energy efficiency. ''We've covered green from every angle,'' he said.
 But Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said that the teardown would be anything but green. Demolishing ''a perfectly good building,'' Mr. Moe said, is ''antithetical to the idea of sustainability.''
 Mr. Moe said it could take 50 years or more for even a highly efficient building to save as much energy as is expended in the demolition and construction processes. Calling the developer's plan green, he said, ''boggles the imagination.'' 
 Mr. Rosenfeld said that the difficulty of filling a 726-room hotel, especially during a downturn in the economy, was a factor in his decision.
 At noon on a recent Sunday, the lobby of the Century Plaza was quiet. ''Times are tough now,'' conceded the hotel's general manager, David Horowitz. ''We're fighting hard to get every piece of business we can get.'' He added that the teardown, if it happened, was years away. ''We're focused on the immediate future,'' he said.
 Mr. Horowitz said the hotel was in good physical shape, thanks to a $30 million renovation that was begun when Hyatt took over the management of the hotel in 2006. 
 Mr. Rosenfeld said that while it might be difficult to obtain financing for the redevelopment at present, the downturn was a perfect time to begin obtaining the approvals needed to begin construction. That process, he said, could take up to three years.
 The hotel, with 100,000 square feet of meeting space, remains a popular setting for banquets. On May 28, the Los Angeles Architectural Awards luncheon, a program of the Los Angeles Business Council, was held there. Eric Owen Moss, a Southern California architect, was the keynote speaker.
 Mr. Moss didn't mention the Century Plaza in his remarks. But, in a later interview, he disputed the contention that the building was a key part of the city's architectural history. ''I think it's a hotel you could ship to Sao Paulo or Singapore or Dubai,'' he said, ''and nobody would know the difference.''
 His bottom line? ''I wouldn't fight for the preservation of that particular building,'' he said.
 But Ms. Keaton plans to battle on. Linda Dishman, executive director of the Los Angeles Conservancy, a local preservation group, said that she and Ms. Keaton were monitoring the project's environmental review process while continuing to call attention to the building's historical and architectural significance.
 Several years ago, Ms. Keaton was part of a campaign to save another Los Angeles hotel, the Ambassador, which has been torn down. 
 ''We really can't afford to lose these,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Banks Stumble, but Markets End Higher Another Day

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market extended its weeklong rally even as it struggled with more worries about the banking industry.
 Major market indexes seesawed through much of Tuesday's trading and ended with gains of less than 1 percent. Better-than-expected results from companies including Caterpillar spurred shares generally higher, although financial stocks slid on reports of losses at several regional banks. 
 Investors also digested a mixed report from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who restated the Fed's view that the economy was still on track to recover this year, but slowly. He also predicted rising unemployment.
 Analysts said the market's more subdued tone was natural after stocks surged more than 8 percent since the start of last week.
 Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, joined other major companies in issuing an improved 2009 profit forecast. Second-quarter profit fell 66 percent but was still ahead of expectations. Shares in the company, considered a bellwether of the global economy, rose 7.7 percent.
 Banks stumbled after the Regions Financial Corporation, Comerica and Zions Bancorp posted second-quarter losses that stirred worries about rising loan defaults, a persistent concern for banks as unemployment approached 10 percent.
 Technology shares could drive trading on Wednesday. The chip maker Advanced Micro Devices slid in after-hours trading after posting a wider-than-expected loss after the bell, while Apple rose after reporting a 15 percent increase in profits.
 Tech stocks have led the market's rally from 12-year lows in early March. The Nasdaq composite index is up 21.5 percent for the year, compared with 5.7 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and 1.6 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average.
 David Chalupnik, head of equities at First American Funds, said it could be harder for stocks to push higher because investors were becoming harder to impress. ''Expectations are being ramped up,'' he said. ''As earnings continue to come out better than expected you may not get that lift anymore.''
 The Dow rose 67.79 points, or 0.77 percent, to 8,915.94, its highest level since January. Seven consecutive advances have pushed the blue chips up 9.4 percent. 
 The S.& P. 500 rose 3.45 points, or 0.36 percent, to 954.58, its highest close since November.
 The Nasdaq rose 6.91 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,916.20, its 10th gain in a row. The last time the index rose 10 consecutive days was in July 1997.
 Michael Binger, portfolio manager at Thrivent Investment Management, said stocks had been rising because company forecasts signaled that the worst for the economy could be over.
 ''The sequential declines in revenue have stopped, which a lot of the companies are calling stabilization,'' he said.
 Treasury investors said Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed would keep interest rates low for the time being, a policy that supports the value of bonds already in circulation. His assurance that inflation would remain at bay also helped lift the bond market.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 percentage point, to 97 1/32, and the yield fell to 3.48 percent, from 3.61 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Apple Reports Robust Profit As Macs Shine

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
While earnings have faltered at other electronics companies, unexpectedly strong sales of Macintosh computers and a surge in iPhone purchases pushed Apple's profit up 15 percent in the third quarter, the company said Tuesday. 
 ''We're making our most innovative products ever and our customers are responding,'' Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive, said in a statement. 
 Apple recorded its best nonholiday quarter ever when other electronics makers were hurting because of a downturn in consumer spending. According to various estimates, PC shipments for the industry fell 3 to 5 percent over the last three months. But Apple said it sold 2.6 million Macs in the quarter, up about 18 percent from the 2.2 million it sold in the previous quarter, which ended March 28. 
 Apple said Mac sales were helped in June by updates to its line of MacBook Pro laptops, which got new features like longer battery life and a price reduction of $300, or 25 percent, from the previously least expensive Pro model. Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief operating officer, said the company saw an ''acceleration of sales'' after the introduction, which he said had led to some inventory shortages.
 About half of Mac buyers in Apple's own retail stores had never owned a Mac before, said Mr. Cook. 
 Shaw Wu, an analyst at Kaufman Brothers, said that Macintosh computers were ''resonating with increasing number of customers, as it is arguably the best platform for what people do today, which includes Web surfing and creating and managing content.''
 Apple also benefited from the June introduction of a new smartphone, the iPhone 3GS. Apple sold 5.2 million phones in the quarter, up from 3.79 million in the April quarter. The 3GS includes new features like the ability to record video, send picture messages and dial with voice commands. Apple previously said it sold more than one million 3GS handsets in the first three days of the product's availability.
 Apple also lowered the price of the old iPhone 3G to $99 in an effort to increase its market share in the expanding market for smartphones, although the company would not say how well it was selling.
 The company's overall gross profit margin grew to 36.3 percent, from 34.8 percent in the year-ago quarter.
 In the only dark spot for the company, sales of the iPod dropped to 10.2 million, from 11 million a year ago, a decline of 7 percent. Analysts said the slump reflected a saturation of the market for MP3 music players as well as the migration of people to phones that play music.
 Mr. Cook noted that the company had predicted and planned for the decline, and that sales of the iPod Touch -- which looks similar to the iPhone and can also access applications from the company's online iTunes store -- had jumped 130 percent over the last year.
 Mr. Cook took the opportunity of a conference call with media and Wall Street analysts to again criticize the low-cost, pared-down computers known as netbooks, which had provided one of the few bright spots in the computer industry. He said that many netbook buyers became disappointed and that the devices were ''very slow, they have software technology that is old, they don't have a robust computing experience, they lack horsepower, they have small displays and cramped keyboards.'' 
 Though analysts wonder whether Apple could introduce its own low-cost computer -- or at least some kind of economical tablet reading device -- Mr. Cook said Apple would only deliver a product ''that is very innovative and that is something we are very proud of.''
 Apple reported that its net income grew to $1.23 billion, or $1.35 a share, up from $1.07 billion, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter a year ago.
 Revenue rose to $8.34 billion, from $7.46 billion last year. That exceeded even some of the optimistic expectations of analysts, who projected Apple to announce revenue of $8.16 billion and a profit of $1.16 a share, according to a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters.
 Apple shares were up almost $7 in after-hours trading, after closing at $151.51 in the regular session Tuesday. Wall Street is impressed with Apple's growing traction with affluent urban and suburban consumers unaffected by the recession. Analysts are also increasingly confident in how the company will fare without Mr. Jobs, who had a liver transplant in the spring but has recently returned to work.
 Mr. Jobs was not present on the earnings call with analysts, as some had hoped.
 The last six months ''have been a resounding endorsement'' of Apple's management team, led by Mr. Cook, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. ''This basically shows that in six months of running the company, Tim Cook has basically pulled it off in a terrible economy.''

HEADLINE: Pinch of Reality Threatens the California Dream

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Even in the 1930s, Woody Guthrie warned America in a Dust Bowl song that the California dream could not be had on the cheap. Yet relative to other places, the state has historically been a pretty good bargain, with a low-cost, enviable higher education system, subsidized energy and an abundance of services for those down on their luck. 
 But three decades of staggering population growth combined with three high-impact recessions, budgeting by ballot box, federal mandates, an unusual tax structure and the rising cost of social services have finally produced disastrous results, and the ramifications are reaching across every aspect of life in this state. 
 The California dream is, for now, delayed, as demonstrated by the budget state lawmakers and the governor agreed upon late Monday. At no point in modern history has the state dealt with its fiscal issues by retreating so deeply in its services, beginning this spring with a round of multibillion-dollar budget cuts and continuing with, in total, some $30 billion in cuts over two fiscal years to schools, colleges, health care, welfare, corrections, recreation and more. 
 The rest of the nation, which has historically looked to California as a model for fierce economic independence and freewheeling innovation, may now see that the state looks like every place else -- just with better beaches. 
 ''We are now the state that can't,'' said Stephen Levy, the director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a private research organization in Palo Alto. ''It can't agree on its water problem. It can't balance its budget, it can't decide what to do with prisoners, and it's still fussing about its immigrants. And this is not the end of our economic problems. This is the beginning.''
 California, of course, has weathered economic ups and downs for decades and rebounded in ways that left the rest of the nation eating its dust. The downturn in the defense industry in the 1990s, followed by plummeting housing prices, was met with a huge technology boom. When that fell apart, the state roared back with a real estate boom.
 But in the past, the state contended with its problems through a mix of taxes and cuts. Earlier this year, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his fellow Republicans agreed to increases in sales and vehicle-licensing taxes, but this time, they refused to approve any tax increase, and the Democrats had too few votes to force one. 
 And the protracted national recession has delivered a big hit on the state's greatest source of revenue, income taxes on rich people. Further, the state's structural deficit has become exceedingly pronounced after years of accounting tricks and borrowing.
 The result is that Californians will find state offices closed three days a month. The poor will go without health care in a state that practically invented the health care safety net and as some financially embattled states seek to expand coverage for children.
 Classroom sizes are about to explode, and state universities are furloughing professors, cutting class offerings and reassessing, in the case of the University of California, whether the system can remain one of excellence for residents. All of this did not creep up overnight. 
 Expansive growth in the first half of the 20th century led to rising housing prices and infrastructure growth, which came with higher taxes to pay for it all.
 Those increases created an antitax rebellion that begot Proposition 13 in the 1970s, a voter-led initiative that artificially depressed property taxes and shifted school financing burdens to the state. It also led to the onset of a culture of ballot initiatives that have hamstrung state budgeters by earmarking money for programs with one vote and taking away the ability to pay for them with others.
 The state's population -- over 38 million today from 23.6 million in 1980 -- has also meant a growing need for costly services for the poor, especially when revenues are declining. (In the 1930s, when Mr. Guthrie was warning that people needed do-re-mi to live here, no one was on Medicaid.)
 While the state's property taxes are below average, its personal income tax rate and levies on capital gains are among the highest; so unlike states that pass the tax burden around, California can become disastrously imbalanced. 
 ''Volatility is a challenge for budgeting,'' said Jed Kolko, the associate director of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research organization in San Francisco.
 Now, local governments, schools, the state university system and state agencies find themselves unable to provide the services residents have been used to receiving.
 ''Compared to the post-World War II era, an in-migrant to California now faces higher cost housing, lower quality K-12 schools, and more expensive higher education,'' said Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a professor emeritus at the School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 ''He or she also faces job opportunities that more or less mirror what is available on average elsewhere in the U.S.,'' Professor Mitchell said.
 The fallout is already evident. Summer school was canceled in many districts. In Eureka, near the Oregon border, the Old Town Dental Center is about to close. Its patient base is 90 percent Medicaid, and the state's program will no longer pay for anything beyond tooth extractions. 
 ''There are a lot of people that are just not showing up,'' said Nicole Eleck, the receptionist there. ''Half our patients are saying, 'If something bothers me, I will wait until it needs to get pulled.' ''
 Herrmann Spetzler, the chief executive of Open Door Community Health Centers, which operates 10 clinics in rural northern California, said clinics that are the only providers for miles around might close.
 ''If you sit in our waiting room, you will see the faces of everyone who lives in our region,'' he said. ''There is the local judge, the policeman, the mom with kids and the homeless person. In my health centers, we've had $5 million in cut since July, and we don't know what the future will bring.'' 
 What comes next is anybody's guess, but it may be that California's standing as paradise is meeting an organic end. 
 ''In the end, we do not know for sure whether the California public really wants the California dream anymore,'' said Bruce E. Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The population is too diverse to have a common vision of what it wants to provide to everyone. Some people want the old dream, some want the gated privatized version, and some would like to secede and get away from it all.''

A3) CHARTS: The Long Road To a Budget Resolution: SEPT. 23 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signs a $143 billion state budget for fiscal year 2008-9 that is 85 days late. The spending plan is a result of intense haggling by both political parties and the governor over how to close a $15 billion gap.
NOV. 6 In a special legislative session to deal with an additional budget shortfall, Mr. Schwarzenegger calls for a sharp increase in the state's sales tax as well as new taxes on oil drilling and alcoholic drinks
DEC. 17 The Legislature passes its own version of a budget, which Mr. Schwarzenegger refuses to sign, arguing that it lacks sufficient spending cuts.
DEC. 31 Mr. Schwarzenegger proposes a budget that contains a hefty sales tax increase and would cut away at state services. The plan also calls for an increase in higher education fees and layoffs of state workers.
FEB. 20 Ending months of gridlock, Mr. Schwarzenegger signs a budget that closes a $41 billion deficit through 2010. The plan is contingent upon voters approving six ballot measures that include temporary tax increases, borrowing and the allocation of money from special programs to the general fund.
MAY 14 As revenues decline, Mr. Schwarzenegger releases two versions of budget revisions about a week before the special election on the ballot measures
MAY 19 Voters reject five of the six ballot measures intended to close the budget gap.
JULY 20 Lawmakers finally seal the deal with Mr. Schwarzenegger on a plan to close the now $26 billion budget gap. A vote is expected on Thursday.
JULY 2 The state begins issuing i.o.u.'s in lieu of cash to taxpayers, vendors and local governments.
 JULY 1 Mr. Schwarzenegger releases a new budget proposal suspending a voter-approved proposition that requires the state to spend 40 percent of the general fund on schools.(pg. A3)

HEADLINE: 2nd-Quarter Earnings Top Expectations At Caterpillar

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Caterpillar posted a second-quarter profit on Tuesday that exceeded analysts' highest estimates, aided by job cuts and a lower tax rate. The company, the maker of construction equipment, raised its full-year forecast, saying stimulus programs were starting to support global demand. 
 ''We are seeing signs of stabilization that we hope will set the foundation for an eventual recovery,'' Caterpillar's chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. ''Credit markets have improved significantly. Fiscal policy and monetary stimulus have been introduced around the world, and we are seeing signs, particularly in China, that they are beginning to work.''
 Net income dropped to $371 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $1.11 billion, or $1.74 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 41 percent, to $7.98 billion.
 Full-year profit, the company said, will be $1.15 to $2.25 a share excluding some items, exceeding analysts' average estimate of $1.12. Sales will be $32 billion to $36 billion, in line with the average estimate of $34.8 billion.
 Shares of Caterpillar rose 7.67 percent, or $2.81, to $39.46. 
 Mr. Owens has pressed the government for tax and trade policies to bolster sales and has eliminated about 17,100 full-time jobs since December. More than 17,000 contract and temporary workers also were cut. 
 Caterpillar's effective tax rate in the second quarter was 10 percent, less than the estimated annual rate of 31.3 percent, the company said. CAT Financial Services reported after-tax profit of $89 million, a 32 percent decline from a year earlier. Revenue declined 10 percent, to $700 million.
 ''They exceeded expectations due to a lower tax rate than analysts expected, lower costs and better-than-expected profit at CAT finance,'' said Lawrence T. De Maria, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach in New York.

HEADLINE: Governors' Races Offer Republicans an Opening

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republicans in search of good news these days have had to rely on bad news for the White House: the latest setback for President Obama's health care plan; his sagging poll numbers; the failure of the Obama economic stimulus plan so far to reverse the rise in unemployment.
 But there is the potential for some tangible good news for Republicans just over the horizon: the 2010 elections for governor. For a variety of reasons, like the economic problems crushing governors across the country and term-limit laws forcing out otherwise formidable Democratic incumbents, Republicans have a good shot at making gains in what is shaping up as a free-for-all for 39 governors' seats next year. 
 And 2010 is not just any election year: it is crucial given that this class of governors will be in charge as their states draw Congressional and state legislative districts as part of the reapportionment process after the next census. And given historical trends in midterm elections and the lopsided majority Democrats enjoy in Congress, the possibility that Republicans could make gains in House races next year could give the party a psychological boost at the halfway point of Mr. Obama's term.
 That would certainly offer a welcome break for Republicans after the resignation of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and the marital difficulties of Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina.
 ''When I start looking at this chart, in some ways I'd sure rather be a Republican than a Democrat next year,'' said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks governors' races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. 
 ''There were a bunch of Democratic states I wasn't looking too seriously at for a while -- Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin -- that I am taking new looks at because in the past several months, I have seen polling numbers for these governors tank,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''Let's face it: Being governor is not the best job in America right now.''
 There are reasons for this. First, Democrats have more seats to defend next year: 21, compared with 18 for Republicans. (Over all, Democrats hold 28 governorships, and Republicans 22.)
 In addition, governors everywhere are struggling with huge budget deficits that are forcing them to cut services and raise taxes, enmeshing them in bruising battles with state legislatures and constituency groups. That is causing problems for governors like James E. Doyle of Wisconsin and Chet Culver of Iowa, both Democrats who are up for re-election next year; Republicans are tracking polls showing both men as unpopular.
 What is more, there are 17 open seats in 2010, mainly because of term limits, and Democrats hold 10 of them. 
 Among the Democrats being forced out by term limits are Edward G. Rendell in Pennsylvania, Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan (where, given the economic situation, she might have had a tough re-election bid); Brad Henry of Oklahoma; Bill Richardson of New Mexico; and Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon. 
 And the Democrats can thank Mr. Obama for creating another big opportunity for Republicans in Kansas when he tapped the governor, Kathleen Sebelius, to be his secretary of health and human services.
 It is early, and to a certain extent the shape of these races will be dictated by who emerges from some crowded and competitive Republican primary fields across the country. As of now, officials from both parties said, Republicans could see a net gain of at least three governorships. Democrats face especially long odds in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Tennessee and perhaps Wyoming. That list of highly competitive races could end up including Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, officials in both parties said.
 ''We are mindful of the economic landscape, the historical trends for a president's first midterm election and the sheer number of seats we need to defend,'' said Nathan Daschle, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association. ''These are tremendous advantages for the other side. But the outlook is sunnier than we anticipated even a year ago.''
 Not that Republicans are not in danger of losing some seats of their own. With Gov. Charlie Crist running for the Senate, Florida could prove to be a high-profile and valuable gain for Democrats. The same is true for California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is barred by term limits from seeking re-election (though given his poll numbers, Democrats might wish he were on the ballot). 
 Democrats are also in a strong position to challenge Republican governors in Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada and Rhode Island.
 Similarly, the decision by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, not to seek re-election in Minnesota, as he prepares for a potential presidential bid in 2012, has created an opportunity for Democrats.
 Republicans, however, may not have to wait until 2010 to start posting victories. There are two elections for governor this November, in New Jersey and Virginia, both for seats held by Democrats. And both seem to be prime targets for Republicans.

HEADLINE: Sales Weaken At Starbucks, But It Still Turns a Profit

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Starbucks is still losing customers, but not as many as it has for the last two quarters. These days, that qualifies as welcome news. 
 On Tuesday, Starbucks reported that in its third quarter, sales at stores open at least a year declined 5 percent -- an improvement over the 8 percent drop in same-store sales last quarter and the 9 percent drop in the first quarter. Starbucks also posted its first quarter of earnings growth since 2007. 
 The core challenge for the coffee chain remains persuading people to come to its stores as they cut spending. 
 Some analysts had been worried that the major summer ad blitz by McDonald's, promoting the fast-food chain's new espresso drinks, could further the declines in traffic at Starbucks. 
 But Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, said that ''to the contrary, it appears that the various marketing campaigns and all the media coverage about coffee has created unprecedented awareness of the coffee category over all and has actually had a positive result on Starbucks' business.'' 
 Starbucks, based in Seattle, reported that net income in the third quarter, ended June 28, was $151.5 million, or 20 cents a share, in contrast to a net loss of $6.7 million and a penny a share in the period last year. Revenue fell 6.6 percent, to $2.4 billion. 
 ''We started experiencing and spotting a softness in the business that was linked to a downturn in the economy and consumer confidence earlier than most,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''In hindsight, that did provide us with the catalyst to make cuts earlier than most, which gave us an advantage as we're now coming out of this.'' 
 Analysts also attributed the earnings growth to an aggressive cost-cutting campaign started in 2008. The company says the cuts will save it $550 million this year. 
 It has shut 676 stores in the United States and plans to shut 124 more by September. In January, it said it would cut 6,700 jobs, reduce the number of new stores and renegotiate contracts with landlords and suppliers. 
 The results, released after the close of markets, were better than Wall Street's predictions and the shares rose about 10 percent in after-hours trading. They had ended regular trading at $14.69.
 ''The company's cost-savings initiatives appear to be yielding some fruit,'' said Sharon Zackfia of William Blair, who covers the restaurant industry. Now, she said, analysts are shifting their focus to revenue at Starbucks and the biggest challenge for all restaurants right now: getting more people into the stores. 
 To lure customers, Starbucks started its summer promotion, which offers morning customers a discounted drink in the afternoon, on June 30, a month earlier than usual. On Tuesday, Starbucks offered customers a free pastry before 10:30 a.m. Starbucks will soon include coupons on packaged coffee sold in grocery stores that customers can exchange for a free coffee at a Starbucks store, Mr. Schultz said. 
 ''A lot of hard work still lies ahead,'' he said. ''One quarter does not make a trend.''

HEADLINE: Real Challenge To Health Bill: Selling Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
What's in it for me?
 On the subject of health care reform, most Americans probably don't have a good answer to the question. And that, obviously, is a problem for the White House and for Democratic leaders in Congress.
 Current bills would expand the number of insured -- but 90 percent of voters already have insurance. Congressional leaders say the bills would cut costs. But experts are dubious. Instead, they point out that covering the uninsured would cost billions.
 So the typical person watching from afar is left to wonder: What will this project mean for me, besides possibly higher taxes? 
 Barack Obama was able to rise from the Illinois State Senate to the presidency in large measure because of his ability to explain complex issues and then to make a persuasive argument. He now has a challenge worthy of his skills. 
 Our health care system is engineered, deliberately or not, to resist change. The people who pay for it -- you and I -- often don't realize that they're paying for it. Money comes out of our paychecks, in withheld taxes and insurance premiums, before we ever see it. It then flows to doctors, hospitals and drug makers without our realizing that it was our money to begin with.
 The doctors, hospitals and drug makers use the money to treat us, and we of course do see those treatments. If anything, we want more of them. They are supposed to make us healthy, and they appear to be free. What's not to like?
 The immediate task facing Mr. Obama -- in his news conference on Wednesday night and beyond -- is to explain that the health care system doesn't really work the way it seems to. He won't be able to put it in such blunt terms. But he will need to explain how a typical household, one that has insurance and thinks it always will, is being harmed. 
 The United States now devotes one-sixth of its economy to medicine. Divvy that up, and health care will cost the typical household roughly $15,000 this year, including the often-invisible contributions by employers. That is almost twice as much as two decades ago (adjusting for inflation). It's about $6,500 more than in other rich countries, on average.
 We may not be aware of this stealth $6,500 health care tax, but if you take a moment to think, it makes sense. Over the last 20 years, health costs have soared, and incomes have grown painfully slowly. The two trends are directly connected: employers had to spend more money on benefits, leaving less for raises. 
 In exchange for the $6,500 tax, we receive many things. We get cutting-edge research and heroic surgeries. But we also get fabulous amounts of waste -- bureaucratic and medical. 
 One thing we don't get is better health than other rich countries, whether it's Canada, France, Japan or many others. In some categories, like emergency room care, this country seems to do better. In others, like chronic-disease care, it seems to do worse. ''The fact that we spend all this money and don't have better outcomes than other countries is a sign of how poorly we're doing,'' says Dr. Alan Garber of Stanford University. ''We should be doing way better.'' 
 So far, no one has grabbed the mantle as the defender of the typical household -- the opponent of spending that creates profits for drug companies and hospitals at no benefit to people's health and at significant cost to their finances. 
 Republicans have actually come out against doing research into which procedures improve health. Blue Dog Democrats oppose wasteful spending but until recently have not been specific. Liberals rely on the wishful idea -- yet to be supported by evidence -- that more preventive care will reduce spending. The American Medical Association, not surprisingly, endorses this notion of doing more care in the name of less care.
 Mr. Obama says many of the right things. Yet the White House has not yet shown that it's willing to fight the necessary fights. Remember: the $6,500 tax benefits someone. And that someone has a lobbyist. The lobbyist even has an argument about how he is acting in your interest. 
 These lobbyists, who include big names like Dick Armey and Richard Gephardt, have succeeded in persuading Congress to write bills with a rather clever feature. They include some of the ideas that would cut costs -- but defang them. 
 One proposal would pay doctors based on the quality of care, rather than quantity, but it's a pilot project. Doctors who already provide good care may well opt in; doctors providing wasteful but lucrative care surely will not. The bills would also finance research on which treatments are effective. But Medicare officials would not be prevented from continuing to spend taxpayer money on ineffective treatments.
 In reaction, some people who should be natural supporters of reform have become critics. The Mayo Clinic -- one of Mr. Obama's favorite models of care -- says the legislation fails to ''help create higher-quality, more affordable health care.'' 
 On Thursday, Mr. Obama will visit another example he likes to cite, the Cleveland Clinic. Its successes capture what real reform would look like. Like Mayo, the Cleveland Clinic pays its doctors a salary, rather than piecemeal, and delivers excellent results for relatively little money. 
 ''I came here 30-some years ago,'' Delos Cosgrove, a heart surgeon who is the clinic's chief executive, told me. ''And I have never received any additional pay for anything I did. It never made a difference if I did five heart operations or four -- I got paid the same amount of money. So I had no incentive to do any extra tests or anything.'' 
 This is the crux of the issue, economists say: the current fee-for-service system needs to be remade. The administration has made some progress, by proposing a powerful new Medicare overseer who could force the program to pay for good results and stop paying for bad ones. 
 But even a strong Medicare plan won't be enough. Reform will need to attack the piecemeal system in numerous ways. Among the most promising, which Mr. Obama has resisted, is a limit on tax subsidies for the costliest health insurance plans. This limit would give households and employers a reason to become smarter shoppers.
 Above all, reform can't revolve around politely asking the rest of the medical system to become more like the Cleveland Clinic. 
 In recent weeks, polls have shown that a solid majority of Americans support the stated goals of health reform. Most want the uninsured to be covered and want the option of a government-run insurance plan. Yet the polls also show that people are worried about the package emerging from Congress.
 Maybe they have a point.

HEADLINE: A Defining Moment Nears for President

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Six months into his administration, President Obama is at a pivotal moment. He has pushed through a $787 billion economic stimulus package, bailed out Wall Street and, on Tuesday, managed to beat the defense industry in the Senate, which voted to kill a high-profile fighter jet program.
 But the public, and lawmakers, are growing skittish over Mr. Obama's next big plan, to remake the American health care system. How he handles the issue over the next several weeks could shape the rest of his presidency, shedding light on his political strength, his relationship with both parties in Congress and the extent to which he is willing to bend in fighting for his agenda. 
 With some fellow Democrats balking over his insistence that both the House and the Senate pass health legislation before the August recess, Mr. Obama has a tough decision to make: Does he take a hard line, demanding that lawmakers stick to his timetable -- and risk losing the support of Republicans and moderate Democrats? Or does he signal flexibility, allowing lawmakers to take their time -- and give opponents the chance to marshal their case against the bill?
 ''He's got to be careful that while he ratchets up the pressure, he doesn't bet his whole presidency on whether this gets done before the August recess,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who orchestrated President Ronald Reagan's first-term legislative strategy. ''He has a broad, broad agenda that he's in a rush to enact, and if he's not careful he will be viewed as a steamroller who tries to get things fast and not necessarily right.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will address the nation in a prime-time news conference. Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview that the president intended to use it as a ''six-month report card,'' to talk about ''how we rescued the economy from the worst recession'' and the legislative agenda moving forward, including health care and energy legislation, which squeaked through the House and faces a tough road in the Senate.
 Polls show that Mr. Obama is more popular than his own policies, a worrisome sign for a president with such an ambitious agenda. Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who is now vice president of the Aspen Institute, said Mr. Obama might be making a mistake in reading his election as a mandate for dramatic change.
 ''A lot of people supported Obama because they wanted to repudiate the Bush administration,'' said Mr. Edwards, who backed Mr. Obama for president. ''I was one of those people who supported him for reasons other than the policies he is proposing. He seemed more thoughtful, more contemplative -- I felt he had the right temperament to be president. But I think his health care proposal goes beyond what the public at the moment is ready to accept.''
 Mr. Obama came into office promising a more bipartisan Washington tone, which he has so far been unable to achieve. His actions in the coming weeks on health care may determine his long-term relationship not only with Republicans but also with his fellow Democrats. 
 ''I think this will be a major factor in defining his presidency,'' said Tom Daschle, the former Senate Democratic leader, who remains a close adviser to the White House on health issues. ''Because he's made it such an issue, and because he has invested so much personal time and effort, this will, more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far, be a measure of his clout and of his success early on. And because it is early on, it will define his subsequent years.''
 On the Republican side, one question is whether Mr. Obama will succumb to the temptation to turn health care into a partisan fight, even as he tries to court the opposing party. He is, after all, still a popular new president confronting an unpopular Republican Party, and so it would be easy for him to demonize Republicans as obstructionists who want to stand in the way of progress. 
 Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, gave Mr. Obama an opening to do just that the other day, and the president took it. Mr. DeMint called health care a ''Waterloo moment'' that could break Mr. Obama. The president struck back, declaring, ''This isn't about me.'' But if Mr. Obama extends that line of attack to Republicans more broadly, and rams a bill through without their support, any claim he may have to bipartisanship will quickly evaporate.
 As for Democrats, Mr. Obama faces a balance-of-power conundrum. He has said all along that he will set out broad principles for a bill and leave the details to Congress. But now House Democrats in the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, including seven who hold decisive votes on the Energy and Commerce Committee, say they will not support the House bill without big changes.
 One question for Mr. Obama is whether to try to strong-arm them, and face a rebellion from some of the very same conservative Democrats who helped put him in office. If he forces them to vote for a bill their constituents do not like, on a timetable that feels too rushed for them, it could hurt them at home. That could mean a bigger political problem for the White House: a resulting loss of Democratic seats in the 2010 midterm elections.
 Another question is how hard Mr. Obama will push Congress as a whole to adopt his progressive agenda, not only on health care but also on climate change and a variety of other issues. 
 The next few weeks, as the president tries to broker a health care deal, may well tell Americans just how far he is willing to go.

HEADLINE: Governors' Races Offer Republicans An Opening

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republicans in search of good news these days have had to rely on bad news for the White House: the latest setback for President Obama's health care plan; his sagging poll numbers; the failure of the Obama economic stimulus plan so far to reverse the rise in unemployment.
 But there is the potential for some tangible good news for Republicans just over the horizon: the 2010 elections for governor. For a variety of reasons, like the economic problems crushing governors across the country and term-limit laws forcing out otherwise formidable Democratic incumbents, Republicans have a good shot at making gains in what is shaping up as a free-for-all for 39 governors' seats next year. 
 And 2010 is not just any election year: it is crucial given that this class of governors will be in charge as their states draw Congressional and state legislative districts as part of the reapportionment process after the next census. And given historical trends in midterm elections and the lopsided majority Democrats enjoy in Congress, the possibility that Republicans could make gains in House races next year could give the party a psychological boost at the halfway point of Mr. Obama's term.
 That would certainly offer a welcome break for Republicans after the resignation of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska and the marital difficulties of Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina.
 ''When I start looking at this chart, in some ways I'd sure rather be a Republican than a Democrat next year,'' said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks governors' races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. 
 ''There were a bunch of Democratic states I wasn't looking too seriously at for a while -- Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin -- that I am taking new looks at because in the past several months, I have seen polling numbers for these governors tank,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''Let's face it: Being governor is not the best job in America right now.''
 There are reasons for this. First, Democrats have more seats to defend next year: 21, compared with 18 for Republicans. (Over all, Democrats hold 28 governorships, and Republicans 22.)
 In addition, governors everywhere are struggling with huge budget deficits that are forcing them to cut services and raise taxes, enmeshing them in bruising battles with state legislatures and constituency groups. That is causing problems for governors like James E. Doyle of Wisconsin and Chet Culver of Iowa, both Democrats who are up for re-election next year; Republicans are tracking polls showing both men as unpopular.
 What is more, there are 17 open seats in 2010, mainly because of term limits, and Democrats hold 10 of them. 
 Among the Democrats being forced out by term limits are Edward G. Rendell in Pennsylvania, Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan (where, given the economic situation, she might have had a tough re-election bid); Brad Henry of Oklahoma; Bill Richardson of New Mexico; and Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon. 
 And the Democrats can thank Mr. Obama for creating another big opportunity for Republicans in Kansas when he tapped the governor, Kathleen Sebelius, to be his secretary of health and human services.
 It is early, and to a certain extent the shape of these races will be dictated by who emerges from some crowded and competitive Republican primary fields across the country. As of now, officials from both parties said, Republicans could see a net gain of at least three governorships. Democrats face especially long odds in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Tennessee and perhaps Wyoming. That list of highly competitive races could end up including Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, officials in both parties said.
 ''We are mindful of the economic landscape, the historical trends for a president's first midterm election and the sheer number of seats we need to defend,'' said Nathan Daschle, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association. ''These are tremendous advantages for the other side. But the outlook is sunnier than we anticipated even a year ago.''
 Not that Republicans are not in danger of losing some seats of their own. With Gov. Charlie Crist running for the Senate, Florida could prove to be a high-profile and valuable gain for Democrats. The same is true for California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is barred by term limits from seeking re-election (though given his poll numbers, Democrats might wish he were on the ballot). 
 Democrats are also in a strong position to challenge Republican governors in Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada and Rhode Island.
 Similarly, the decision by Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, not to seek re-election in Minnesota, as he prepares for a potential presidential bid in 2012, has created an opportunity for Democrats.
 Republicans, however, may not have to wait until 2010 to start posting victories. There are two elections for governor this November, in New Jersey and Virginia, both for seats held by Democrats. And both seem to be prime targets for Republicans.

HEADLINE: Acres of Antiques, And on a Spree

BYLINE: By STEVEN KURUTZ

DATELINE: Brimfield, Mass. 

 BODY:
 THE consensus last week at the Brimfield Antique Show, a kind of showroom on steroids with the chaos of a parking-lot flea market, held that the vibe was more relaxed than usual, and, as one vendor put it, ''the bargains were flowing.'' 
 Chalk it up to the season -- the July show, one of three every year, is traditionally smaller than those held in May and September -- and the sputtering economy. Whatever the reason, the let's-make-a-deal atmosphere was welcomed by Trent Wisehart, 39, a creative executive at Tommy Hilfiger who, on the show's first day, led a six-person team on a spare-no-expense spree. 
 Mr. Wisehart and his co-workers were hunting for items to decorate the fashion label's flagship Manhattan store, scheduled to open in September in the McKim, Mead & White building on Fifth Avenue formerly occupied by Fortunoff. Because it had to find objects to fill 22,000 square feet over four floors, the team had come prepared -- with a 36-foot trailer, five people to carry items from booth to truck, two-way radios so they could fan out and relay finds, custom ''Tommy'' tags to mark their merchandise and an enormous wad of cash. 
 The six-day show, which began on July 14, stretches for over a mile along Route 20 in Brimfield and attracts an estimated 5,000 vendors. It has long been a favorite destination for collectors, as well as for interior decorators and designers like Martha Stewart and Ralph Lauren, whose creative teams come to seek out vintage textiles and other items for inspiration. 
 Walk into a maze of antiques on either side of the highway and you come out convinced that anything imaginable can be found there. An X-ray machine? Check. How about a vintage prosthetic leg? Yes, that too. Six-foot-tall plastic cat? Of course!
 ''It's everything you can imagine to decorate a house or the outside of a house,'' said Angelo Dounoucos, a retired engineer from Albany, who last year self-published a book of photographs he had taken at Brimfield over the years. ''It's almost more than you can imagine.''
 Mr. Wisehart, who estimated that he had been to Brimfield a dozen times, navigated the tented booths like a pro. Disguised in a T-shirt and baggy cargo shorts -- so as not to betray he was a deep-pocketed corporate emissary -- he combed the stalls with two team members, Jennifer George-Rojas and Heather Waite, who carried a binder filled with visual mockups of the new store and a checklist of things the team hoped to find. 
 They were on the lookout for items with distinctly American appeal and, more nebulously, what Mr. Wisehart called the ''fun factor.'' 
 At one stand, he found a dressmaker's mannequin decoupaged with cutout photos of Marilyn Monroe. ''She'd be great on the collection floor,'' he announced, referring to the mannequin. ''Do you like it, Jen, or is it freaking you out?'' 
 Ms. George-Rojas did not seem freaked out, and after a quick negotiation, the dress form was purchased for $40 and carted away by the porters. 
 At another booth, the team obsessed over an antique wooden shoeshine stand priced at $1,600 that, according to the dealers selling it, had come from an airport in Rhode Island. It was not on the checklist, but everyone agreed it would look spiffy in the men's department. 
 ''Would you redo the cushion?'' Ms. Rojas asked. 
 ''I think so,'' Mr. Wisehart said. ''It needs to be cool, aged leather.'' 
 In the same booth, he inquired about a settee made of two ornately carved Chippendale chairs. 
 ''That came out of the oldest house in Cromwell, Conn.,'' said one of the dealers, Richard Conley, shifting into pitch mode. 
 By the time the transaction was concluded, Mr. Conley, who wears his white hair long, with a beard descending to his navel, had sold a reproduction 1940s-style bike for $400, as well as his partner's shoeshine stand and settee. 
 ''There's a meal here at Brimfield,'' Mr. Conley said, referring to the acres of merchandise. And collectors and buyers, like Mr. Wisehart, are ''hawks,'' he added, ''looking for that meal.''
 By the end of the day, the Tommy team had amassed, among other things, four pink-cushioned, '50s-era kitchen chairs; a military drum; license plates from all 50 states (''Can you find me a Nebraska?'' Mr. Wisehart could be heard calling out); stone printing blocks; a Shiraz rug; and, from a man who looked vaguely like Jerry Garcia, an oversize poster bearing the phrase ''Love Generator,'' an advertisement for a psychedelic event in San Francisco, circa 1966.
 ''Love generator -- that's so great,'' Mr. Wisehart said, counting out $1,600 from his bankroll. 
 WHAT'S referred to collectively as Brimfield is actually about 20 individually managed shows, each with its own flavor and start time. The oldest, J & J Promotions, was founded by Gordon Reid, an auctioneer who in 1959 -- the show is celebrating its 50th anniversary -- invited 67 dealers to exhibit their wares on his land in the town of Brimfield. ''It started as a small antiques fair,'' said his daughter Judith Reid Mathieu, who lives in the family homestead and runs the J & J show with her sister, Jill Lukesh. ''The dealers would set up on the back of their station wagons.'' 
 These days, Brimfield's reputation is global. It's not uncommon to see Japanese hipsters scooping up whole racks of vintage clothes. And the competition among buyers is fierce.
 Scarlett Scales, an antiques dealer from Franklin, Tenn., recalled watching a few years ago as two women examined old grain sacks she was selling. According to Ms. Scales, a well-known Manhattan designer was in her booth at the time, and while the women still had the sacks in their hands, he said, ''I'll take them all.''
 The staggered openings add to the frenzy. On the second day, a crowd gathered in front of a field along the mile called Quaker Acres, waiting for the gate to open. It was 5:45 a.m. When the market opened a half-hour later, the crowd stampeded. 
 The Tommy team members followed soon after, picking up more military drums and a box of weathered finials. But they were biding their time until the 9 a.m. opening of Heart-O-the-Mart, considered one of the better shows.
 The mob scene at the gate was replayed. As a hedge against the rush, Mr. Wisehart devised a flanking strategy. He and a co-worker would go right, and the rest of the team would go left. 
 They made quick work of the market and found eye-catching pieces like a barber pole and two sculptural metal etageres. At one point, they found themselves rummaging for textiles next to two women from Gap, the apparel company. 
 Eventually, the team's seemingly inexhaustible bankroll was exhausted. That afternoon, members gathered in the field where their 36-foot trailer was parked to examine the haul.
 ''What's amazing about Brimfield is that you can stretch your dollar,'' Mr. Wisehart said. (Although that's easier to do when you have a five-figure budget.) ''It's also amazing to have that quantity of things in one location. The juxtaposition of things here can trigger you creatively.'' 
 He looked at the random collection of items, from the ''Love Generator'' poster to the barber pole to an Empire-style table with a pedestal base made of a sawed-off porch column. 
 ''I mean, we would have never said, 'Oh, let's get a barber pole,' '' he said. ''But you see it in a field, and it hints at red, white and blue, and it's authentic. It's an amazing element.''

HEADLINE: MAC Pitching Its Fashion Tent Downtown

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
DURING the five years that MAC was the cosmetics sponsor of fashion shows in Bryant Park in New York, the makeup company made headlines with press conferences attended by supermodels and lithe young dancers who wore body paint in the place of clothing. But MAC, while spending millions, had to share a rather circuslike stage with other sponsors who were competing for attention, sometimes including makers of doughnuts, cameras, toilets and Big Macs.
 Now the company has decided to end its support of that event -- Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, as it's called -- and will instead present its own shows at Milk Studios in the meatpacking district. Depending on your perspective, it could be viewed as a complement to Fashion Week, or a new competitor. Proenza Schouler, Erin Fetherston and Alexander Wang are among the dozen designers who have already signed on. 
 The event, with the working title of MAC at Milk, will overlap with the established Fashion Week, beginning Sept. 10. 
 As John Demsey, the Estee Lauder group president who oversees MAC, described it, the idea was to create a space for emerging and international designers at a time when they need more corporate support. The designers will not be charged for the use of the studios, whereas the Bryant Park shows typically cost around $25,000 for the smallest space.
 ''Not everybody wants to be in a giant tent environment,'' Mr. Demsey said. ''And not everybody should be.''
 While Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week usually includes about 60 shows held in Bryant Park, hundreds of other designers present their collections at other locations, causing endless frustration among retailers and editors trying to see them all. Mazdack Rassi, the founder of Milk Studios, said that there is room for about 25 to 30 presentations in his building. 
 And because of the relationships of MAC and the studio with top designers, they were able to draw some names at the vanguard of fashion who do not normally consider showing in the same space as anyone else. Band of Outsiders, Preen and ThreeAsFour will also show there.
 ''It's not just an alternative show space we are creating, but truly a movement,'' Mr. Rassi said.
 Mr. Demsey said that the MAC at Milk shows are being coordinated with the Council of Fashion Designers of America and will be included in the official calendar of Fashion Week.
 Meanwhile, Maybelline, a division of L'Oreal, will replace MAC as the cosmetics sponsor of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Zach Eichman, a vice president of IMG Fashion, which produces those shows, said the company welcomed the new event and would coordinate its bus service between shows where possible.
 ''We can't do every show in the tents,'' he said. ''We hope they will be successful.''
 Gilt Is Golden
 Almost every weekday at noon, Eastern Standard Time, 100,000 to 200,000 people log on to Gilt.com, one of a handful of Web sites that offer discounted designer merchandise in an online version of a sample sale, only without the throwing of elbows. 
 Dresses from Alexander McQueen and men's suits from Thom Browne are offered at about half their retail price. They go fast. The fastest transaction, said Susan Lyne, the chief executive of Gilt, took all of nine seconds from the time a customer visited the site to checking out with a dress. So it would be fair to call the company, less than two years old and with sales of $100 million, a surprising success during the recession.
 Still, not everyone is buying. Of its 1.2 million members, more than half are in their 20s, and of that group, about 250,000 visit the site twice a week or more and never make a purchase, Ms. Lyne said. The reason is pretty obvious. Even on sale, the merchandise is expensive -- a Fendi bag offered this week was $1,348. Why hesitate?
 So next month, Gilt is introducing a second site, called Gilt Fuse. It's kind of like the Co-Op floor at Barneys New York, where the trendier, less expensive collections reside. Clothes from Diesel, C&C, Generra and Laundry will be offered for $75 to $150. Ms. Lyne said the company is expecting a big year: Its sales are projected to reach $400 million, or about half the size of Barneys.
 ''You are getting access to brands you might not ever see in your city,'' Ms. Lyne said. ''And it's at a price point that is almost irresistible.''

HEADLINE: The Unchilled Life

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
TO many Americans, abstaining from air-conditioning is a masochistic folly akin to refusing Novocain or renouncing the dishwasher. 
 Yet as this particular summer finally heats up, even citizens who believe that climate control is a God-given right may be questioning whether it has become a luxury they can no longer afford. They are probably also wondering how they can survive without it.
 Those who've done just that like to point out that air-conditioning is a relatively recent boon to humanity: The Allies won World War II without it, and the great pyramids of Egypt were built al fresco. Today, fans of the unchilled life say that it is not only possible to turn back the clock and live as one with summer, but to do it while maintaining a fairly high quality of life.
 Lisa Finkelstein, a freelance editor, stopped using the semi-functional air-conditioning and heating unit in her rented cottage in Tallahassee, Fla., two years ago, mostly for economic reasons. 
 ''You live with your windows and doors open, you use fans, drink lots of cold liquids and take it easy,'' she said. ''You come to realize that winter and summer is going to be kind of a bear but you dress for it, and you enjoy fall and spring very much. What's interesting is you acclimate to it.''
 She said that if she didn't work from home, the adjustment would probably be harder. ''It's miserable when you come out of a nice air-conditioned place,'' Ms. Finkelstein said.
 This summer, she probably has more company in the choice she has made. Shipments of window air-conditioners from manufacturers to distributors were down 39 percent in the first half of this year compared with the first half of last year, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers in Washington, D.C., and shipments of central air-conditioning units have been down 10 percent a year for the past few years, according to the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute in Arlington, Va. 
 Those who plunge into a warmer world for economic reasons sometimes find that there are advantages that they hadn't anticipated. 
 Genma Holmes, a 42-year-old mother of three in Nashville, and her husband, Roger, declared their suburban ranch house a no-air-conditioning zone last summer as surging gas prices ate into the profits of their pest control business. Their children -- now ages 17, 18, and 23 -- were not amused, given that average summer temperatures in Nashville are in the high 80s with around 90 percent humidity.
 ''They didn't look at it from our economic point of view,'' said Ms. Holmes, who ripped the thermostat from the wall after her offspring repeatedly turned on the central air while their parents were out. ''They thought we were doing something to them personally. They thought mom and dad were going through some kind of midlife crisis, like when we recycled before everyone started doing it.''
 To defend against the heat, the Holmeses took some of the usual measures: long, cool showers at night, box fans in the open windows and grilling outside instead of turning on a hot stove. 
 It was when the family put up an awning and fan over their patio -- effectively transforming it into their living room, where they spent about three hours a night grilling, playing games and talking instead of going their separate ways -- that they discovered the upside of an uncontrolled climate
 ''We spent an entire summer getting to know our kids by sitting outside trying to keep our electricity bill down,'' said Ms. Holmes, who estimated that the family saved $2,100 last summer; they are repeating the experience this year. ''It was very therapeutic and we got closer. We also got thinner -- all of our diets changed because we were eating a lot of grilled food. And by the time fall came around, with the change in the economy, we had learned to live off less. So when everyone started talking about how hard things are, we felt like we had already experienced the worst of the worst. It prepared us for the whole year.''
 Like the Holmeses, many choose to go natural during the summer for economic reasons. Others find that this is a point on which finance, politics and habits intersect.
 ''In our social circle, use of the air-conditioner is extremely limited,'' said Martin Focazio, who lives in Upper Black Eddy, Pa., and commutes into Manhattan four days a week to his job as a digital media strategist. ''It's not like we're health-nut crazies or a bunch of dirty hippies dancing naked around the fire. We're all white-collar geeks living an exurban lifestyle. We just all share the philosophy of rolling with the seasons if you can.''
 Five years ago, Mr. Focazio dismantled the central air system in the 1,600-square-foot ranch house he shares with his wife and three young children. He left the blower motor in the attic, which the family turns on at night to draw up hot air and vent it outside, lowering the inside temperature by a few degrees but leaving the humidity unaffected.
 ''If you sweat it out, drink water and let your body adjust with the seasons, you'd be surprised,'' he said. ''There's a few days where you feel like you're walking into a wet shower curtain, but it's amazing how your body will adapt.''
 Mr. Focazio, 44, said that before the family stopped cooling their house, they tended to wait out their summers rather than participate in them.
 ''We found that going in and out of air conditioning always made you feel like it was too hot outside, so you ended up sitting in your easy chair eating pretzels,'' he said. But being uncomfortable indoors forces them out -- onto their 1,000-square-foot multilevel deck and beyond.
 ''When it's too hot to just sit here we might go swimming or ride our bikes or walk along the canal path,'' said Mr. Focazio, who noted that he usually loses about six or seven pounds each summer, which he attributes to an appetite diminished by the heat, and an increase in exercise. 
 Houses built before the 1960s, when widespread use of window air-conditioners began, tended to incorporate many of the elements that make it easier to stay cool: higher ceilings, alignment of windows to facilitate cross-ventilation, more windows on the north side of the house than the sun-exposed south, and a large covered porch to shield the sunniest part of the house. 
 But even those who live in houses without the ideal design can fight summer heat with strategic window opening and the use of heavy curtains or shutters. At night, open windows let in the cool air (window fans help). But windows should be closed in mid-morning, along with drapes or blinds, to prevent sunlight from heating up the rooms. 
 While those techniques work, not everyone is comfortable using them. Drawn drapes in the daytime can be a bit gloomy, and open windows at night can admit ambient noise -- and intruders. Ms. Finkelstein, the freelance editor who also co-writes an antiwar blog, deals with that problem by keeping a loaded shotgun and revolver on hand. 
 She explained, ''crimes of opportunity are a fact of life in Tallahassee, and open windows and doors provide entree.''
 Even if safety is not a concern, the sultry life is not for everyone. Guests tend to object. (Depending on your perspective, this can be viewed as a positive.) Heat stroke is a risk for the very young, the very old and infirm. Their neurological systems may not be up to making the subtle thermoregulatory changes needed to adjust to heat, according to Kerry Stewart, the director of the clinical and research exercise physiology program at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. 
 There is also the matter of other, ancillary living creatures. Pests like cockroaches thrive in the heat; pets do not. Kim Gorode said her cat became dehydrated from the heat the first summer she went without air-conditioning in her fourth-floor Brooklyn walk-up apartment.
 ''I had just moved to New York and had no money, and I thought I could get by with fans,'' said Ms. Gorode, a 26-year-old who works in public relations.
 But about halfway through the summer, Waldo, her orange tabby cat, began vomiting and passing out. 
 ''The vet put him on medication and gave him a saline IV for rehydrating,'' she said. The bill for $400 dwarfed the $100 she wound up paying for an air-conditioner.
 Whether pulling the plug on air-conditioning on a temporary or long-term basis, those who've done it advise patience (along with a window unit to fall back on in dire circumstances or when entertaining).
 ''Stick it out longer than you might feel comfortable with it and sooner or later you'll start to feel more used to it,'' said Timothy Honse, a 27-year-old chaplain near Kansas City, Mo., who stopped using air-conditioning several summers ago while living in a two-bedroom apartment in Atlanta, with his wife, Trinity.
 ''The first summer was really tough and we really were tempted to turn the air on,'' he said. ''But when it starts to cool off in the fall again you're like, wow, I made it. It's actually not that bad.''

HOT REWARDS: Genma Holmes, left, and her husband, Roger, declared their suburban Nashville home a no-air-conditioning zone last summer, transforming the backyard, below, into an outdoor room for grilling, playing games and talking. Besides saving $2,100 in electricity, the family grew closer -- and thinner -- and they are repeating the experience this summer. Like them, Martin Focazio, below center, and his family live without air-conditioning in their home, in Upper Black Eddy, Pa. Mr. Focazio, shown with his daughter Evelyn, said that he not only saves money but also loses six or seven pounds a summer.

 COLD REALITY: For some people, the negatives of living without cool air outweigh the positives, especially if the health of a pet is at stake. Kim Gorode, left, said that the heat made her orange tabby, Waldo, ill when she went without air-conditioning in her Brooklyn apartment. She has since moved to a place with central air-conditioning. Ms. Holmes said that one trick she learned to keep her house from getting too hot was to paint the interior walls a cool, neutral color, above. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHELLE V. AGINS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

HEADLINE: The Trojan Frog Strategy

BYLINE: By DARREN DAHL

 BODY:
Few people can claim to have created an entire industry from scratch. But Greg Wittstock, who long ago labeled himself ''The Pond Guy,'' laid the foundation for the multi-million-dollar backyard water-feature industry in 1991 when he started Aquascape Designs, shortly after completing his sophomore year at Ohio State University.
 From back-breaking beginnings digging his customer's ponds by hand, Mr. Wittstock built his St. Charles, Ill.-based company, which now goes by Aquascape, into a juggernaut that employed more than 180 and produced almost $60 million in annual revenue at its peak. Over the last two years, however, business has been off and both of those numbers have declined -- employment to 110 and revenue to an expected $40 million this year. Like many entrepreneurial pioneers, Mr. Wittstock has seen his success spawn much competition. That, along with the faltering economy and especially the collapse of the housing industry, has forced him to re-think much of what he does.
 Darren Dahl spoke with Mr. Wittstock recently about the challenges of inventing and then re-inventing an industry and of turning the looming threat of a global water crisis into a business opportunity. A condensed version of their conversation follows: 
 Q:What do you remember about the first pond you ever built?
 A: I moved from my lakefront home in New Jersey to Illinois when I was 12. My parents promised me that I could bring 11 of my pet turtles with me. On the second day after the move, I started digging my own backyard pond. I built the first pond out of concrete and it cracked during its first winter. The filter systems clogged, the pond turned green, and my turtles started escaping. That was the beginning of my odyssey.
 Q: Was there a turning point for the business when things really took off?
 A: Yes, when we decided to teach our contracting partners how to build ponds like we were. Once we taught them to fish, we started selling them the lures.
 Q:What's an example of a mistake you've learned from?
 A: The biggest mistake we made was allowing third parties like distributors and retailers to communicate for us to our customers. I just assumed that everyone had the passion for building ponds that we did. I was wrong. Our sales have been down for two years as a result. And it's not just because of the economy. We simply lost our focus. That's why we have really embraced social networking as a way to start talking to our customers directly again.
 Q:What are you doing?
 A: We have something like 18,000 people using our chat room. We just landed a six-figure contract in Egypt because they found our page. But our big leap was the launch of our new community Web site called watergardening.com. We want our customers to post pictures of their ponds and gardens and to discuss them. That way we create templates for others to follow. Our goal is to have the largest and most dynamic site in the world for anyone interested in the water-gardening business.
 Q:You've complained about your competitors copying you in the past. Won't they do it again with watergardening.com?
 A: Sure, they will be all over this, and will try to poach our customers. But what I've learned is that when you try to keep something to yourself, you might protect it, but it won't grow. My goal is to grow the overall size of the water-feature pie. Then we can take our slice from it.
 Q:You're embracing social networking, and yet, if I'm not mistaken, you personally still don't use e-mail.
 A: Well kind of. I don't use a computer and I don't type. I do tons of texting though. I can respond with brevity with my thumbs. But when I write, I like to do it with a pen in my hand. My assistant types 80 words a minute, so she can just type up whatever I write out. 
 Q:How did you deal with your declining sales?
 A: Revenue was flat in 2007 and took a downward turn in 2008. My first layoff was in January or February of that year because we were anticipating that it was going to be a tough year. The amazing thing was that even though our revenue fell by $10 million, we went from a $1.3 million loss to making a $1.1 million profit because of the cuts we made to overhead. 
 Q:But to get there you had to lay people off.
 A: I failed the people we had to let go. I blame our inability to act and to do the right things to keep us growing despite the economy. We had grown every year by 10 percent to 30 percent since I founded the company. I never had a cost-control mechanism in place. So when we couldn't grow revenue, we were forced to do a layoff.
 Q:How dependent is your business on a healthy real estate market?
 A: Obviously it's tough to grow a company during a depressed economy. But right now we have more booked jobs and construction projects than any other time in the history of the business. And part of the reason for that is that while construction has stopped, people are now looking to invest in their existing properties and to enjoy a staycation at home. 
 Q:You've said that your goal has always been to build Aquascape into a $100 million-a-year business. Is that still your goal?
 A: I think the potential has always been there for a $100 million business. It is my belief that everyone wants a water feature in their backyard but they just don't know it yet. And given the worldwide water crisis and new focus on harvesting rainwater, that number barely scratches the surface.
 Q:Do you think you tried to grow too fast?
 A: Absolutely not. Pressure is what makes you better. If you lose pressure, you lose passion.
 Q: Tell us about rainwater harvesting.
 A: I call it our Trojan Frog strategy. People are finally beginning to think differently about what it means to recycle rainwater, especially in the western U.S. Rather than look at water restrictions as a threat [to our water-gardening business], we have turned it into an opportunity. The key is that once someone begins capturing water, we'll want to convince them that they might as well put a decorative element on top of it.
 Q:How big a part of your business do you expect this to be?
 A: Well, in 2009, it will be a very small percentage of sales. But the potential is there. In five years, it should become the majority of our business.
 Q:Will that require new-home construction to pick up? 
 A: Yes and no. The big sales would come when big national homebuilders would be putting in a new subdivision or whatever. As we know, there is virtually no new construction happening today. But there is potential through remodeling. We have decided to no longer be victims. That's why we have embraced this idea of converting existing homes through our green community makeover campaign. When things turn around, we will already be the No. 1 green product line in the industry.
 Q:Looking back over the years since you started the company, what are you most proud of?
 A: We are proud to be the water-feature geeks of the world.

HEADLINE: A Modern Corps for National Parks

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Michelle's Next Mission,'' by Timothy Egan (column, July 12): 
 One way to steward our national parks is to establish a federal work-relief program modeled on the Civilian Conservation Corps, which focused on natural resource conservation from 1933 to 1942. 
 A modern corps could recruit civilian labor to improve the parks through construction and maintenance, in return for a reasonable wage and health benefits. This would better the parks, establish a safety net for more Americans at a time of economic peril, and conserve our natural endowment for the future.

HEADLINE: Concerns on Health Care Reflect Conflicting Goals

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As Democratic Congressional leaders try to round up the votes to remake the health care system, they face a range of concerns about the cost and scope of the legislation among centrist lawmakers in each party whose support is vital to a deal. 
 Representative Charlie Melancon, Democrat of Louisiana, suspects that a proposed government-run health insurance plan will be another unaffordable ''entitlement program'' that puts a stranglehold on the federal budget and on future generations. 
 Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, expresses fears that the health care legislation could inadvertently cause some Americans to lose their existing coverage. And he wants to be sure that any bill includes new ''incentives for healthy lifestyles.'' 
 Representative Mike Ross, Democrat of Arkansas, wants to reduce or eliminate the disparities in what Medicare pays for health services in rural areas versus urban centers, a gap that he says has forced hospitals to close and doctors to move away. 
 Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, worries about requiring employers to provide insurance to workers. Without categorically rejecting the idea, she said: ''My inclination is to oppose an employer mandate. Employers want to provide health insurance and do so if they can afford it.'' 
 Many of the centrists said they shared the same concerns: that the legislation proposed so far is too expensive; does not sufficiently reduce health care costs over the long term; and would raise taxes too much, or in ways they oppose. 
 If there is one thing centrists in the House and the Senate agree on, it is that they are being pushed way too fast to act on a hugely complex bill with an astronomical price tag of roughly $1 trillion over 10 years, prompting a loud chorus of demands to slow down. 
 But aside from taking more time, and missing President Obama's deadline of having each chamber pass a health care bill before the August recess -- a goal that seems impossible to meet -- getting to ''yes'' will require an artful set of compromises. 
 In many cases, the concerns of centrist lawmakers reflect conflicting goals: to expand health coverage to nearly all Americans while reducing the growth of health spending, cutting the cost of the bill and minimizing new taxes. 
 In the House, a group of seven Democrats who are members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition have stalled the proceedings of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the last of three House panels needed to approve the bill. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Wednesday that she shared some of the group's concerns but also said, ''I have no question that we have the votes on the floor of the House to pass this legislation'' -- a remark that some took as a threat to barrel ahead. 
 ''Why are we rushing it?'' asked Mr. Melancon, a Blue Dog on the Energy and Commerce Committee. ''Let's get it right.'' 
 And he effectively dared House leaders to press ahead without fully addressing his group's concerns, noting that the Blue Dogs potentially had enough votes in Energy and Commerce to stall the bill and that leaders would have to resort to pressure tactics.
 ''We're going to need some orthopedists around here to take care of the broken bones and twisted arms,'' he said. 
 The best hope for a bipartisan compromise seems to lie with a small group of lawmakers in the Senate Finance Committee, which continued to meet on Wednesday. 
 The committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and a centrist with a long history of collaborating with Republicans, has resisted pressure from Senate leaders and the White House while insisting that a compromise is within reach. 
 Republicans on that committee, including Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are insisting that any new taxes to help pay for the legislation come from within the health care arena. They have expressed no interest in the income surtax, on high-earners, proposed by the House that would raise $544 billion over 10 years and instead are exploring a menu of smaller items including fees on private insurers. 
 Last week, a bipartisan group of senators, including two on the Finance Committee, sent a letter to the Senate leadership pleading for more time. A number of other senators have said they want the panel to continue working carefully toward a deal. 
 Ms. Collins, who joined Democrats in supporting the economic stimulus measure this year, said she had several big concerns about the House health care bill and a separate measure approved last week on a party-line vote by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
 She said that she was ''very skeptical'' of the new government health insurance plan that Democrats want to create, and that she was ''not a proponent of an employer mandate,'' which would require employers to provide health benefits to workers or pay a fee to the government.
 Instead, she said, ''I would like to encourage more employer coverage by giving generous tax credits to smaller businesses.'' 
 As for reaching a deal, Ms. Collins said, ''we have a long way to go.'' 
 The Senate Finance Committee has been working on a compromise idea that would create private nonprofit health insurance cooperatives instead of a government-run insurance plan to compete with private insurers in an effort to reduce costs. 
 Mr. Ross, of Arkansas, said the House Blue Dogs were open to considering the co-op idea and any number of other proposals that might reduce the cost of the legislation while still expanding insurance coverage to most Americans. 
 At a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, the Blue Dogs said, they won agreement from the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Representative Henry Waxman of California, to try to curtail Medicare spending by giving the executive branch new power to set annual payment rates for doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, based on recommendations from an independent advisory council. 
 Rates are now set by statutory formulas, and Congress is besieged by lobbyists pleading for bigger increases each year.
 But Mr. Ross said that addressing long-term costs was just one area of concern for the Blue Dogs. They also want to reduce or eliminate the disparity in Medicare payments that result in lower rates for health providers in rural areas. 
 Mr. Ross said his hometown, Prescott, now has three doctors -- down from six -- and that private insurers in Arkansas pay 30 percent more than Medicare, making doctors reluctant to accept new Medicare patients.

HEADLINE: Can Ulta Muss Up Sephora's Makeup?

BYLINE: By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS

 BODY:
A NEW boyfriend has a way of putting into stark relief the pros and cons of a predecessor. Until recently, Alessandra Salvatore, 27, happily made a beeline to the nearest Sephora when she craved an $18 lip plumper or her favorite scent, Giorgio Armani's Emporio She. 
 But because Sephora with its Parisian pedigree doesn't sell drugstore makeup, Ms. Salvatore required another stop to grab a $7.29 Maybelline Full N' Soft mascara. That was before she moved from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., to Charlotte, N.C., and discovered Ulta, a national chain of beauty stores that brings together designer fragrances, drugstore staples, salon-only hair products, as well as a growing selection of prestige cosmetics like Benefit and Smashbox.
 ''When you walk in, it was really clean and easy on the eye,'' said Ms. Salvatore, an administrative assistant at a health care company. Cavernous enough for 21,000 products and cut-and-color hair salons, Ulta stores are often in strip malls, a convenience she appreciates. ''I like that you pull right up and boom there's Ulta,'' she said. 
 Sephora may have pioneered the concept of glitzy stores as playgrounds where women could dab and smear prestige lipsticks and face creams. No longer was a salesclerk a gatekeeper to the makeup, nor a cheerleader for the single brand that paid her commission. Instead, roving experts helped as needed. 
 Now Ulta, with 331 stores nationwide, is trying to go Sephora one better. It offers inexpensive beauty staples found at the likes of Target, along with easy access to prestige treats that used to be trapped behind glass. There are also hair salons in each Ulta store and stylists to help navigate the rows of professional hair products. 
 Lyn P. Kirby, Ulta's chief executive, likes to call the company a ''category killer,'' as if she wants to tear down the walls segregating L'Oreal in pharmacies from high-end skin care in department stores and beauty chains. 
 Only recently has Ulta wrangled enough prestige cosmetics to give a beauty powerhouse like Sephora, with more than 230 freestanding stores in the United States, a run for its clientele, said consumers and retail analysts. 
 ''They have a critical mass of prestige brands,'' said Liz Dunn, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, adding: ''Part of the off-mall appeal is convenience. They're trying to target the time-starved woman who wants an easy shopping experience.'' Critics say Ulta is hardly within Sephora's universe. Until Ulta stores offer beloved standards like Clinique Dramatically Different lotion and more adventurous niche makeup brands, they say, it cannot be considered one-stop shopping.
 Even in this rocky economy, Ulta, which used to be a discount retailer with a schlocky look, has added sleek stores at a clip. It opened 65 stores in 2008, including its first urban locations, a four-floor showpiece in Chicago and a behemoth in Miami.
 Although luxury brands can be leery of being sold under the same roof as, say, CoverGirl, Ulta is having some success luring them. Lorac, a fresh-off-the-red-carpet cosmetics line created by the makeup artist Carol Shaw, has been in Sephora, which got its start in Europe, since there were few outposts in the United States. By contrast, Lorac arrived at Ulta in 2008.
 When Ulta came courting, David Hirsch, part of the senior management team at Lorac, said they worried about ''downmarketing'' the brand. But he soon grew convinced that women don't enjoy their high-end splurges any less just because Maybelline is sold a section over. ''It's sort of like a Baskin-Robbins,'' he said. ''There's nonfat yogurt but there's the good stuff, too.''
 For some, convenience is paramount. ''When my wife walked into Ulta for the first time, she thought, 'I can knock off a couple of things here,' which you can't do at Sephora.''
 It didn't hurt that Sephora has also opened 140 shops within J. C. Penney stores, where Lorac is doing well. That venture had expanded Lorac's reach, not cannibalized existing revenue, Mr. Hirsch said. 
 Many beauty shoppers are fickle when it comes to store allegiance, said Karen Grant, the vice president for beauty at NPD, a market research firm. The two chains go head to head among 25- to 34-year-olds, 29 percent of whom shop at Ulta, 30 percent at Sephora, according to NPD research. Meanwhile, Ulta has an edge with women older than 44, who ''tend to be more loyal,'' Ms. Grant said, because ''Ulta rewards that loyalty'' with savings. 
 After landing a deal on a curling iron, Emily Veitia, a program assistant at Florida International University, wrote a customer review on Yelp.com: ''Ulta, you are Sephora's nemesis!'' 
 But in a telephone interview, Ms. Veitia lamented that Ulta ''felt a little bit like a beauty supply store.'' She would rather ''save up some money and go to Sephora'' she said, because ''it's more on top of the times.'' Some of Sephora's niche brands include Living Proof No Frizz hair care, Tarte cosmetics, Make Up For Ever and Josie Maran, according to Allison Slater, the vice president of retail marketing. None of which Ulta carries.
 Ms. Kirby wouldn't say which prestige cosmetic lines she hopes to bring to Ulta, but she wrote in an e-mail message that customers clamor for Nars and Bobbi Brown. 
 Ulta's personality is best described as ''approachable and in style,'' Ms. Kirby said in an interview. ''We are not about intimidating. Sephora's black and white isn't approachable.'' 
 The peachy color of Ulta's awnings and bags is an expression of that sentiment. The company had considered pink, but went with a hue that Ms. Kirby calls ''Persian melon'' for its vibrancy and curbside pop. 
 Annie Vazquez, a freelance journalist in Miami, likes that she can get two of her Matrix Biolage color care shampoos for $20 at Ulta, whereas elsewhere she has paid $25 a bottle. She is not yet ready to make the store her one-stop beauty destination, not until it carries the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer she can't go without.
 For now, her allegiances are divided. ''Sephora, it's not that it's pretentious or anything like that,'' she said, ''but Ulta is more down to earth, and sometimes when you're on the go, and we all are, you just want to get there, get what you need, and go.''

HEADLINE: Marijuana Supporters Welcome a Tax Increase

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif. 

 BODY:
Perhaps only in the sometimes hazy world of medical marijuana could higher taxes be considered good news. 
 But sure enough, supporters of medical marijuana were pleasantly pleased Wednesday after Oakland voters overwhelmingly approved a huge tax increase -- 15 times the former rate -- on sales at the city's handful of permitted medical marijuana dispensaries. 
 Believed to be the first of its kind, Measure F received nearly 80 percent of the vote, a landslide that pot professionals hailed as a significant step in the legitimization of the cannabis industry. 
 ''It's one more victory in a big war,'' said Richard Lee, president of Oaksterdam University, a downtown storefront where the aroma of marijuana pervades the sidewalk. ''It's a lot better than being arrested and thrown in jail.'' 
 Medical marijuana has been legal in California since 1996, but its dispensaries and their proprietors have periodically faced crackdowns from federal authorities who do not recognize the state law, which was passed as Proposition 215. Supporters of the drug's medical use have been cheered, however, by recent remarks from Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. that those abiding by state law will not be made a target by federal agents. 
 California, whose $26 billion budget crisis has dispirited many residents, has toyed with the idea of legalizing marijuana, with a bill that would legalize and tax the drug scheduled to be taken up by the Assembly later this year. The dispensaries already pay some $18 million a year in state sales tax, according to the Board of Equalization. 
 Laura Thomas, deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance in San Francisco, which lobbies for changes in drug policy, said the recession was forcing many states to consider ''untouchable topics'' as potential revenue streams. ''In hard budget times people are willing to be more creative,'' Ms. Thomas said. 
 In Oakland, Measure F raises the tax on ''gross receipts'' at a handful of dispensaries to $18 per $1,000 worth of goods sold, and is expected to raise about $300,000 in new taxes. That is not much money -- the city just closed an $83 million budget gap -- but even so, a spokesman for Mayor Ron Dellums said the mayor was grateful for ''all measures that will help with our budget situation.'' 
 For Mr. Lee, who plans to introduce a ballot measure this week -- with an eye toward getting it on the ballot in 2010 -- seeking to legalize personal, nonmedical use of the drug, the election victory means he would pay about $42,000 more in taxes. Not that he minds. 
 ''This tax,'' he said, ''is a lot cheaper than lawyers.''

HEADLINE: Amazon Expands With Deal For Zappos

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Amazon.com is trying the shoe retailer Zappos.com on for size.
 The companies announced on Wednesday that Amazon was acquiring Zappos, based in Henderson, Nev., for 10 million shares of Amazon stock, worth nearly $900 million at its current level.
 Amazon also said it would give Zappos employees an additional $40 million in cash and stock. 
 The acquisition is the largest in Amazon's history.
 Online shoe sales hit $4.3 billion last year, up from $3.3 billion in 2007, according to Forrester Research. 
 Zappos, a private company founded 10 years ago, has won fans with perks like free shipping and personalized service. It is the largest player in that market.
 Amazon has tried without much success to burnish its shoe offerings in the face of competition from Zappos. In 2007, it introduced a separate site, Endless.com, to sell shoes and handbags. But while Zappos received 4.5 million visitors in June, Endless.com got 777,000, according to comScore. 
 Amazon also sells shoes on its main site and allows outside retailers to sell them there as well.
 ''I don't think Amazon has gotten much traction'' with Endless, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester. ''People will go to Amazon to purchase a lot of their core media products and consumer electronics. But it is not thought of in the same light when shopping for apparel, accessories and footwear.''
 Zappos, Ms. Mulpuru said, ''is one of the few sites out there that people think of first when they think of footwear.''
 The companies said that the management team of Zappos would remain intact and that Zappos would continue to operate as an independent division of Amazon from its offices outside Las Vegas. Zappos, whose backers include the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, also said it planned to maintain its shipping facility in Louisville, Ky.
 The companies had held conversations about a deal over the years, but they took on a serious tone a couple of months ago, a person briefed on the matter said. Amazon initially sought to pay cash, but Zappos asked for an all-stock deal, this person said.
 The extra cash and restricted stock for employees is meant to keep them on board and preserve the company's culture, the person said. The deal is expected to close in the fall.
 On the Zappos blog on Wednesday, Tony Hsieh, Zappos' chief executive, said that the decision to accept Amazon's offer was a difficult one. This was in part because Amazon focuses on low prices and convenience, while Zappos has carved out a favorable reputation among consumers for personalized service, free overnight shipping and a policy allowing buyers to return any pair of shoes free.
 ''We plan to continue to run Zappos the way we have always run Zappos -- continuing to do what we believe is best for our brand, our culture and our business,'' Mr. Hsieh wrote.
 Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said in a video clip about the deal that Zappos ''has a customer obsession, which is so easy for me to admire.'' 
 He added, ''I get all weak-kneed when I see a customer-obsessed company.''
 Zappos appears to engender friendly feelings even among some of its smaller competitors.
 Korey Buzzell, who runs the independent site Shoe-Store.net, said Zappos had been an amicable competitor in the past, sending customers to his site when it could not fulfill their orders. 
 ''They have sent a lot of business our way over the years, and in return I myself refer people to Zappos if I can't help them,'' he said. ''Amazon is different. I don't use Amazon that much for shoes, in fact I try to avoid them. I hope Zappos doesn't change with an acquisition like this.''
 Amazon was advised in the deal by Lazard, and Zappos by Morgan Stanley.

HEADLINE: For New Leader of the Arts Endowment, Lessons From a Shaky Past

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN and JO CRAVEN McGINTY

 BODY:
Although it may be hard to remember now, there was a time when the National Endowment for the Arts seemed to be on solid footing, both financially and politically, and could spend its days quietly financing artists and arts groups at its discretion. 
 Then came the controversies -- Robert Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs, Karen Finley's chocolate-smeared performance pieces, Andres Serrano's urine-immersed crucifix and others -- and from the late 1980s onward, the endowment seemed to be constantly under siege. 
 After the Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, it was only a matter of time -- just about a year -- before the N.E.A.'s overall budget was cut by 40 percent, to $99.5 million for 1996, from $162.3 million, and its ability to finance potentially divisive artists (with the exception of some literary writers) was eliminated. For a while there, it seemed as if the agency might not survive. 
 But it did, thanks partly to the efforts of successive leaders, partly to the gradual fading of the culture wars from public consciousness. And now, as the N.E.A.'s chairman-designate, Rocco Landesman, awaits his confirmation (his proposed nomination is expected to be approved before the Congressional recess in August), he looks likely to start the job on firmer ground than any of his recent predecessors. 
 In June a House subcommittee approved a $170 million budget for the endowment for next year, an increase of $15 million from the current budget and $9 million more than President Obama, widely considered an avid arts supporter, had requested. (The president, however, did supplement this year's budget with $50 million in stimulus money, which the N.E.A. has been distributing to state arts agencies and local organizations.)
 Certainly the economy, and the growing public anxiety about the deficit, may yet put a damper on arts financing. But political goodwill toward the endowment is clearly on the rise, and many in the arts world are wondering if Mr. Landesman will be able to lead it, finally, into a new era -- and, if he does, in what direction he will take it. 
 Mr. Landesman isn't talking, pending his confirmation. Still, as a Broadway producer, he has a reputation for being direct, irreverent and occasionally confrontational, which has led many people to expect a shake-up of the endowment and a more aggressive management style. 
 Bill Ivey and Dana Gioia, the endowment chairmen who served through most of the years after the deep cutbacks of 1996, worked hard to make the most of the depleted agency they inherited, spending much of their time and energy trying to rebuild the N.E.A.'s prestige and credibility with Congress. Even if Mr. Landesman hopes to strike out on a new path, say, by pushing to restore grants to individual artists -- something many people in the arts considered ''the heart and soul of the endowment,'' as the painter Chuck Close put it in an interview -- he may find himself looking to the tenures of Mr. Gioia and Mr. Ivey. 
 As interviews with the former chairmen and others familiar with the endowment show, along with an analysis of N.E.A. grant patterns, the two men often found creative, if not always universally admired, ways to push their agendas forward in the face of institutional constraints.
 In some cases they did this by identifying and honing in on areas of potential spending that were less likely to raise Congressional hackles. During Mr. Ivey's tenure, from 1998 to 2001, for instance, spending on design grants increased by more than 130 percent, even if the chairman -- an academic whom President Bill Clinton hired away from the directorship of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville -- was not himself a design hound. 
 ''I'm a folklorist and came into the chairmanship with an interest in the folk arts, but, while folk arts funding was certainly maintained during my tenure, I did not feel free to indulge my enthusiasm by pumping up that part of the endowment's work,'' Mr. Ivey said. ''We were still playing defense under the gaze of a critical and watchful Republican Congress, so we were very careful with both the reality and appearance of how money was spent.''
 And in 2003 the first of Mr. Gioia's six years as chairman, spending on arts-education grants increased by 49 percent. Although there were reductions in later years, that increase helped arts education dominate grants financing from 2003 to 2005. (Only N.E.A. ''partnerships,'' through which state arts agencies and regional arts organizations distribute funds, received more money; these arrangements typically account for about 40 percent of the money the endowment awards.) 
 The United States has ''dismantled the arts-education programs that used to be part of every public school,'' Mr. Gioia said. ''The N.E.A. is uniquely positioned to provide leadership in this.''
 For Mr. Gioia, arts education was central to his vision for redeeming the endowment. 
 ''Part of our mission as a public agency was to address the public,'' he said, adding that he saw changing perceptions of the agency -- through public outreach and his frequent meetings with members of Congress -- as an important part of his mandate as chairman. 
 Mr. Gioia is proud, he said, of having ''defined the N.E.A. as an agency which brought the best of art and arts education to all Americans.''
 In much the same spirit, Mr. Gioia also established crowd-pleasing programs, like the Big Read, through which people read and discuss a single book in their communities; Operation Homecoming, in which active-duty troops and veterans write about their wartime experiences; and Shakespeare in American Communities, which sends traveling professional Shakespeare productions around the country and bills itself as ''the largest tour of Shakespeare in American history.''
 Some arts professionals argue that these programs -- known as National Initiatives -- have absorbed too great a proportion of endowment funds. The Big Read, for example, cost about $9 million over the last two years.
 ''There were definitely concerns that by building special initiatives of that size, you were limiting the agency's ability to do the routine work of supporting other organizations,'' Mr. Ivey said, adding that the Big Read seemed to him more like ''a humanities project and less like an art project.''
 Robert L. Lynch, president of Americans for the Arts, a lobbying group, said Mr. Gioia's effort to create a better image for the agency through these initiatives was ''a good thing but not necessarily a long-term strategy.''
 ''The emphasis needs to be using the leverage power of a tiny amount of money so that more things get funded in more places by people themselves,'' Mr. Lynch added, articulating a widely held view of how N.E.A. financing works best. The fiscal impact of the endowment's small budget has always been magnified by its outsize cultural influence, the thinking goes; the stamp of approval conferred by even a paltry N.E.A. grant can provide an arts organization with a powerful fund-raising tool.
 ''Much of what I did was try to explain to the country why they needed artists,'' Mr. Gioia said, pointing out that for fiscal year 2008 he secured the largest increase for the endowment's overall budget -- $20.1 million, raising the budget to nearly $145 million -- in 28 years. ''That would not have happened had Congress not been convinced of the agency's ability to spend the money productively,'' he said. 
 The question that probably most preoccupies people in the arts is whether Mr. Landesman will succeed in securing more money for the endowment -- its budget still pales in comparison with those of other federal agencies -- and if he will try to restore the N.E.A.'s ability to make grants to individual artists. Although he declined to comment on his plans for the agency, Politico.com reported this month that Mr. Landesman had expressed an interest in reinstating those grants.
 Representative Norman D. Dicks, Democrat of Washington, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, which oversees the N.E.A., said he was open to discussing it. ''We're willing to entertain that idea,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''There is some risk here, and that's what we want to evaluate.'' 
 Some say that it is unlikely that the grants will be revived, because they require the N.E.A. to approve art before knowing its content. ''I don't know if we're at a point where the political process can withstand the vicissitudes of contemporary art,'' Mr. Ivey said. ''It does expose the agency more than any other single activity.''
 On the other hand, he continued, ''I think it's much closer to being brought back'' -- and he said he believes it should be. The grants would represent ''a kind of signature investment by the federal government in the vitality of the nation's cultural life,'' Mr. Ivey said. ''The American people should have the nerve to invest in the work of individual artists.'' 
 At the very least, cultural professionals say they are hopeful about a growing potential for art to be taken seriously as part of the national identity, rather than disparaged as an elitist, effete enterprise unworthy of federal support. ''I hope that time is over, the period when artist have been held as suspicious by the politicians,'' said Michael Conforti, president of the Association of Art Museum Directors.
 ''Anybody interested in the arts has to be so thankful that, whatever did or didn't happen, the N.E.A. didn't go away,'' he added. ''If it had gone away, it would be very difficult to reconstitute.''

HEADLINE: Study Finds Record Number of Inmates Serving Life

BYLINE: By SOLOMON MOORE

DATELINE: CORONA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Mary Thompson, an inmate at the California Institution for Women here, was convicted of two felonies for a robbery spree in which she threatened victims with a knife. Her third felony under California's three-strikes law was the theft of three tracksuits to pay for her crack cocaine habit in 1982. 
 Like one out of five prisoners in California, and nearly 10 percent of all prisoners nationally in 2008, Ms. Thompson is serving a life sentence. She will be eligible for parole by 2020. 
 More prisoners today are serving life terms than ever before -- 140,610 out of 2.3 million inmates being held in jails and prisons across the country -- under tough mandatory minimum-sentencing laws and the declining use of parole for eligible convicts, according to a report released Wednesday by the Sentencing Project, a group that calls for the elimination of life sentences without parole. The report tracks the increase in life sentences from 1984, when the number of inmates serving life terms was 34,000.
 Two-thirds of prisoners serving life sentences are Latino or black, the report found. In New York State, for example, 16.3 percent of prisoners serving life terms are white. 
 Although most people serving life terms were convicted of violent crimes, sentencing experts say there are many exceptions, like Norman Williams, 46, who served 13 years of a life sentence for stealing a floor jack out of a tow truck, a crime that was his third strike. He was released from Folsom State Prison in California in April after appealing his conviction on the grounds of insufficient counsel.
 The rising number of inmates serving life terms is straining corrections budgets at a time when financially strapped states are struggling to cut costs. California's prison system, the nation's largest, with 170,000 inmates, also had the highest number of prisoners with life sentences, 34,164, or triple the number in 1992, the report found. 
 In four other states -- Alabama, Massachusetts, Nevada and New York -- at least one in six prisoners is serving a life term, according to the report.
 The California prison system is in federal receivership for overcrowding and failing to provide adequate medical care to prisoners, many of whom are elderly and serving life terms.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger this week repeated his proposal to reduce the inmate population through a combination of early releases for nonviolent offenders, home monitoring for some parole violators and more lenient sentencing for some felonies. But there are no credible plans to increase the rate at which prisoners serving life sentences are granted parole.
 ''When California courts sentence somebody to life with parole, it turns out that's not possible after all,'' said Joan Petersilia, a Stanford law professor and an expert on parole policy. ''Board of parole hearings almost never grant releases, and that's the reason that California's lifer population has grown out of proportion to other states.''
 Margo Johnson, 48, also an inmate at the women's prison here, has served 24 years of a life sentence for a 1984 murder. She has been recommended for release four times by the state parole board, but she said that Mr. Schwarzenegger had rejected the board's recommendation each time.
 ''Sometimes I wonder, is it just a game they're playing with me?'' Ms. Johnson said.
 Seven prison systems -- Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and the federal penitentiary system -- do not offer the possibility of parole to prisoners serving life terms. 
 That policy also extends to juveniles in Illinois, Louisiana and Pennsylvania. A total of 6,807 juveniles were serving life terms in 2008, 1,755 without the possibility of parole. California again led the nation in the number of juveniles serving life terms, with 2,623.
 ''The expansion of life sentences suggests that we're rapidly losing faith in the rehabilitation model,'' said Ashley Nellis, the report's main author.
 De Angelo McVay, 42, is serving a life term with no possibility of parole at the maximum security state prison in Lancaster, Calif., for his role in the kidnapping and torture of a man.
 He said in an interview Wednesday that he had used his 10 years in prison to reform himself, taking ministry classes, participating in the prison chapel program, becoming vice chairman of his prison yard and avoiding behavioral demerits.
 ''I'm remorseful for what I did,'' he said. ''But I got no chance at parole, and I know guys who have committed killings and they have parole.''
 Supporters of longer sentences for criminals, including victims rights organizations, prosecutors and police associations, often cite public safety, the deterrent effect of punishment and the need to remove criminals from society.
 But the number of aging inmates serving life sentences has risen sharply as the sluggish economy has shrunk state budgets. By 2004, the number of inmates over 50 had nearly doubled from a decade earlier, to more than 20 percent, according to the report. Older inmates cost more because they have more health needs. California, for example, spends $98,000 to $138,000 a year on each prisoner over 50, compared with the national average of about $35,000 a year.
 But Professor Petersilia said she was skeptical that economic arguments alone would persuade voters to treat inmates serving life terms -- most of whom have committed violent felonies like murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery -- with more leniency.
 ''All the public opinion polls say that everybody will reconsider sentencing for nonviolent offenders or drug offenders, but they're not willing to do anything different for violent offenders,'' Professor Petersilia. In fact, she added, polls show support for even harsher sentences for sex offenses and other violent crimes.
 Burk Foster, a criminal justice professor at Saginaw Valley State University in Michigan and an expert on the Louisiana penitentiary system, said the expansion of life sentences started at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, the nation's largest maximum penitentiary, in the early 1970s, when most people sentenced to life terms were paroled after they had been deemed fit to re-enter society.
 ''Angola was a prototype of a lifer's prison,'' said Professor Foster. ''In 1973, Louisiana changed its life sentencing law so that lifers would no longer be parole eligible, and they applied that law more broadly over time to include murder, rape, kidnapping, distribution of narcotics and habitual offenders.'' 
 Professor Foster said sentencing more prisoners to life sentences was an abandonment of the ''corrective'' function of prisons. 
 ''Rehabilitation is not an issue at Angola,'' he said. ''They're just practicing lifetime isolation and incapacitation.''

HEADLINE: Regional Banks' Profits Are Hurt by Loan Losses

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Some of the biggest names in American banking are finally on the mend. But across the nation, many small and midsize lenders are still struggling -- and bracing for even more bad news. 
 A spate of quarterly results from regional banks this week is painting a sobering portrait of the potential pitfalls ahead. 
 KeyCorp of Cleveland said Wednesday that it was girding for losses on commercial real estate loans. At SunTrust Banks, based in Atlanta, the big worry was residential real estate loans. And at Wells Fargo, the giant lender in San Francisco, rapidly souring home mortgages cast a shadow over otherwise robust profits. 
 ''There is no doubt that the challenges are clearly not behind us,'' said C. Dowd Ritter, the chief executive of Regions Financial in Alabama, which on Tuesday reported a $188 million loss for the second quarter. 
 It is just another tough week in a tough year for the regional banks, and more downbeat news is expected on Thursday, when several others, including Fifth-Third Bancorp of Ohio, report their latest results. 
 The problems underscore the widening gap between huge banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which have bounced back with hefty profits in investment banking and trading, and regional banks that rely on more traditional transactions like accepting deposits and making loans.
 ''They don't have the diversity,'' said Kathy Boyle, the president of Chapin Hill Advisors in New York. ''They don't have a place to hide.''
 And the problems are expected to worsen as one of the industry's biggest troubles -- commercial real estate loans -- continue to sour.
 KeyCorp reported a $226 million net loss for the second quarter as it built up reserves to cover bad loans, particularly in commercial real estate. SunTrust lost $184 million during the period. 
 At Wells Fargo, worries about future loan losses stained news of record profits -- $3.17 billion -- for the period. The bank said borrowers had stopped making payments on $18.3 billion of loans, a jump of 45 percent from the first quarter. Losses from uncollectible loans increased by a third in the second quarter, to $4.4 billion, from the prior quarter.
 Despite the mostly bleak news, some analysts found signs of hope. Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners, said many regional banks showed strong deposit growth, a better financing mix and improving net interest margins. While loan portfolios from the Midwest and West show signs of stabilizing, she said construction-related loans in the Southeast were deteriorating faster than she had expected.
 Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, said several regional banks reported that early stage delinquencies -- payments that are 30 to 89 days late -- were slowing, suggesting that consumer loan losses could decline in coming months. Given that, buying some regional banks stocks makes sense, he said. Shares of SunTrust and KeyCorp leapt on Wednesday, even as Wells Fargo's share price fell. 
 ''People believe we are at the cusp in the turn in the cycle,'' Mr. Bove said. 
 Not everyone agrees. Ms. Boyle, of Chapin Hill, worries regional banks are particularly susceptible as losses accelerate in commercial real estate. ''Everybody is looking for hope right now,'' she said. ''We are still very much in the bear camp.''
 At Comerica bank, based in Dallas, executives attributed a big drop in quarterly profits to running problems with residential real estate development.
 ''We have seen signs of stabilization in the residential real estate portfolio in California,'' Ralph W. Babb Jr., Comerica's chief executive, said in a call with investors. The bank's home market of Texas was holding up relatively well, he said, but the recession has taken a toll in other markets, like Florida, he said. 
 ''I think with the real estate piece clearly, the fall off in values has been more significant than anyone would have anticipated,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Buying a Train Ticket, and Being Taken for a $23 Quadrillion Ride

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NORTH SALEM, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 Lydia Alcock doesn't seem like the kind of kid who would run up a $23 quadrillion bill on her Visa Buxx card.
 She is a seemingly responsible sophomore at Johns Hopkins University interested in psychology and museum studies. Typical charges to her card include $5.26 for pizza, $21.15 for flip-flops with her sorority's Greek letters on them and $1.47 for raspberry iced tea. Her father got her the card when she was 13 so that Lydia could learn to be responsible about money; a grandmother trained at the London School of Economics is something of an obsessive about frugality.
 And, yet, when Ms. Alcock clicked on her account earlier this month, there it was: $23,148,855,308,184,500. Plus a $20 negative balance fee from Wachovia Bank, which under the circumstances, seemed pretty reasonable. 
 But wait. It turns out this was not for a splurge on iPods, iTunes, iPhones, Juicy Couture or the gross world product, but for a single train ride (off-peak!) on Metro-North Railroad from Grand Central to Goldens Bridge. The usual cost is $10.
 Ms. Alcock looked. She looked again. She gasped. She laughed. She shouted to her father: ''Dad, you need to come here. Right now.'' And then after realizing, to her chagrin, that she owed the staggering sum, not that she was the recipient of a tidy little windfall, she typed into Google: ''How to say really big numbers,'' and cut and pasted $23,148,855,308,184,500. It read: ''twenty-three quadrillion, one hundred forty-eight trillion, eight hundred fifty-five billion, three hundred eight million, one hundred eighty-four thousand, five hundred dollars.''
 In the end, phew, Ms. Alcock will not have to spend the rest of her life chipping away at the bill. Instead she joins more than 12,000 Visa customers (or ''fewer than 13,000'' as the company puts it) who for a day seemed to be the biggest debtors in world history.
 Ms. Alcock, 18, discovered the problem when she returned from a trip to Baltimore and got an e-mail notice that she had overdrawn her account, something she had never done before. She worried that someone had obtained her card number until she went to her account and realized that $23 quadrillion was probably beyond even the most energetic credit card thief.
 Her father, Martin, who runs Naked Earth, a company that sells environmentally friendly products like vegan cheese and fallen palm leaves used as plates, called Wachovia. And after waiting on hold for a half-hour, he got the word that, yes, there had been some kind of error that was being corrected. The next day, the $20 fee was still there, but then that disappeared too.
 Visa said there had been ''a temporary programming error'' during a regularly scheduled systems upgrade that caused some transactions on prepaid cards to be inaccurately posted. ''No one was actually charged $23 quadrillion,'' a spokeswoman, Elvira Swanson, said reassuringly. The company said the ''technical glitch'' had no financial impact on Visa cardholders.
 Victims have popped up on the Internet or in news stories, including Josh Muszynski, 22, of Manchester, N.H., who ran up his bill buying Camel cigarettes at a Mobil station. Others include a diner at Applebee's and a shopper at CVS. ''My lectures about financial responsibility appear to have failed: yesterday she charged $23,148,855,308,184,500.00 at the drugstore,'' went one online post. ''Well, at least she wasn't texting. Those charges really add up,'' added another. ''I always said when they started charging $23 quadrillion a pack, I'd quit,'' read a third.
 It was perhaps unfortunate that some of those affected used the Visa Buxx card, which is pitched as ''the ultimate tool for teaching your teen financial responsibility with peace of mind.'' But Ms. Alcock said the incident was a helpful reminder about the importance of checking those statements -- chances are not every error is as conspicuous as a $23 quadrillion train ride. Her father said he was a bit disappointed that the bank never apologized or explained what happened, perhaps figuring the relief of not being $23 quadrillion in the red was balm enough. 
 The story, a perfect silly-season summer news story, got surprisingly little traction in the news universe. This could be a reflection of how hard it is to compete in the cavalcade of Michael Jackson/Sarah Palin/Randy Republican/man-on-the-moon news events.
 Or maybe, given all the billion- and even trillion-dollar figures being thrown around for bailouts and economic dislocation and the rest, a quadrillion just isn't what it used to be. That would be a shame. After all, updated for inflation, the old saying is still true: a quadrillion here and a quadrillion there and pretty soon you're talking real money.

HEADLINE: Iraq Premier And Obama Emphasize The Positive

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama welcomed Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to the White House on Wednesday and said that despite occasional differences between the two nations' military forces, the United States was on track for withdrawing combat forces from Iraq by the end of August 2010.
 ''The United States and Iraq have known difficult times together,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now, both of us agree that the bonds forged between Americans and Iraqis in war can pave the way for progress that can be forged in peace.'' 
 In a joint appearance in the Rose Garden, the two leaders sidestepped some of the recent conflicts over details of the withdrawal and security, and they presented a positive portrait of the evolving relationship between the United States and Iraq. Although Mr. Obama conceded there would be ''some tough days ahead,'' he said he remained confident that the Iraqi forces would ultimately be able to handle much of their own security so the United States could pull out its combat troops.
 The president also said he was committed to working with Iraq to persuade the United Nations to ease international sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The sanctions, which were imposed on Saddam Hussein's government, require Iraq to pay 5 percent of its oil revenue as war reparations.
 ''It would be a mistake for Iraq to continue to be burdened by the sins of a deposed dictator,'' Mr. Obama said, responding to a question from an Iraqi reporter.
 Mr. Maliki's visit to the White House for a series of meetings with Mr. Obama and other administration officials was the highlight of his weeklong trip to the United States. The two leaders met privately in the Oval Office, their first meeting since American forces turned over security in cities and towns to Iraqis on June 30.
 ''From working closely with the American forces and the multinational forces, our forces became highly capable,'' Mr. Maliki said, speaking through an interpreter. ''And they will continue to do their role and their part to provide the opportunity needed for reconstruction, rebuilding and developing Iraq.''
 For the White House, the private meeting with the prime minister was a rare public shift away from health care policy-making, which has dominated the president's week. Mr. Obama said the United States was eager to move beyond its military relationship with Iraq to encourage more business investment and stable diplomatic relations. Still, about 130,000 United States troops remain in the country.
 ''Violence continues to be down, and Iraqis are taking responsibility for their future,'' Mr. Obama said, standing beneath a broiling sun alongside Mr. Maliki. ''We have been very encouraged by the progress.''
 Mr. Maliki said Iraq needed to build upon a ''strategic relationship on the economic front.'' He said Iraq planned to convene an investment conference in October for companies eager to look for business opportunities in the country.
 ''Iraq has suffered a great deal from being marginalized, from the policies of sectarianism and from wars,'' Mr. Maliki said. ''We will work very hard not to allow any sectarian behavior and opportunity to flourish.''
 On his trip to Washington, the prime minister is also scheduled to meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressional leaders.

HEADLINE: Harry Potter Is Their Peter Pan

BYLINE: By DAVID BROWNE

 BODY:
AS anyone who has seen the box-office phenomenon ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' surely noticed, the movie's main characters have grown up. And so has its audience: many of those who are streaming to theaters are in their 20s. 
 The sixth film in the series was released almost a dozen years after the book that started it all: ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' 
 The generation that ignited Pottermania as preadolescent readers is approaching college graduation or entering the workplace, and they have kept alive this flame of their early adolescence. 
 Indie rock bands have sprung up inspired by their obsession, with names like Harry and the Potters, the Half Bloods, and Voldie and the Wiz Kidz, playing songs inspired by Potter lore.
 Last fall, teams from Princeton, Vassar, Boston University and a dozen other schools competed in the Quidditch World Cup, in which students play a real-life version of the soccer-like contact sport featured in the books and films. (They can't fly, but still compete with brooms between their legs.)
 The continuing pull of all things Potter is a testament to the franchise's enduring sway. But it also seems like something else: the advent of Generation Y nostalgia. 
 ''I associate 'Harry Potter' with my childhood,'' said Becca Cadoff, 21, a senior at Northwestern. ''I couldn't wait for the books to come out. We went to midnight parties at our bookstore in New Jersey.''
 Now, she said, her roommates have all the Potter films on DVD. ''It's a release from all the school work,'' she said.
 ACCORDING to a survey of 4,000 people who bought tickets to the new ''Potter'' movie through Fandango, the online ticket service, 45 percent were 18 to 30 years old, compared with 15 percent under 17. 
 Let the boomers have their 40th anniversary of Woodstock. Let Generation X commemorate the 15 years since Kurt Cobain shot himself. For Generation Y -- those born roughly between 1980 and 2003 -- it's the pop culture of the late '90s and early 2000s that makes them wistful.
 Pop music is cashing in this summer on the first glimmers of the trend. Acts that dominated the charts a decade ago but then disappeared are back. Eminem's comeback album, ''Relapse,'' has sold 1.2 million copies (an impressive figure in today's anemic music business), while three of the biggest bands of the period -- Blink-182, Limp Bizkit and Creed -- have each reunited for summer tours.
 Seth Matlins, chief marketing executive at Live Nation, the concert promoters, refers to those acts as ''classic rock for the next generation.''
 The top-grossing tour of the year so far is not Bruce Springsteen or AC/DC, but the Gen-Y icon Britney Spears, who has made $61 million to date on her first tour in five years.
 ''It could be her original fans coming back for a nostalgic return,'' said Gary Bongiovanni of Pollstar, which tracks concert sales. ''It's like the New Kids on the Block tour, which drew women in their late 20s revisiting their youth.''
 Another early warning sign is a sudden longing for a reunion of the cast of the high school sitcom ''Saved by the Bell,'' which went off the air in 1993 but was beloved by those in grade school at the time. Jimmy Fallon, on his talk show's Web site, has collected nearly 80,000 petitions to reunite the cast. 
 Just as it has been throughout their lives, the demographic clout of Gen Y (now ages 6 to 28) has strong appeal to marketers.
 ''Twenty to 30-year-olds are the epicenter'' of the concert industry, Mr. Matlins said.
 Even though nostalgia hits every generation, it seems awfully early for 28-year-olds to be looking back. One possible explanation, say authors who focus on generational identity, is the impact of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The political and economic climate of the late '90s had been as soothing as a Backstreet Boys ballad: no wars, unemployment as low as 4 percent, a $120 billion federal surplus. 
 Neil Howe, an author of several books on what he calls the Millennials (another term for Gen Y), draws a parallel between this nostalgic wave and the one boomers embraced with the film ''American Graffiti'' in 1973. That movie depicted the recent past, the early '60s, which seemed to have vanished forever.
 ''It's instant nostalgia before a huge change in the nation's mood,'' Mr. Howe said. '' 'American Graffiti' was nostalgia for the boomers for a world before everything changed after J.F.K.'s assassination.
 ''Millennials see the world before Sept. 11 as a period of innocence. Our biggest worry was the Y2K bug. That all seems a world away now.'' 
 Jeff Gordinier, the author of ''X Saves the World,'' a book last year that looked back at the early-90s formative years of Generation X, said, ''It shouldn't come as a surprise that Generation Y is burrowing into nostalgia in the middle of a severe recession.
 ''Nostalgia comforts people and the Millennials are probably craving comfort right now.'' 
 Jeff Taylor, a 24-year-old media analyst in Arlington, Va., agreed.
 ''Sept. 11 was a moment where our generation took a second to think,'' he said. ''We grew up quicker because of it.'' 
 Mr. Taylor, who was a sophomore in high school on that day, sees the appeal of the Blink-182 reunion tour (''part of Blink's allure was their carefree nature''), and he is personally nostalgic for portable CD players. ''Buying my first Discman was huge,'' he said, ''like getting an iPod for kids now.'' 
 Other older members of Gen Y expressed similar longing for late '90s popular culture like AOL buddy lists and compact discs -- the once-dominant music medium now in its declining years. 
 WHILE boomers or Gen Xers might have no idea what the phrase ''classic Nickelodeon'' implies, to anyone in his or her 20s, it means fondly remembered cable tween shows like ''All That'' and ''Clarissa Explains It All'' (whose star, Melissa Joan Hart, recently showed off her weight loss on the cover of People magazine).
 ''I had a huge crush on her,'' said Josh Meyer, a 28-year-old real estate agent in Portland, Ore. 
 Aaron Eisenberg, a 20-year-old theater major at Northwestern, fondly recalled his Austin Powers Halloween costume, the day he bought the Backstreet Boys' ''Millennium'' album, and how much funnier Adam Sandler was when he blew off steam in films like ''Happy Gilmore'' and ''The Waterboy.''
 ''He's not as angry as he used to be,'' Mr. Eisenberg said.
 And don't even bring up Blu-ray.
 ''I miss VHS tapes,'' he said. ''I can't find a way to watch any of my Power Rangers videos.''

HEADLINE: White House Official Links Health Care Plan to Fiscal Balance

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
A comprehensive overhaul of the health care system, eliminating inefficiencies and wasteful practices, will be crucial in correcting the nation's unsustainable fiscal excesses, the White House budget director said on Wednesday. The Obama administration is increasing its pressure on Congress to act before the August recess.
 Speaking before an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director, sought support for President Obama's health care agenda. The president has already expended considerable political capital to push through a $787 billion economic recovery package and, most recently, to eliminate additional money for the F-22 fighter jet program. 
 Mr. Orszag opened his talk by urging patience with the administration's stimulus spending plan. But he soon focused on health care, arguing that while overhauling the system would raise costs temporarily, the policies would ultimately become at least ''deficit neutral'' and help restore fiscal balance.
 The drive to overhaul the health care system is ''further along than it's been in decades, with an array of allies that was once unthinkable,'' Mr. Orszag said, dismissing news reports of rising political challenges on Capitol Hill. 
 ''If we fail to do more to move toward a high-value, low-cost health care system,'' he said, ''we will be on an unsustainable fiscal path, no matter what else we do.'' 
 But Mr. Orszag warned several times that the president would reject any bill that worsened the long-term fiscal situation, pledging that ''at worst, we are going to be deficit neutral and meet the moral imperative of covering more people.''
 Whether the president can push his health care initiatives through Congress now is seen as a critical measure of how well he has maintained political momentum. 
 Mr. Orszag's speech came hours before the president gave an extended prime-time news conference in Washington in which his health care agenda was a central theme. 
 In order to bring down long-term costs for health care, Mr. Orszag called for the creation of an independent commission that would measure the efficiency of specific medical providers and practices. 
 The existing problem of inflated costs, he said, was caused by a ''distinct lack of information about what works and what doesn't, producing huge variations in the quality and cost of care.''
 He cited cost and efficiency discrepancies between top-tier service providers in different parts of the country. Mr. Orszag said that during the last six months of life, Medicare patients at the New York University Langone Medical Center spent an average of 31 days in the hospital, while the average was 12 days at the Stanford Medical Center in California.
 ''East Coast versus the West Coast -- or East Side versus the West Side?'' he said. ''If anything, it seems that higher-cost hospitals and regions provide lower-quality care, not higher-quality care.''
 Mr. Orszag said that an Independent Medicare Advisory Commission, a panel of ''politically insulated'' health experts who would set Medicare reimbursement rates, could track advances in medical technology and promote efficiency.
 But Mr. Orszag conceded that the road ahead was long.
 ''We don't have enough knowledge to change from a fee-for-service to fee-for-value,'' he said. ''But moving more decisions into the hands of medical professionals and out of the political process will enable us to continually update the system.''
 At one point during the question-and-answer session, a man took the microphone to ask those in attendance whether they believed the benefits of a health care overhaul would outweigh the costs, and he drew a mixed response.
 Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia Business School and moderator of the event, quickly moved on to the next question.

HEADLINE: President Seeks Public's Support On Health Care

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and JEFF ZELENY; David M. Herszenhorn and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama tried on Wednesday to rally public support for overhauling the nation's health care system and said for the first time that he would be willing to help pay for the plan by raising income taxes on families earning more than $1 million a year.
 ''If I see a proposal that is primarily funded through taxing middle-class families, I'm going to be opposed to that,'' Mr. Obama said in a prime-time news conference in the East Room of the White House. A surcharge on the highest-income Americans, under consideration in the House, ''meets my principle,'' he said.
 On a day when the leader of fiscally conservative Democrats said a deal was a long way off and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted that she had the votes to push a bill through, Mr. Obama used the news conference to take his message over the heads of lawmakers and straight to the public. Conceding that ''folks are skeptical,'' he sought to convince Americans that overhauling the nation's health care system would benefit them and strengthen the economy. 
 ''If somebody told you that there is a plan out there that is guaranteed to double your health-care costs over the next 10 years,'' he said, ''that's guaranteed to result in more Americans losing their health care, and that is by far the biggest contributor to our federal deficit, I think most people would be opposed to that,''
 ''That's what we have right now,'' he said. ''So if we don't change, we can't expect a different result.''
 While Mr. Obama declared, ''it's my job, I'm the president,'' he did not use the appearance at the White House to make any fresh demands on Congress, which is struggling to meet his timetable for both chambers to pass legislation before members break for August recess. Mr. Obama did not repeat that demand Wednesday night.
 Instead, he sounded cerebral as he delved into policy specifics for nearly an hour and tried to link them to the concerns of ordinary Americans. 
 As he sought to reassure the public that a new health care system would be an improvement, he also acknowledged that there would be changes that could be unsettling, a point that is often raised by critics of overhauling the health care system.
 ''Can I guarantee that there are going to be no changes in the health-care delivery system? No,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The whole point of this is to try to encourage changes that work for the American people and make them healthier.''
 Health legislation is Mr. Obama's highest legislative priority, and his success or failure could shape the rest of his presidency. But while he is under increasing pressure from leading Democrats to delve more deeply into the negotiations by taking positions on specific policy issues, he largely resisted doing so Wednesday night.
 But the president did weigh in how the government might pay for the plan.
 In addition to saying he would be open to taxing those households earning more than $1 million -- a scaled-back version of an earlier proposal that would have imposed a surcharge on households earning $350,000 or more -- he signaled that he was also receptive to another idea under consideration in the Senate: taxing employer-provided health benefits, as long as the tax did not fall on the middle class.
 On Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats remained on track to reach a deal on major health care legislation. But she acknowledged that the process had slowed in response to concerns among conservative Democrats about the cost of the bill, and that some House Democrats were reluctant to embrace the income surtax on high-earners without knowing whether the Senate would go along.
 Indeed, even as Ms. Pelosi insisted that Congress was closer than ever to achieving a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's health care system, leaders of the Blue Dogs, a conservative faction of Democrats, said a deal was still a long way off. Asked if the House Energy and Commerce Committee could resume work on the bill by late Thursday, as House leaders hoped, Representative Charlie Melancon, a Blue Dog from Louisiana, said: ''No way.'' 
 A senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill said party leaders now believed it was essential for Mr. Obama to be more specific about what he wanted in a health care bill -- and not just exhort Congress to pass one.
 ''The president needs to step in more forcefully and start making some decisions,'' said the aide, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not want to be publicly identified as criticizing Mr. Obama. ''Everyone appreciates the fact that Obama has devoted so much time to health care. The bully pulpit is powerful. But in view of the deadlines Congress has missed, we would like to hear more from the president about what he wants in this bill.''
 While he faces pressures from fellow Democrats, Mr. Obama is also fending off attacks from Republicans who sense an opportunity to knock him off his stride by arguing that the health care bill, estimated as costing more than $1 trillion over the next decade, will not slow or reduce the growth of health spending. 
 The White House has been in a running debate this week with Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who predicted that health legislation would prove to be Mr. Obama's ''Waterloo moment'' and would break the president. To that, Mr. Obama said: ''This isn't about me. I have great health insurance, and so does every member of Congress.''
 In his opening remarks Wednesday night, Mr. Obama said he was aware that many Americans are asking, ''What's in this for me?'' But he also tried to appeal to the nation's conscience, casting the issue as a matter of urgency to families who are losing their life savings trying to pay for medical care and to businesses burdened by trying to provide coverage to their employees.
 Asked what the rush was to meet his August deadline for passage of House and Senate bills, Mr. Obama replied: ''I'm rushed because I get letters every day from families that are being clobbered by health care costs. They ask me, 'Can you help?' '' 
 In fact, there is another reason Mr. Obama is rushed: he knows time is not on his side. The more Congress delays passage of a health bill, the more time his Republican opponents will have to marshal their opposition and kill it.
 ''If you don't set deadlines in this town, things don't happen,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The default position is inertia.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Speaks of Shielding Mideast From a Nuclear Iran

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and DAVID E. SANGER; Mark Landler reported from Phuket, Thailand, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

DATELINE: PHUKET, Thailand 

 BODY:
Stiffening the American line against Iran, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Wednesday that the United States would consider extending a ''defense umbrella'' over the Middle East if the country continued to defy international demands that it halt work that could lead to nuclear weapons. 
 While such a defensive shield has long been assumed, administration officials in Washington acknowledged Wednesday that no senior official had ever publicly discussed it. Some of the officials said the timing of Mrs. Clinton's remarks reflected a growing sense that President Obama needed to signal to Tehran that its nuclear ambitions could be countered militarily, as well as diplomatically. 
 It also signified increasing concern in Washington that other Middle East states -- notably Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- might be tempted to pursue their own nuclear programs for fear Iran was growing closer to realizing its presumed nuclear ambitions.
 Mrs. Clinton later clarified her comments on Iran, delivered in advance of a regional meeting here, saying her warning that the United States might create such an umbrella did not represent any backing away from the Obama administration's position that it must prevent Tehran from obtaining a bomb capability. But her words suggested that the administration was developing a strategy should all efforts at negotiation fail.
 Her statement also came as Iran's internal divisions and crackdown on post-election protests have complicated Mr. Obama's pledge to ''engage'' Iran directly. Iranian officials have hinted that they will present new proposals on the nuclear program, and American officials have said their offers to negotiate stand. 
 Speaking during a televised town hall meeting in Bangkok, Mrs. Clinton said, ''We want Iran to calculate what I think is a fair assessment, that if the U.S. extends a defense umbrella over the region, if we do even more to support the military capacity of those in the gulf, it's unlikely that Iran will be any stronger or safer, because they won't be able to intimidate and dominate, as they apparently believe they can, once they have a nuclear weapon.''
 Asked about Mrs. Clinton's comments, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, the British ambassador to the United States, said, ''I don't think it should be read as an acceptance of an Iranian nuclear weapon'' but rather as a statement intended to ''reassure our partners in the gulf.'' 
 A senior White House official said he believed that Mrs. Clinton was speaking for herself and that she was, as she insisted, restating existing policy. 
 Mrs. Clinton's invocation of a defense umbrella is reminiscent of the so-called nuclear umbrella that Washington extends to its Asian allies: implicitly, the promise of an American reprisal if they are attacked by nuclear weapons. But she did not use the term nuclear, and a senior State Department official cautioned that her remarks should not be interpreted to mean that.
 After meeting the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, Mrs. Clinton also said that the United States would not offer new incentives to North Korea to return to negotiations. She said all of the other nations that had engaged in talks with North Korea in the past five years were united in demanding that North Korea undertake a ''complete and irreversible denuclearization'' before receiving any economic or political incentives from them. 
 She did not detail the steps that would be part of such a process, though she confirmed that they could include the disabling of the Yongbyon nuclear complex. Last year, North Korea began to dismantle that complex, where it runs a nuclear reactor and reprocess fuel rods to recover plutonium, but it vowed in June to restart production there. 
 The United States has had an uncharacteristically visible presence at this gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. It signed a friendship treaty with Asean's 10 members and called on one country, Myanmar, to release the imprisoned pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
 Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy, Dan Meridor, told Israeli Army radio: ''I was not thrilled to hear the American statement from yesterday that they will protect their allies with a nuclear umbrella, as if they have already come to terms with a nuclear Iran. I think that's a mistake.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton said she was trying to make even starker the choice Iran faced if it did not agree to abandon its program. 
 The administration has talked about bolstering the military capacity of Iran's neighbors in the Persian Gulf so they could better meet the threat of a heavily armed Iran. It has also defended the proposed missile defense system in Eastern Europe as a potential shield against Iran. 
 ''It faces the prospect, if it pursues nuclear weapons, of sparking an arms race in the region,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''That should affect the calculation of what Iran intends to do, and what it believes is in its national security interest.''
 On North Korea, Mrs. Clinton tried to project a united front, saying that China, Russia, Japan and South Korea had pledged to carry out the United Nations sanctions adopted in June against the North after its recent nuclear and missile tests. 
 Mrs. Clinton also reiterated concerns that North Korea might be transferring nuclear technology to Myanmar, which American officials refer to by its former name, Burma. She is to deliver a statement on North Korea on Thursday. In an excerpt provided to reporters, the tone remained unyielding, but the United States pledged to give North Korea ''significant economic and energy assistance'' if it undertook a verifiable denuclearization. 
 At the ministers meeting, Mrs. Clinton demanded that Myanmar release Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who could face years in prison on charges that she violated her house arrest. ''It's so critical that she be released from this persecution that she has been under,'' she said later at a news conference. ''If she were released, that would open up opportunities, at least for my country, to expand our relationship with Burma, including investments in Burma.''
 American officials met with diplomatic officials from Myanmar later to reiterate Mrs. Clinton's demand.

HEADLINE: More Cost Cuts Sought From Drug Industry

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
The pharmaceutical industry has remained relatively unscathed so far in Washington's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system. But it is too soon for drug makers to declare victory -- especially now that the cost of health care has become a central issue in the debate.
 Despite the much publicized 10-year, $80 billion cost-saving promise the drug industry made to President Obama and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee last month, some House leaders do not think the drug makers have given enough.
 And Mr. Obama seemed to agree Wednesday night in a nationally televised news conference focused on health care reform. He praised the pharmaceutical industry for making a hard commitment, but added, ''We might be able to get $100 billion out of them, or more.'' Mr. Obama offered no specific plans to increase the companies' contributions to health care savings. 
 Chief among the Congressional critics of the drug industry is Henry A. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is playing a lead role on the health overhaul.
 For starters, Mr. Waxman wants the drug industry to give up an additional $63 billion over the next decade. That would come by reversing a 2006 policy change that removed millions of low-income elderly from Medicaid drug coverage and had them pay higher prices for the same drugs under Medicare -- a move he has called a ''windfall for drug companies.''
 Billy Tauzin, head of the drug industry's main trade group, said that his members could not support that change. ''What Waxman is trying to do, you not only break the deal, you break the bank for us,'' said Mr. Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. 
 But Mr. Waxman said in an interview Wednesday night: ''I know they have a deal with the Senate, and I think they do have a deal with the White House, but I don't know how pinned down it all is. But they don't have a deal with us -- the House.''
 Mr. Waxman is also looking for a much tougher bargain with drug makers on another pivotal piece of the cost puzzle -- the effort to allow generic competition in so-called biologic drugs, which represent the most expensive and fastest growing part of the market. The drugs, many of them used against cancer, can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year. 
 As a trade-off for opening that market to generic competitors for the first time, the Senate health committee last week voted 16 to 7 to give the name-brand drug companies 12 years of exclusive marketing rights before a copycat biologic drug could go on the market. ''That was a huge vote,'' Mr. Tauzin said. 
 But Mr. Obama still wants to hold the line at seven years, his aides said Tuesday. And Mr. Waxman wants to offer the brand-name industry only five years of profit protection. 
 ''There's no justification for giving them monopoly pricing for their drugs for such a long period of time,'' he said.
 It is not remarkable that a top Democrat like Mr. Waxman would be taking a hard line against drug makers. After all, the pharmaceuticals industry has long been a target of attack by the Democrats who now rule Washington.
 What is more notable is that on many other issues in the health care debate, the drug industry seems to have staved off some of the measures it most feared. None of the legislative packages now favored by the Democratic leadership, for example, include long-simmering proposals to let Americans buy cheaper drugs from Canada. Nor is there a push to end the tax breaks for drug advertising that some critics say promote the unnecessary use of costly pills.
 And seemingly off the table is any talk of giving the federal government new powers to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry. 
 ''PhRMA's biggest worry is price negotiation,'' said Steven Findlay, a health policy analyst at Consumers Union, using the nickname for the drug industry group. ''They would like to keep that totally off the table -- this year and forever.''
 John Rother, executive vice president of AARP, the lobby for older Americans and a longtime critic of the drug industry, described PhRMA as ''one of the big winners so far in health care reform.''
 ''It's only surprising in the context of calls that everyone should give something and that we need to slow down the rate of health care costs,'' Mr. Rother said. ''So you don't expect then to see an industry coming away with huge wins.''
 Mr. Tauzin, PhRMA's president, has led the group since shortly after he left Congress in 2005, where as a Louisiana Republican he was chairman of the same House committee now headed by Mr. Waxman. 
 Mr. Tauzin has helped PhRMA build a compelling public policy argument on behalf of prescription drugs: they account for only 10 percent of the nation's health care spending. They help people avoid hospitalization and other more costly medical treatments and their profits pay for research and innovation that result in newer, better drugs. 
 Mr. Tauzin, who has been battling intestinal cancer for several years, credits drugs for his own survival. 
 ''All we have to do is convince America we are trying to save lives,'' he said, citing studies that each dollar spent on drugs saves $6 in other health costs.
 It is an argument backed by an army of lobbyists and a huge political war chest. 
 Drug companies have invested nearly $1 billion in lobbying over the last decade, more than any other industry, according to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, and more than $100 million in campaign donations, increasingly to Democrats. And the drug industry in the last three months has increased its spending, according to reports filed Tuesday: PhRMA spent $6.2 million during that period and 10 drug companies each spent more than $1 million.
 A crucial moment for the industry came a month ago when Mr. Obama and Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, announced that PhRMA had agreed to come up with $80 billion in drug savings for seniors and federal health programs over the next decade. 
 About $36 billion of that would come from a 50 percent discount on name-brand drugs when people using the Medicare Part D drug program enter the so-called doughnut hole -- a built-in gap in the federally subsidized coverage when enrollees must pay for their drugs out of their own pockets. 
 A Deutsche Bank stock analyst termed the 50 percent offer ''a palatable form of concession'' since it would also raise new revenue from people who would otherwise stop buying the drugs or switch to lower-price generics. A Barclays Capital analyst called the offer ''less than what meets the eye.''
 But it was the first industry group to make a savings pledge, and it came at a time Mr. Obama's health care agenda needed a political kick-start.
 On July 7, Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, and Mr. Baucus assured at least five pharmaceutical companies during a White House meeting that there would be no provision in the final health care package to allow the reimportation of cheaper drugs from Canada or elsewhere, according to Mr. Tauzin. 
 The industry's message, Mr. Tauzin said, was, ''Don't put us in a big negative fight over this issue while we're trying to help you pass something that would be good for the American public.''
 The meeting included chief executives from Pfizer, Merck, Amgen, AstraZeneca and Abbott Laboratories. 
 ''This time our industry has a seat at the table and our voice is being heard,'' Richard T. Clark, Merck's chief, said in a conference call Tuesday with stock analysts.
 Reid H. Cherlin, a White House spokesman, said Tuesday that the administration was happy with the ''unprecedented commitment'' from ''an industry that has opposed health reform efforts in the past.'' 
 The rest of the $80 billion cost-savings package tentatively includes more than $15 billion in higher rebates for Medicaid drugs, much of which Mr. Obama was already seeking in his budget. The pledge also projects about $9 billion in federal savings from the advent of generic competition in biologic drugs, and additional billions from imposing some sort of new fee on the industry. 
 The details are expected to emerge from Mr. Baucus's bill, which is still under cloak as he negotiates concessions from other industries. 
 ''We'll do it in a way they want,'' Mr. Tauzin said. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Tauzin met last weekend with the Blue Dog Democrats, who control the swing votes on Mr. Waxman's committee. He said the fiscally conservative group -- which he helped found in 1994 before he switched parties -- gave PhRMA a good reception.
 Even if PhRMA feels secure in its understanding with the White House and Mr. Baucus, the industry knows it must still try to bring Mr. Waxman's committee and the House around to its way of seeing things. 
 The WORK-UP: Articles in this series are analyzing the economic and financial issues at the heart of the health care debate in Washington.

HEADLINE: The Role of Community Colleges

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''No Size Fits All'' (column, July 17):
 David Brooks is right about the crucial role of community colleges and the importance of the Obama administration's investment, linked to greater accountability for outcomes. 
 To address Mr. Brooks's point about the divergent goals and abilities of their students, community colleges need resources for effective student supports -- high-quality career development services to ensure that students pursue education that fits their interests and the requirements of growth fields, academic advising, peer mentoring, child care and other proven strategies for retention.
 Employers could help, too, by setting more predictable schedules for part-time workers, lending experienced professionals as faculty in fields like nursing, and getting involved in governance. 
 President Obama's proposed investment is a huge opportunity to advance the reforms needed to enable students to achieve their aspirations and make the colleges the engines of economic development they have the potential to be. 
 Anne Ladky Chicago, July 17, 2009
 The writer is the executive director of Women Employed.
 To the Editor:
 I want to applaud David Brooks for acknowledging the significance of President Obama's new initiative to produce five million more community college grads by 2020.
 The success of America's future work force depends on the ability of higher education institutions to adapt to and educate our rapidly growing population of nontraditional students: those who are low-income, first-generation, part time, commuting, ethnically diverse and older.
 Community colleges are on the front lines of the changing higher education landscape, with Latinos -- the country's largest, youngest and fastest-growing minority group -- showing the greatest increase in college enrollment, with more than 300 percent more Latino students enrolled in 2007 than in 1980. 
 Equally important, community colleges are the institutions of choice for 51 percent of all Latino college students enrolled today. 
 America's greatest opportunity lies in harnessing the potential of our Latino population and helping them, and the nation, to thrive.

HEADLINE: Strategic Issues, Not Abuses, Are U.S. Focus in Kyrgyzstan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan 

 BODY:
''You know what this is for,'' Emilbek Kaptagaev recalled being told by the police officers who snatched him off the street. No other words, just blows to the head, then all went black. Mr. Kaptagaev, an opponent of Kyrgyzstan's president, who is a vital American ally in the war in nearby Afghanistan, was found later in a field with a concussion, broken ribs and a face swollen into a mosaic of bruises.
 Mr. Kaptagaev said that the beating last month was a warning to stop campaigning against the president, but that he would not. And so he received an anonymous call only a few days ago. ''Have you forgotten?'' the voice growled. ''Want it to happen again?'' 
 Mr. Kaptagaev's story is not unusual in this poor former Soviet republic in the mountains of Central Asia. Many opposition politicians and independent journalists have been arrested, prosecuted, attacked and even killed over the last year as the Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, has consolidated control in advance of elections on Thursday, which he is all but certain to win.
 ''This is how the authorities rule in Kyrgyzstan,'' said Mr. Kaptagaev, 52. ''They use criminal methods to keep power.''
 The United States has remained largely silent in response to this wave of violence, apparently wary of jeopardizing the status of its sprawling air base, on the outskirts of this capital, which supports the mission in Afghanistan. Indeed, the Obama administration has sought to woo the Kyrgyz president since he said in February that he would close the Manas base. 
 In June, President Obamasent a letter to Mr. Bakiyev praising his role in Afghanistan and the campaign against terrorism. Mr. Bakiyev allowed the base to stay, after the United States agreed to pay higher rent and other minor changes. 
 The lack of criticism of Mr. Bakiyev underscores how the Obama administration has emphasized pragmatic concerns over human rights in dealings with autocratic leaders in Central Asia. Under pressure in Afghanistan, the administration has feared alienating nearby countries whose support is increasingly important. 
 How to react to crackdowns like Mr. Bakiyev's is a longstanding challenge for American diplomacy, here and around the world. Some American officials stress that rebuking governments over human rights is often ineffective because they lash back, and tighten things further.
 The administration is mindful that a neighboring former Soviet republic, Uzbekistan, closed an American military facility there after American officials condemned an attack by the security forces in 2005 that killed hundreds of people. The Obama administration is trying to repair that relationship.
 In the Kyrgyz elections on Thursday, opposition parties have rallied around the candidacy of a former prime minister, Almazbek Atambaev, but he is given little chance. Mr. Atambaev's campaign manager, Bakyt Beshimov, said the Kyrgyz president drew strength from the American reluctance to speak out.
 ''This regime clearly understand that for the United States, democracy is not a priority, freedom of speech is not a priority,'' Mr. Beshimov said. ''They want peace, stability, air bases and regional security connected with Afghanistan.'' 
 The Obama administration's attempt to improve ties with Central Asia was underscored by a visit to the region this month by a senior diplomat, William J. Burns.
 In Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Burns said at a news conference that the United States hoped for ''fair and credible elections,'' but he did not mention the treatment of the opposition or journalists. 
 Interviewed about the political situation, another State Department official, George A. Krol, said reports of violence ''greatly disturb the department.''
 ''The United States doesn't shy away from raising these issues with the Kyrgyz authorities,'' he said.
 The Kyrgyz president, Mr. Bakiyev, took office in 2005 after the Tulip Revolution -- the third in what was seen at the time as a series of so-called color revolutions that offered hope of more democratic governments in the former Soviet Union.
 Today, widespread disillusionment has set in, as in Ukraineand Georgia, which also had such upheavals. 
 Kyrgyzstan, with five million people, continues to have a more open political system and more open media than its hard-line neighbors in Central Asia. It is not a police state, and in general, only those who overtly challenge the government are hounded by the security services. 
 Even so, human rights groups have been taken aback. 
 ''President Bakiyev has become infamous for even greater levels of corruption, authoritarianism and ineffective economic policies than his predecessor,'' Freedom House, a human rights group, said in a new report. 
 In an interview at the presidential residence, Mr. Bakiyev dismissed such criticism. He said the security services were in no way persecuting the opposition.
 He said he would be easily re-elected because the country was faring well despite the financial crisis, adding that opposition leaders were complaining that balloting would be falsified because they needed excuses for their lack of support.
 ''A strong opposition would not behave in that way,'' Mr. Bakiyev said.
 He said he was so confident that the elections would be honest that he had invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor them. In a report in May, the organization, which has 56 member states, described concerns in Kyrgyzstan about ''a criminalization of the political process.'' 
 Mr. Bakiyev, asked about repeated attacks on journalists, said he doubted that the attacks were related to their jobs. He said the government would never try to silence the media.
 ''The only authorities that would take that step are ones who are afraid -- afraid of journalists, afraid of openness, afraid of something that they want to hide,'' he said. ''I, as president, and the government of Kyrgyzstan fear absolutely nothing. There is no motive, there is no reason to hunt down journalists.''
 Still, the bloodshed continues. This month, a journalist named Almaz Tashiyev died after being beaten by police officers, prosecutors said. 
 Syrgak Abdyldaev says he barely escaped that fate. In March, Mr. Abdyldaev, 47, a well-known journalist who has scrutinized the president's political activities, was lured to a meeting by an anonymous caller who promised confidential information, and was attacked.
 He was stabbed 29 times in the thigh, apparently in an effort to cause him to bleed to death. He survived after passers-by came to his aid.
 ''They wanted to make an example of me,'' Mr. Abdyldaev said. ''They wanted me to die in front of everybody. And then nobody -- not a journalist, not anybody with a brain in his head -- would dare write anything in the press.''
 While he was hospitalized, his newspaper, The Bishkek Reporter, dismissed him. He was told it was too risky to keep publishing his work.

HEADLINE: Earnings Top Forecasts at 3 Drug Makers

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The drug companies Eli Lilly and Pfizer both topped Wall Street expectations for second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and raised their profit outlooks for the full year. GlaxoSmithKline, based in Britain, also bucked the tough economy, reporting an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit and exceeding estimates. 
 But a strong dollar hurt overseas sales for Lilly and Pfizer.
 Glaxo reported a 15 percent increase in revenue but said sales in the United States fell by the same amount.
 Pfizer said unfavorable exchange rates reduced revenue by $1.1 billion, or 9 percent, and revenue for virtually all Pfizer drugs declined because of the currency changes. Sales were down in all five of Pfizer's business units.
 Pfizer said its net income in the quarter ended June 28 was $2.26 billion, or 34 cents a share, compared with $2.78 billion, or 41 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding charges, Pfizer's earnings were 48 cents a share, topping analyst estimates by a penny.
 Lilly earned $1.16 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the second quarter, compared with $958.8 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Lilly also topped Wall Street expectations with adjusted earnings of $1.12 a share.
 Lilly said sales of its top seller, the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa, slipped 3 percent, while sales for the antidepressant Cymbalta rose 14 percent.
 Lilly reduced its spending on advertising in the United States and said a stronger dollar helped contain its marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which rose slightly to $1.71 billion.
 Pfizer cut spending on research and on marketing and administration by double digits, and eliminated 3,750 jobs in the second quarter. During the quarter, it spent $330 million on cost cuts.
 Pfizer is also working to close the biggest deal in the industry this year, its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth, which it expects to complete late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter. Pfizer spent $491 million in the quarter on financing and other acquisition-related costs.
 Lilly expects adjusted earnings for the full year of $4.20 to $4.30 a share, compared with a previous estimate of $4 to $4.25.
 Pfizer expects adjusted earnings per share for the year of $1.90 to $2, up from $1.85 to $1.95.
 Bristol to Buy Medarex
 Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would buy Medarex, which makes treatments for cancer and other diseases, for about $2.4 billion.
 Bristol will pay $16 a share, a 90 percent premium over Medarex's closing price on Wednesday. Medarex has about $300 million in cash and securities that reduces the cost of the deal to about $2.1 billion, Bristol-Myers said.

HEADLINE: California Pension Fund Hopes Riskier Bets Will Restore Its Health

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO 

 BODY:
Big as California's budget woes are today, so are the problems lurking in its biggest pension fund.
 The fund, known as Calpers, lost nearly $60 billion in the financial markets last year. Though it has more than enough money to make its payments to retirees for many years, it has a serious long-term shortfall. Meanwhile, local governments in the state are pleading poverty and saying they cannot make the contributions that would be needed to shore it up. 
 Those problems now rest largely on the slim shoulders of Joseph A. Dear, the fund's new head of investments. He is not an investment seer by training, but he thinks he has the cure for what ails Calpers, or the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest in the nation with $180 billion in assets. 
 Mr. Dear wants to embrace some potentially high-risk investments in hopes of higher returns. He aims to pour billions more into beaten-down private equity and hedge funds. Junk bonds and California real estate also ride high on his list. And then there are timber, commodities and infrastructure. 
 That's right, he wants to load up on many of the very assets that have been responsible for the fund's recent plunge. Calpers's real estate portfolio has tumbled 35 percent, and its private equity holdings are down 31 percent. What is more, under Mr. Dear's predecessor, Calpers had to sell stocks in a falling market last year to fulfill calls for cash from its private equity and real estate partnerships. That led to bigger losses in its stock portfolio.
 Mr. Dear remains a believer. Private investments, he asserts, will over the long haul outperform stocks by three percentage points a year, and that is necessary to keep Calpers on track to returning its goal of 7.75 percent annual returns. 
 ''Three percent on a portfolio as large as ours makes a material difference,'' he said. 
 If he can inch Calpers's investment performance up, many problems will disappear. If not, Calpers may end up in an even bigger financial squeeze than it is today. 
 The scope of his task elicits sympathy from one of Calpers's harshest critics, Marcia Fritz, a Sacramento lawyer and vice president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility, which has led a loud campaign over the rich benefits received by some Calpers retirees. 
 ''Joe Dear has got a tough job,'' Ms. Fritz said. ''I wouldn't wish it on anyone. There's so much pressure. It's horrible.'' 
 A somewhat unorthodox choice for the job, Mr. Dear sounds a little like Captain Kirk surveying the Starship Enterprise when he explains why he leaped at the opportunity earlier this year: ''Calpers is the flagship command of the public pension fund world.'' 
 He was hired in large part for his management skills and political savvy -- honed in Washington, where headed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton years. He does not have an M.B.A. or any other advanced degree in finance. Harvard, Yale or Wharton is not on his resume. Instead, his lone degree, in political economy, is from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.
 Most recently, Mr. Dear headed the Washington State public pension fund, which gained a reputation as a daring investor under his oversight. It risked more of its portfolio -- 25 percent -- on private equity than any other public fund. The bet pushed the Washington State Investment Board, which now has $67 billion in assets, into the top 1 percent of its peer group in performance during the boom years, according to Wilshire Associates. But in the fiscal year that ended last month, the fund lost 27 percent of its value, or $18 billion.
 Calpers has a lot riding on Mr. Dear's effort to achieve above-market performance. The fund just posted a loss of 23 percent, the worst in its history. That leaves it 66 percent funded, the lowest level in two decades, meaning it has only $66 on hand for every $100 in benefits promised to 1.6 million California public employees and their families. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is on the Calpers board, has called the fund ''unsustainable.'' He has specifically criticized a decision by Calpers last month to give California municipalities a break on their required contributions. Rather than stepping up contribution rates to 5 percent to cover investment losses, Calpers set a maximum increase of 1.1 percent -- saving municipalities hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger called it a ''pass the buck to our kids idea.'' Calpers says municipalities, which pay 15 percent of their payroll -- or about $11 billion a year -- into the fund, needed the help. 
 Steering through the political cross currents would seem to be one of Mr. Dear's strengths.
 ''My career sort of culminates in this job, where this combination of investment and political management and organization management come together because that's what Calpers needs,'' he said in his expansive corner office decorated with a photo of himself and Bono. (Bono was a general partner in an equity fund in which the Washington State fund invested.) 
 ''The fun part is the investment part,'' Mr. Dear added, speaking in fast, yet measured tones. ''The necessary part is the organization, the management and the work in the political environment. The common element in my career is that I'm extremely focused on improving the performance of the organizations I work for.''
 Mr. Dear, 57, is also chairman of the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington nonprofit group that promotes shareholder activism -- an effort close to the heart of the Calpers's board and one reason he was hired. 
 ''The board felt that we had extremely good depth on the investment staff,'' said George Diehr, chairman of the board's investment committee. ''We were looking for someone to knock down silos and get various asset managers talking to each other. We felt Joe would have those skills. He's well known in the public pension field, and he's a strong advocate for corporate governance.'' 
 In the end, Mr. Dear, who will get $408,000 to $612,000 in salary and can qualify for a performance bonus of up to 75 percent of that salary, will be judged by portfolio returns. 
 Already, Calpers has raised its target for private equity and related investments by 40 percent to about 14 percent of the total portfolio. To cover any calls by private equity firms for additional money, the fund has also raised its target for cash on hand to 2 percent of assets. 
 It is ratcheting back on public domestic stocks, which account for less than 25 percent of the portfolio, while another 25 percent of the portfolio is in international equities. 
 Critics say that Mr. Dear and Calpers -- which has a staff of 200 investment professionals -- are taking on too much risk. 
 ''Calpers is significantly underfunded, and they have decided that they will roll the dice,'' said Edward A. H. Siedle, president of Benchmark Financial Services, which audits pension plans. ''Is that appropriate if you have just lost 25 percent of your portfolio? These are high-risk, illiquid, unregistered products where there is tremendous valuation uncertainty. I would bet you any amount that five years from now, this plan will not have outperformed the market.'' 
 Mr. Dear says he can improve performance in other ways as well. He has pressed the private equity and hedge funds in Calpers's portfolio to reduce their fees, provide more transparency and segregate Calpers's money from that of other investors. While not ready to announce any agreements, Mr. Dear said he was making ''good progress.'' 
 Last week, he testified before Congress that private equity and hedge funds should register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and be subject to the agency's oversight. On the activist front, Calpers has voted against management in a number of recent proxy battles, including management of Bank of America. And Mr. Dear or his staff meet regularly with members of Congress and the Obama administration. 
 Saying he spends a third of his time as investment chief, a third on board matters and a third on outside issues, Mr. Dear remains passionate that this is the moment when shareholders can prevail. 
 As he sees it, ''You have public awareness, outrage over the consequences of a failed regulatory system and an administration and Congress prepared to respond.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 27, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the investment strategy of the California Public Employees' Pension Fund misstated the relationship between Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the board of the fund, which is also known as Calpers. Mr. Schwarzenegger appoints two board members, but he is not a member himself. The article also misstated the profession of Marcia Fritz, who commented on the difficulty facing Calpers's investment manager. She is a certified public accountant, not a lawyer.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE TREASURE OF ULYSSES DAVIS,' through Sept. 6. Ulysses Davis (1914-1990) was a Savannah, Ga., barber who whittled and carved wooden sculptures in his shop when business was slow. Organized by the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, this show is by far the largest presentation of Mr. Davis's sculpture to be seen outside Savannah and the first to reveal the full scope of his imagination. His best-known works, carvings of historical figures, take a backseat to hybrid beasts and hydra-headed figures. It makes clear that he wasn't just a patriotic folk artist, or an African-American artist affirming his heritage, or an inward-looking, visionary artist. He was all of these, which is to say that no single cliche of ''outsider'' art quite fits him. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090723 
 ASIA SOCIETY: YANG FUDONG: 'SEVEN INTELLECTUALS IN A BAMBOO FOREST,' through Sept. 13. Presented in its five-hour entirety for the first time in a United States museum, Mr. Yang's hypnotic, five-part black-and-white movie, ''Seven Intellectuals in a Bamboo Forest,'' tracks the dreamlike meanderings of a group of fashion-model-pretty young people, from a breathtaking mountain summit to a busy city where the disjunctive imagery becomes increasingly surrealistic and comical. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)20090723
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'LIVING AND DREAMING,' through Sept. 13. This annual exhibition presents works by young artists who have completed a preparatory program for careers as professionals. Most look as if they could use a few years more of seasoning, but a handful look like artists to keep an eye on. The highlights include Eva Davidova's surreal videos; Meredith Drum's enigmatic, low-budget sci-fi film; Nathan Bennett's walk-in room resembling a set for a Stanley Kubrick space odyssey; and Jeffrey Hargrave's mock-racist caricatures. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090723
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIGHT OF THE SUFIS: THE MYSTICAL ARTS OF ISLAM,' through Sept. 6. ''What's in your head -- throw it away! What's in your hand -- give it up! Whatever happens -- don't turn away from it.'' That's how a 10th-century Persian spiritual master defined the Islamic devotional practice known as Sufism. Countless other definitions have been proposed since, almost as many as for Islam itself. And variety -- paintings, ceramics, mosque lamps, books -- is what you find in this tiny, exquisite show in the Brooklyn Museum's newly reinstalled Islamic galleries. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090723
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. ( Cotter)20090723
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090723
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'YINKA SHONIBARE MBE,' through Sept. 20. This is an important show for Mr. Shonibare, a British-Nigerian artist who emerged in the late 1990s and was made a member of the Order of the British Empire in 2005. His sculptural tableaus, which revolve around Victorian-era costumes made from 20th-century fabrics associated with Africa, are riotously colorful; their themes of frivolity and excess feel current. But with few exceptions, Mr. Shonibare serves his post-colonialism straight up. The show is rescued by smart integration with the permanent collection: a kind of scavenger hunt through the museum's American period rooms, where Mr. Shonibare's figures of children at play inhabit historical settings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'FASHIONING FELT,' through Sept. 7. Tribute is paid to the world's oldest textile (no loom required) in all its sturdy, cosseting, beautiful, shape-shifting, dye-friendly majesty. The show includes contemporary furnishings, garments, jewelry and room dividers, as well as two large installation works. The felt runs from raw to cooked -- that is, furry to gossamer -- and in some of the most intriguing instances it is mated with lacquer, plastic, LED lights, metal or coral beads, as well as silk, linen or cotton. There are episodes of frivolity. A few earlier works -- including a Mongolian runner and a saddle blanket -- reunite function and decoration and distort familiar motifs in wonderful ways. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)20090723
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'PORTRAITS, PASTELS, PRINTS: WHISTLER IN THE FRICK COLLECTION,' through Aug. 23. This summer's refurbishment of the Frick's East Gallery, where four full-length portraits by James Abbott McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) normally hang, has occasioned a small celebration of Whistler's art. The four portraits have been moved into the Oval Room, where they are joined by a seascape; etchings and pastels of Venice are on view in the Cabinet Room. Both displays reinforce a suspicion about Whistler: that despite his oft-professed regard for the abstract qualities of music -- all those ''symphonies,'' ''arrangements'' and ''nocturnes'' -- he had a rare talent for conveying specific places and personalities. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SWEENEY DECADE: ACQUISITIONS OF THE 1959 INAUGURAL,' through Sept. 2. What did they get, and when did they get it? The perennial yardstick of a museum's sensitivity to new art is quite useful in this show. All 24 paintings and sculptures date from the 1950s and were acquired by the Guggenheim within a year or so of their making, and many were part of the first exhibition in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral building. They constitute a mixture of the good, the bad and the innocuous, as well as European, Asian and American. But they also attest to the vision of James Johnson Sweeney, the Guggenheim's second director, who steered the museum away from its founding obsession with ''non-objective painting'' and into the broad, challenging terrain of art after 1950. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20090723
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AVEDON FASHION: 1944-2000,' through Sept. 20. The first museum retrospective devoted to Richard Avedon's fashion photography exudes a contagious joie de vivre. With postwar Paris as a stage set, Avedon made fashion photography new by adding movement and then narrative to his images, along with ironic self-awareness and a buoyant exuberance. The best of his early images are as perfect as the best work of Jackson Pollock or Jasper Johns from this period and as profoundly representative of it. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Smith)20090723
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THEY CALLED ME MAYER JULY: PAINTED MEMORIES OF A JEWISH CHILDHOOD IN POLAND BEFORE THE HOLOCAUST,' through Oct. 1. Introducing the reluctant painter and accidental memoirist Mayer Kirschenblatt, now 92, who has devoted the last two decades to documenting life between the wars in and around the provincial city of Opatow (Apt in Yiddish), Poland. Wrought with irresistible detail and folk-art dispatch, the paintings begin with his mother's kitchen and reflect an omnivorous curiosity about everyday everything, aided by an apparently photographic memory. Labels pick up where the paintings leave off; words and images combine in a marvel of a book accomplished in collaboration with the artist's daughter, a folklorist whose career choice was shaped by her father's stories. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Smith)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AFGHANISTAN: HIDDEN TREASURES FROM THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, KABUL,' through Sept. 20. The 200 pre-Islamic objects in this important and moving show date from the Bronze Age to the first century A.D. They dropped from sight during the country's recent turmoil, which was deadly for both people and artwork alike. Courageous curators were their salvation; the rediscovery of the pieces was a moment of national thanksgiving. Consisting of vessels, sculpture, architectural ornaments, jewelry and furniture decoration made of bronze, stone, glass, ceramic, ivory, gold and gemstone, they attest to an astounding cosmopolitanism and diverse cultural heritage. Once, many trade routes led through Afghanistan, and proof of its former centrality is both dazzling and heartening. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRANCIS BACON: A CENTENARY RETROSPECTIVE,' through Aug. 16. This 66-work survey starts with the stagy existentialism of Bacon's early work (the semihuman fiends, screaming popes, flanks of beef) and proceeds to the effulgent colors, insistent rhythms and true anguish of his grand triptychs and portraits. It suggests that his greatest achievement was his ability to paint convincingly men having sex and sometimes making love. As his hero Picasso had done for men and women, Bacon turned sexual passion into a pictorial event, using paint on canvas with finesse and no small sense of drama, while operating under cover of modernism. For once, the male gaze turned emphatically selfward. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,' through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PEN AND PARCHMENT: DRAWING IN THE MIDDLE AGES,' through Aug 23. This quietly ravishing exhibition ventures where few shows have gone before, with 50 rarely seen works. They prove medieval drawing to be vital, diverse and essential to the medium's Renaissance blossoming. They reveal the medium untangling from manuscript illumination and Christianity in general -- although not without first reveling in some astounding Psalters, gospels, epistles and a saint's life or two. It re-embraces antiquity and provides a framework for speculative (read, secular) thought. The show ends with the visionary drawings of Opicinus de Canistris, a 13th-century Italian cleric who diagrammed his own notion of the relationship between the earthly and spiritual church. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PICTURES GENERATION, 1974-1984,' through Aug. 2. With this historical survey, the Met tackles a subject in American contemporary art -- namely, a critical and innovative body of media-influenced work produced between two major economic booms -- that has been begging for full-scale museum attention, and gives it the full old master treatment. Much of the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints, music and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- continues to look good. There are things to quarrel with, from the sweeping ''generation'' concept to a surprising, un-Met-like factual error in the wall labels: the original ''Pictures'' show had five artists, not four; one, Philip Smith, has been deliberately excised here in the interest of writing a neater history. Still, the show is a big step into the pertinent present for this museum. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090723
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM,' through Oct. 25. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending 130 feet from one end of the open-air deck to the other and rising 29 feet overhead. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090723
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'PAGES OF GOLD: MEDIEVAL ILLUMINATIONS FROM THE MORGAN,' through Sept. 13. This quietly compelling show assembles ''orphan'' leaves (illuminated pages separated from medieval manuscripts and sold, individually, to collectors). Organized geographically, the show allows a comparison of illumination styles in England, Italy, Spain and other countries and regions. It also highlights the figures who created and participated in the market for single leaves. They include an Italian abbot, an English art historian and a mysterious artist known as the Spanish Forger. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'GORD PETERAN: FURNITURE MEETS ITS MAKER,' through Aug. 16. This Canadian furniture maker who is widely admired in craft creates what he calls ''furnitural'' sculpture. He is a consummate technician, and his play with elements of furniture is often amusing and sometimes conceptually provocative. ''Table Made of Wood'' (1999) wittily makes its title literal. It is a side table made by gluing together hundreds of wood scraps, adding up to what is as much a Cubist representation as a functional table. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090723
 MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'SCRIPTURE FOR THE EYES: BIBLE ILLUSTRATION IN NETHERLANDISH PRINTS OF THE 16TH CENTURY,' through Sept. 27. Abounding in sex, violence and supernatural happenings, the Bible has been a great source of inspiration for visual artists. This superb show features pieces by some of the biggest names in the history of Western printmaking. Woodcuts and engravings by Lucas van Leyden and Hendrick Goltzius alone would make a visit to the museum worthwhile, but among the 79 works on view there are lots more wildly imaginative and technically amazing feats of printmaking. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20090723
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090723
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956,' through Nov. 30. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director. The prevailing sense of beauty, restraint and economy is an implicit rebuke to today's inane material excesses. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090723
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 24. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090723
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/ OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Never-Neverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090723
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'DAN GRAHAM: BEYOND,' through Oct. 11. This beautifully installed retrospective pays tribute to an influential artist who doesn't necessarily call himself that, and it tends to bear him out. Most impressive are a series of early Conceptual artworks involving surgically precise uses of language and magazines; a series of deadpan, Minimalist-inspired photographs of New Jersey architecture; and ''Rock My Religion,'' an imaginative video about the roots of rock 'n' roll. The video installations and walk-in glass-and-mirror pavilions -- admired because they are interactive -- quickly grow tedious or gimmicky. The many artists who claim Mr. Graham as precedent may surpass him, but there is more than one way to be important. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090723
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SADIE BENNING: PLAY PAUSE,' through Sept. 20. A new stop-action animation by this former film prodigy uses an avalanche of simple, almost naive gouache drawings, sometimes tinted with color, to prowl the margins of urban society. The result is low-key with undercurrents: a picture of the everyday sublime riddled with suggestions of longing, otherness and the difficulties of connection. Solveig Nelson has provided its beautifully accurate (yet largely electronic) soundtrack of city sounds, whether a subway singer or squirrels rifling through a garbage can, people talking in a bar or gates being called in an airport. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090723
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'CLAES OLDENBURG: EARLY SCULPTURE, DRAWINGS, AND HAPPENINGS FILMS' AND 'CLAES OLDENBURG AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN: THE MUSIC ROOM,' through Sept. 6. This pair of exhibitions leans heavily on the Whitney's sizable collection of Oldenburg and Oldenburg/Van Bruggen drawings, some of which were shown in 2002. But they also include newly restored, never-exhibited films of Mr. Oldenburg's Happenings and a major kinetic sculpture, ''Ice Bag -- Scale C'' (1971), brought back to life by conservators. A centralized gallery of early drawings and soft sculptures defines Mr. Oldenburg's epicurean branch of Pop, with works like ''Giant BLT (Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich)'' and ''French Fries and Ketchup'' (both 1963), served up on low, platterlike pedestals. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20090723
 Galleries: Uptown
 BLANCHE LAZZELL: 'WHITE-LINE COLOR WOODCUTS,' through Aug. 14. This show is a wonderful introduction to one of the unsung geniuses of early American modernism, Blanche Lazzell (1878-1956), an artist who perfected the relatively new technique of white-line woodcut prints into a truly, if modestly, visionary art. The elimination of black lines between the woodcut shapes created an inherent luminosity that Lazzell exploited with her superb sense of color and Cubist-flavored composition. A denizen of Cape Cod, she depicted harbor scenes, landscapes and village rooftops and backyards in images that replace the expected sentimentality with fervent joy. The light has been switched off. Craig F. Starr Gallery, 5 East 73rd Street , (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Smith)20090723
 Galleries: 57th Street
 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: FURTHER EVIDENCE (PART 1: PAINTING),' through July 31. Despite including artists like Hans Hofmann, Lee Krasner and Joan Mitchell, this exhibition delves into the further reaches of America's most renowned art movement. Its high points include a monstrous collage by Alfred Leslie and excellent works by James Brooks, Alfonso Ossorio and Milton Resnick. But the standout is Beauford Delaney's ''Composition 16'' from 1954-56, a shimmering field of dark, green-tinged yellow that crosses Monet with Pollock and is a must-have for any museum that wants to expand its definition of Abstract Expressionism beyond the white and the male.

 'PAUL JENKINS IN THE 1960S AND 1970S: SPACE, COLOR AND LIGHT,' through Sept. 25. While seriously overhung, this exhibition affords a rare, extensive look at the work of an artist who borrowed from Abstract Expressionism and then Color Field Painting to devise flowing, billowing veils of color that dazzle with their formal acrobatics and luminous, jewel-toned hues. Working with his well-known ivory knives, Mr. Jenkins makes his colors leap, overlap and splinter, pitting them against whiplash lines and stark white backgrounds that increase their luminosity. His paintings have frequently been too gorgeous for their own good, which means that they can verge on slick. But the selection here shows him at the height of his powers. D.

 GUYTON/WALKER, through Aug. 7. A Geiger counter designed to measure art-world cleverness would go haywire around the latest collaborative efforts of Wade Guyton and Kelley Walker. Several generations' worth of painting's history, motifs and breakthroughs are evoked -- along with its shipping needs, its use as decor and its influence on design. The dots, stripes, monochromes and Op Art checks of postwar abstraction mingle with Pop Art bananas, zebra-skin motifs and orange slices while migrating from canvas to drywall to Parsons tables and paint cans. Painting as process, as pleasure and as commodity is evoked. The high-key color is especially impressive. But once the references are parsed and sourced, the fun-house formalism tends to ring hollow.

 'PROJECT SPACE & ROOFTOP: PAULA HAYES,' through Aug. 15. The best works in this show, which spreads from gallery space to terrace, are hand-blown clear-glass terrariums inhabited by either plants or crystals; rubbery planters of several kinds; and some eco-conscious landscaping devices. All blur the lines dividing sculpture, gardening and design into an art of purposeful, playful beauty and serenity. Marianne Boesky Gallery, 509 West 24th Street , (212) 680-9889, marianneboeskygallery.com. (Smith)20090723
 'YOUR GOLD TEETH II,' through Aug. 15. This exceptional show -- titled after a song by Steely Dan -- ignores the distinctions between art and craft, old and new, commercial and fine. The many works are arranged in unusually tight clusters without labels; formal and visual affinities are established before you quite know what you're looking at. Craft-world greats like Peter Voulkos, Ed Rossbach, Marvin Lipofsky, George Ohr and Edward Moulthrop (you can look them up) rub shoulders with fine-art practitioners like Barkley L. Hendricks, Sergej Jensen, Alexandra Bircken, Alighiero E. Boetti and Cady Noland. All kinds of visual prejudices are shaken up, if not startled out of existence.

 JONAH FREEMAN AND JUSTIN LOWE: 'BLACK ACID CO-OP,' through Aug. 15. This immense, labor-intensive, maniacally contrived warren of some dozen rooms, interiors and passageways tours some of the darker sides of American life and its always evolving recreational drug cultures. The itinerary includes two home-style meth labs (one functioning, one exploded); a red-carpeted gallery of pseudo-artworks; and a hippie haven. Things seem realistic enough on the surface, but artistic license regularly intervenes, adding curve balls about perception, voyeurism and display. And yet beyond all this, it is the impression of different styles of American detachment and dysfunction caving in upon one another that sticks, underscored by a bleak, empty final chamber where the only choice is to turn around and retrace your steps.

 LEIDY CHURCHMAN: 'GOOD AFTERNOON!,' through Aug. 1. These sly, tenderly wrought figurative paintings on wood constitute an impressive debut. With inspirations that seem to include Grandma Moses, Tom of Finland, Charles Demuth and Hans Holbein, the images both sort out and blur issues of gender and sexual orientation while celebrating relationships of all varieties. Pictorial and social wit combine with color and spatial contradiction to reinforce ambiguities of a sexual and emotional nature. Even the wood contributes to the wholesome, normalizing glow.

 'PLOT/09: THIS WORLD & NEARER ONES,' through the summer. The big draw in the city's first quadrennial of public art -- an exhibition of 19 site-specific works organized by Creative Time on Governors Island -- is the beautiful, haunted, car-free island itself. Standouts among the uneven melange of artworks include videos by Guido van der Werve, Adam Chodzko, Judi Werthein and the ingenious Bruce High Quality Foundation. Outdoors, beyond the dark rooms, Susan Philipsz, Teresa Margolles, Tue Greenfort, Mark Wallinger and especially Klaus Weber also add substance. But the degree of site-specificity fluctuates wildly, and the concept as a whole is inadvertently called into question. (212) 206-6674, creativetime.org. (Smith)20090723
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama ''Hope'' poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston , (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090723
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. , (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090723
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'THE ART OF POWER: ROYAL ARMOR AND PORTRAITS FROM IMPERIAL SPAIN,' through Nov. 1. Drawn from the Royal Armory in Madrid, one of the oldest and greatest repositories of armor in the world, this exhibition presents full suits of armor, as well as individual helmets, shields, swords and armor for horses. There are portraits of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish kings in armor, too, and three spectacular tapestries. But it is the extraordinarily sumptuous metalwork, produced not for warfare but for ceremonial occasions, that is the main attraction.

 Last Chance
 ANTONIA DIAS LEITE: 'ANTONIA'S LINE'; closes on Saturday. This young Brazilian artist and recent graduate of the School of Visual Arts makes her New York debut with ''Mildred's Farewell,'' a short, mesmerizing video about her mother's death. Its ghostlike forms drift convincingly among semi-abstract expanses of shadows, water, plants and reflections; cloudlike piles of various fibers; and fragmentary glimpses of faces and bodies, including a pair of seemingly bloody feet walking on broken glass. Experimental films from several decades are recalled, but with help from its subtle, ambient soundtrack (also by Ms. Leite), this work finds legs to call its own. Luxe Gallery, 53 Stanton Street, at Eldridge Street, Lower East Side , (212) 582-4425, luxegallery.net. (Smith)20090723
 TIM HAWKINSON; closes on Friday. Great expectations are aroused by the prospect of a Tim Hawkinson show. At his best, this mercurial Los Angeles sculptor can be astoundingly inventive. This is a relatively modest and spotty exhibition, however. Works included range from almost beautiful to hideous. A life-size motorcycle made entirely of eight different kinds of dark feathers is lovely and poetic. A bronze sculpture of a nude adolescent boy and his dog is drop-dead ugly. Pace Wildenstein, 32 East 57th Street , (212) 421-3292, pacewildenstein.com. (Johnson)20090723
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'AERNOUT MIK'; closes on Monday. Something is happening in this Dutch artist's videos, but you don't know what it is. Displayed on single flat screens or as multiple projections on custom-built walls in various locations at the museum, they seem to document chaotic, emotionally charged, newsworthy situations involving scores of people. As you watch, you keep hoping to discover what exactly is the cause of the commotion, but no clarification arrives. They are by turns mesmerizing, tantalizing and frustrating.

 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS'; closes on Sunday. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington , (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090723
 'WILD FEATURE'; closes on Thursday. Organized by Brian Belott, this exhibition explores the intersection of overheated color and stylized figuration, from James B. Franklin's meticulous, vacuum-sealed images, to Misaki Kawai's exuberant plunge into large-scale painting and (it seems) the rigors of space-age surveillance. Brendan Cass, Melissa Brown, John Hodany and Taylor McKimens comport themselves with varying effectiveness. Jesse A. Greenberg takes on multimedia relief, faux stained glass and sculpture with a panache verging on obstreperous. Zurcher Studio, 33 Bleecker Street, at Mott Street, East Village , (212) 777-0790, galeriezurcher.com. (Smith)20090723
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'PAINTINGS FROM THE REIGN OF VICTORIA: THE ROYAL HOLLOWAY COLLECTION, LONDON'; closes on Sunday. Though often sappy, moralistic and formally unadventurous, the best British painting of the late 19th century still delivers a rich mix of visual imagination, narrative intrigue and social commentary. Drawn from a collection created in the early 1880s for students at the Royal Holloway College in England, at the time for women only, this exhibition presents pictures that can make you wish painting today were as tuned in to the real world. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Conn. , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson)20090723
 JACK YOUNGERMAN: 'TRIADS/QUADRADS'; closes on Sunday. Mr. Youngerman's new paintings have an exhilarating punch. In bright Playskool colors and with a direct, slightly brushy touch, he has been creating centered, hard-edged abstractions on star-, diamond-, three-leaf-clover- and oval-shaped plywood panels. They have a numinous vibe, like altar paintings for a pagan cult or heraldic emblems for a mystical knighthood. Washburn Gallery, 20 West 57th Street , (212) 397-6780, washburngallery.com.

HEADLINE: A Capture in Afghanistan, and Hometown Closes Ranks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HAILEY, Idaho 

 BODY:
The sheriff encouraged everyone to ride bicycles to the vigil here on Wednesday night, ''in the spirit of Bowe.''
 It has barely been a year since Bowe R. Bergdahl joined the Army last summer and just days since the Taliban released a grainy video in which Private Bergdahl, who had been stationed in a volatile area of eastern Afghanistan, can be seen being held as their captive and saying how much he missed home. 
 It was in this valley of the Northern Rockies that Private Bergdahl, 23, grew up to become a young man with flair and diverse passions nurtured by his free-spirited hometown here amid the mountains. 
 Raised with a sister in a family of modest means, Mr. Bergdahl loved bicycles, disliked cars, loved motorcycles, danced ballet, knew his way around a rifle, served espressos, dropped out of high school, earned his G.E.D., read widely, biked the California coast, fished for salmon in Alaska and sailed the Atlantic. He pursued life and with good manners. People took to him. 
 Sheriff Walt Femling of Blaine County, a family friend and Mr. Bergdahl's former landlord, recalled his tenant once politely declining a ride home in the rain, ''because he didn't want to get my car wet.'' 
 Mr. Bergdahl's family does not appear to have had a strong connection to the military. Nor, for that matter, does Hailey, whose population is about 6,000. There are craft breweries and bike shops on Main Street, not the empty storefronts and Army recruitment centers found in some other rural towns. The most visible military presence is a small armory for the Idaho National Guard that is not open on a daily basis. 
 While there is an active American Legion post in the area, nearly all of its 215 members are from wars preceding those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Several people said they were not aware of the area's having lost a soldier in the recent conflicts. Some said the area's liberal politics have made for a strong antiwar sentiment locally, at least relative to other parts of Idaho, particularly among the newcomers who have arrived over the past few decades seeking life in the outdoors.
 ''Bowe is very much a product of this community,'' said Sue Martin, a family friend and the owner of a coffee shop where Mr. Bergdahl worked. ''And he's misunderstood because of that.'' 
 ''We're all struggling to define who Bowe is,'' Ms. Martin added.
 A rush of scrutiny and questions has followed Private Bergdahl's capture. Military officials said Private Bergdahl walked off his outpost in eastern Afghanistan in late June. In the video, the soldier says he was captured after he lagged behind during a patrol. Afghan police officials said Mr. Bergdahl's base was in Paktika Province, a rugged and dangerous region that borders Pakistan. 
 ''The circumstances under which Pfc. Bergdahl went missing are still under investigation,'' Capt. Marcy Hopp, a spokeswoman for the United States Central Command, in Tampa, Fla., said Wednesday. ''There's so much speculation out there. Before we can release information, we have to complete the investigation and find out what really happened.''
 Some people here worry that what Sheriff Femling called the soldier's ''adventurous spirit'' could have played a role in his capture. The intense focus on what may have happened has led many people here to try to protect Private Bergdahl and his family, which has refused to be interviewed.
 ''They don't know any more than we know,'' Ms. Martin said.
 Unlike in some other, less affluent small towns, where young people often join the military as a route to employment and a broader world, children who grow up in Hailey and its neighboring towns to the north, Ketchum and Sun Valley, are more likely to attend college, Sheriff Femling said. Some have the means and the motivation to travel or leave altogether after high school. Others might seek work in restaurants or retail. Service industries have grown substantially as the area has evolved into a skiing and summer sports resort where celebrities have second homes. At the same time, the recession has had an impact.
 ''My friends are all struggling to find jobs,'' said Kyle Rose, 19, who graduated from Wood River High School here and has since moved to Big Sky, Mont., where he works as a cook.
 Mr. Rose said he and a friend considered joining the Marines ''to become snipers,'' but ultimately did not because both have asthma. He said he did not know of any of his classmates who had entered the military. He knew Mr. Bergdahl in passing, Mr. Rose said, in part because Mr. Bergdahl once courted his former girlfriend -- while she was still his girlfriend.
 ''It's funny, he had long hair and stuff; he was pretty laid back,'' Mr. Rose said. ''But now he's in the military.''
 Elaine Charlat, whose husband, Maurice, served in the Army during the Korean War and was the commander of the American Legion post here for several years, said war and the military could be topics best left avoided.
 ''You want to keep your friends,'' Mrs. Charlat said. 
 Yet she noted that Private Bergdahl's situation seemed to have transcended division. 
 ''We all want to support the family,'' she said. ''How stressful can you imagine that would be? You don't know if something you say could be picked up and used against him. We're playing it pretty close to the vest.''
 Still, shops in the area have run out of yellow ribbon.

HEADLINE: Earnings at Amazon Are Weaker Than Expected

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
Amazon.com posted weaker-than-expected earnings on Thursday, punctuated by a steep decline in its flagship business of selling media products like books, music and DVDs.
 Amazon, based in Seattle, said its net profit fell 10 percent, to $142 million, or 32 cents a share, in its second quarter, from $158 million, or 37 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue climbed 14 percent, to $4.65 billion, coming in slightly below Wall Street's expectations. 
 Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average had expected $4.67 billion in revenue and earnings of 32 cents a share. A charge for a $51 million legal settlement to Toys ''R'' Us depressed the company's profit. 
 Shares of Amazon fell more than $6, or nearly 7 percent, in after-hours trading. It more than doubled in the last eight months as investors applauded the company's ability to navigate the recession.
 ''People had looked at their recent performance and assumed that Amazon was, relatively speaking, exempt from the current downturn,'' said Jeffrey Lindsay, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Amazon's quarter ''was by any measure a good performance, but expectations had gotten ahead of themselves,'' he said.
 For some analysts, the most worrisome indicator was a sharp falloff in Amazon's media sales in North America. The company's original business of selling books, CDs and DVDs showed no growth in the second quarter over the prior year, after posting 15.6 percent growth in all of 2008. Worldwide media sales grew only 1 percent, while worldwide sales of electronics and general merchandise grew 35 percent.
 In a conference call with analysts, Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, attributed the falloff in media to an industrywide slowdown in video game and console sales and to an unfavorable comparison with the same quarter last year, when popular products like Wii Fit were introduced.
 But analysts seemed to worry that the emergence of digital alternatives in Amazon's Video on Demand, MP3 and Kindle stores -- which generally have lower prices than their physical counterparts -- might be weakening one of the core drivers of Amazon's business.
 ''I think people are worried that the Kindle and their other digital efforts may be cannibalizing their real-world sales,'' Mr. Lindsay said.
 Nevertheless, Amazon has been accelerating its shift from physical to digital media formats. This month the company lowered the price of the Kindle reading device to $299 from $359 and began selling the Kindle DX, which has a larger screen, for $489. Amazon's Web site says the DX is sold out, with a two- to three-week wait.
 On Wednesday, Amazon announced plans to buy the shoe retailer Zappos.com for stock currently worth more than $800 million, the largest purchase in its 15-year history. Amazon executives said Thursday that the acquisition was intended to help the company establish a separate outpost in the rapidly growing business of selling shoes and apparel online.
 Mr. Szkutak said Zappos had roughly $635 million in revenue last year and made a small profit. He said Amazon intended to let the company function as a ''standalone business'' and was not considering layoffs or other cost-saving measures once the deal was completed. ''This is not about synergies; this is about growing in categories that we think are very interesting,'' he said.
 Analysts generally applauded the purchase of Zappos. Marianne Wolk, an analyst at the Susquehanna Financial Group, said buying Zappos ''eliminates a competitor in the market, and a competitor that could have been even more powerful if it expanded into more categories.'' 
 Amazon issued only a broad forecast for its current quarter, saying that it expected revenue to rise in a range of 11 percent to 23 percent from a year earlier, and that operating income could fall as much as 22 percent or increase as much as 36 percent.
 Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, did not participate in a conference call with analysts; the company said he was traveling. But earlier in the day he did address one matter: the deletion of the George Orwell books ''1984'' and ''Animal Farm'' from the Kindle libraries of customers who had bought them from a vendor that lacked the rights to sell them. Angry customers said this was equivalent to the company's breaking into their houses to take back a conventional book.
 In a posting on an Amazon bulletin board, Mr. Bezos wrote an apology, saying the move was ''stupid, thoughtless, and painfully out of line with our principles.''

HEADLINE: As Ranks of Unemployed Swell, Wait for Benefits Worsens Pain

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Years of state and federal neglect have hobbled the nation's unemployment system just as a brutal recession has doubled the number of jobless Americans seeking aid.
 In a program that values timeliness above all else, decisions involving more than a million applicants have been slowed, and hundreds of thousands of needy people have waited months for checks. 
 And with benefit funds at dangerous lows even before the recession began, states are taking on billions in debt, increasing the pressure to raise taxes or cut aid, just as either would inflict maximum pain.
 Sixteen states, with exhausted funds, are now paying benefits with borrowed cash, and their number could double by the year's end. 
 Call centers and Web sites have been overwhelmed, leaving frustrated workers sometimes fighting for days to file an application.
 While the strained program still makes more than 80 percent of initial payments within three weeks -- slightly below the standard set under federal law -- cases that require individual review are especially prone to delay. Thirty-eight states are failing to make those decisions within the federal deadline.
 For workers who survive a paycheck at a time, even a week's delay can mean a missed rent payment or foregone meals.
 Kenneth Kottwitz, a laid-off cabinet maker in Phoenix, waited three months for his benefits to arrive. He exhausted his savings, lost his apartment and moved to a homeless shelter.
 Luis Coronel, a janitor at a San Francisco hotel, got $6,000 in back benefits after winning an appeal. But in the six months he spent waiting, there were times when he and his pregnant wife could not afford to eat. 
 ''I was terrified my wife and daughter would have to live on the street,'' Mr. Coronel said.
 Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said: ''Obviously, some of our states were in a pickle. The system wasn't prepared to deal with the enormity of the calls coming in.''
 The program's problems, though well known, were brushed aside when unemployment was low.
 ''The unemployment insurance system before the recession was as vulnerable as New Orleans was before Katrina,'' said Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, who is chairman of a House panel with authority over the program.
 Now the number of unemployed Americans has doubled since 2007 to 15 million and the program is more than tripling in size. About 9.5 million people are collecting benefits, up from about 2.5 million two years ago. Spending is expected to reach nearly $100 billion this year, about triple what it was two years ago. 
 Given how suddenly the workload has increased, some analysts say the delays might have been even worse. 
 ''Payments are later than they should be, and later than they used to be, but states have been overwhelmed,'' said Rich Hobbie, director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, which represents the program's administrators. ''Considering the significant problems in the program, unemployment is responding well.''
 The recovery act passed in February provided states an additional $500 million for administration. It also suspended interest payments through 2011 for states paying benefits with federal loans.
 Unemployment insurance began as a New Deal effort with dual goals: to sustain idled workers and stimulate weak economies. States finance benefits by taxing employers, typically building surpluses in good times to cover payments in bad. 
 In 2007, the average state paid about $290 a week and aided 37 percent of the unemployed.
 As downturns over the last 20 years proved infrequent and mild, states cut taxes, and the federal government, which pays administrative costs, reduced its support by about 25 percent. The states' performance sagged. 
 In a recent report to the Department of Labor, Ohio said its computer problems ''kept the system performance at a snail's pace.'' Louisiana said its call center was staffed with ''temporary workers, with little knowledge'' of unemployment insurance. 
 North Carolina said a wave of retirements had left it ''unable to maintain pace or volume of work.'' Virginia wrote ''performance continued to be very stagnant'' and called the odds of improvement ''bleak.'' 
 By 2007, 11 states were paying benefits so slowly they violated multiple federal rules, up from just two at the start of the decade. 
 While most eligibility reviews can be done by computer, about a quarter require a caseworker -- to ensure, say, the applicant was laid off, rather than quit.
 In the last year, states processed just 61 percent of these cases within three weeks -- well below the federal requirement of 80 percent. More than a half-million cases, 6 percent, took more than eight weeks, and 350,000 took more than 10 weeks.
 Of the 12.8 million eligibility reviews that have occurred during the recession, 4.6 million took more than three weeks. That is 2.1 million more than federal rules allow. 
 Appeals take even longer, with 28 states violating timeliness rules, many of them severely.
 Perhaps no state is as troubled as California, which has not met timeliness standards for nine years. As in most other states, its 30-year-old computer runs on Cobol, a language so obsolete the state must summon retirees to make changes. 
 Yet a major overhaul in California has been delayed for five years, with $66 million in federal funds still waiting to be spent. In part, the shelved project was meant to upgrade the call centers, which were ''completely swamped'' last winter, a legislative analyst wrote, with ''desperate unemployed Californians dialing and redialing for hours.'' 
 Deborah Bronow, who runs the state's unemployment insurance program, said, ''The systems were antiquated to begin with,'' and ''we were unprepared.''
 In April, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency, saying the failure to efficiently process checks posed ''extreme peril to the safety of persons and property.''
 California has not met federal standards for adequate reserves since 1990. Still, it cut taxes and raised benefits in the last decade. It is now paying benefits with federal loans, with its debt projected to reach nearly $18 billion next year.
 Among those hurt by delays was Mr. Coronel, the San Francisco janitor who lost his hotel job in January. With the phone lines jammed, it took him two days to file an application and a month to learn it had been denied. 
 Then the waiting really began, as Mr. Coronel filed an appeal and heard nothing for three months. Luckless as he applied for new jobs, he borrowed to pay the rent, then moved in with his mother, and joined his pregnant wife in skipping meals.
 ''The worst day was when my daughter was born,'' he said. ''I had no clothes for her, and no car seat.''
 While federal rules require states to decide 60 percent of appeals cases within a month, in recent years, California has met that deadline for just 5 percent. A report by the state auditor last year found the appeals board rife with nepotism and mismanagement.
 Mr. Coronel won the appeal, but is soothing a marriage strained by a six-month wait. ''It's extremely stressful when you don't know how you're going to support your family,'' he said.
 Nationally, the program is the worst financial shape since the early 1980s, when back-to-back recessions left more than half the states borrowing from the federal government. Tax increases and benefit restraints gradually rebuilt the funds, then states changed course and pushed taxes well below historical levels.
 From 1960 to 1990, the tax rate averaged about 1.1 percent of overall payroll. Over the last decade, it fell to 0.65 percent. That represents a tax cut of 40 percent.
 Measured against a decade's payroll, that saved employers $165 billion. But by 2007, when the recession began, the average state had just six months of recession-level benefits in reserve, half the recommended sum.
 ''The attitude became, 'We don't need a firehouse -- we can buy hoses when the fire starts,' '' said Wayne Vroman of the Urban Institute, a Washington research group.
 Some analysts defend the tax cuts, saying they helped both employers and workers, by spurring the economy and creating jobs. 
 ''Lower tax rates make it easier to attract business,'' said Doug Holmes, president of UWC, a group that advocates on behalf of employers. ''We don't want to spend a whole lot of time beating ourselves up because we didn't raise taxes enough. Nobody anticipated a recession this size.''
 A big reason the reserves fell, Mr. Holmes said, is that the jobless now spend more time on the rolls -- 15 weeks in recent years, up from 13 weeks several decades ago. Each extra week costs the program about $3 billion a year. The solution, he said, is stronger job placement provisions.
 But others see an irresponsible past that now promises future pain.
 ''Workers who had nothing to do with the funds becoming insolvent are going to be asked to pay for that with benefit cuts,'' said Andrew Stettner, an analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a workers' rights group. ''That's the worst thing states can do -- it takes money straight out of the economy.''
 Among those who say timely benefits are essential is Mr. Kottwitz, the Arizona cabinet maker, who lost his job just before Christmas. He filed a claim and promptly received a debit card, with no money on it. It took him weeks to reach a program clerk, who told him to keep waiting.
 ''They said, 'We're behind -- be patient,' '' he said. 
 With little savings, no family nearby, and a ninth-grade education, Mr. Kottwitz, 42, had limited options. He got $100 a month in food stamps, collected cans and applied for jobs. When his landlord put him out, he moved to a shelter so overcrowded he spent his first few nights on the ground. 
 ''I felt like I was the scum of the earth,'' Mr. Kottwitz said. 
 In March, the shelter referred him to Ellen Katz, a lawyer at the William E. Morris Institute for Justice, an advocacy group, who secured his benefits. By the time the money arrived, Mr. Kottwitz had lost nearly 40 pounds. His first stop was an all-you-can-eat buffet. 
 Now back in an apartment, he said he was sharing his story in the hope that someone might read it and offer him a job.
 ''You think that someone would have seen this coming and been more prepared,'' he said.

Reserves vary widely by state. Sixteen states have had to borrow from the federal government so they can continue paying jobless benefits.

... and administratively: Federal rules require states to pay 87 percent of new applicants within three weeks, a benchmark now being missed. Many workers say jammed phones and Internet sites pose obstacles to filing applications.
Especially slow are cases that require a review of why a worker left the job. Federal rules require states to resolve 80 percent of these cases within three weeks, though most now do not.
 And just one of four appeals cases is resolved within a month, well short of the federal rule requiring 60 percent.(CHART BY MATTHEW ERICSON AND JASON DE PARLE/THE NEW YORK TIMES)(pg. A16)

HEADLINE: Arts and Crafts From Bloomsbury Days

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Virginia Woolf could sometimes barely stand to look at the flamboyantly colorful furniture and clothing that her sister, Vanessa Bell, designed. Woolf once warned her that the palettes ''almost wrenched my eyes from the sockets.''
 Bell helped run a design collective in London called the Omega Workshops. With a dozen artisans, part of the Bloomsbury circle of poets and painters, it operated out of a Georgian town house from 1913 to 1919. They applied overlapping geometric patterns and contorted landscapes and human figures to woodwork, textiles, theater sets, ceramic dishes, books and posters.
 The Omega's brief lifespan is not surprising, given Britain's economic turmoil during World War I and the artists' complicated personal lives. (Bell had affairs with the two other major members of the collective, Duncan Grant, who was openly gay, and Roger Fry, whose wife, Helen, had been committed to a psychiatric asylum.) 
 The family pathologies and professional accomplishments are the subject of two exhibitions this summer, ''A Room of Their Own: The Bloomsbury Artists in American Collections,'' at the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University through Oct. 18, and ''Beyond Bloomsbury: Designs of the Omega Workshops 1913-19,'' through Sept. 20 at the Courtauld Gallery in London.
 The curators have juxtaposed hundreds of objects with the Omega's original design drawings, and the wall texts, soundtracks and catalogs explain how much pontificating and inner torment went into these products. Fry wrote manifestoes for the Omega, declaring war on ''dead mechanical exactitude and uniformity'' in the home furnishings market. The workshops' wares instead revealed what Fry called ''the directly expressive quality of the artist's handling.'' At the Johnson and Courtauld galleries, monochrome earthenware plates have bumps and rough edges, and bands of raw pigment are streaked on wooden tabletops, lamps and boxes. Upholstery fabric is printed with wobbly checkerboards and scribbled leaves, and terra-cotta cat figurines are glazed in mottled shades of tan with a few suggestions of black tabby stripes.
 Most of the pieces were originally custom orders for literati, including Ezra Pound and Lady Ottoline Morrell (another one of Fry's lovers). But the workshop did produce some of its idiosyncratic designs in bulk. ''There were 30 color-ways available for some of the fabric patterns,'' said Alexandra Gerstein, the curator of sculpture and decorative arts at the Courtauld. The Omega staff, she added, ''had amazing energy and ambition and organization, for a group of artists who're often considered a bit slapdash. There was such a proliferation of ideas, such a wealth of color and experimentation, in a short burst of creativity.''
 A few works by the Omega circle are on view, and for sale, in New York this summer. A gallery, Davis & Langdale Company, at 231 East 60th Street, is offering three pictures by Grant, including a charcoal sketch ($3,000) of Bell's hand and a rug design ($1,300) with black-and-white fin motifs. On Aug. 5 the Swann Galleries will auction a poster (estimated to sell for $700 to $1,000) by Grant, depicting an English village's wharves as shards of reflections on a calm river.
 AN ASTROLOGICAL AUCTION
 A tourist attraction devoted to the celebrity astrologer Jeane Dixon has been shuttered, and its contents will be auctioned Sunday. The Jeane Dixon Museum and Library in Strasburg, Va., which opened in 2002, five years after her death, has been stripped of scrapbooks, fan letters from politicians and beaded gowns, for a sale at Sloans & Kenyon Auctioneers and Appraisers in Chevy Chase, Md.
 The museum's founder, Leo M. Bernstein, who died last year, was a financial adviser to Dixon. The galleries were arranged in simulations of room settings at her Washington home; portraits of her hung alongside her oak desk and leather office chair, and stuffed toys were nestled on her gilded, canopied bed. But ticket sales were slow. ''The museum was never profitable,'' said Stephanie Kenyon, the president of the auction house. Mr. Bernstein ''kept it open in tribute to her,'' she added. ''Without him, there was no way to sustain it.'' To transport the galleries' contents to Maryland, she said, ''we sent five moving vans with 500 boxes.''
 The auction lots, mostly estimated to sell for a few hundred dollars, give a sense of Dixon's pampered lifestyle. She wore mink muffs and Adolfo and Chanel hats. She dressed her cat, Mike the Magicat, in furs and rhinestone collars, and displayed portraits of him staring into crystal balls. She was also a careful record keeper; one box lot at the Sloans sale contains ''photocopies of her predictions specific to individuals as well as general events,'' according to the catalog. In another box lot are ''religious and other items discovered under Jeane Dixon's bed,'' including a ''handkerchief with pen drawing of mystical matrix.''
 Two crystal balls, on gilded supports, are for sale with no estimates listed. ''Nothing comparable has been auctioned before,'' Ms. Kenyon said. To suggest a price range, ''we'd have to get another psychic to tell us that,'' she said, deadpan.
 ESOTERIC GADGETS SALE
 A few hundred obsolete measuring devices with cryptic dials will be auctioned on Saturday at Skinner Inc., in Marlborough, Mass. Mainly from the collection of Norman J. Mercer, a sculptor and yachtsman who died in 2007, the machines were originally useful for navigating, surveying or telling time. The auction catalog defies spell-check programs with its rarefied terminology: the brass theodolites, binnacle compasses, and equinoctial dials come with knurled knobs, vernier adjustments, hinged gnomons, and pinnule sights. Only a few Roman numerals, latitude markings and zodiac signs will be intelligible to novices.
 The market for this esoteric material ''is a niche that's developed a remarkable following,'' said Robert C. Cheney, the director of Skinner's science, technology and clocks department. ''We get stuff that no one here has any idea how it works, or what it does.'' The scholarly buyers ''sometimes even specialize,'' he added. ''There are people who just collect equinoctial dials.''
 Another substantial contingent of the bidders, however, only like the tools' sculptural forms and moving parts. ''There are always people winding things up'' at the preview, Mr. Cheney said. ''Curb appeal still jumps into play.''

HEADLINE: Breaking Up the Family Business

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
Whatever you think about the Red Sox, whether you are running for president of Red Sox Nation or wish some new curse would infest Fenway Park with locusts, it is almost certain you never before accused them of being home wreckers.
 But the Sox went antifamily Wednesday. In the span of a couple of hours Boston made two trades that broke up chunks of two families. The Sox snared first baseman Adam LaRoche from the Pirates, leaving poor Andy at third base without his older brother to endure being in last place (again!). And then they snatched left fielder Chris Duncan from the Cardinals, leaving a steaming dad, the pitching coach Dave Duncan, behind. Worse, perhaps, the Red Sox immediately sent Duncan to the minors. 
 Ouch.
 The trades apparently made the Sox feel better about being swept by the Rangers and falling farther behind the Yankees. They also tried to steal a little thunder from the Dodgers, who threw their own little twist into the news when Manny Ramirez hit a game-winning, pinch-hit grand slam on his own bobblehead night. It was the latest wow moment of Ramirez's colorful but checkered career, writes Helene Elliott of The Los Angeles Times. Conveniently, it gave Dodgers fans another reason to forget the reason he was suspended for 50 games this season. (Reminder: doping!)
 In other disturbing quasi baseball news, the former Yankees draft pick Taylor Mattingly, the son of Don Mattingly, was arrested in Evansville, Ind., and charged with battery against his mother.
 On the competitive front, baseball's trade deadline (which is less a deadline than a suggestion) brings this year's opportunity for teams to throw money away, writes WSJ.com. Usually that means the Yankees, because that is their cottage industry, but perhaps the franchise this year is obsessed with putting football games in their new stadium, which, The Daily News reports, may soon include a bowl game.
 If the Yankees appear to move money around with bulldozers, they have nothing on the Southeastern Conference, which signed another ludicrously lucrative television contract. The SEC, writes Dennis Dodd on CBSSports.com, seems to be an economy all its own.
 Of course, if ESPN doesn't own something in sports, we have yet to discover what that might be. The dynasty has absorbed a few arrows, however, for its decision not to report on the sexual assault accusations lodged in a lawsuit against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger until late Wednesday night. Fanhouse.com's Kevin Blackistone said ESPN's decision was a terrible one. Perhaps the dynasty was fixated on the peephole scandal surrounding its sportscaster, Erin Andrews, and barring New York Post reporters from its programs because the newspaper ran pictures from the illegal video.
 Perhaps ESPN should turn to Edmonton Eskimos defensive end Kitwana Jones if the perpetrator is found. Jones did an excellent job of tackling a purse snatcher on his way to breakfast Tuesday.
 Canada usually produces the hockey news, but now it seems the Islanders are taking a rare turn at that, signing their third starting goalie of sorts, Martin Biron, a move that seems to signal Rick DiPietro's lifetime contract isn't working out so well. Neither, it seems, are the former N.H.L. star Sergei Fedorov's investment decisions, with the news that he filed suit against a man he accuses of swindling him out of $43 million.
 N.B.A. fans, meanwhile, remain fixated on the dunk perpetrated on LeBron James at his own camp, with a video finally emerging despite Nike's best efforts to confiscate any and all legend-denting videos.
 At least Nike didn't break up any families today. Yet.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Earnings Decline 49%, to $445 Million, as Downturn Saps Demand

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
United Parcel Service, the world's largest package delivery company, said on Thursday that its second-quarter earnings fell 49 percent as the recession cut business demand.
 It forecast that its profit in the third quarter will be lower than analysts' projections. 
 Second-quarter profit declined to $445 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $873 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped 17 percent, to $10.8 billion.
 Package volume in the United States slid for a sixth consecutive quarter as the recession caused businesses to reduce orders amid the highest unemployment rate in 26 years. The company said shipments would remain ''significantly below'' those for last year. U.P.S. is considered an economic bellwether because it delivers a wide variety of items, including clothing, auto parts and financial documents.
 ''A lot of us got excited by those initial signs of stabilization, and now we're realizing it's going to be more of a 2010 event before we see real recovery,'' said Nathan Brochmann, an analyst at William Blair & Company in Chicago. He rates the shares market perform. 
 U.P.S., based in Atlanta, said profit for the three months through September will be 45 to 55 cents a share, less than the 60-cent average of analysts' estimates. 
 ''We are cautious, frankly,'' the company's chief financial officer Kurt Kuehn told analysts and investors on a conference call. ''We don't have any confidence that either demand or activity is going to pick up substantially'' in the next several months.
 Domestic volume fell 4.6 percent in the second quarter, the worst results since the company's 1999 initial public offering. The measure will probably decline at a similar pace this quarter, Mr. Kuehn said. International volume tumbled 5.5 percent and will not improve this quarter, he said. 
 The number of hours U.P.S. airplanes were in operation declined 11 percent, saving 14 million gallons of fuel and contributing to a 54 percent drop in the company's total fuel bill to $539 million as oil prices collapsed from a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Their Belief Is In the Power Of Persuasion

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: For the city's organized atheists 

 BODY:
-- here's hoping that doesn't sound oxymoronic -- the rotten economy would seem in one respect to be Heaven-sent.
 ''You got it,'' Kenneth Bronstein said. Mr. Bronstein is president of New York City Atheists, whose name should be self-explanatory.
 For the last month, his group has run 12-foot-long advertisements on the sides of city buses in Manhattan. You may have seen them, though perhaps not. New York City Transit has 981 buses assigned to Manhattan, and the atheists could afford ads on only about two dozen. 
 The message, in white lettering on a sky-blue background, is nonconfrontational by design. It doesn't attack religion or say there is no God. It simply says: ''You don't have to believe in God to be a moral or ethical person.'' Hard to gainsay that thought. Most of us know nonbelievers who are pillars of rectitude. We also know pious types who are as honest as a Siberian winter's day is long.
 Mr. Bronstein said that the ad campaign, scheduled to end this weekend, was a resounding success that prompted donations and requests to join his organization. ''We don't announce our numbers,'' he said, ''but we say we have hundreds of paid members.''
 Religious people have contacted him to say they agree with the message, he said. More meaningful to him are calls from fellow nonbelievers. ''Many, many atheists were so proud that we finally put a sign up,'' he said. ''We announced to the world that we're around. We're here.''
 In some respects the strategy echoes that of the gay-rights movement, by persuading once-closeted people to come out. Polls show that atheists' numbers are growing around the country. ''I got phone calls from people who said, 'I've been an atheist all my life, and I was afraid to tell anybody,' '' Mr. Bronstein said. Because of the ads, he said, those people now feel, ''Hey, there are others of us out there, and I'm proud to be an atheist.''
 To get back to the point raised earlier, the poor economy has been something of a blessing for the nonbelievers. ''We probably could not have gotten this poster program in New York City if the financial times were very good,'' said Mr. Bronstein, who is 70 and retired from I.B.M. ''But people are looking for business.''
 The company that sells the ads on New York buses is Titan Worldwide. Mr. Bronstein's conversations with a Titan representative led him to believe that in normal times he might have been deemed too small a fish. You may have noticed that these are not normal times.
 ''I didn't have the money to go with a $50-to-$100,000 program,'' he said. ''I had about 10,000 bucks to play with. I think what happened was that they needed business. If you look at subway cars, there are a lot of empty spaces for advertisements. The bottom line is that they bought into the $10,000 program.''
 IT was much the same with the company that printed the ads, for about $1,000. ''I have never, ever had such a response,'' he said. ''They kept calling me back: 'Can I help you with this? Can I help you with that?' For a $1,000 order they spent an awful lot of time trying to get my business.''
 Officials at Titan and at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said they had not received a single complaint about the atheists' ad. Same goes for him, Mr. Bronstein said. ''The only potential negative comment I've received is from a few atheists who had wished my statement was stronger: 'Bash religion because they bash us all the time.' I said, 'No, I don't go that way.' ''
 One goal for him now is to raise enough money to expand the campaign to buses beyond Manhattan.
 But let's face it: Your group hasn't truly made it in New York until the city suspends alternate-side street sweeping rules for one of your holidays. Most of the 30-plus designated holidays are religious in nature. This is one city where cleanliness is not necessarily next to godliness. The problem with being an atheist is that you don't have a holiday. ''That's what Henny Youngman said,'' Mr. Bronstein noted.
 Possible holidays have been proposed. One is Charles Darwin's birthday, Feb. 12. Abraham Lincoln pretty much has that date sewn up, though. Besides, Mr. Bronstein doesn't think much of the idea. ''Darwin is too controversial,'' he said. Either solstice would be better, he said. Maybe both.
 Not that it really matters. ''They're going to turn me down no matter what I do,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Postcards From Canada's 'New North'

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
The 2007 edition of Documenta, the contemporary-art exposition held once every five years in Kassel, Germany, was an ultraglobal affair. Names of artists from far-flung places filled the roster. And it's a safe bet that few of those names were as unfamiliar to the mainstream art world as that of Annie Pootoogook. 
 Ms. Pootoogook lives and works in the Inuit hamlet of Cape Dorset, just below the Arctic Circle in far northern Canada. Everyday life in that remote settlement, where she was born in 1969, was the subject of the ink-and-crayon drawings that she showed at Kassel. And strange drawings they seemed, with their shifts between homeyness and violence. 
 In one, an Inuit family is seen in a cluttered living room watching Jerry Springer on television. In another, a woman is assaulted in her bedroom. A polar bear noses around outside a house. A man covers his face with his hands and weeps. 
 It was hard to know what to make of these condensed and unexplained narratives, of art that was neither conventionally heavy nor light. People tended to look, hesitate, look again, then quickly move on to the next gallery. 
 Several of those Documenta pictures are in Ms. Pootoogook's solo exhibition at the George Gustav Heye Center, the Lower Manhattan branch of the National Museum of the American Indian, where they feel less exotic and unanswering, largely because of the changed context. At Documenta the work was presented simply as contemporary art even if it didn't fit any ready internationalist models. At the Heye Center it is inescapably Native American, automatically inviting an ethnic reading. 
 Categories are tricky. They make life more manageable and art easier to sell, but they can distort and confuse. Inuit art, once called Eskimo art, is an example. For some people it is by definition a tradition that must embody specific references to nature and spirituality to be authentic. Yet much contemporary Inuit art, like soapstone carvings of whales or prints of shamanistic figures, is considered by many too new and stylistically modern to be anything more than tourist kitsch. By such perversely exacting standards the possibilities for a genuine, living Inuit art to exist at all are slim. 
 Ms. Pootoogook's work stands a bit outside such debates because it offers a different model of what's traditional and authentic. By the time she was born, certain Inuit traditions had ended or assumed new forms after prolonged contact with an aggressive larger world. A millennia-old nomadic existence, shaped by seasonal hunting and fishing patterns, had been exchanged, by the late 20th century, for life in settlements. 
 That change had obvious advantages, including access to medical care, education and the prepackaged necessities of life. It also entailed well-documented disadvantages: a population increase in an unsustaining economy, a battered self-identity, a plague of substance abuse. The native populations had been gradually brought into the modern fold only to be left, in essential ways, out in the cold. 
 Ms. Pootoogook grew up entirely on the modern side of this transition. Her art, with its images of electronic gadgets and fast food, reflects this. But she has retained contact with the past by staying in touch with a particular type of traditional art, namely art made by her family. Her grandmother, Pitseolak Ashoona, of the last generation to grow up in a nomadic Inuit lifestyle, was a famous artist. Her mother, Napachie Pootoogook, became a well-known artist too. Ms. Pootoogook herself began drawing only in 1997, with encouragement from the Kinngait Co-operative, a community center that offers supplies and studio space, and commercially promotes local work, making Inuit art production a staple of the Cape Dorset economy. She worked in a firm, clean drawing style established by her grandmother, adding bright crayon colors. And she picked up on themes that her mother, who died in 2002, broached only late in her career: realistic views of contemporary Inuit life. 
 In Ms. Pootoogook's hands this realism can be disconcertingly autobiographical. She is the woman being threatened with a beating in the drawing ''Man Abusing His Partner.'' In ''Memory of My Life: Breaking Bottles,'' she is the woman smashing liquor bottles in a rage at the damage that alcohol is causing her family and friends. 
 Occasionally she makes allusions to Inuit myth, of a kind familiar in her grandmother's art, but only in images of extreme physic trauma, as in ''Sadness and Relief for My Brother,'' with its crying face circled by suns, giant teardrops and radiating energy lines.
 Most if the drawings, though, are far less dramatic than this, scenes of ordinary domestic life in the so-called New North, where Inuit and non-Inuit cultures mingle. Certain tableaus seem lifted straight from the past: a woman sits scraping an animal skin, a family sleeps together in a fishing tent. 
 But the ''ground'' the woman sits on is the floor of her modern kitchen. The sleeping family is surrounded by up-to-date supplies, including jars of peanut butter, a Coleman stove and a broadband radio. Anyway, it's likely that most fishing trips these days are made for sport rather than from need, or so one gathers from an image of shoppers in the Cape Dorset food cooperative stocking up on Hungry Man frozen dinners before heading home for night in front of the television. 
 What will they be watching? Ms. Pootoogook shows us: a sports event, an erotic film or a documentary about old-time Inuit life broadcast on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.
 She also shows us time passing. Nearly every interior she draws has a clock on the wall, a reminder that Inuit time, once cycles of seasons measured in polar nights and days, is now mechanically counted in minutes and hours. This switch is destabilizing, which may help explain the spatial peculiarities of Ms. Pootoogook's drawings, in which solid things float on stretches of untouched white paper as if barely anchored by gravity and perspective. 
 Some of those solid things -- television, Tylenol, cigarettes, a Pilot Fineliner pen -- are good, some may not be, though Ms. Pootoogook rarely indicates such distinctions. Hers is less an art of commentary than of observation. In one picture a man and woman sleep lovingly together; in another, a second couple, or possibly the same couple, is locked in brutal combat. Either way, this is life as one contemporary eye sees and depicts it. 
 The cumulative effect of the Heye Center show -- originally organized by the independent curator Nancy Campbell for the Illingworth Kerr Gallery at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary -- is of a single extended vision that crosses documentary with diary, by an artist who is both a scrupulous recorder of a specific 21st-century reality and an imaginative but unromanticizing editor of that reality. 
 There's no question that the art that results is of this moment and that it is the genuine Inuit thing, though precisely what category you'd file it under, I don't know, and I suspect that Ms. Pootoogook, whose international presence grows by the year, is too busy to care.

HEADLINE: Air Force Report Envisions A Broader Use of Drones

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Small remotely piloted planes are now used mainly to gather intelligence and fire missiles at insurgents. But over the next several decades, the Air Force envisions building larger ones that could do the work of bombers and cargo planes and even tiny ones that could spy inside a room. 
 In a report released Thursday laying out a ''flight plan'' for developing pilotless systems, the Air Force also said it could eventually field swarms of drones to attack enemy targets.
 And it will have to be ready to defend against the same threat, which could become another inexpensive way for insurgents to attack American forces.
 Col. Eric Mathewson, who directs the Air Force task force on pilotless aerial systems, said in an interview that the service sketched its vision to encourage contractors and university researchers to help create the technologies.
 Military contractors have already been rushing to expand in what promises to remain a prime growth area even as Pentagon budgets tighten. 
 In the last decade, the use of remotely piloted planes has soared in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency have fielded Cessna-size drones, called Predators and Reapers, to send back video of insurgent activity and mount missile attacks.
 Army units have used hand-launched models, which look like toy planes, to peer over hills or buildings. Other drones monitor the seas and eavesdrop from high altitudes, much like the storied U-2 spy planes.
 But many of the systems have been rushed out in an ''almost reactive'' fashion, Colonel Mathewson said. 
 ''At the same time, we have put industry and academia at a disadvantage because we haven't told them where we're going,'' he said. ''So we wanted to describe the future, so they could help us find the solutions.''
 Colonel Mathewson said the goal was to create economical alternatives for most Air Force missions. In that sense, the plan -- which was approved by Air Force Secretary Michael B. Donley and Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff -- helps cement a major cultural change at the service, where many pilots initially recoiled at the idea of drones.
 Colonel Mathewson said the service would like to create modular craft -- basic airframes that could be easily configured for different missions.
 The report envisions a family ranging from ''nano''-size drones that could flit inside buildings like moths to gather intelligence, to large aircraft that could be used as strategic bombers or aerial refueling tankers. Midsize drones could act like jet fighters, attacking other planes or ground targets and jamming enemy communications.
 The changes will begin with enhancements of current systems, Colonel Mathewson said. The more exotic changes would come from 2020 through the 2040s.
 Perhaps the most controversial is the idea of drones swarming on attack. Advances in computing power could enable them to mount preprogrammed attacks on their own, though that would be a difficult legal and ethical barrier for the military to cross.
 But before long, even a single insurgent could dispatch several small drones at once. Referring to the improvised explosive devices that insurgents have planted like mines in Iraq and Afghanistan, the report warned that the next inexpensive threat to American troops could be ''an airborne I.E.D.''

HEADLINE: A Retreat From Global Banking

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The era of financial globalization may be coming to an end.
 Virtually universal revulsion at the errors and excesses of the financial giants, and the global recession that resulted, has not led to any real consensus what to do about it, at either national or international levels. 
 Instead, countries are looking out for themselves, or simply quarreling. Recriminations are in fashion, whether against regulators who allowed bailed-out bankers to get big pay packages or against financial institutions that were unpopular in some countries long before the financial crisis.
 Samuel Johnson once said, ''when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.'' He might have added that a reprieve from the death penalty can cause the mind to wander. 
 That wandering can be seen in Britain, where the Labour government has put together a package of regulatory reforms that the Conservative opposition vows to repeal if it wins the next election, as is widely expected. 
 It can be seen in Washington where the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are being pilloried in Congress for actions that were necessary to avert a collapse of the global economy last fall.
 The Institute of International Finance, a group of the world's largest financial institutions -- the ones that would be most affected by a sharp retreat in financial globalization -- put out a report on Thursday pleading for international cooperation and voicing fears in particular about national efforts to apply differing standards for local affiliates of international banks.
 ''We are operating in a globally interconnected world where we need to strengthen the system's capacity to minimize the risks and to maximize the benefits of the interconnected global marketplace,'' said Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the institute.
 The big banks are particularly concerned about a proposal by Britain's Financial Services Authority to ''ring fence'' the assets of British subsidiaries of foreign financial firms. Other countries have indicated they may follow suit, noting the way Lehman Brothers brought assets home before it failed.
 For any one country, the group said, that might appear prudent. ''But this can only put the brakes on global recovery, global finance capacity and ability to respond to global liquidity problems.'' 
 But what was global before the crisis quickly turned local. The countries that suffered the most were those that had no locally owned banking system -- think of Eastern Europe -- and those that had banking systems far larger than the nation could afford to rescue -- think of Iceland. 
 To many, the crisis showed the dangers to so-called host countries of relying on foreign banks that are supervised by home country regulators. When bailouts were necessary, the home countries were reluctant to let the money be used overseas.
 Charles Dallara, the managing director of the institute, quoted a central banker as saying, privately and sadly, ''We are going back to a world of national banking.'' Mr. Dallara thinks that would be disastrous for global efficiency and global growth.
 There could be a healthy debate on that issue. Over the last 30 years, financial globalization appeared to be crucial to increasing global growth and prosperity. Is that record unworthy of respect in the aftermath of the collapse, or are there ways to keep the benefits while avoiding a new financial crisis?
 But that debate is not taking place. Among the leaders of the major countries, there is universal agreement that a coordinated global regulatory system is needed -- and little will to get such a system in place. They talk globally when the Group of 20 meets, and act locally when they return home. The banks admit they messed up, but plead for a new regulatory system that is consistent across borders and flexible enough to allow innovation. 
 In Europe, there is much more hostility to both credit rating agencies and to hedge funds than there is in the United States, albeit for reasons that have little to do with the crisis. So tougher rules may be applied there.
 In the United States, the Obama administration proposals may be faltering in Congress. It is not clear there are enough votes to create a consumer protection agency to review financial products. That is turf the Federal Reserve wants to occupy.
 Bankers, having survived because of bailouts, have recouped enough to be raising their own pay again, to the fury of many, and to be able to lobby politicians in both Europe and the United States to force a relaxation of accounting rules. That is now letting the banks report better profits, but at the cost of freezing some assets. If there were an active market in troubled assets, the banks might have to recognize losses they now can pretend will vanish if they are ignored.
 That lobbying battle, in which the banks have had at least the quiet support of some regulators, shows the risks of depending on bank regulators to perform other duties, like protecting consumers or regulating systemic risk.
 The first duty of banking regulators is to protect the banking system. That usually means keeping the banks healthy, which is in everyone's interest. But if the banks are weak, it can seem like a good idea to hide that weakness from the public, to buy time for the banks to regain health. That tendency to secrecy needs to be resisted, particularly since secrecy can also help to obscure the original regulatory failures that created the problem. Can we be sure that the Federal Reserve would put consumer protection over bank profits at a time of stress?
 It is amazing that these days the Fed is being raked over the coals not for its precrisis failures -- of inadequate regulation of the banks, no regulation of mortgage brokers and too-easy monetary policy as the housing bubble grew -- but for the steps it took to successfully contain the crisis last fall and winter.
 Even after several Congressional hearings, I'm still not sure if the Fed and the Treasury really forced Bank of America to complete its purchase of Merrill Lynch at the end of last year, or whether such an action would have been improper. But having lived through the aftermath of the Lehman collapse, I am glad I did not get to see how the markets and the economy would have responded to a New Year's eve crisis at Merrill.
 One measure of the post-Lehman panic is that the government ended up offering to guarantee all kinds of things that in any other environment would have seemed safe. When Neil Barofsky, the inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, totaled up all possible federal guarantees at $23.7 trillion recently, he included assets like Treasury bills in money market funds and mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 That is now being used to accuse those who fashioned the bailouts of having been overly generous to undeserving bankers. It should be used to remind everyone of just how close to disaster the financial world came -- and of the need to get the financial system working again, without public guarantees for everything in sight and with enough safeguards and regulation to avoid a new crisis.

HEADLINE: Credit Suisse Reports $1.5 Billion Profit

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; Mark McDonald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, cemented its place among those lenders that emerged relatively unscathed from the credit crisis on Thursday when it reported a rise in second-quarter profit because of a strong performance at its investment banking business.
 Profit rose 29 percent, to 1.6 billion Swiss francs, or $1.5 billion, from 1.22 billion francs a year earlier, as the bank gained market share in businesses like cash equities, foreign exchange and high-grade trading. 
 Earnings at Credit Suisse's investment bank rose fivefold in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations. Its private bank benefited from net new assets as competitors struggled. 
 ''These are very strong figures,'' said Christian Stark, an analyst at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux in Zurich. ''There is a good momentum in the core businesses, the growth in investment banking looks more sustainable, and the risk discipline is still there.''
 Brady W. Dougan, the Credit Suisse chief executive, is cutting 5,300 jobs and has exited businesses that required more capital and were relatively risky, like risk arbitrage and some proprietary trading. But Credit Suisse has also expanded its team of private bankers in certain regions to win clients and take advantage of the weakness of competitors like UBS and Merrill Lynch.
 UBS's private banking business suffered as clients withdrew billions of francs since the beginning of last year, partly because the bank's reputation had been damaged by an investigation by Washington into possible tax evasion by wealthy Americans. UBS said earlier that it expected a second-quarter loss, largely because of restructuring charges, when it reported on Aug. 4.
 Credit Suisse benefited from its relatively limited exposure to financial products linked to the subprime mortgage market, which Mr. Stark said now allowed the bank to build up capital faster. Unlike its rival, UBS, Credit Suisse was not forced to accept government funds to rebuild its capital. Instead, the bank raised 10 billion francs in October from investors in Qatar, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
 The bank also took steps to reduce risk. Credit Suisse cut its risk-weighted assets to $139 billion, down 10 percent from the first quarter of this year, and said previously that it planned to reduce the number to $135 billion by the end of this year. Like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, Credit Suisse benefited from growth at its investment banking business in the second quarter as rivals continue to struggle. Morgan Stanley reported a second-quarter loss from continuing operations of $159 million on Wednesday.
 Mr. Dougan said that he expected further challenges globally but added, ''If markets continue to improve, we expect to see further momentum across all our businesses.'' He said that unlike some competitors, Credit Suisse did not believe that the banking industry would return to its practices before the recession. 
 ''Clients, investors and regulators will behave differently in the medium to long term,'' he said in a conference call from Zurich.
 At its investment banking unit, pretax profit rose to 1.66 billion francs, from 304 million francs a year earlier, and revenue from sales and trading more than doubled. Private banking, which includes wealth management and corporate and retail banking, brought in 10.7 billion francs in net new assets. Of that, wealth management had a net inflow of 8.5 b francs, beating analysts' expectations, even though it was below the 15.4 billion francs the bank attracted in the same period last year. 
 ''We had a solid quarter in private banking, with strong inflows across all regions and a high gross margin in wealth management,'' Mr. Dougan said. Yet credit provisions continued to rise at its retail banking unit, making its performance the only one to disappoint some analysts. Provisions for credit losses rose to 75 million francs in the second quarter, from 5 million francs a year earlier.

HEADLINE: The Dow Sails Past 9,000

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
The numbers are a bit breathtaking: In a little more than four months, the Dow Jones industrial average has leapt more than 2,500 points -- nearly 39 percent -- to close above 9,000 for the first time since January.
 Behind that meteoric rise, capped by a 188-point gain on Thursday, is a growing belief that profits at many blue-chip corporations are starting to bounce back, despite the tough economy. 
 In the last week alone more than 100 major companies, from 3M to Intel, reported quarterly earnings that surpassed Wall Street's predictions. Even one of the troubled Detroit automakers -- Ford Motor -- managed to beat expectations Thursday.
 Wall Street remains wary. Many of the cheery earnings reports, analysts contend, mask fundamental weaknesses. At Ford, I.B.M., Starbucks and others, for instance, the latest results were driven not by a rise in sales, but by a decline in costs -- in other words, by aggressive penny-pinching and, in some cases, big layoffs.
 And no sooner did the Dow close above 9,000 on Thursday than two of its 30 members -- Microsoft and American Express -- reported disappointing results, and stock futures promptly fell. 
 ''You've got to be kind of skeptical about it,'' Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at Standard and Poor's, said of the apparent rebound. ''What we've seen is just nice presentations and spreadsheets.''
 According to the S.& P.'s data, Mr. Silverblatt said, sales at major corporations fell 7.1 percent in the second quarter from the period a year earlier. That is actually a bit of good news, since sales plunged 16 percent in the first quarter. But Mr. Silverblatt said many businesses will be in trouble if they cannot increase sales by the fourth quarter. ''There's only so much you can cut,'' he said. 
 Before the disappointments from Microsoft and American Express, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.03 points, or 2.12 percent, to 9,069.29. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 22.22 points, or 2.33 percent, to 976.29, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 47.22 points, or 2.45 percent, to 1,973.60. 
 While all three indexes have recovered strongly from their lows of March, the broad S.& P. 500 is still far below where it was a year ago, when it was flying high near 1,300. 
 Where stocks go from here will, of course, depend on the course of the economy. Some economists caution that the incipient economic recovery could falter, resulting in a double-dip recession that would snuff out the recent stock market rally.
 But for now, the optimists say that poking holes in recent earnings statements misses the point. Investors, as ever, are looking ahead, and they are bullish on the prospects of many companies.
 ''The excitement is where we might be 12 months from now,'' said David Kovacs, the chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners. ''It does require some leap of faith, but I find this rally extremely justifiable.''
 Others point out that the improvement in the financial markets will help companies recover. 
 Many companies, including AT&T and Xerox, have managed to sell new shares to primp their balance sheets and raise cash. Others have sold bonds as the credit markets have thawed. Ford and others have refinanced their credit lines -- a feat that would have been difficult, if not impossible, to pull off only months ago. And big banks, though suffering from bad loans, have at least stabilized. 
 Stephen Stanley, the chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said that during this recession companies have cut back far more quickly and efficiently than they did in the past.
 ''Firms are now much more nimble in terms of their payroll,'' he said.
 But given the deep cuts, Mr. Stanley said the worry is that even though the economy might recover, employment could lag. 
 ''The fear now is a jobless recovery,'' he said. ''Firms have cut operations to the bone.''
 In other news, the September crude oil contract rose $1.76, to $67.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 ''The outlook for oil is still pretty positive,'' said Benjamin Dell, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''What we're seeing is demand beginning to recover particularly in Asia.''
 He added, ''Arguably we expect the price of oil to continue to push up beyond $75 a barrel as we get toward the end of the year.'' 
 Demand for Treasuries continued to fall as the equities markets attracted investor capital. The government also announced that it would auction a record $115 billion worth of bonds in July. 
 The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell by 29/32, to 95 20/32. The yield rose to 3.66 percent, from 3.54 percent Wednesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Shift Afghan Narcotics Strategy

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The American-led mission in Afghanistan is all but abandoning efforts to destroy the poppy crops that provide the largest source of income to the insurgency, and instead will take significant steps to wean local farmers off the drug trade -- including one proposal to pay them to grow nothing.
 The strategy will shift from wiping out opium poppy crops, which senior officials acknowledged had served only to turn poor farmers into enemies of the central government in Kabul. New operations are already being mounted to attack not the crops, but the drug runners and the drug lords aligned with the insurgency. 
 Ultimately, farmers must be persuaded to plant other crops, including wheat for domestic consumption and pomegranates and flowers for export, officials said.
 Michael G. Vickers, the Pentagon's top civilian official for counter-insurgency strategy, said Thursday that the specifics of the new antidrug effort still needed to be worked out, but that a decision had been reached on the new focus.
 ''We are reorienting our counternarcotics strategy rather significantly for Afghanistan to put much less emphasis on eradication and to shift the weight of our effort to interdiction,'' Mr. Vickers said.
 The new strategy will ''particularly focus on going after those targets where there is a strong nexus between the insurgency and the narcotics trade, to deny resources to the Taliban,'' he told a group of reporters.
 Mr. Vickers, who was the principal C.I.A. strategist for arming anti-Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the mid-1980s, also predicated that there would be ''more focus on other agricultural initiatives'' in the coming year. 
 One short-term solution being urged by senior Defense Department and military officials would be to pay Afghan farmers not to plant poppies in the next growing season. 
 ''To the degree we don't do that, we are at risk for a continuing of both poppy growth as well as sustaining the insurgency, since profits go to the Taliban,'' a senior military official told a small group of reporters earlier this week.
 The official, who asked not to be named because he did not want to be identified discussing a program still under debate, said he did not know what such a program would cost the United States. He described it as a stopgap measure until the United States could put a long-term agricultural program in place in Afghanistan.
 It could take years to supply different seeds and build the new irrigation systems, transportation routes and markets required to turn Afghan agriculture away from a poppy economy.
 That long-term effort, the official said, includes ''a diversity of crops, irrigation systems'' and ''government support at every level to be able to sustain that.'' 
 Richard C. Holbrooke, the administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, briefed allies on the shift last month, and has said that ''the Western policies against the opium crop, the poppy crop, have been a failure.'' Allied officials at the recent meeting of the Group of 8 industrial countries welcomed the change.
 Past efforts that focused on eradicating the poppy crop in Afghanistan ''wasted hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars'' and ''did not result in any damage to the Taliban -- but they put farmers out of work and they alienated people and drove people into the arms of the Taliban,'' Mr. Holbrooke said last month.
 Afghanistan supplies 90 percent of the world's heroin, and the drug trade is estimated to account for about half of Afghanistan's economy. Various official estimates say that the Taliban earn as much as $300 million annually from the opium trade.

HEADLINE: Ex-Premier Withdraws From Election In Kyrgyzstan

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
The leading opposition candidate in Kyrgyzstan essentially withdrew from the presidential race on Thursday even before voting had concluded, asserting that widespread fraud had assured the incumbent's victory. 
 The candidate, Almazbek Atambaev, a former prime minister, called on the public and international organizations to reject the election as unlawful. Mr. Atambaev instructed supporters who were working as observers at polling and vote-counting stations to leave, and he demanded that a new election be organized.
 ''The authorities understood that they would lose an honest and free election, which is why they relied on force -- relied on force against their own people!'' he said in a statement. 
 Election officials dismissed his accusations, saying that the balloting was legitimate. Official results were not expected to be released until Friday morning.
 The Russian state news agency said an exit poll showed the incumbent, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, with 67 percent of the vote, and Mr. Atambaev with 13 percent. The opposition called the exit poll false and said it planned protests against the election. The government said such actions were illegal and would be blocked.
 Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia that is host to an important American military base that supports operations in Afghanistan, has regularly faced political turmoil in recent years. It has also been the site of a tug of war between the United States and Russia over influence in Central Asia.
 Mr. Bakiyev took power after the so-called Tulip Revolution of 2005, which ousted a government that was considered corrupt.
 He had been expected to win a second term easily, though there was disagreement in Kyrgyzstan over why. His supporters said he had steered his poor country, which has five million people, through difficult times caused by the financial crisis and had garnered strong popularity.
 The opposition has derided him as an autocrat who has persecuted opposition leaders and independent journalists. 
 Mr. Bakiyev has accused the opposition of airing phony charges of vote-rigging in an effort to explain away its lack of popularity. Voting on Thursday, he declared that the voting would be fair, saying that the Kyrgyz people cared about democracy.
 ''Each person understands that the fate of the nation, and his own future, depends on his choice,'' the president said.
 Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe were in Kyrgyzstan to monitor the election, and they said they would deliver a preliminary report on Friday.
 American officials have generally refrained from criticizing the Kyrgyz government in recent months. They have focused on ensuring that the United States military can remain at the air base near the capital, Bishkek.
 In February, Mr. Bakiyev announced that he was closing the base, apparently at Moscow's behest. But he reversed his decision after lobbying by Washington, which agreed to pay more rent.

HEADLINE: Hyundai Sets Record For Profit In Quarter

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Hyundai Motor Company outshined its global rivals by reporting a record quarterly profit on Thursday, as a weak won helped overseas sales and government incentives increased domestic demands for cars. 
 Net income between April and June soared 48 percent, to 811.9 billion won ($650 million), the company, South Korea's largest car maker, said in a statement. The figure compared with 546.9 billion won in net profit in the same quarter a year earlier and 225 billion in the first quarter of this year. 
 Sales in the April-June period rose to 8.08 trillion won from 6.03 trillion won in the first quarter, but fell from 9.11 trillion won a year before. 
 Like its competitors, Hyundai has been hit by falling demand amid the global economic downturn. But it has worked aggressively to expand its market share, seizing on its improving global brand image, a growing appetite for smaller cars and the benefits of a weak South Korean currency which makes Korean cars cheaper abroad. 
 The won's value in the second quarter was down 20.8 percent against the United States dollar from a year earlier. 
 Hyundai's overseas affiliates, especially those in China and India, contributed to the strong numbers, Hyundai said. Sales in China during the first half of this year surged 56 percent. 
 In the first half of the year, Hyundai's global market share reached 5 percent for the first time. It carved out 4.3 percent of the light vehicle market in the United States, compared with a 3.1 percent share a year earlier, thanks to stronger sales of the Elantra and Accent models. Market shares for Toyota and General Motors slipped in the same period. 
 At home, Hyundai attributed the gain to rising demand for new vehicles spurred by government incentives to trade in older models, such as tax cuts and easier consumer financing. Overseas, it also bolstered its expenditures for marketing to lure customers into its showrooms. 
 Hyundai, together with its affiliate Kia Motors Corporation, forms the world's fifth-biggest automotive group.

HEADLINE: An Afghan Challenger Campaigns to Crowds

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

DATELINE: HERAT, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
When Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, the main election challenger to President Hamid Karzai, arrived here to campaign last weekend, thousands of supporters choked the six-mile drive from the airport. Cars were plastered with his posters. Motorbikes flew blue banners. Young men wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his face leapt aboard his car to embrace him to ecstatic cheers.
 With only a month to go, Dr. Abdullah has started his campaign late, but in its first two weeks he has canvassed six provinces and drawn growing support and larger crowds than expected. Rapturous welcomes like this one have suddenly elevated him to the status of potential future president. 
 ''I have no doubt that people want change,'' Dr. Abdullah said in an interview after a tumultuous day campaigning in Herat, in western Afghanistan, adding that his momentum was just building. ''Today they are hopeful that change can come.''
 Mr. Karzai is still widely considered the front-runner in the campaign for the Aug. 20 presidential election. But Dr. Abdullah, who has the backing of the largest opposition group, the National Front, is the one candidate among the field of 41 who has a chance of forcing Mr. Karzai into a runoff, a contest between the top two vote-getters if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the votes in the first balloting. 
 Already well known among most Afghans, Dr. Abdullah, 48, an ophthalmologist, has a background that includes years of resistance to Soviet and Taliban rule as well as a crucial role in the formation of the new democratic government after the American intervention. 
 A dapper dresser, wearing traditional Afghan clothes under a variety of Western tailored jackets, he combines solidarity with the former resistance fighters with the moderation of the Afghan intellectual, giving him potentially broad appeal.
 After serving as foreign minister in Mr. Karzai's government for five years, he left in 2006 and has since become a strong critic of the president's leadership. He refused an offer to become Mr. Karzai's running mate, and he contends that the president practices a policy of divide and rule that has polarized the country. 
 Today, Dr. Abdullah, with a diplomat and a surgeon as his running mates, is seen as part of a younger generation of Afghans keen to move away from the nation's reliance on warlords and older mujahedeen leaders and to clean up and recast the practice of governing.
 To do that, he advocates the devolution of power from the strong presidency built up under Mr. Karzai to a parliamentary system that he says will be more representative. He is also calling for a system of electing officials for Afghanistan's 34 provinces and nearly 400 districts as a way to build support for the government.
 Those provincial governors are now appointed from Kabul, and many have been criticized for cronyism and corruption. Influential Shiite clerics here in Herat, who supported Mr. Karzai in the last election in 2004, are now so fed up with corrupt appointees that they have said they will back Dr. Abdullah this time.
 Re-engaging the people is essential to reverse the lawlessness and insecurity that have reached a critical point in much of the country, Dr. Abdullah said. ''They have managed to lose the people,'' he said of the current government. ''In fighting an insurgency, you lose the people and you lose the war.'' 
 Before several thousand people in Herat's sports stadium, he raised the biggest cheer with his promise to build up Afghan institutions so that foreign troops could go home soon. 
 He also promised to curb the rampant corruption and review foreign assistance programs to ensure that they focused on grass-roots development and addressed poverty and unemployment. In his public meetings, he emphasized support for the rights of women, the unemployed, the disabled and the victims of war. 
 He said he would work seriously toward reconciliation with the Taliban, calling the current process a ''joke.'' Yet in an interview he retained his longtime opposition to the Taliban leadership and said he doubted that the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was ready to negotiate for peace.
 This is only the second national presidential election in Afghanistan's history, and political analysts warn that it is virtually impossible to predict how the election will go or to read voters' intentions. Diplomats calculating the numbers of the various factions that have come out in support of Mr. Karzai say that he will just scrape back in, thanks largely to the support from the largest ethnic group, his fellow Pashtuns.
 Yet two opinion polls conducted this year suggested that Mr. Karzai had lost considerable support since his 2004 victory with 55 percent of the vote. One of those polls, conducted in May by the International Republican Institute, a nonprofit pro-democracy group, showed that Mr. Karzai's support was down to 31 percent. While only 7 percent said they would vote for Dr. Abdullah, the poll indicated that the election would have to go to a second round.
 People interviewed in Herat also spoke of a shift in the public mood. ''Karzai has governed for eight years and all the problems have increased, not decreased,'' said Hosseini, 47, a farmer who uses one name and who traveled to the city to hear Dr. Abdullah speak. 
 Although Dr. Abdullah has significant support in the north and the large population centers, he will have difficulty campaigning in the south, where the insurgency makes movement virtually impossible. 
 And although he may tap into the desire for change after nearly eight years of Mr. Karzai's rule, supporters and analysts say Mr. Karzai will still dominate in his Pashtun homeland in Kandahar, in the south.
 Dr. Abdullah also claims heritage from Kandahar through his father, Ghulam Muhayuddine Khan, a Pashtun who was a senator in the 1970s. Yet he is far better known for his connection to the northern Panjshir Valley, through his mother and his close relationship with the famous resistance commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, who fought both the Russian occupation and the Taliban. 
 Dr. Abdullah dismissed suggestions that he could not raise support in the Pashtun south and said that support for Mr. Karzai in the area had dropped drastically as security had worsened and more people had joined the insurgency. ''Southern Afghanistan has nearly announced jihad against Karzai,'' he said.

BYLINE: By NICK KAYE

 BODY:
''WE'RE quite excited -- I guess the right word would be relieved -- to be progressing the project rapidly to opening,'' Richard Holland, the co-developer of Capella Pedregal, a resort and residential development perched at the tip of the Baja peninsula in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, said in an interview in the spring. 
 An upscale project that includes hotel rooms and residences, Capella Pedregal was expected to make its debut in fall 2007. At least that was the plan in mid-2006, when it was one of the first projects to be covered in the Breaking Ground column in Escapes. 
 Last November owners began arriving, and the 66-room hotel welcomed its first customers this month. And while a yearlong delay may seem like a blemish for such a high-profile project, Mr. Holland knows well that things could be a great deal worse. 
 ''There are a lot of projects,'' he said by phone as construction rumbled in the background, ''that aren't in a position to proceed forward.''
 The market for new vacation homes, like the housing market in general, has gone through a shake-up, traveling from boom to bust as prices have dropped and projects have been stalled or called off altogether. While it is hard to chronicle the fate of every new vacation-home project announced in the past few years, a look back at some of the nearly 300 projects featured in the Breaking Ground column does provide one window into the market. 
 While some projects featured in the column, like Capella Pedregal, have managed to weather the storm, many have been far less fortunate.
 Take, for instance, the Trump Ocean Resort Baja on the outskirts of Tijuana, Mexico, which was profiled in January 2007. One news report described the scene when sales began at a 2006 event in San Diego, where buyers watched ''a giant screen showing units getting snapped up'' for a total of $122 million. 
 Now the project has been dropped altogether, having failed to secure construction financing, and Donald Trump, who has said he merely licensed the Trump name and was not a developer of the project, is being sued, along with the Los Angeles developer Irongate and others, by buyers who say they lost as much as $18 million in deposits, according to Bart I. Ring, a lawyer representing the group of buyers. 
 In turn Mr. Trump is suing members of the development group for failing to complete the project. Timothy J. Hughes, a lawyer for the developer PB Impulsores, said that buyers were notified of the nature of the Trump Organization's relationship with the development. The Trump Organization declined to comment.
 It is not all bad news for projects bearing the Trump brand, though. The high-rise Trump Ocean Club in Panama City, featured in May 2006, is faring well, said Roger Khafif, the president of the project's development company, the K Group, with more than 80 percent of its 1,030 residences under contract. The true test of the project's success, however, will come when closings are held upon completion, which Mr. Khafif now expects to come late next year.
 Mr. Khafif said recently that he was ''very comfortable that the building will be finished.''
 In Costa Rica a number of projects have been suspended, including the St. Regis Resort & Residences, which was being financed by Lehman Brothers. The project, on the central Pacific coast, had been expected to open early this year, but Ronald Arias, the operations manager for Grupo Inmobiliaria Genesis, the project's co-developer, said there is ''no specific schedule'' to resume construction.
 The Paradis project on St. Lucia in the eastern Caribbean is also now in a holding pattern. Construction was halted last October after the development lost financing, said Kierron Dolby, the managing director of the development company, DCG Properties Limited. Its Web site, leparadisstlucia.com, shows shells of oceanfront buildings and swaths of dirt where a Westin hotel with residences and a Greg Norman-designed golf course were expected to be up and running by fall 2007.
 Times like these are ''when your mettle is being tested, quite frankly,'' Mr. Dolby said. Seemingly undeterred by setbacks, he noted that new financing has just been established, and that he expects the project to come to fruition in fall 2010.
 ''I'm not looking at the short-term gain,'' Mr. Dolby added. ''My long-term gain for this project is the legacy that I leave behind me.''
 The National Association of Realtors recently released survey results that detail how the economic downturn has affected second-home sales in the United States, which, according to the group, represented 40 percent of the country's market in 2005. 
 ''That was unsustainable,'' Walter Molony, a spokesman for the trade group, said. ''And it was driven by speculative investment.''
 By last year second-home purchases had fallen to 30 percent of the market, with the number of vacation-home sales declining by nearly 31 percent from 2007. 
 ''About a third of sales being second homes is normal over time,'' Mr. Molony added. ''So we're below the normal demand right now.''
 These figures do not include Americans buying abroad, nor do they factor in foreigners buying homes in the United States, Mr. Molony said, which is a significant market in places like Florida, where, he noted, 15 percent of all purchases are second homes bought by overseas buyers.
 The Miami area was a hot spot at the market's peak; it is also now home to many struggling and scrapped projects. Chi, a 42-story tower that was planned to rise over Sunny Isles Beach, was startling in its level of luxury. It was to have only one 4,700-square-foot residence per floor, priced from $5.2 million, with amenities like private mineral-water swimming pools and a Bentley with a chauffeur. 
 Construction never started, said the lead developer, Bruce Goldstein, because the project was unable to secure a loan. He still hopes to resurrect plans at some point, he said, adding, ''If the world changes, we're going to give it a try.''
 Another high-end project is the 4,000-acre Hampton Island Preserve, on barrier islands along the Georgia coast. The community was expected to be completed last year, but in September 2006 a new group of owners took over and altered some plans, acquiring land and more than doubling the number of homesites. So far a handful of houses have been completed or are in development. 
 Ron Leventhal, the managing partner of the company that now owns Hampton Island Preserve, said recently that 12 sites have been sold since early last year. A golf course and an equestrian center are open, he said. 
 The South Peak Resort in Lincoln, N.H., was among the first ski-area projects to be included in the column, in July 2006. Last year it was one of five developments sold by Centex Destination Properties -- whose parent company has since been acquired by Pulte Homes -- to Macfarlan Capital Partners of Dallas. Designed to coincide with a recent expansion of the Loon Mountain ski area, which is now connected to the South Peak Resort's site by trails that lead to a high-speed quad lift, it has 40 condos and 66 homesites that are nearly all sold.
 ''It has been one of those resorts that was planned and delivered in stages that are reasonable,'' Dean Macfarlan, the managing partner of the new ownership company, said. ''It wasn't such a massive undertaking.''
 When it comes to massive undertakings it is hard to get much bigger than Tamarack Resort in Idaho, which was billed as the country's first ski resort to be created from scratch in decades. The resort opened in late 2004 and seemed to pick up steam in 2006, when Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf announced plans to help create a resort and residential development there with the Fairmont brand. 
 The project was to include nearly 350 condo-hotel units and private residences on two sites, and $140 million worth of residences were purchased in less than seven hours when sales began in early 2007, according to a news release issued soon after. But last year, after Tamarack was sued for foreclosure, Joel Goldman, a representative of one of the development companies involved in the Fairmont project, told The Associated Press that it had been shelved. Reached recently by phone, Mr. Goldman declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Tamarack was closed indefinitely last March. 
 The current second-home landscape may seem somewhat bleak, but Mr. Molony of the Realtors association said he still has a positive outlook on the future of the market. 
 ''The fundamental demand has not gone away,'' he said. ''It's just been postponed.''

HEADLINE: Clinton and North Korea Engage in Tense Exchange

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PHUKET, Thailand 

 BODY:
The United States and North Korea fell into an acrimonious exchange on Thursday, with the North Korean government ridiculing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as a ''schoolgirl'' and a ''pensioner,'' two days after she referred to its leaders as ''unruly children.''
 At a meeting of Southeast Asian nations here, the war of words competed for attention with Mrs. Clinton's campaign to marshal worldwide pressure on the North Koreans to dismantle their nuclear weapons program. 
 On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry in North Korea issued a statement criticizing remarks Mrs. Clinton made this week to ABC News, in which she said the best response to North Korea's behavior would be to ignore it, as one would a child clamoring for attention.
 ''We cannot but regard Mrs. Clinton as a funny lady, as she likes to utter such rhetoric, unaware of the elementary etiquette in the international community,'' the North Korean statement said. ''Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping.''
 North Korea said it would defend its sovereignty against the United States, which it accuses of aiming nuclear weapons at it. 
 The ill will surfaced vividly during a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, at this Thai resort when the North Korean delegation turned up on a hotel podium to deliver a scheduled statement.
 The officials were told that Mrs. Clinton was due to speak soon, though she was running late, as she has often this week. After huddling, they stalked away and held a news conference nearby, at which they reiterated that North Korea would never return to multiparty talks with South Korea, Japan, Russia, China and the United States, talks that are aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions.
 For her part, Mrs. Clinton said she was encouraged by the international support for putting pressure on North Korea. Even Myanmar, she said, responded to requests by China and other countries to track a North Korean freighter this month that American officials suspected was carrying illicit cargo.
 ''The international community's response to North Korea's actions has been unequivocal and nearly unanimous, leading to a new consensus,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference, during which she read a lengthy statement restating the American policy on North Korea.
 She said there was a commitment to carry out the sanctions called for in a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted in June after North Korea's recent arms tests. Among its measures, the resolution bans weapons shipments to North Korea and seeks to squeeze the sources of financing for its nuclear and missile programs.
 Mrs. Clinton singled out China, an influential neighbor, for asking officials in Myanmar, formerly Burma, to help in dealing with the North Korean freighter, which was steaming toward Myanmar. The vessel, the Kang Nam 1, eventually turned around on its own, and she called China's pressure a ''proximate cause.''
 She said she would discuss further steps in pressing North Korea with senior Chinese officials during consultations with China next week in Washington. Mrs. Clinton is leading the strategic and economic dialogue jointly with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. 
 The United States has talked to China and other countries about a package of incentives, including economic and energy aid, which could be offered to North Korea in return for dismantling its nuclear program.
 But even before Thursday's vitriolic statements from North Korea, American officials said they were more focused for now on inflicting pain on North Korea than on luring it back to the bargaining table. 
 ''We are not interested in half measures,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We have no desire to pursue protracted negotiations that will only lead us right back to where we have already been.''
 Mrs. Clinton said the North Koreans had been intransigent in their public statements during the conference. Other senior American officials said the tone of the North's statements was openly hostile.
 Still, Mrs. Clinton may have contributed to the chilly atmosphere in her remarks just before the meeting. ''Maybe it's the mother in me,'' she told ABC News, ''the experience I've had with small children and teenagers and people who are demanding attention: don't give it to them.''

HEADLINE: Porsche, Agreeing to Takeover by VW, Ousts Its Chief and Will Sell a Stake to Qatar

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The largest European carmarker, Volkswagen, moved quickly on Thursday to consolidate its grip on Porsche, which dismissed Wendelin Wiedeking, its chief executive, who had sought to take over VW in a quest that fell apart along with the global financial system.
 Writing another chapter in the crisis-driven reordering of the global auto industry, Porsche's supervisory board reached an agreement with Mr. Wiedeking calling for his departure. It approved plans for the new chief executive, Michael Macht, to secure an investment of billions of euros from the government of Qatar. 
 That will ease the way for the creation of an integrated automobile company that includes Porsche as the 10th brand in Volkswagen's stable.
 Alluding to Audi, the premium brand that Volkswagen turned into a profitable franchise in the United States and elsewhere, Volkswagen's chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, predicted that Porsche would take advantage of the larger company's economies of scale while protecting its brand in the eyes of its customers.
 ''We can call on our considerable experience in the integration of proud and successful brands rich in tradition,'' Mr. Winterkorn said after a VW board meeting in Stuttgart. ''Like Audi today, Porsche can also continue its independent development under the aegis of Volkswagen and preserve its own identity.'' 
 The various owners and interests of Volkswagen -- a patchwork of rich families, influential unions and the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns about 20 percent -- must still negotiate the precise details of the combination, while adding a newcomer from a Persian Gulf emirate. 
 A similar declaration in May led to weeks of bickering between the two companies. But the departure of Mr. Wiedeking, who had fiercely defended Porsche's independence, removes a serious stumbling block to integration -- with VW in control.
 Christian Wulff, the premier of Lower Saxony, said the companies would complete the immediate details in time for a board meeting in mid-August and that a final merger could be completed by mid-2011.
 Wolfgang Porsche, the chairman of the sports car maker, and Ferdinand Piech, his cousin and the chairman of Volkswagen, both issued statements in support of this goal, with Mr. Porsche emphasizing the need to preserve ''the Porsche brand.''
 ''The merger with Volkswagen is a done deal now,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Studies at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
 If the combination with Porsche pans out, Volkswagen would add a gold-plated name in automaking to its lineup, a step that its backers view as a logical extension of the company's growth strategy.
 VW sold 6.3 million vehicles last year, making it one of the largest automakers in the world, while Porsche sold about 100,000 vehicles.
 Though the company sells more Volkswagens than it does any other brand, it also makes Bentley and Lamborghini, as well as Audi sports cars, and gives its executives considerable leeway in managing their brands.
 Mr. Porsche, the gentle patron behind Mr. Wiedeking for the last 18 years, acknowledged Thursday that a different future awaited the company, which his grandfather founded as an automotive consulting and design firm in 1931.
 Choking up as he addressed Porsche's employees in Stuttgart, Mr. Porsche promised that the storied company would thrive in its new form. 
 ''Count on me,'' Mr. Porsche said. ''The Porsche myth is alive and will never die.''
 Porsche also announced the departure of Holger P. Harter, its chief financial officer and a close confidant of Mr. Wiedeking. 
 Mr. Harter gained notoriety for engineering Porsche's purchase of VW shares using complex financial derivatives, a strategy that at one point led to an epic squeeze on those investors who had bet VW shares would fall.
 Under the agreement with Porsche's supervisory board, it will raise at least 5 billion euros, or $7.1 billion, in new capital, a portion of which will come from selling a stake to Qatar. Porsche needs fresh cash to ease its 9 billion euro debt burden, which it accumulated to buy slightly more than 50 percent of VW.
 The Piech and Porsche families, which control the company's voting shares, will buy new shares as well, or make a ''contribution in kind,'' Porsche said. 
 That refers to the possibility that the families would combine with Porsche their lucrative business in distributing Volkswagen brands in Austria and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.
 Mr. Winterkorn also said that by buying a package of options from Porsche, Qatar would acquire 17 percent of Volkswagen, making it the company's third-largest investor after Porsche and Lower Saxony.
 The decisions Thursday, however, portend considerable friction over the unresolved question of whether Volkswagen would buy shares in Porsche itself as part of the integration of the two companies.
 ''You need Qatar, Porsche and Volkswagen to create a healthy integrated company,'' said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of automotive research in London for Credit Suisse in London.
 Volkswagen said it would do so ''step by step,'' but Porsche made no mention of the idea, which would allow VW to mimic the influence that Porsche already has over the larger company. 
 Mr. Piech, the Volkswagen chairman who is also on Porsche's board, has pushed strongly for an acquisition of Porsche shares once the smaller company brought in fresh capital to ease its debt load, a step Mr. Wiedeking had opposed.

HEADLINE: President Obama, Professor Gates and the Cambridge Police

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
The American obsession with people who are said to transcend race began long before Barack Obama moved into the White House -- long before he even thought about running for president. Affluent, well-educated black people were being appropriated as symbols of racial progress -- and held up as proof that racism no longer mattered -- back when Mr. Obama was still a youth in short pants.
 White Americans have little experience with this brand of appropriation. In general, their personal and professional triumphs are viewed as the product of individual fortitude and evidence that the founding ideals of the nation are alive and well. 
 Successful African-Americans -- whether they are sports stars, entertainers or politicians -- are often accorded a more tortured significance. In addition to being held up as proof that racism has been extinguished, they are often employed as weapons in the age-old campaign to discredit, and even demean, the disadvantaged. 
 ''Don't talk to us about discrimination,'' the argument typically goes. ''You made it. If the others got off their behinds and tried, they would, too.'' In this rhetoric of race, there is no such thing as social disadvantage, only hard-working, morally upright people who succeed, and lazy, morally defective people who do not.
 Black Americans who find this line of argument appealing, along with the celebrity it brings them, typically end up trumpeting exceptionalism, playing down the significance of discrimination, and lecturing black people (nearly always in front of white audiences) to stop whining about racism and get on with it.
 Mr. Obama has refused to play this role, even though people have tried to thrust it upon him. He has made clear all along that the election of the first African-American president, while noteworthy in a nation built on the backs of slaves, did not signal a sudden, magical end to discrimination.
 He underscored this point again this week when he commented on the arrest in Cambridge, Mass., of the Harvard African-American scholar (and my longtime friend) Henry Louis Gates Jr. and about the tendency of police officers to target blacks and Hispanics for traffic stops. 
 These remarks could change how the news media sees the president's views on race. Up to now, he has been consistently and wrongly portrayed as a stern black exceptionalist who takes Negroes to task for not meeting his standard. 
 He is not happy with this characterization. That was clear in a recent Oval Office interview with the columnist Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post. Mr. Obama complained about the press coverage of his speeches and seemed especially miffed about the portrayal of the one he delivered before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People this month.
 He suggested that the news media had overemphasized his remarks about ''personal responsibility'' -- a venerable theme in the African-American church -- while disregarding ''the whole other half of the speech,'' which included a classic exercise in civil-rights oratory.
 The president described disproportionate rates of unemployment, imprisonment and lack of health insurance in minority communities as barriers of the moment. He contrasted them with the clubs and police dogs that black marchers faced in the 1960s and said that solving present-day problems would require comparable determination. 
 And ''make no mistake,'' he continued, ''the pain of discrimination is still felt in America. By African-American women paid less for doing the same work as colleagues of a different color and a different gender.''
 This was no exceptionalist rant. Speaking to Mr. Robinson, the president used the first-person plural revealingly when he said: ''I do think it is important for the African-American community, in its diversity, to stay true to one core aspect of the African-American experience, which is we know what it's like to be on the outside.'' 
 During the campaign, Mr. Obama tended to avoid direct engagement with racial issues until circumstances (a tempest over his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright) made further evasion impossible.
 He reached a similar moment when he was asked to comment on Mr. Gates's arrest at a White House news conference on Wednesday. 
 In a remark that became instantly famous, he responded that the police acted ''stupidly'' in arresting Mr. Gates when no crime had been committed and the professor was standing in his own home. Mr. Obama further noted that disproportionate attention from the police was an unwelcome fact of black life in America. 
 People who have heretofore viewed Mr. Obama as a ''postracial'' abstraction were no doubt surprised by these remarks. This could be because they were hearing him fully for the first time.

HEADLINE: Health Care: Obama States His Case

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''President Seeks Public's Support on Health Care'' (front page, July 23):
 I listened to President Obama's news conference on the subject of health care for all Americans. I must say it left me with a deep sense of frustration.
 We already have a successful federal health care program: Medicare. Even many physicians prefer it over the various programs sold by insurance companies. Why don't we just gradually lower the age of eligibility until all Americans are covered? Or is that too easy? 
 Bernard F. Erlanger New York, July 23, 2009
 The writer is emeritus professor of microbiology at Columbia University.
 To the Editor:
 Once again, on reading the various pundits, I feel as if I'm in a looking-glass world.
 Did we hear the same news conference? I heard President Obama make a cogent, intelligent argument for fixing a health care system that is very broken; they heard that he did not lie or pander to the American public, which is apparently bad politics. Maybe it is.
 More's the pity.
 Michelle Bisson Tarrytown, N.Y., July 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 President Obama pointed out in his news conference that every member of Congress has great health insurance, and yet some are resisting making it available to all Americans. Maybe it's kind of hard to feel the pain of those without it when you have created the best for yourselves.
 Nancy Oliveira San Francisco, July 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Real Challenge to Health Bill: Selling Reform'' (Economic Scene, front page, July 22):
 David Leonhardt says that the ''typical person,'' one of the 90 percent of voters who already have health insurance, thinks that the Democratic health care plans offer nothing for them except higher taxes.
 As one of those 90 percent, I disagree. Beyond thinking that a rich society ought to be able to provide this basic need of life as a matter of course, the main reason to support strong universal health care is personal and family security: removing the weight of vulnerability to misfortune.
 This is not just personal: we should not underestimate the corrosive effects of pervasive insecurity on American democracy. The recent trajectory of our society has whole segments seeing an increasingly tenuous hold on a middle-class lifestyle, and health care economic worries are a big part of that. This is a deeply destructive dynamic that bodes poorly for the American project. 
 Those who can't conceive of losing their health insurance (which includes members of Congress and most influential political actors, and most of their friends) do not seem to appreciate that widespread personal vulnerability can translate into a caustic political culture.
 Avoiding that future concerns me greatly, even though I myself have no worry about my own insurance.
 William S. Kessler Seattle, July 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 ''What's in it for me?'' may be asked by healthy people who are covered by health insurance plans -- that is, until they become ill. Once serious illness strikes, profit-minded insurance bureaucrats come between patient and doctor; and uncovered bills and expenses mount.
 Everyone has a stake in health care reform. He just might not know it yet. 
 Carol Messineo Brooklyn, July 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As David Leonhardt rightly points out, one of the great barriers to health reform is that because most Americans already have health insurance, they don't see ''what's in it for me.'' Consequently, there is considerable resistance to the increased cost that health reform will require. 
 One possible answer is to include coverage for home- and community-based long-term care services -- the kinds of services that help people avoid nursing home placement. This is a huge issue for many elderly Americans and their baby boomer children, two of the most powerful groups of voters.
 In fact, a recent poll released by the SCAN Foundation, a private foundation dedicated to improving long-term care, found that almost 8 of 10 Americans (including two-thirds of Republicans) say that if health care reform included coverage for home- and community-based long-term-care services, it would personally benefit them or someone in their families.
 The added cost of these services would at least in part be offset by reduced nursing home costs, but more to the point, the vast majority of Americans would clearly be able to see ''what's in it for me.''

 To the Editor:
 According to David Leonhardt, most Americans are satisfied with their present coverage in part because tests and treatments ''appear to be free'' under the current employer-provided health care system. For many of us this is puzzling. Except for a few fully covered screening tests, my insurance, and that of millions of others, functions with a system of deductibles and co-pays that add up quickly.
 A few years back, a simple broken wrist set in the emergency room cost me $700 out of pocket.
 While I support health care reform and would even be willing to pay more to cover more folks, I am tired of hearing that I am blithely demanding care I might not need because it is free to me. Usually I weigh the costs I know I will incur when deciding whether to visit a doctor or not.
 Anne-Marie Hislop Davenport, Iowa, July 22, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Selling reform is a problem for President Obama because he is not delivering what he is selling. If he were selling reform that increases access, manages costs and improves outcomes, he might not be having such a problem. 
 Americans are savvy consumers and can understand a sales pitch when they see it.

HEADLINE: Where the Jobs Are

 BODY:
An estimated 2.8 million employees will get a raise on Friday, as the federal minimum wage rises from $6.55 an hour to $7.25. Another 1.6 million whose hourly pay hovers around $7.25 are also expected to get a boost as employers adjust their pay scales to the new minimum. The raise is badly needed. It is also wholly inadequate. 
 With the latest increase, the minimum wage is still no higher now, after inflation, than it was in the early 1980s, and it is 17 percent lower than its peak in 1968. That means that no matter how hard they work, many low-wage workers keep falling behind. The latest increase will slow the decline in living standards, but it doesn't reverse the overall downward pull. 
 Even that understates the broader dimensions of the problem. 
 The minimum wage also sets a floor by which other wages are set. Keeping it low keeps wages lower than they would be otherwise, especially for jobs that are just above the minimum-wage level. That's a big problem for American workers because low-wage fields are the ones that are adding the most jobs. 
 According to the Labor Department, 5 of the 10 occupations expected to add the most jobs through 2016 are ''very low paying,'' up to a maximum of about $22,000 a year. They include retail sales jobs and home health aides. Another 3 of the 10 are ''low paying,'' from roughly $22,000 to $31,000, including customer-service representatives, general office clerks and nurses' aides. 
 During the presidential campaign, Barack Obama proposed lifting the minimum wage to $9.50 an hour by 2011 and, from there, adjusting it annually for inflation. He should press that goal. At $9.50 an hour, the minimum wage would be restored to its historical highs -- about 50 percent of the average wage. And it would restore the minimum wage to its broader function -- helping boost pay across the economy.
 President Obama talks a lot about a bright future with high-paying green technology jobs. It is imperative to plan and work for that future. But a concerted effort must also be made to improve the opportunities for workers in the types of low-wage jobs that are going to be most plentiful for years to come. 
 That means working with unions, professional associations, community colleges and employers to build so-called career ladders so workers can attain the skills they need to advance, say, from a very-low-paid home care aide, to a low-paid nurse's aide, to a higher-paid licensed vocational nurse. Partnerships between unions and employers in hospitals, casinos and factories have pioneered such skill-building efforts, combining on-the-job training with classroom instruction. 
 The Labor Department must also ensure that low-paid workers are not exploited by vigorously enforcing workplace safety rules and fair pay practices. 
 Low-paid jobs are a fact of working life in America. Unlike so many of the nation's higher-paying jobs, they are not going away. One of the big challenges of our time is to ensure that for some workers, they are a stepping stone to better jobs and that for all workers, they are safe and fairly compensated.

HEADLINE: As Banks Fight New Rules, Some Taxpayers Feel Irked

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Joy of Sachs,'' by Paul Krugman (column, July 17), and ''2 Giants Emerge From the Ruins on Wall Street'' (front page, July 17): 
 My wife and I, negotiating a bank CD this month, were told by a Chase officer that the bank's interest rates were lower than those of other banks because it was doing so well.
 I reminded her that if not for the taxpayer bailout, the building we were sitting in might be dark that morning. How galling it is to read now that Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, is battling in Washington against tighter regulations of derivatives as well as the creation of a new consumer protection agency, both of which he claims threaten the profitability of his bank.
 Mr. Krugman reminds us that in the 1930s the government's quid pro quo for rescuing the banks by insuring their deposits was a set of much tighter regulations on those institutions. Today, the finance lobby is already fighting against even the most basic protections for consumers.
 If these lobbying efforts succeed, we'll have set the stage for an even bigger financial disaster a few years down the road. And given the very deep pockets of these financial institutions, many a representative or senator may find himself or herself unable to resist jumping in, thus siding with those malefactors of great wealth against a public who, by this time, should be furious. I sure am!
 Arthur Salz Kew Gardens, Queens, July 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman's column rightly describes Goldman Sachs's use of government funds to enrich itself while trying hard to avoid government oversight. Can no one explain to these executives that, like my children, if they want to enjoy my largess, they must follow my rules?
 Mark P. Solomon Bala Cynwyd, Pa., July 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman is right that ''moving money around'' is something quite other than ''production of useful stuff.''
 Isn't the solution easy then? Tax profits from ''moving money'' at a much higher rate than profits from production or true investment. That would certainly be a step in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Obama Drives a Change In Global Views, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A new global survey has found a vast improvement in views of the United States since the election of President Obama. But it also finds broad opposition to one of his crucial policies -- sending more troops to Afghanistan -- and confirms a drop in confidence in the United States among Israelis. 
 Mr. Obama, according to the survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, enjoys greater confidence among Germans than does Chancellor Angela Merkel, and among the French than President Nicolas Sarkozy. His election in itself, pollsters found, helped restore the United States' image abroad to levels unseen since the Clinton years.
 Improved attitudes toward the United States were most marked in Western Europe, but also evident in Asia, Africa and Latin America and included some predominantly Muslim countries.
 In Indonesia, where Mr. Obama spent part of his youth, 73 percent of those polled said his election had directly improved their opinion of the United States. 
 But the survey, involving more than 26,000 people in 24 countries, and the Palestinian territories, found that anti-American animosity remained high in places like Pakistan and Turkey and among Palestinians. 
 Europeans, in particular, seemed to be responding positively to Mr. Obama. The proportion of Britons saying that they trusted the American president to do the ''right thing'' in world affairs soared to 86 percent this year, under Mr. Obama, compared with just 16 percent last year, under President George W. Bush. The increase was even larger in Germany and France. 
 The ''right thing'' numbers also jumped in all Middle Eastern countries surveyed except Israel, which saw no statistical change.
 Mr. Obama's June 4 speech in Cairo gave his standing a statistically insignificant boost among Palestinians. But Israeli confidence in Mr. Obama to do the right thing slipped from 60 percent before the speech to 49 percent afterward. Israelis were the only people polled who gave the United States lower ratings than in past surveys.
 ''I think that his high ratings overseas are in spite of the economy,'' said Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, based in Washington. ''His high ratings reflect personal confidence in him, and a sense that he will be much different than Bush -- more multilateral, will seek international approval before using force, ending Guantanamo, getting out of Iraq.''
 Announcing the closing of the Guantanamo Bay prison and setting a troop-withdrawal deadline in Iraq were the policies that engendered the greatest support, the poll found. Sending more troops to Afghanistan was the only policy tested that majorities in most countries opposed.
 The survey, taken from late May to mid-June, had national margins of sampling error of two to four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Obama Complains About the News Cycle but Manipulates It, Worrying Some

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It has become his common lament. Challenged about difficulties with his economic or legislative programs, President Obama complains about the tyranny of ''the news cycle,'' pronouncing the words with an air of above-it-all disdain for the impatience and fecklessness of today's media culture.
 Yet after six months in office, perhaps no other president has been more attuned to, or done more to dominate, the news cycle he disparages. Mr. Obama has given roughly three times as many interviews as George W. Bush and held four times as many prime-time news conferences as Bill Clinton had by comparable points in their terms. 
 In the past four days, Mr. Obama gave ''exclusive'' interviews to Jim Lehrer of PBS, Katie Couric of CBS and Meredith Vieira of NBC. He gave two interviews to The Washington Post on one day, one to the editorial page editor and one to news reporters. He held a conference call with bloggers. His hourlong session in the East Room on Wednesday night was his second news conference of the day. And on Thursday, he invited Terry Moran of ABC to spend the day with him for a ''Nightline'' special.
 The all-Obama, all-the-time carpet bombing of the news media represents a strategy by a White House seeking to deploy its most effective asset in service of its goals, none more critical now than health care legislation. But longtime Washington hands warn that saturation coverage can diminish the power of his voice and lose public attention.
 About 24.7 million viewers tuned in Wednesday, according to Nielsen ratings, some 4 million fewer than watched his last evening news conference in April and 25 million fewer than saw his first in February. Mr. Obama's focus on health care produced what Chuck Todd of NBC described as a ''snoozer conference,'' a line the Republican National Committee happily adopted.
 ''I'm really perplexed. It's unbelievable,'' said Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's White House counselor. ''They've taken his greatest political asset -- his gifts as a communicator -- and totally diluted them. It's been especially notable in the last couple weeks.''
 Some Democrats said Mr. Obama should worry about frittering away the novelty of his presence. ''It's a risk of overexposure,'' said Joe Trippi, a political consultant. ''If you use it all up on health care, you may not be able to use it on something else. But if you're going to risk using it all up, this is the one to risk it on.''
 Past presidents have been more exclusive in giving exclusives, believing they would have more impact. In their first four months, Mr. Clinton gave 11 interviews and Mr. Bush gave 18, compared with 43 by Mr. Obama, according to Martha Joynt Kumar, a presidential communications scholar at Towson State University. That has accelerated in recent days as Mr. Obama popped up in venues like''Anderson Cooper 360'' on CNN and ''Dr. Nancy'' on MSNBC.
 ''In part, he is omnipresent because news organizations want to carry news about him, his goals, and his initiatives,'' Professor Kumar said. ''If he does not use the space he has available to him, he risks ceding it to his critics.''
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said the current news media world left little choice. ''You worry about overexposure maybe very deeply in the back of your mind,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''But the way the media is structured these days and the fact that it is so segmented and split up means that in order to get something to go through, you've got to do multiple platforms.''
 Mr. Obama prefers long-form sessions, eschewing the more typical way presidents have used to get out their views. Past presidents routinely took a couple questions from reporters during photo opportunities. Mr. Clinton answered questions 158 times this way in his first six months, compared with Mr. Obama's 30.
 If Mr. Obama is an energetic producer of news, he also seems to be an avid consumer. At Wednesday's news conference, he seemed to address or borrow ideas from two columns in that morning's newspapers. 
 Steven Pearlstein, an economic columnist for The Washington Post, had written: ''Among the range of options for health-care reform, there's one that is sure to raise your taxes, increase your out-of-pocket medical expenses, swell the federal deficit, leave more Americans without insurance and guarantee that wages will remain stagnant. That's the option of doing nothing.''
 During the news conference, Mr. Obama said: ''If somebody told you that there is a plan out there that is guaranteed to double your health care costs over the next 10 years, that's guaranteed to result in more Americans losing their health care, and that is by far the biggest contributor to our federal deficit, I think most people would be opposed to that. Well, that's the status quo.''
 Similarly, David Leonhardt, an economics columnist for The New York Times, had written: ''What's in it for me? On the subject of health care reform, most Americans probably don't have a good answer to the question. And that, obviously, is a problem for the White House and for Democratic leaders in Congress.''
 Mr. Obama responded in his opening remarks: ''A lot of Americans may be wondering, 'What's in this for me? How does my family stand to benefit from health insurance reform?' So tonight I want to answer those questions.''
 For those who missed those answers, not to worry. No doubt there will be another chance soon enough.

HEADLINE: Index Shows a Drop in Consumer Confidence

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer confidence in the United States waned in late July to its lowest ebb since April on growing pessimism about the long-term economic outlook, especially about income and jobs, a survey showed Friday, even as some economists reckon the longest recession in decades may be easing. 
 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final July consumer sentiment reading fell to 66.0 from June's 70.8, though it was slightly higher than economists' median expectation for a reading of 65.0, according to a Reuters poll.
 The index of consumer expectations fell to 63.2 in July's final reading, from 69.2 in June.
 ''Consumers believe that the economic free fall is now over, but consumers see little reason to believe the stimulus policies will improve their financial condition anytime soon,'' the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said in a statement.
 On the long-term outlook, 58 percent of respondents said they anticipated bad times, up from 49 percent in May. Lower income and less favorable job prospects in the next year are factors making consumers anxious about their financial position, the statement said.
 ''People are a little more worried about the economy, especially over the labor market and what's happening in Washington. It's still consistent with the picture that the economy is bottoming out, but you are not going to get a big bounce in consumer spending,'' said David Wyss, chief economist with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
 The current conditions index slipped to 70.5 in the final July reading, from 73.2 in June.

HEADLINE: A Field of Dreams, With No Cornstalks in Sight

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: SAG HARBOR, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It was a quintessentially American scene: talented baseball teams playing on a sweltering Sunday afternoon in a small town, parents cheering on their college-age sons, children on the sidelines trying to snag balls and autographs. 
 But it was in a location that is anything but typical.
This is Hamptons Collegiate Baseball, a summer league that is bringing the foul balls and dirt-stained uniforms that come with the game to a place better known for its celebrities, glamorous fund-raisers and crisp polo shirts. 
 ''We're the Hamptons, and we have plenty of cachet to go with that reputation, but at the root of it, we're small towns with year-round populations,'' said Rusty Leaver, the league's founder and owner of Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk. ''This is bringing Iowa to the Hamptons.'' 
 The five-team Hamptons league, which sits under the umbrella of the larger Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, started in June with teams in Mattituck, Riverhead, Sag Harbor, Southampton and Westhampton. The regular season ends in July and the playoffs conclude in August.
 It is modeled after the Cape Cod Baseball League, which recruits top college players each summer. (The players are not paid, but stay free with volunteer host families.)
 The Hamptons League is also trying to replicate the sense of community that permeates through the Cape League, where games are often played on high school fields and are always free. 
 The crowd for the early Sunday game here was thin, mostly parents and friends of players, a few of whom are from Long Island. 
 Some spectators sat on bleachers near the public field, others under an overhang, and a few on beach chairs plopped on the grass. More people, some fresh off the beach or bike trails, came to watch the 5 p.m. game, which Sag Harbor lost to Southampton, 7-3. 
 ''Go, Kevin!'' one fan yelled to a player on the field. ''Nice pitch!'' yelled another. 
 ''This is so exciting for us -- we live two blocks from the park,'' said Mary Labrozzi, whose son, Michael, a student at Farmingdale State, plays for the Sag Harbor Whalers. Ms. Labrozzi is thrilled to have her son playing in their hometown, and bakes a huge batch of cookies or brownies for each home game. 
 Robert Cleary of Sag Harbor comes almost every Sunday with his 7-year-old son, Dillon, who sings ''God Bless America'' with a group of children during the game. Dillon also goes to a Sunday morning clinic that many of the players -- who are regarded like rock stars by the town's youths -- put on to teach baseball fundamentals. 
 ''We're lucky we don't have to go anywhere. They come to us,'' Mr. Cleary said. ''The price is right. It's like going to a free concert in Central Park. You get a great caliber of music for free, and we get a great caliber of baseball for free.'' 
 While donations are requested during games, Mr. Cleary said he wished more Sag Harbor residents would come support the team. 
 ''There's probably more people inside the ice cream shop than here, which surprises me,'' he said. 
 But the team does have its huge fans. John Longmire and his son William, 10, have traveled around the Hamptons to watch the Whalers. 
 ''It's really fun to go to the games on the weekends,'' said William, who used Mr. Leaver's radar gun to clock a few pitches.
 Mr. Leaver said he and Skip Norsic, a sponsor, brainstormed the idea for the league ''on a bar stool'' two years ago. 
 They formed one team last year -- the Hampton Whalers, now the Sag Harbor Whalers, -- to ''test the waters,'' Mr. Norsic said. They traveled to play other teams in the Atlantic Collegiate League. 
 But the idea was always for a league that could ultimately sustain itself. The two spent all of 2008 rallying local businesses and residents, and to some extent the Hamptons celebrity scene, for volunteer hours and seed money. 
 Mr. Leaver raised $200,000 to build a new field in Southampton and got the comedian Jerry Seinfeld to throw out the first pitch at a game. This year, Mr. Leaver believes the league, registered as a nonprofit, has raised about $150,000 in cash donations. 
 ''I feel like what we have going for us is a very diverse pool of people to draw from out here who share the common denominator of loving baseball,'' Mr. Leaver said. 
 The league also works with colleges to recruit players and coaches, the only people in the organization who are paid. Many of the players work in local restaurants and stores when not playing or practicing.
 Word of the league has spread among baseball fans, especially in Mattituck, where home games regularly draw hundreds of people, Mr. Leaver said, as does the large field in Southampton. But crowds have been much thinner in Westhampton and here in Sag Harbor, where the team plays a doubleheader each Sunday afternoon. Many residents, he acknowledged, still don't know about the teams.
 ''We knew it was an 'If you build it, you have to build a fan base that will come' thing,'' Mr. Leaver said. 
 The toughest part, he said, is coordinating volunteers in five communities and ensuring that there are enough host families to house all the players. This year's goal is to build a fan base and credibility as a solid league. Mr. Leaver hopes the league becomes an economic boon for each of the towns, and leads to some sort of partnership with Major League Baseball. 
 But he never wants it to get too out of control. 
 ''It should look like people with beach blankets and chairs, and should be a bucolic small-town atmosphere,'' Mr. Leaver said. ''It should be really relaxed, but when you're sitting on a beach blanket you'll see someone hit a 400-foot home run or throw a 90-mile-per-hour fastball.''

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW: Art or Ad or What? It Caused a Lot of Fuss

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
It all began with a woman with a phallus. She was Lynda Benglis, a 32-year-old rising star in the New York art firmament of the early 1970s, Post-Minimal division. The instrument in question was a large, cast-latex double-headed dildo that Ms. Benglis held defiantly between her thighs in a now infamous color photograph. Visible from the knees up, she is nude except for a pair of cat's-eye rhinestone sunglasses and a diamond stud earring, her body oiled, her cropped hair stiffly moussed. 
 And ''it''? It was the historic dust-up that ensued when this photograph appeared, in 1974, in Artforum, the leading art magazine of the time. Ms. Benglis called the image a ''centerfold'' and considered it a work of art; others called it an ad, since Paula Cooper, Ms. Benglis's dealer at the time, paid for it; still others said it was pornography and unsuitable for an art magazine. 
 But there it was in the advertising section in the front of the magazine, many pages ahead of an article on Ms. Benglis's work by Robert Pincus-Witten, the art critic who coined the term Post- 
 Minimalism. She had originally wanted the photograph to run as part of the article, but the editor, John Coplans, refused.
 The ''Benglis ad,'' as it is usually called, is central to ''Lynda Benglis/Robert Morris, 1973-74,'' an informative, fascinating and often hilarious exhibition at the Susan Inglett Gallery in Chelsea. With a sheaf of unpublished letters to the editor, it fills in history that you probably missed even if you were around the first time. (I worked for Paula Cooper until a few months before the ad ran and was writing short reviews for Artforum.) 
 The exhibition has been organized by David Platzker, Ms. Inglett's husband, a dealer in rare catalogs and art-world ephemera who owns a bookstore-cum-gallery called Specific Object on West 26th Street. Combining art with papers drawn mostly from Ms. Benglis's files, Mr. Platzker elaborates several rings of context around the ad, starting with Ms. Benglis's friendship and loose collaboration, in video, with the older sculptor Robert Morris. Two videos, one by each artist, indicate the fruitful way they passed video material back and forth, incorporating one another's additions into new pieces. The layered images and convoluted narratives now seem very much of the present. 
 Also here is Mr. Morris's incendiary poster for his April 1974 exhibition at the Sonnabend and Castelli galleries, which many people have seen as a catalyst to the Benglis ad. The poster shows him naked to the waist, wearing only a German Army helmet (Nazi vintage), mirrored aviator glasses, steel manacles and a spiked collar. (The collar and cuffs are linked by heavy chains that he clutches in his hands, as if he were Atlas about to shrug.)
 But as this exhibition demonstrates, Ms. Benglis's ad was also preceded by three other images of herself that increasingly flouted gender and sexual stereotype. One, an announcement card for a show at the Clocktower in 1973, used a childhood portrait for which she wore the national dress of Greece (her family's country of origin) -- the boy's costume, since the girl's was too small.
 In an ad in the April 1974 Artforum she appears in a jacket and jeans, leaning against her silver Porsche, in a pose of slouchy West Coast male-artist cool. The third photograph, by Annie Leibovitz, for the card announcing Ms. Benglis's May 1974 exhibition at Paula Cooper, shows her from the back. She's in Betty Grable mode, except she wears jeans that are dropped around her ankles. 
 As the show progresses, the Benglis ad -- photograph by Arthur Gordon -- takes over, and we see that reaction was swift and divided. Several of the magazine's associate editors, all well-known art critics, stormed and huffed at Mr. Coplans's acceptance of the ad, and simmering feuds escalated into schisms. Two of the critics, Rosalind Krauss and Annette Michelson left to found the redoubtable, strait-laced and theory-driven magazine October. (Another wrinkle: it turned out that Ms. Krauss took the photograph of Mr. Morris in chains.)
 Before leaving, Ms. Krauss and Ms. Michelson joined three of their colleagues in a strongly worded, strait-laced letter to the editor. It appeared edged in black on the letters pages from the December issue, included here. It is amazing to read critics of new art sounding like National Endowment for the Arts-baiting senators, 15 years before Mapplethorpe. (On the same page, Mr. Coplans, one assumes, insinuates the pedigree of Ms. Benglis's action by including an uncaptioned photograph of the Comtesse de Castiglione, the 19th-century French beauty who may have been the first woman to self-consciously orchestrate images of herself for the camera, from pose to attire to maquillage.) 
 And a letter from the critic Peter Plagens, a regular contributor, adds levity, feigning shock and concluding with the funniest line of the whole tempest: ''On the other hand, anyone who could win Eydie Gorme and Steve Lawrence look-alike contests simultaneously can't be all bad.''
 Readers were similarly divided, and the letters from outside that deluged the magazine, most of them never published, make for some of the Inglett show's best moments. Questions are asked, fingers are shaken. Subscriptions are canceled, some by librarians at Midwest high schools. Female artists approve enthusiastically and sometimes eloquently. Reading all this, you see how the ad became a lightning rod for conflicting views of feminism, pornography, editorial (and critical) responsibility, art-world economics, reputation-building and artistic license.
 What was all the fuss really about? Well, for one thing, Mr. Plagens was right. It really was an amazing photograph. I remember the shock of seeing it and am always surprised at how shocking it remains. It is laugh-out-loud thrilling, and the phallus is the least of it. If this item continues to startle rather than look ridiculous, it is because everything around it is so perfect: the shiny leanness of Ms. Benglis's androgynous torso, the saucy tilt of her hips, the slight flaring of her fingers at her hip, the angle of her head, her full, undulant Man Ray lips reiterated by the curves of the cat's-eye sunglasses. Everything communicates fully and pictorially.
 The most startling phallus in the picture is perhaps the metaphorical one that results from this fine-tuned perfection: the sense of empowerment, entitlement, aggressiveness and forthrightness so often misunderstood to be the province of men. This more than any object, penile or otherwise, is what Lynda Benglis waved at the art world. 
 Mr. Platzker's show concludes with the mission statement of the first issue of October. But this is not the whole messy story. For that, consult Amy Newman's oral history of Artforum's early years, ''Challenging Art: Artforum, 1962-1974.'' Ms. Newman's book neatly splices together interviews with 30 people who worked at, wrote for or avidly read the magazine -- Ms. Benglis included -- and is wonderfully alive with the energy of art critical infighting. This exhibition could be published as an appendix to that book.
 ''Lynda Benglis/Robert Morris: 1973-74'' is on view through Friday at the Susan Inglett Gallery, 522 West 24th Street, Chelsea; (212) 647-9111, inglettgallery.com.

 CORRECTION:
An art review on July 25 about ''Lynda Benglis/Robert Morris: 1973-74,'' at the Susan Inglett Gallery in Chelsea, which centers on a photograph of Ms. Benglis published as an advertisement in Artforum magazine in 1974, misidentified the person who paid for the advertisement. It was Ms. Benglis -- not her dealer, Paula Cooper, who arranged for placement of the ad, which ran under the name of her gallery.

HEADLINE: Store From Middle America Opens an Outlet in Midtown

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
J. C. Penney, the middle American department store, is suddenly in the middle of Manhattan. This week, the value-priced chain quietly opened its first store in the city, in Midtown -- a mere falafel cart or two away from its rival Macy's. The grand opening is July 31.
 ''We always knew we wanted a presence in Manhattan,'' said Michael J. Boylson, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for J. C. Penney, which is based in Plano, Tex. ''It's only been within the last four to five years it was even financially feasible.''
 Feasibility may not mean success, of course. Near term, Penney's, like retailers of all stripes, is still trying to claw its way out of the recession. And the horizontal sprawl of the typical Penney's store does not translate readily to Manhattan real estate. 
 ''It's not so easy to hit a home run,'' said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for NPD Group. 
 Yet like the ingenue in the musical ''42nd Street,'' nearly every big-box retailer dreams of someday coming to Manhattan. This year, Costco will open its first Manhattan store in East Harlem. Next spring, the upscale outlet chain Nordstrom Rack will open its first Manhattan store in Union Square. Home Depot and Best Buy have opened several stores in the city in the last decade. 
 The daunting prospect of adapting the big-box business to the Big Apple has limited Target to the city's outer boroughs, while Wal-Mart has not ventured in from the suburbs.
 The retailers that do set up shop in Manhattan come for the exposure, the cachet and the pipeline to some of the nation's wealthiest consumers, even in a recession. 
 Although Penney's has stores in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, Manhattan represents its own geographic and psychographic space.
 ''It is the center of media in the United States,'' said Mr. Boylson, who added that being in Midtown would enable his company to introduce itself to Manhattan residents (and news media) who may have ''an outdated perception'' of Penney's. The company has been using the tag line ''We're stepping up our style'' in its advertising, and highlighting its clothing by the likes of Charlotte Ronson and Nicole Miller. 
 Penney's, which will occupy two lower levels of the Manhattan Mall, on the Avenue of the Americas near 33rd Street, also contends it can make money in Manhattan. 
 ''We think now, more than ever, the value that we bring to the table is going to play very, very well,'' Mr. Boylson said. 
 Most of the borough's boutiques and department stores cater to upscale consumers, he said, so Penney's prices ''are going to fill a void.'' Executives have said the chain tends to do well in ethnically diverse markets and is among the most popular clothing stores for Hispanic consumers. 
 By opening in a major traffic hub and aiming at households earning about $65,000 a year, J. C. Penney hopes to attract new customers and take its national retail battle with Macy's to its rival's home turf. Advertisements for the new store zing Macy's with barbs like, ''the real miracle is now on 33rd Street,'' referring of course to the film ''Miracle on 34th Street,'' about a Macy's Santa Claus. 
 Penney's is tackling Manhattan even as June comparable sales fell 8.2 percent from June 2008. The heady days of 2006 when the company was reporting robust sales increases seem a dim memory. The relatively good news, however, is that while Penney's is still reporting declines with other retailers, the double-digit drops of last year have not been repeated since January. 
 At 153,000 square feet, Penney's Manhattan store (which includes a Sephora cosmetics shop) is about the same size as its other locations. But the ceilings are significantly lower -- eight feet high instead of the usual 11. To create the illusion of height, the company installed white panels that float slightly below a black ceiling. Also, directional signs that hang from the ceiling are daintier than usual. 
 Like all out-of-towners, retailers go to great lengths to make it in Manhattan. They overhaul their typical big-box store designs, rethink how they manage inventory, hire more employees and even offer different merchandise. And they must contend with local concerns -- the survival of nearby small businesses, traffic patterns, noise and labor practices. 
 Even after years of planning, they still must do a lot of on-the-job learning. Home Depot, for instance, learned from customers that, in a borough of tiny kitchens, diminutive ranges, not usually stocked by the chain, are a must. 
 ''That was one of those baptisms by fire,'' said Steve Lieberman, a regional merchandising manager for Atlanta-based Home Depot. And the chain's popular free do-it-yourself workshops had to be tailored to Manhattan residents. Instead of clinics on lawn care, the Manhattan Home Depot offers seminars on how to pot a plant. Another class that has been popular in Manhattan is how to install your own toilet. 
 ''We sell a boatload of toilet seats and toilets'' in Manhattan, Mr. Lieberman said. And delivery is much more important than in the suburbs; customers cannot lug a toilet home on the F Train. (Penney's is offering same-day delivery in Manhattan for $15 for up to 70 pounds of merchandise.) 
 Then there is the special character of New Yorkers. Executives have estimated that a city customer's ''wait tolerance'' will be no more than 90 seconds. 
 To hurry things along in its Manhattan shoe department -- which will offer more shoes (some 41,000 pairs) than any other Penney's -- the retailer hired shoe runners. When a customer wants to try on a pair, a sales associate will use an electronic hand scanner to send the shoe's size and type to the runners in the stockrooms. The runners will fetch the shoes and then place them on dumbwaiters that zoom up to the sales floors.
 Other New-York-minute amenities include an electronic queuing system that directs customers to cash registers and estimates wait times -- almost as if the checkout line were a Walt Disney World ride. 
 A machine called the FindMore has a touch screen to enable shoppers to view every item in the store and on Penney's Web site. Even if the store is out of an item, customers can still buy it using the machine. 
 Among the trickier challenges Manhattan poses to retailers is figuring out how to distribute a big-box store model over multiple floors.
 James Damian, senior vice president of the enterprise design group for Minneapolis-based Best Buy, said chains had to determine whether their brand could survive vertically. 
 ''Most big-box retailers fail because they've never kicked the tires on that,'' he said. 
 One consideration is how well each floor will accommodate throngs of shoppers. ''The traffic is ferocious,'' Mr. Damian said. 
 That and the scarcity of storage space in Manhattan means big-box chains typically must house their inventory outside the borough, and use small trucks to bring it into their stores. Mr. Boylson said Penney's was storing inventory in a distribution center in Manchester, Conn., and expected to be ''running smaller trucks to New York almost around the clock.'' 
 The chains also have to increase the number of employees, cash registers and fitting room stalls. 
 The Manhattan Penney's has 500 employees, making it the company's largest store staff. It has 100 cash registers; most Penney's have 58. The fitting rooms have twice the number of stalls, 61, of the average Penney's.
 Elbow room is tight, even for dummies. The Manhattan store has more mannequins than any other J.C. Penney outlet, to fill the myriad display cases near the escalators and entrances. 
 The company is also using technology to help manage potential crowds: if an hour goes by and the bathrooms have not been cleaned, a buzzer automatically goes off, alerting store staff. 
 Heavy customer traffic is among the reasons the company likes Manhattan Mall. Consumers can enter from the street, or from the 34th Street Herald Square subway station and the 33rd Street PATH train station. 
 Company executives declined to say whether the recession had enabled them to get a break on the rent, but Mr. Boylson said the mall owner, Vornado Realty Trust, allowed Penney's to design the space as it desired. 
 The Manhattan store merchandise is essentially the same as that in other Penney's, though during a recent tour, Pete Sadler, a district manager, said the store planned to take market share from Macy's by offering more plus- and petite-size clothing. 
 A lot of merchandise is already on sale, like 40 percent off cultured pearl jewelry, and 50 percent off clothing brands like St. John's Bay. 
 Walking the aisles, Mr. Sadler squeezed $3.99 pillows and stacks of white bath towels, also $3.99. 
 ''We think the people in Manhattan are going to love these prices.''

HEADLINE: In Recession, Optimistic College Graduates Turn Down Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

 BODY:
It has been two months since Diana Parsons graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a liberal arts degree that cost about $100,000, and she has still not found a full-time job. She has returned to Milwaukee, where she is living with her parents and occasionally waiting tables at a restaurant owned by a friend of her mother. 
 Another hard-luck case in a miserable economy? Not exactly. Ms. Parsons, 21, is jobless by choice. She turned down one $23,000-a-year offer to become a research assistant at a magazine because she did not want to move to Chicago and another because she did not want to work nights. 
 ''I'm not really worried,'' she said. ''When the right thing comes along, I'll know it.''
 Ms. Parsons is far from the only member of the class of 2009 who is picky when it comes to employers. Job recruiters may be bypassing university campuses in droves and the unemployment rate may be at its highest point in decades, but college career advisers are noticing that many recent graduates do not seem to comprehend the challenging economic world they have just entered. 
 ''I don't think the students understand, I really don't, but come September, October, when they still don't have jobs, they're going to be panicky,'' said Clarice Wilsey, a career counselor at the University of Oregon, where just 55 employers came to a recent job fair, down from nearly 90 the year before. 
 Ms. Wilsey and others in her field said part of the problem stemmed from the fact that the latest graduates had spent most of their college years in a booming economy that went suddenly cold in their final academic year. 
 Until recently, students like Ms. Parsons had every reason to expect a bounty of high-paying career opportunities, said Manny Contomanolis, president of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, an organization for career counselors that met last month in Las Vegas to ponder how to help themselves and their students cope with the souring economy.
 ''If you went back to September and October, most campuses were reporting record recruiting activity,'' Mr. Contomanolis said. ''It was really in the November time frame that things really started manifesting themselves. A lot of students haven't gone through a full recruiting cycle yet.''
 Some students, like Ms. Parsons, say they can afford to hold out a while. So does Robert Sherman, a finance major at Syracuse University who rejected a $50,000-a-year job as head of technology for a consulting company because he did not get a good vibe from his potential bosses. Instead, he said, he is ''doing odd jobs to support myself, and I'm O.K. with that'' while he tries to get two technology companies of his own off the ground.
 ''I'm definitely seeing a lot of the older generation saying, 'Oh, it's so awful,' but my generation isn't getting as depressed and uptight about it,'' said Mr. Sherman, who admitted he and his parents had deliberated for a week before he turned down the offer. ''We're working within the bounds of the situation. The economy will rebound.''
 Some praise that approach. Steven Rothberg, founder of the online job board CollegeRecruiter.com, noted that most seniors were not compelled by mortgages or other expenses to grab just any position at whatever salary is offered. To do so could haunt them later when the economy improves, he said.
 ''A lot of times, the offer is simply not acceptable to them, the compensation is far beneath where it should be, the job does not line up with their career interest,'' Mr. Rothberg said. ''If they take it, they're going to be stuck with that career path and compensation level for years to come.''
 The phenomenon of students' turning down offers despite the economic conditions is so pervasive that the president of the University of Connecticut, Michael J. Hogan, addressed it in his commencement speech in May.
 ''My first word of advice is this: Say yes,'' Mr. Hogan urged the graduates when it came to prospective employers. ''In fact, say yes as often as you can. Saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow. Saying yes leads to new experiences, and new experiences will lead you to knowledge and wisdom. Yes is for young people, and an attitude of yes is how you will be able to go forward in these uncertain times.''
 That is how Anthony Scruggs, 23, sees it, too. Mr. Scruggs recently graduated from the University of Arkansas and is moving home to Houston to take a $30,000-a-year job as a self-described ''paper pusher'' with a real estate development firm, the only offer he received in seven months of searching.
 ''It kind of took me by surprise because you just assume when you're in college that when you graduate you're going to get the job, and here I am,'' Mr. Scruggs said. ''I'm 23 years old, and I'm going to move back in with my parents. I kind of had to rearrange the game plan for sure.''
 Career counselors like Ms. Wilsey wish more students saw it that way. She is bracing for a busy summer as new graduates finally face up to the tough market and turn to her for help.
 ''There are fewer successes, but I have to keep a positive attitude because if I don't, then I'll get discouraged, and then that'll discourage the students,'' Ms. Wilsey said. ''I've got to say: 'Here's what you have to do, here's how I can support you -- yeah, it's going to be tough, but I'm going to support you.' ''

HEADLINE: Teaching the Entitled Young The Financial Facts of Life

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
This is the summer of reviling the rich. The financiers at Goldman Sachs got a populist drubbing after the bank reported record quarterly earnings and analysts began predicting average bonuses of $700,000 an employee at the firm this year. Now, Congress is debating whether high earners should be hit with a surtax to pay for health care reform. In states like New York and California, that could mean that top earners are paying more than 50 percent of their income in taxes. 
 But the rich and the not-so-rich do have something in common this summer: worrying about their children's financial future. This may come as a shock to those middle-class Americans who imagine wealthy parents sunning themselves by their infinity pools, confident that their children, having been given every opportunity, are on their way to productive lives. 
 In truth, the image is fairly rare at this point. What is more common among the wealthy is their fear that the lives their children have known, and the futures they expected, may be gone. 
 ''The notion that you're entitled to goodies has to be dispelled,'' said Fredda Herz Brown, a partner at Relative Solutions, a consultant who works with family businesses. ''They really do think life is going to continue as it has. But most of them are not getting jobs, no matter what their parents do.''
 While the wealthy are in a better position to help their children financially, having money doesn't guarantee that their child will be responsible and productive. 
 So that leads to the question: How can parents help children with a healthy sense of entitlement adjust to the new economic reality?
 EMOTIONAL REASSURANCE The first thought that pops into many parents' heads when they worry about their children is bailing them out. But the best thing many parents can do, particularly those with children who are not asking for money, is to set the right example. 
 While children may be idle this summer, many parents are out of work, too, and casting about for ways to pay the bills. If they mope around, their children are going to pick that up. If, on the other hand, they discussed what has happened over the last year, their children will be better equipped to make their own financial decisions. 
 ''The patriarch can say, 'This is the risk I took, this is how I felt, these are the lessons here,' '' said Evan Roth, founding partner of BBR Partners, an adviser to ultra-high-net-worth clients. ''It's, 'Look at how I'm handling this; I'm teaching you a valuable a lesson here.' ''
 That lesson is often the need to work hard. Ms. Herz Brown tells the story of a financial services client who traveled a lot on business. When his role at work was reduced, he started spending less time on jets and more time at home with his teenagers. 
 ''He had a sense that too much came to them,'' she said. ''It came from a basic belief that what he had created for his kids was this sense that everything comes to you.''
 So he made them look for summer jobs. And when they couldn't find any, he made them take odd jobs to earn money. He also gave them a budget for school clothes and other incidentals and made it clear that if they budgeted poorly, they were not getting more money.
 The point was that he recognized he was enabling his children's sense of entitlement, she said. While his children will probably never want for money, he realized his actions had been just as indulgent as a parent who gives in to his child's every request for fast food. 
 FINANCIAL PLANNING There are, of course, many reasons to give money to your children. A popular one during the bull market was estate planning -- the more you could pass on while you were alive, the less subject to estate tax later. 
 One of the most popular structures during the bull market was a grantor retained annuity trust. This arcane-sounding trust was predicated on assets going up. The idea was that parents could put an asset they thought would appreciate into the trust for a set period of time, usually two to 10 years. At the end of that period, their child would get the appreciated value tax-free, less a small interest payment paid to their parents.
 Now that most asset values have gone down, these trusts look as if they have failed. But there is a chance to salvage them. The grantor can swap out the original asset for one of equal value without penalty and start another trust with the original asset, if he believes it unfairly lost value. 
 Rich Kohan, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Company Services practice, said people who set up the trusts should take advantage of the opportunity. ''If the asset has dropped in value, it's likely not to leave anything for the benefit of children,'' he said. 
 Then there are trusts set up for reasons other than tax savings. Joan Crain, senior director of wealth management strategies at Bank of New York Mellon, said she had seen an increase in clients setting up trusts for their adult children.
 ''Their children are in their late 30s to 50s, and they're not good stewards with money,'' she said. ''Parents want to protect them from creditors but also ex-spouses, even if the children are happily married or not married.''
 Money in trust is doled out to the beneficiaries and kept from creditors, but it is not shielded from estate taxes. That people are employing this strategy, though, should be a stark lesson to parents: teach money management skills to your children when they are young. 
 PRACTICAL SUPPORT In tough times, parents may need to set aside their estate plan and bail out their child.
 One way parents or grandparents can help without seeming intrusive is to cover all medical and education costs for their children and grandchildren. If they pay the hospital or school directly, they will not incur gift tax. 
 Separately, if a husband and wife pool their annual gift exclusions, they can give up to $52,000 a year to a child and his spouse to help make up for a lost job.
 ''Parents worry it's humiliating,'' Mr. Roth said. ''But paying their mortgage is not a direct handout. It's the same thing, but if you don't see it, it doesn't affect them as much.''
 On the positive side, this may be the right time to finance a child's entrepreneurial idea.
 ''The consensus is the fortunes of tomorrow are going to be made today in this downturn,'' said Mary Duke, head of private wealth solutions for the Americas at HSBC Private Bank. 
 The key is not to give your child a handout. Ms. Duke suggests setting up a board of advisers to look over the plan and provide assistance with framing and carrying out the idea. This takes the child's request out of the realm of asking Mom and Dad for money and into the arena of an actual business plan.
 ''It's important kids understand budgeting,'' she said. ''Everyone is more focused on living within their reduced means.''
 If a parent can instill that discipline in a child, the rest may just fall into place.

HEADLINE: Low-Budget Mother Goose, Intended for Mature Audiences Only

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
In January 1903, ''The Wizard of Oz,'' a stage adaptation of L. Frank Baum's best seller ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' opened on Broadway to huge success, prompting its producers to do what producers have always done: take a winning formula and copy it. By the fall they were ready to present ''Babes in Toyland,'' another flashy and fantastical family-friendly musical based on beloved source material. 
 Shoehorning Mother Goose characters into a story involving an evil uncle, adorable runaways and toys that come to life, the show had a meandering and overstocked plot but featured eye-catching design, tuneful songs and a sugary-sweet innocence. At this year's Ice Factory festival the Little Lord Fauntleroys, who describe themselves as ''interested in manipulating public domain texts, pillaging faulty nostalgias and celebrating the homemade,'' have mounted a rare revival that replaces the spectacle with a tongue-in-cheek bargain-basement aesthetic. 
 In the program, the words ''musical extravaganza'' have been crossed out, replaced by ''recession spectacular.'' And the intentionally cheesy sets by Jason Simms have the sorry look of what happens when grand ambitions meet meager budgets. The innocence is also gone, replaced by a lurid sexuality, with shirtless men in diapers and dancing girls wearing plastic breasts. 
 The unfocused plot includes an endless procession of characters and half-baked subplots -- the main one centering on the sinister Uncle Barnaby (Michael Levinton), who courts Contrary Mary (Laura von Holt) by blackmailing her mother, the little old lady who lives in a shoe (David Greenspan). One can imagine a dark update of this material that also pays tribute to it, but this ambling show, performed in a gee-whiz glee-club style that will be familiar to audiences of children's puppet theater, wavers in its intent, hinting at homage but settling into the easy, self-conscious satire that the success of ''Urinetown'' turned into cliche. 
 The main attraction here is not the sets or the songs but that human special effect Mr. Greenspan, who slings insults and complaints with the gleeful flamboyance of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Every time he struts onstage the production perks up, like a beaten boxer jolted awake by smelling salts. He's a hoot, but not enough of one to make this a major draw for anyone besides theater historians. 
 ''Babes in Toyland'' continues through Saturday at the Ohio Theater, 66 Wooster Street, SoHo; (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com.

HEADLINE: A Pig Roams Free in the Florida Panhandle, Drawing a Few Admirers

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Thomas Paine and Ayn Rand, make way for Porky. Or is it Wilbur? 
 No one really knows what to call the 150-pound pig roaming free in Panama City, Fla., but by eluding the authorities for five months, shaking off a Taser and four tranquilizer darts on Tuesday, the porker has become more than just swine. 
 The pig is now a local libertarian hero. Supporters describe the animal as a freedom-loving outlaw with a taste for corn. His Facebookpage lists more than 200 fans, like Mary K. Sittman, who asked this week, ''Is the pig a symbol of our desire to live free of government controls?''
 In an interview, Ms. Sittman said the pig, which lives in a lush, muddy park near her home, had ''to be a real survivor.'' It is this independence, she said, that appeals to residents in her mostly conservative area in the Florida Panhandle.
 The pig is also frugal fun. ''Now we have something free to do on a hot summer night,'' said Ms. Sittman, 62, a real estate developer semiretired by the recession. ''We can go pig-spotting.''
 Local officials, though, see the pig as more of a hogzilla in the making. 
 Jim Crosby, division manager for Bay County Animal Control, said the pig charged him and his deputies on Monday and nearly tore a chunk of flesh from their calves. A woman walking her dog near the park on Thursday reported that the pig also rushed her. 
 ''It has been fed by people and chased by some teenagers,'' Mr. Crosby said, adding, ''We are afraid the pig could hurt humans or could run into the road and get hit by a car.'' 
 A family in a rural area about 50 miles away has volunteered to accept the pig, without turning him into bacon. So Mr. Crosby said he would keep trying, until he got Porky in a poke. 
 ''We've re-evaluated which tranquilizers we'll be using,'' he said. ''With the four darts in him Tuesday, he looked like he had a couple of good shots of tequila, but that was it.''

HEADLINE: In Alaska, Qiviters Never Win

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. IGGIAGRUK HENSLEY. 
William L. Iggiagruk Hensley is the author of ''Fifty Miles From Tomorrow: A Memoir of Alaska and the Real People'' and former Democratic state senator.

DATELINE: Anchorage 

 BODY:
 TEN thousand summers have come and gone here in Alaska and the village people are already preparing for another cold winter by drying and smoking salmon, rendering seal oil and drying the meat and hoping for a bountiful berry season. In the meantime, our governor has called it quits 18 months before the end of her four-year term. She leaves tomorrow, to be replaced by her lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell.
 The Inuit have a word, ''qivit,'' that you do not want to have applied to you. It means to quit or give up when the going gets rough. In traditional times, and that was very recent, if you gave up as a leader you were jeopardizing yourself and everyone around you. It takes a lot of effort to maintain life in the bitter cold of the Arctic. 
 Things weren't much different when Alaska became a state 50 years ago. It was you and your family out there, hewing a living from the land and what little cash economy that existed. 
 In fact, Alaska's prospects looked dim just a couple of years after statehood in 1959. With a tiny population, inadequate tax receipts, almost no private property of any consequence and only a few thousand barrels of oil a day produced on the Kenai Peninsula, the state's first governor, Bill Egan, was presiding over what increasingly looked like a failed state. 
 Three weeks into his first term, Governor Egan, humble and effective, was stricken with an infection after gall bladder surgery and hovered near death. After three difficult months of recuperation, he returned to lead Alaska through the early years of state building that the voters elected him to accomplish. He didn't have enough revenue to pay for what little government we had, let alone do anything to meet the tremendous needs of its citizens for schools, health care, water and sewer lines, roads and electricity. All that changed in 1968 with the discovery of huge oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay in the northernmost part of the state. 
 We have had other governors resign, but that is not the same as ''qivit.'' When President Richard Nixon tapped Gov. Walter J. Hickel to be secretary of interior, he stepped down with the full support of Alaskans to help solve two of the state's biggest problems -- Alaska Native land claims and the construction of the oil pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. In time, the issue was resolved by Congress with 44 million acres and $1 billion for the Alaska Natives, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was constructed by the oil companies for $8 billion. With these problems behind him, Mr. Hickel ran for governor again in 1990, and won. 
 Finally, crude gold began to flow in 1977 and Alaska was on its way to becoming a full-fledged state, with up to two million barrels of oil a day flowing through the pipeline. Now, that oil is flowing at only 700,000 barrels a day and declining at six percent or seven percent a year. Without oil it is unclear what Alaska will look like in the next 50 years. 
 The great hope during the Palin administration was that a natural gas pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to the Lower 48 would be built, creating tens of thousands of jobs and providing revenue to help fill the fiscal gap that will come sooner than later. In spite of much political motion, years have gone by with no commitment to build a pipeline. In the meantime, the global economy has soured and other parts of the world are filling the energy gap. The window of opportunity may have closed. 
 Just like other states, Alaska is faced with many problems that the governor was expected to resolve. But unlike chief executives of some other states, our governor is powerful and can appoint all judges and department commissioners and university regents, and can control the budget. With state revenues subject to the whims of the oil market and appropriations from Congress now uncertain as the country struggles with the recession, Alaska has serious, immediate challenges. 
 We have high suicide and school dropout rates, and problems of poverty and alcohol and drug abuse. The Anchorage area faces an energy shortage due to declining gas fields and the villages face almost insurmountable energy costs; key resource development projects are languishing, and there is no revenue sharing for Alaska for offshore oil development even though we have 33,000 miles of coastline. 
 In short, Alaska had a governor who had the stature within the state, nationally and internationally, to deal with our problems. She could have used her position to find solutions to the high costs and financial insecurities of our far-northern state. Instead, she abandoned her role as the state's leader in midstream, making her the only governor in our state's history to ''qivit'' in the true sense of the word, at a time when we need strong leadership. Good luck, Governor Parnell -- may the great Arctic spirits be with you.

HEADLINE: New Factory Seen as Boon for Upstate

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: MALTA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A decade ago, it was 200 acres of pine trees near Saratoga Lake. A decade from now, it could be the booming heart of a new high-tech corridor, filled with some of the most sophisticated labs and plants in the country.
 After years of haggling and setbacks, officials finally broke ground Friday on a $4.2 billion plant that will manufacture advanced microprocessors and would be the most advanced facility of its kind in the world. The plant, to be built on a 222-acre site, will be bigger than the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan. 
 Elected officials are counting on the expected completion of the factory in 2011 to provide a major boost to the ailing upstate region, where for years they have promised, and mostly failed, to deliver an economic resurgence. 
 The plant, which will manufacture chips for California-based Advanced Micro Devices and other chip design firms, will generate 1,400 new manufacturing jobs, officials say.
 With the new factory as an anchor, they say, they can attract more investment to the area, building a cluster of businesses and academic centers that could ultimately rival Route 128 outside of Boston or North Carolina's Research Triangle.
 ''You've got everything in place here to make the whole upstate region a leader in chip fab manufacture and high technology generally,'' said Charles V. Wait, president of Adirondack Trust Corporation, a bank that helped finance early efforts to bring tech companies to the area. ''When I grew up, you couldn't find a job here in Saratoga, and everyone left after college.''
 The plant will receive $1.37 billion in state aid over 15 years, making it one of the most heavily subsidized projects in state history. About half that money is capital aid that was appropriated in this year's budget, a considerable gamble at a time of severe economic crisis.
 ''I was concerned about the value of taxpayer dollars versus the number of jobs that would be created,'' said Gov. David A. Paterson, speaking at a news conference after the groundbreaking. ''But when I started to see that we would move to global leadership in semiconductor development, I then realized that these are where the jobs of the next decade can come from.''
 The new factory is also a gamble for Advanced Micro Devices, the world's second-largest producer of computer chips.
 Since January, the company has posted hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, and it expects sales to continue declining. In March, it partnered with the Advanced Technology Investment Company, created by the Abu Dhabi government, to spin off GlobalFoundries, which will build and own the New York plant. The Abu Dhabi backing will provide a hedge against any threats to the project posed by the continued recession in the United States.
 While chip design is a big business in the United States, most chips are manufactured in China, Taiwan and Singapore. The factory here, some experts say, will help make the country globally competitive in chip manufacture for the first time in years.
 ''The grants and tax support level the playing field on a global basis,'' said Douglas A. Grose, the chief executive of Global Foundries. ''We looked all over the world for the next site. Every country that wanted a facility like this stepped forward.''
 For state economic development officials, the groundbreaking was the culmination of more than a decade of planning that began during the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki. 
 Before state officials could entice an advanced chip factory to the region, they had to build an entire infrastructure to support it. That included not only a network of new roads and utility upgrades, but the creation of local academic centers, including an institute for nanotechnological engineering at the State University at Albany.
 ''There were times when we had some doubt along the way,'' said Mr. Grose.
 Even after Advanced Micro Devices settled on the project site, in 2006, there were hurdles, including zoning issues, the company's financial difficulties and the need for more state financing. To smooth the way for timely construction, Mr. Paterson -- once a skeptic about the project -- jumped in to negotiate a labor agreement under which the factory would be built mostly by New York workers.
 At Friday's ceremony, a mound of dirt was piled in an air-conditioned tent with seven shovels ready for the groundbreaking ceremony, one for each of the speakers. Champagne awaited in an adjoining tent. The lineup of elected officials included Mr. Paterson, Mr. Pataki, United States Senator Charles E. Schumer and Joseph L. Bruno, the former State Senate leader who retired last year and who regards the factory as part of his legacy. 
 Mr. Bruno said he was so eager to see the project through final approval that he had put off retiring. 
 ''I knew it was going to happen,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Are Signaling the Recession's End

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE American recession appears to be nearing an end, but only after it has become the deepest downturn in more than half a century.
 The index of leading indicators, which signals turning points in the economy, is rising at a rate that has accurately indicated the end of every recession since the index began to be compiled in 1959.
 The index was reported this week to have risen for the third consecutive month in June, and to have risen at a 12.8 percent annual rate over those three months. Such a rise, pointed out Harm Bandholz, an economist with UniCredit Group, ''has always marked the end of the contraction.'' 
 Mr. Bandholz said he expected that the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of American economic cycles, would eventually conclude that the recession bottomed out in August or September of this year.
 If that proves to be accurate, the recession that began in December 2007 will have lasted 21 or 22 months, making it the longest downturn since the Great Depression. 
 There are caveats to the forecast, of course. Somewhat illogically, the index of leading indicators is subject to revision in coming months, which could make the recent gain seem smaller and not necessarily indicative of an approaching recovery.
 Only seven of the 1o leading indicators for June have been reported by the government, while the other three were estimated by the Conference Board, an independent research group that compiles the indicators. Some of the seven indicators that have been reported may be revised.
 As can be seen in the accompanying charts, six of the seven recessions since 1960 either ended in the month the indicator first showed a 12 percent annualized gain, or had ended a month or two before the index did so.
 The exception was the 1990-'91 recession, which was followed by one of the slowest recoveries ever. The official end of the recession was in March 1991, but the recovery was so tepid that it was not until December 1992 that the economic research bureau made that call. As it happened, December was the same month the indicator first showed such a strong three-month rise.
 An end to recession is not, of course, the same thing as the beginning of a boom. The indicator ''has an unblemished record on calling the turning point,'' said another economist, Robert J. Barbera of ITG, ''but it is not a particularly good guide to the power of the upturn.''
 Indeed, one of the strongest moves in the leading indicators came at the end of the brief 1980 recession, as credit controls were removed. But the economy soon fell into another, longer recession.
 Mr. Bandholz thinks we may get a ''W'' recovery, in which early gains are followed by weaker figures. ''We do not expect this recovery to be strong and self-sustaining,'' he said. ''What is lacking is support from consumer spending.''
 During the most recent three months, the strongest indicators have been the financial ones. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen while the gap has widened between long-term and short-term interest rates. The indicators index was also helped by an increase in consumer expectations and a slowing in deliveries by suppliers. (Slower deliveries are assumed to be caused by rising orders, although such a change could indicate the suppliers simply laid off too many workers.) 
 Two of the 10 indicators -- the money supply and new orders for consumer goods -- have shown declines.
 Another measure compiled by the Conference Board, the index of coincident indicators, has fallen for eight consecutive months, and dropped in 17 of the last 19 months. That indicator is often used by the economic research bureau in dating decisions, and its failure to stabilize is a reason that Mr. Bandholz says he thinks the downturn is not yet over.
 The index of coincident indicators has fallen 6.4 percent from the peak it reached in November 2007, making this the deepest recession since 1960. Before this cycle, its steepest decline was a 5.6 percent slide during the 1973-'75 downturn.

HEADLINE: Toyota, Mired in Slump, to Close California Plant

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Toyota is set to close a major factory for the first time in its 73-year history, exiting a joint venture with General Motors and initiating an era of more aggressive cuts.
 Toyota will soon enter discussions to dissolve New United Motor Manufacturing, a venture in Fremont, Calif., that employs about 4,550 people, said a Toyota spokesman, Paul Nolasco. 
 G.M. quit the venture, called Nummi, as part of its reorganization under bankruptcy protection last month. A final decision on closing the plant is expected in August after talks between Toyota and the entity responsible for liquidating G.M.'s assets, the Motors Liquidation Company, or M.L.C. 
 ''We have decided to discuss with the M.L.C. what we would need to do to withdraw from our joint venture,'' Mr. Nolasco said in Tokyo. ''We've never shut down and ended a plant,'' he said, ''but we are in a really tough situation.''
 The shutdown of Nummi is a turnabout for Toyota, the world's largest automaker, which has protected factories and jobs with a near-religious conviction despite ups and downs in the market.
 Toyota executives have boasted of tolerating excess capacity on the books in anticipation of future demand -- a strategy that paid off in recent years as the company's global sales surged. The company says it has not laid off regular workers for financial reasons since 1950.
 But Toyota has little choice. Its sales are down 38 percent in the United States this year after a 15 percent decline last year. Toyota lost 437 billion yen, or $4.6 billion, in the year through March 31, its first loss in almost six decades, and it forecast an even bigger loss this year. Globally, Toyota is building cars at just 70 percent of its capacity.
 ''It's as if a long-held doctrine at Toyota -- that it doesn't shut down factories and it doesn't fire workers -- has crumbled,'' said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto analyst at UBS in Tokyo. ''Some would say this is a new era for Toyota.''
 The dissolution of the factory also comes as a blow to California just as the state faces a crippling budget crisis. Top politicians, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, have publicly urged Toyota to save the plant. 
 On top of direct job losses, about 1,000 companies in California supply parts and services to Nummi. The closing could indirectly affect about 30,000 jobs, according to the East Bay Economic Development Alliance.
 The Fremont plant was owned solely by G.M. until 1982, when labor unrest and spiraling costs led to its closing. But Toyota, which was looking for a base to jump-start its United States operations, invested $150 million to reopen the plant as a joint venture with G.M. in 1984.
 The new factory helped to revolutionize American car manufacturing, introducing Toyota's trademark just-in-time production, employee teamwork and efficiency methods to American workers.
 But the plant, which made as many as 420,000 cars and pickups each year, has long been unprofitable, in part because of higher labor costs in California. The predominance of United Automobile Workers union members at the plant has added to the labor bills, as have California's strict environmental standards. 
 With Toyota's five other United States factories running below capacity, it is no longer viable for Toyota to keep Nummi open, analysts say. Many of Toyota's main parts suppliers are located near the company's factories in Indiana, Alabama, Kentucky, West Virginia and Texas. Toyota also has two new plants coming online in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Takes a Break As Earnings Disappoint

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed Friday as broad market indexes finished slightly higher and the Nasdaq fell for the first time in 12 sessions, weighed down by disappointing results from Microsoft and Amazon.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.95 points, or 0.26 percent, to 9,093.24. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 2.97 points, or 0.30 percent, higher at 979.26, while the Nasdaq was down 7.64 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,965.96.
 Shares of Microsoft, which announced a 29 percent decline in second-quarter profit on Thursday night, fell by 8.26 percent. The software giant blamed low business demand for its poor sales and said that Windows Vista, the operating system that the company had hoped would carry revenue, continued to struggle to gain customers. 
 Shares of Amazon fell by 8 percent after the company said that declines in video game sales and rising shipping costs pinched the bottom line.
 The news from Microsoft and others was released after trading closed on Thursday and cast questions over whether the earlier string of better-than-expected reports might have led the markets a bit too much.
 ''Most of the profit surprises have come from cost-cutting or productivity enhancement, but the underlying comments the companies are giving are very cautious,'' said Nick Kalivas of MF Global Research.
 But Friday was bound to be an uneasy session, analysts said, as investors looked to sell shares and lock in profits from a two-week rally. 
 In the period from July 13 to Thursday, when the Dow closed above 9,000 for the first time since January, the index gained 10 percent. 
 ''This has been a very powerful move,'' Mr. Kalivas said, ''so I think the market is ripe to consolidate itself.''
 The market received no help from economic data Friday. Consumer confidence in the United States fell in late July to its lowest level since April on growing pessimism about the long-term economic outlook, especially about income and jobs, a survey showed.
 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final July consumer sentiment reading fell to 66.0, from June's 70.8, though it was slightly higher than economists' median expectation for a reading of 65.0, according to a Reuters poll.
 ''People are a little more worried about the economy, especially over the labor market and what's happening in Washington. It's still consistent with the picture that the economy is bottoming out, but you are not going to get a big bounce in consumer spending,'' said David Wyss, chief economist with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
 In the financial sector, two credit card issuers, American Express and Capital One, reported quarterly profit declines of about 50 percent on Thursday night. But shares of both companies shrugged off the reports and ended in positive territory, with Capital One gaining more than 8 percent.
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was unchanged at 95 20/32 and the yield held at 3.66 percent. 
 But concerns over the flood of supply in next week's record $115 billion auction of government Treasury notes have been compounded by doubts about the timing of the sale when many bond dealers are away on holiday.
 ''Right now it's dubious about who's going to show up,'' said Tom di Galoma, the head of fixed income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners.
 But by far the biggest factor behind the bond market's recent struggles has been the energized stock market. As investors continue to pull out of bonds to pursue higher equities returns, Mr. di Galoma said, yields will continue to rise.
 Oil prices continued a three-week rally on Friday, rising to $68.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Following are the results of Friday's Treasury auction of 70-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Hospital Shows a Way to Save: Doctors Get Salaries, Not Fees

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Visiting the Cleveland Clinic this week, President Obama held up that well-known hospital as a model for the rest of the country. But for most of the nation's nearly 6,000 hospitals, copying the Cleveland Clinic would be like asking the Durham Bulls, a minor league team, to copy the New York Yankees.
 A more accessible example is a hospital that sits a bit more than a home-run blast from the Baseball Hall of Fame here. Called Bassett Healthcare, this modest hospital of 180 beds delivers high-quality care at low costs in the face of federal reimbursement policies that discourage many of its best practices. 
 Changing those policies is crucial to the success of health care reform, economists say -- something Mr. Obama said that he would do. ''Our proposals would change incentives so that doctors and nurses finally are free to give patients the best care, not just the most expensive care,'' the president said Thursday in Ohio. 
 But almost nothing in proposed legislation that has so far emerged in Congress would encourage the creation of similar hospitals.
 Bassett looks like a small liberal arts college, with ivy-covered fieldstone buildings connected by a warren of passageways. But what really sets it apart is the way the system pays its 260 doctors.
 Doctors in the United States are usually paid fees for each service they provide. The more procedures and tests they order, the more money they pocket. There is widespread agreement among health policy analysts that many of these procedures are unnecessary, raising costs in ways that often do nothing to improve patient health.
 By contrast, Bassett -- like the Cleveland Clinic and a small number of other health systems in this country -- pays salaries to all of its doctors. No matter how many tests or procedures are performed, they take home the same amount of money. Medical costs at Bassett are lower than those at 90 percent of the hospitals in New York, while the quality of care ranks among the top 10 percent in the nation, surveys show.
 Dr. William F. Streck, the longtime president of Bassett, said the hospital paid salaries that were competitive with the money earned in a fee-for-service setting. Some fee-dependent physicians, though, either by working hard or by providing excessive treatments, can make more, an ability doctors trade associations have long defended. 
 ''Everyone knows that the Bassett model is the right model,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat involved in negotiations over health care legislation. ''The question is, How do you get from here to there?''
 It is a question that has plagued lawmakers and medical experts for nearly a century. As early as 1910, Abraham Flexner wrote a landmark report that argued teaching hospitals should be staffed only with salaried doctors. In 1970, the Carnegie Commission released a report calling for drastic improvements in rural health care, and highlighted Bassett as a model.
 Many doctors who work at Bassett believe deeply in its mission. Bassett has opened 13 clinics in schools around the region. The clinics lose money, but Bassett is considering opening 14 more. 
 ''I was in private practice for years in New Mexico,'' said Dr. Philip A. Heavner, the chief of pediatrics at Bassett, ''and there was no interest in doing anything like this because people thought it would take volume away from their practices.''
 Dr. Randall Zuckerman, an attending surgeon at the Hospital of St. Raphael in New Haven, left Bassett a year ago because his wife wanted their four children to grow up closer to family. Since many of his patients see fee-dependent doctors, Dr. Zuckerman said in an interview, their care is more disjointed than was common at Bassett.
 ''They get a lot of different consultations, some necessary and some not,'' he said. ''They are always missing parts of their medical records because the information is coming from multiple private offices.''
 Michelle Griffiths, 41, of Edmeston found a lump on her breast six years ago. During cancer care at Bassett, Ms. Griffiths's appointments to see her oncologist and primary care doctor are often scheduled on the same day. One doctor will sometimes accompany her during a procedure performed by another, and each has her complete medical history.
 ''The communication amongst all of my doctors is impressive,'' said Ms. Griffiths, who works as a database administrator for the insurance company New York Central Mutual. ''They always call each other or shoot each other e-mails.''
 Such coordinated care is a hallmark of integrated health systems with salaried doctors, like Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic, the Veterans Administration and the Cleveland Clinic. In each system, medical records are electronic, so doctors have quick access to patients' entire histories, including X-rays and prescriptions. And doctors often treat patients in interdisciplinary teams where coordination is encouraged since no one loses money by passing a patient to a colleague.
 But for some, wages are not enough. Dr. J. Turner Stauffer, a gastroenterologist in Thomasville, Ga., left Bassett 10 years ago. He has four children, including two of college age.
 ''To provide for my family, I felt I needed to be reimbursed on a fee-for-service model,'' Dr. Stauffer said. ''I make three to four times what I was making there, although I don't know what my salary at Bassett would be now.''
 Dr. Stauffer would not reveal his pay. A recent national survey found that gastroenterologists earned $457,000 on average, with the top 10 percent making $715,600. 
 For decades, powerful doctors groups like the American Medical Association opposed efforts to change fee-for-service pay systems. And the culture of medicine has been entrepreneurial, with doctors saying they wanted to be their own bosses.
 ''Medicine is the last cottage industry,'' said Dr. Jordan Cohen, president emeritus of the Association of American Medical Colleges.
 Even without legislation, much of this is changing. The share of doctors in one- or two-physician practices dropped to 33 percent in 2005, from 41 percent in 1997, according to the Center for Studying Health System Change. Just 10 percent of doctors in their early 40s work in one- or two-doctor practices, compared with 38 percent of those 60 and older. 
 Whether these trends will encourage the creation of more hospitals like Bassett is uncertain. Legislation pending in the House instructs the government to create pilot programs for ''accountable care organizations'' like Bassett. But the history of Medicare is full of pilot programs.
 Dr. Streck said there was growing recognition that hospitals like Bassett were models. ''Does it appear that Congress is going there?'' he said. ''No.''
 Senator Schumer said the Senate Finance Committee was determined to make major changes to the government's fee-for-service payment system.
 ''We talk about it all the time,'' he said, ''but it's uncharted waters.''

HEADLINE: Trip Propels Clinton Back Into Limelight

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: PHUKET, Thailand 

 BODY:
At every stop during her visit to Southeast Asia this week, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered the same message: ''The United States is back.'' She was talking about America's role in a region where its visibility had dimmed during the Bush years, but she might as well have been talking about herself.
 After being sidelined at home in recent weeks by a broken elbow, Mrs. Clinton thrust herself back into the limelight, making headlines with unexpected statements about Iran, North Korea and Myanmar -- at least one of which her aides felt obliged to clarify. And she reaffirmed that overseas, at least, she is not just the nation's chief diplomat but one of its most reliable celebrities, trailing perhaps only President Obama in star power. 
 In India, Mrs. Clinton was a ubiquitous presence on the three main news channels, giving interviews, sipping coffee with tycoons in Mumbai, marveling over climate-friendly buildings and dining at a New Delhi restaurant where one of the menus is named after her husband, former President Bill Clinton.
 In Bangkok, she bantered with two Thai journalists in a televised town hall meeting, which, like previous public events with Mrs. Clinton in Turkey, Japan and South Korea, ended up being a cross between a Council on Foreign Relations panel and an episode of ''Dr. Phil.''
 What, the secretary of state was asked, does she talk about with her husband? ''We talk about our dog, who got sick and had to go to the vet,'' she said.
 And what does she make of the beleaguered American economy? Mrs. Clinton invoked the name of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his recent Congressional testimony before lamenting that unemployment was still high in many parts of the country. ''We're not out of the woods,'' she said, in a guarded tone. ''I guess that's the best way to say it.''
 Mrs. Clinton batted away suggestions that she had been marginalized. That, she said, was a canard propagated by the news media, which jumped on the fact that her recovery from the elbow injury forced her to cancel two foreign trips, including one with Mr. Obama to Russia.
 ''I'm not with the president on the trip and all of a sudden everybody goes, 'Oh, where is she? She's gone, disappeared,' '' Mrs. Clinton said in a tone of mock horror, as the audience giggled.
 Certainly, she seemed determined to continue her breakneck schedule back home. On Friday, after flying from Thailand, she scheduled a full day of meetings, including one with the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton is to appear live on ''Meet the Press.'' And next week, she will be co-chairwoman of a high-level meeting with Chinese officials, along with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
 Mrs. Clinton stayed in the news, even from unlikely places like Phuket, a lush beach resort that played host this week to a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
 She warned about nuclear links between North Korea and Myanmar. And she offered a rare glimpse into what the United States might do if Iran did not respond to its diplomatic overture. Her comments about the possibility of extending a ''defense umbrella'' over the Middle East ricocheted around foreign-policy circles.
 Mrs. Clinton's aides did their best to convince reporters traveling with her that she was not signaling any change in administration policy. But when a secretary of state muses publicly about one of the world's most sensitive diplomatic problems, the story quickly takes on a life of its own.
 In India, Mrs. Clinton encountered a different problem: a savvy environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, who seized on a visit by her to a ''green building'' outside New Delhi to repeat India's rejection of American demands that it accept binding cuts in its greenhouse gas emissions.
 Fortunately for her, most of the audiences seemed to care less about greenhouse gases and security umbrellas than about hearing dish from her about her life, her ambitions and, particularly, her relationship with Mr. Obama.
 On the inevitable question of how she felt working for the man she had fought in the primary campaign, she said, ''The president is the president; I tried to be the president and was not successful.''
 Nor did she bite at questions about whether she would ever run for the White House again. ''That's not anything I'm at all thinking about,'' she said. Mrs. Clinton did offer some morsels about Mr. Obama's courtship of her to be the secretary. She said she resisted his initial job offer and gave him names of people she thought would be suitable candidates. Mr. Obama told her he needed her, however, and his persistence wore her down.
 ''He gave me an enormous amount of authority as secretary of state, and really everything I asked for so that I could the job that he wanted me to do,,'' she said, ''and I was running out of excuses.''

HEADLINE: Don't Shortchange National Service

 BODY:
Just a few months ago, Congress overwhelmingly approved the Serve America Act, a bipartisan measure to increase the opportunities for Americans to participate in national and community service. Now, having taken credit for their good deed, lawmakers cannot seem to come up with the money to back up their votes. 
 The act's core mandate is staged growth of the domestic volunteer force, which includes AmeriCorps, whose members are eligible for a small living stipend and a modest educational stipend after an intense year of work. The goal is to have 250,000 volunteers by 2017.
 But the House version of next year's budget for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services contains $90 million less than President Obama requested for the Corporation for National and Community Service, which manages the volunteer program. 
 Most egregious, the House omitted $41 million sought by Mr. Obama to expand AmeriCorps next year by 10,000 members, who would be put to serious tasks like mentoring at-risk students, cleaning up parks and responding to emergencies. Applying the House math, AmeriCorps would field about 75,000 to 76,000 volunteers in fiscal 2010, roughly the same level as this year. 
 In another mistaken move, the House bill also shortchanges a newly created Social Innovation Fund intended to provide money for proven private approaches to social problems. The aim is to spread their good ideas and programs. Mr. Obama requested $50 million; the House allotted $35 million for the fund. That seems particularly unwise given the need for fresh approaches and the willingness of foundations and philanthropists to match the federal investment. 
 The action moves now to the Senate. Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is chairman of the chamber's relevant subcommittee, can make a valuable contribution by leading his colleagues to resist the House cuts to Mr. Obama's national service request, and then standing firm when the issue goes to a House-Senate conference committee.
 Yes, these are tough economic times, but applications to join AmeriCorps have risen exponentially. Lawmakers should look elsewhere to economize.

HEADLINE: Lord of 'Rings' and Anime's Avatar Hit Comic-Con

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Few directors are as revered by the fervent fans who attend Comic-Con as Peter Jackson, and he showed up before a rapturous crowd of 6,500 Friday afternoon with a plea.
 ''I wish you could just take the amount of energy in here, bottle it and give it to Hollywood executives to drink,'' he said.
 What passes for royalty in the movie world had shown up to hold court at what has become the biggest annual gathering for the most passionate fans of comics, movies, science fiction, fantasy and video games -- just the sort of folks the studios and networks are most eager to attract and seduce.
 Mr. Jackson, the New Zealander who is lord of the ''Rings'' trilogy and all things fantasy and horror, was on hand to promote a science fiction thriller directed by a protege, Neill Blomkamp. 
 John Lasseter, the king of American computer-generated animation, swapped trade secrets (through an interpreter) with Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's emperor of anime.
 And some of Hollywood's flashiest stars -- Denzel Washington, Robert Downey Jr., Cameron Diaz, Megan Fox and Josh Brolin among them -- shared their presence with the masses. 
 In fact, Friday's lineup -- the convention officially began Thursday -- proved once and for all that virtually no one who makes or stars in Hollywood blockbusters can afford to sidestep this four-day conclave, which is all about direct communication with the fans. It is also very much about marketing, an event that has acquired major importance on the industry's calendar; major studios promote their biggest coming projects, and television producers for shows like ''Lost'' and ''24'' try to stoke interest in their approaching seasons. 
 That can mean painful moments, as actors endure what amounts to a good-natured hazing from fans in cat fur, Bo Peep outfits and neon pink hair. Mr. Washington fairly gave up after he managed to compare working with Gary Oldman to ''good sex'' and used a racial epithet in parrying a friendly catcall. ''We'll be hearing about that,'' he said.
 The actresses routinely fielded marriage proposals from members of the crowd. ''Yes. Where are you?'' responded Cameron Diaz, on hand to talk up the thriller ''The Box.'' She had never attended the convention before, but appeared to have the drill down pat.
 The impact of Comic-Con's myriad panels and parties has been supercharged by an increasingly powerful -- and instantaneous -- tendency by nearly all involved to communicate their experiences via the Internet.
 Warner Brothers gave plenty to tweet about during a two-and-a-half-hour presentation Friday that included scenes from Spike Jonze's fuzzy and furious adaptation of Maurice Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are''; a specially prepared ''emoticon graphic novel'' introducing the postapocalyptic release ''The Book of Eli'' with Mr. Washington; and a bravura performance by Mr. Downey, who popped onstage in shirt and Op Art tie to serve as M.C. for a peek at his ''Sherlock Holmes.''
 ''I think the studio gave me too much credit thinking I was smart enough to play this guy, but they cast me anyway,'' Mr. Downey said of what promises to be an exceptionally louche and rumpled take on the Baker Street sleuth. Asked about his martial arts training for the film, he assured the audience, ''I could windmill through the lot of you, one after another.''
 While some worried that economic woes would keep the studios away and the crowds down, the presentations were even bigger than in previous years and featured, if anything, an even bigger array of top names. And the fans not only filled the San Diego Convention Center to capacity but also kept it packed through some of the less high-profile presentations that, in previous years, might have been more sparsely attended.
 This year some of the industry's more ambitious filmmakers showed up to receive adoration from the fans, and to pay their respects in turn. 
 Mr. Miyazaki, who seldom visits the United States, was an especially big catch. He had arrived to promote the English-language version of his latest, ''Ponyo,'' about a goldfish mermaid and her young boy companion. 
 Asked by Mr. Lasseter, who oversees animation at Disney and its Pixar unit, about how he goes about creating his stories, the silver-haired Mr. Miyazaki, who appeared both bewildered and mildly amused by the encounter, said: ''My process is thinking, thinking and thinking about my stories for a long time. If you have a better way, please let me know.'' 
 Mr. Miyazaki was greeted with rapturous hollers, and the capacity audience hung on his every word, for all his puzzlement at the lavish attention. 
 Mr. Lasseter, meanwhile, introduced Disney and Pixar ventures like 3-D versions of the ''Toy Story'' movies and ''Beauty and the Beast'' and a coming jazz-age musical called ''The Princess and the Frog,'' which relies on conventional hand-drawn animation. He also let slip that the Disney animation shop will be soon be posting tidbits about its works in progress online, beginning with a video blog he expects to begin in the next day or two.
 The director Tim Burton, who said he had not visited the convention since he was a student in the '70s, showed up Thursday to plug his ''Alice in Wonderland,'' from Disney, then, on Friday, to talk about ''9,'' an animated film of which he was a producer.
 Mr. Jackson, meanwhile, wrapped up the day with a preview of Mr. Blomkamp's ''District 9,'' a science fiction adventure about apartheidlike townships for space aliens. The Comic-Con crowd ate it up, but it went ballistic when the ''Lord of the Rings'' director started riffing on another project, the big-screen adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ''Hobbit'' that he intends to write and produce and have Guillermo del Toro direct.
 He said he expected to deliver a script to Warner Brothers in three or four weeks and hoped to be in a position to start offering roles to actors within two months -- assuming studio executives approve of his script.
 ''Drop Warner Brothers a line and encourage them to be kind to us,'' he said.
 As movie stars and star-quality filmmakers occupy ever more space at Comic-Con, old hands are wrestling with what one of them, the author, television producer and veteran convention panelist Mark Evanier, called their most troubling question: ''What am I playing against?''
 Mr. Evanier's Friday panel discussion, with the comic and voice actor Stan Freberg, was scheduled opposite Mr. Jackson, one of Comic-Con's biggest draws. And Pat Oliphant, the political cartoonist, was on a panel opposite Mr. Miyazaki's appearance. 
 But then, any gathering that could embrace Mr. Freberg, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Oliphant and Mr. Miyazaki all at once probably has room for everyone.

HEADLINE: West Bank: U.S. Aids Palestinians In Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The United States has transferred $200 million to the Palestinians to help ease their government's growing budget crisis. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced the aid with the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, on Friday. The Palestinian Authority's budget deficit is growing, and it has borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from commercial banks to cover the government payroll. Mr. Fayyad said the shortfall was caused by Israeli restrictions on the Palestinian economy and the failure of some donors to make good on their pledges.

HEADLINE: Racist Web Posts Traced To Homeland Security

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
After federal border agents detained several Mexican immigrants in western New York in June, an article about the incident in a local newspaper drew an onslaught of vitriolic postings on its Web site. Some were racist. Others attacked farmers in the region, an apple-growing area east of Rochester, accusing them of harboring illegal workers. Still others made personal attacks about the reporter who wrote the article.
 Most of the posts were made anonymously. But in reviewing the logs of its Internet server, the paper, The Wayne County Star in Wolcott, traced three of them to Internet protocol addresses at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border protection. 
 Homeland Security started an investigation into the posts this month, according to the reporter, Louise Hoffman-Broach, and Richard M. Healy, the Wayne County district attorney. A spokeswoman for the federal agency's inspector general said she could neither confirm nor deny an investigation; department rules prohibit the use of office equipment for the personal transmission of material that could offend fellow employees or the public. 
 Coming on the eve of the apple harvest season, the Web posts and the investigation -- first reported this week on The Star's Web site -- have ratcheted up longstanding tensions in Wayne County, where farmers and laborers have accused immigration officials of using heavy-handed tactics like racial profiling and arbitrary or unjustified detentions.
 Such tactics, the farmers say, have scared Hispanic farmworkers from the region just as growers are preparing for the harvest.
 Representative Dan Maffei, who represents the area in Congress, said the allegations of overaggressive immigration enforcement, coming from a wide range of constituents, were ''of extreme concern.''
 ''I'm investigating these reports to make sure that people's rights aren't being harmed and that the economy of Wayne County is not being harmed,'' said Mr. Maffei, a Democrat.
 A. J. Price, a regional spokesman for United States Customs and Border Protection, defended the work of the area's officers. ''We are constantly criticized for doing our job, and that's just part of our job,'' Mr. Price said.
 Local officials and residents say that beginning about 2006, federal officials stepped up their enforcement of immigration laws in western New York.
 Farmers and other residents said the push created a climate of fear in communities whose economies depend on migrant laborers, many of them illegal immigrants.
 The Obama administration has moved to a less confrontational policy at work sites, focusing on employers. But Customs and Border Protection, which does not conduct work-site inspections, had not changed its strategy in New York, Mr. Price said.
 The latest flare-up began with a boat trip on June 12. A local farmer, Robert Norris, decided to take a Mexican employee and relatives of another worker for a spin on Lake Ontario, Ms. Hoffman-Broach said. 
 Federal agents stopped the boat because it had too many people on board, Mr. Price said. When some of the passengers were unable to produce documentation proving they were citizens or legal immigrants, he said, they were detained. All but one was eventually released, The Star reported. 
 The article about the arrests, posted on June 16, led to a torrent of angry Web postings. One, sent from a fake e-mail address, said, ''watcha doing to mi wifey, no checky her papeles. she no legal, but she havey benifit card.''
 A response, which carried a Homeland Security Internet protocol address, read: ''That sounds like my boyfriend. Leave him alones and get your own. My boyfriend works sometimes but he is really good at getting FREE benefits from the Federal and State government.''
 Another post, apparently sent from a separate computer linked to Homeland Security, read in part: ''These farmers have a problem because the gravy train that they were riding for soooooo long is being brought to light.'' 
 The newspaper removed the posts. It also reported that it had discovered others, dating to last year, that appeared to have come from computers affiliated with Homeland Security.

HEADLINE: Gates Faults U.S. on Data Privacy and Immigration

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, India 

 BODY:
In a far-ranging speech on Friday, Bill Gates criticized the American government's policy on immigration and data privacy, predicted giant leaps in technology in the near future and explained why he had to shut down his Facebook page. 
 ''Over the next decade, the entire way we interact'' with computers will change, Mr. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, told hundreds of government officials and information technology executives in New Delhi. Mr. Gates spoke of cellphones that would recognize people around them or be used to test for diseases, computers equipped with voice recognition and an Internet that was used for much more than Web pages. 
 While the recession has been a ''big deal,'' it has not slowed innovation, he said, in part because countries like India and companies like Microsoft are investing in education and research for a new generation of computer scientists. 
 Microsoft is angling to work on India's national identity card project, Mr. Gates said, and he will be meeting with Nandan Nilekani, the minister in charge. Like Mr. Gates, Mr. Nilekani stopped running the technology company he helped to start, Infosys, after expanding it into one of the biggest players in the business. He is now tasked with providing identity cards for India's 1.2 billion citizens starting in 2011. Right now in India, many records like births, deaths, immunizations and driving violations are kept on paper in local offices. 
 Mr. Gates was also critical of the United States government's unwillingness to adopt a national identity card, or allow some businesses, like health care, to centralize data-keeping on individuals. 
 ''It has always come back to the idea that 'The computer knows too much about you,' '' he said. 
 The United States ''got off to a bad start'' when it comes to using computers to keep data about its citizens, he said. Doctors are not allowed to share records about an individual patient, and virtual doctor visits are banned, he said, which ''wastes a lot of money.'' The United States ''had better come up with a better model'' for health care, he said. 
 He was also critical of Congress's stance on immigration, and said he would like to see immigration exceptions for ''smart people.'' Canadian laws are more favorable, he said, because they allow immigrants to work if they are offered a high-paying job. Microsoft has created ''a lot of jobs in Canada for that reason,'' he said. 
 Asked whether he ever ''unplugs,'' abandoning e-mail messages, computers and his cellphone entirely, Mr. Gates laughed and said ''I'm not a 24-hour technology person.'' He said he read a lot ''and sometimes not on a screen.'' He added that he was not big on text messaging. ''All these tools of technology let us waste our time if we're not careful,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gates said the buzzwords ''social networking'' applied to something that had been around for a long time -- a way to communicate with numerous people at the same time.
 He acknowledged that he once had a Facebook page, but every day ''ten thousand people tried to be my friend.'' He said he spent too much time trying to decide ''Do I know them? Don't I know them?'' Ultimately, he said, ''I had to give it up.''

HEADLINE: National Mall Lags in Competition for Cash

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With crumbling sidewalks near the Jefferson Memorial sinking into the Tidal Basin and reflecting pools filled with green, smelly water, some say the National Mall is in danger of becoming a national disgrace.
 ''It does not deserve the name 'National Mall,' '' said Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting member of Congress. ''We ought to call it something else until it looks decent.''
 The Obama administration recently steered $55 million in economic stimulus money toward repairs, but Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that was only a down payment on the nearly $400 million needed to fix up a national park that draws more visitors than Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon and Yosemite combined. 
 Washington has no vote in the House or Senate, and an Associated Press analysis of Congressional spending since 2005 found that the mall has been at a disadvantage in competing for extra money from lawmakers, compared with sites in the districts of powerful members of Congress. 
 Last year, when dozens of ducks and ducklings died of avian botulism because the water in a mall pool near the Capitol was so fetid, and as urgent repairs were needed to stop the Jefferson Memorial's sea wall from sinking into the mud, the Senate killed a $3.5 million earmark for the mall.
 Instead, financing went to other places. All told, members of Congress sent home more than $181 million in earmarks through the park service budget last year -- an election year -- according to data compiled by the group Taxpayers for Common Sense and analyzed by The A.P.
 The mall did not just lose out on earmarks. In January, Congress deleted $200 million in stimulus financing for the mall. And last year, a bill that would have appropriated $100 million for mall repairs failed.
 Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, said mall financing was not an emergency. ''It's entirely appropriate for Congress to fund repairs for the National Mall in the traditional process,'' he said, ''but the American people are smart enough to know that it will do very little or absolutely nothing to provide economic stimulus.''
 The House Republican whip, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, similarly derided efforts to ''help upkeep the grass on the lawns of Washington.''
 The mall must compete for financing with a network of nearly 400 national parks, parkways and recreational sites. It received $31 million, or about 1 percent, of the park service's $2.75 billion budget in 2008. An agency spokesman, Jeffrey Olson, said Yellowstone received $33.5 million in the 2008 fiscal year, the largest budget of any national park that year.
 At 2.2 million acres, Yellowstone is more than 3,000 times larger than the mall. But the mall gets about eight times as many visitors.
 Thousands of events, including festivals, protests and the Independence Day fireworks, play out on the mall. In January, the park service estimated that 1.8 million people crammed into the area to witness the presidential inauguration. Altogether, the mall gets about 25 million visits each year.
 Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee that oversees parks service financing, blamed the Bush administration for not providing enough financing for the service. 
 ''If it's America's front yard,'' Mr. Dicks said, referring to the mall's nickname, ''and everybody in the world wants to come here, we ought to put our best foot forward.''
 A public-private partnership, the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, is also working to improve it and aims to raise $500 million in about five years. 
 So far, the group has taken small steps, like securing private money from Coca-Cola to start the mall's first recycling program. It could take 15 years to complete larger improvements like re-engineering reflecting pools to circulate water, laying new walkways to preserve grass and installing a sprinkler system to keep the mall green, said Caroline Cunningham, the trust's president.
 ''It's resonating in communities around the country,'' Ms. Cunningham said.

HEADLINE: A Second Home for First-Gens

BYLINE: By DANA JENNINGS. 
Dana Jennings is a reporter and editor at The New York Times.

 BODY:
As thousands of low-income, first-generation freshmen flock to campus in the next two months, many, despite their intelligence and optimism, will arrive only to be gone in an academic eye blink. Just 11 percent of them earn a bachelor's degree after six years, according to the Pell Institute, compared with 55 percent of their peers. 
 That fact was frustrating administrators at the University of Cincinnati, where more than 40 percent of its 5,000 freshmen this fall will be the first in their families to go to college. In its mission to get low-income, first-generation students through its doors, the university was succeeding. But once in, many were failing. 
 ''These students find themselves on campus, and overwhelmed quickly,'' says Stephanie A. Cappel, the executive director of Partner for Achieving School Success, a center devoted to university-community partnerships and outreach programs.''They don't even know what questions to ask.'' 
 To teach them how to ask the essential questions, the university opened a novel theme house last September. ''I see this as a runway, with the kids taking off from here,'' Dr. Cappel says.
 The Gen-1 Theme House began its first year with 15 students, mostly minorities and all eligible for low-income Pell grants. Eight ultimately accepted the house's academic focus and strict rules (no alcohol or overnight visitors, midnight curfew on weeknights and 3 a.m. on weekends). The other seven either found the rules too constricting and moved out, or were evicted for breaking them. This fall, 20 or so new freshmen are expected to enter the house, which is overseen by Dr. Cappel's center.
 When I visited last semester, the students at the Gen-1 House were a bit shy and full of nervous laughter. Still, they were college freshmen, filled with that heady mix of uncertainty and knowing that the world was made just for them. But as children of no privilege, they take nothing for granted. They are the sons and daughters of single parents, of hairdressers and woodworkers. They see college as an escape from their old lives, and as a way to set an example for their sisters and brothers.
 ''Both my parents were high school dropouts,'' says Jennifer Abrefa, who earned A's in high school. ''But I always had dreams of leading the good life. I've always wanted to go to college. I've always wanted that degree. I have to keep my eyes on the prize.'' 
 Ms. Abrefa, who grew up in the South Bronx before her family moved to Columbus, Ohio, and who wants to be a nurse, is the oldest of six children. She understands all too well the gravitational pull that home can exert. ''I always thought I'd go back to New York to go to school,'' she says. ''But my mom had another baby, and she wanted me to stay close. Every time something goes wrong at home, I'm the one people want to call.'' 
 She tries to keep family demands in perspective: ''My biggest challenge has been to stay focused. I'm not here to fool around.'' One house rule is no going home for the first five weeks.
 Kendall Peterson, a biochemistry major, knows that the eyes of his family are on him. He's the youngest of his mother's children but the oldest of his father's. ''I'm the big brother of my dad's kids,'' he says, ''so I try to set an example for my younger siblings, and for my nieces and nephews.''
 The University of Cincinnati, a public research university of 20,000 undergraduates in the city center, has the feel of a green, hilly oasis. Down a hill on the far side of campus sits Stratford Heights, a cluster of modern residences that include theme houses dedicated to music, engineering and communications, as well as Gen-1. In the house on the common-area tables were copies of Seventeen, Black Enterprise and Rolling Stone. A large flat-screen television with a Nintendo GameCube held down one wall. 
 Learning takes place here. There are in-house tutoring and study sessions -- sometimes mandatory, depending on a student's grades. There is advising, counseling and mentoring by faculty members, administrators and peers. The program coordinator, Judith Mause, teaches a yearlong course for credit on the first year of college; it focuses on topics like study skills and time management. Gen-1 also wants to bring the university's resources to students' doorstep. Last year's dinner guests included the dean of students, the director of ethnic programs and services, and financial aid advisers. 
 ''You don't know what you don't know,'' says Dr. Cappel, who has walked in her students' shoes -- she, like the other house administrators, is a first-gen graduate. Dr. Cappel was widowed, in her late 20s and raising two children when she decided she needed to transform her life by going to college. ''I was cleaning toilets,'' she says. 
 As with any home, some Gen-1 residents felt they got too much attention. ''The staff mean well, but they're on our backs too much, increasing the stress we already feel,'' Ms. Abrefa says. ''They expect us to be perfect in a way. But we're going to make mistakes, and learn from them.''
 Adds Amber Lofton, her roommate, ''Sometimes it's suffocating.''
 Indeed, the students give up some freedom -- including their right to make potentially poor decisions -- in exchange for a better shot at academic success. (Students sign a contract, committing to all the house's rules.) ''We are very paternalistic,'' says Bob Suess, the project director. ''We are intentionally in their faces.'' 
 First-generation students struggle for many reasons. They aren't prepared, they don't get help choosing a college that's the right fit, their families often discourage them. Because they don't understand college culture, they draw back rather than immerse themselves. 
 ''The problems of the first year fall disproportionately on first-generation and economically disadvantaged students,'' says John N. Gardner, executive director of the Policy Center on the First Year of College. ''You're an immigrant. You have to become assimilated. But there's no Ellis Island for these students.''
 Many institutions have special programs. Florida Memorial University, near Miami, has a program called Black Male College Explorers, whose goal is to recruit, keep and graduate first-generation black men. Fresno State University is using a grant award to provide first-generation students with extra help and remediation in mathematics and English. Both Carroll University in Waukesha, Wis., and College of Idaho focus on Latino first-generation students. 
 At the University of Cincinnati, the residential aspect is crucial, according to Ms. Mause, because for students to succeed they ''need to be embedded in the university environment.'' The Gen-1 Theme House is to be an anchor as the students learn to navigate the university and to be their own advocates. ''There's nobody in your world to show you,'' Ms. Mause says.
 This past year, the residents' grades ranged from struggling-to-achieve-C's to dean's list. All of the students plan to return to school this fall, and some will mentor the incoming class. House alumni -- only one or two will stay on as ''sophomore ambassadors'' -- are being encouraged to take advantage of a new universitywide support program to smooth the way to the second year. 
 Administrators hope to improve retention this year. ''In spite of our better judgment, we accepted a couple of students who shouldn't have been,'' Dr. Cappel says of the seven residents who left the house but remained at the university. Applications include an interview and an essay on why they want to be in the house. ''This year,'' she adds, ''we're telling the students that if you don't have the academic goals, this isn't the place for you.'' 
 Dr. Cappel acknowledges some concern before the house opened that residents might be stigmatized as poor. But the students ''thought it was cool to belong to the house,'' she says, adding, ''They wanted it printed on sweatshirts.''
 The house became their extended family. Jalisa Harris, who grew up in the West End of Cincinnati and is studying criminal justice, values the common ground. Whether pressures from home or lack of money, ''I can talk about any of the stuff in my past with my fellow first-gen students,'' she says, adding, ''They've dealt with the same things I've dealt with.''
 The students say that a lot of the best teaching they experienced came from one another. ''Amber has taught me to keep moving forward,'' Ms. Abrefa says. ''She's like a sister to me. We're closer than sisters. Gosh, I love Amber. We don't want to follow in our parents' footsteps. We have taught each other a lot.''
 Ms. Abrefa and Ms. Lofton, who is studying theater, plan to room together this coming year. 
 ''She's my best friend,'' Ms. Lofton says of Ms. Abrefa. ''We will come down to our last two dollars, and we will split it.'' 
 And what lesson could be better than that?
 Colleges nationwide are trying to address the special needs of first-generation students, including thecolleges below, which have received grants for innovative approaches to recruiting and retaining them.
 First-generation college students find a new family, and future.

HEADLINE: North Dakota, A Place to Go for Employment

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
The state job service agency in North Dakota is bursting with openings -- a total of more than 9,000 in the public and private sectors. It's a sign that the recession is not affecting all states equally. Of the 50 states, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate -- just 4.2 percent, compared with 9.5 percent nationwide. 
 Why has North Dakota remained relatively unscathed? A balanced economy, including robust energy and agricultural industries, have helped keep the state strong, said Michael Ziesch, research analyst for Job Service North Dakota. It also did not have as much exposure to subprime lending as other states, he said. 
 Just a few years ago, North Dakota's unemployment rate was so low that officials traveled to other states, trying to convince people to move there. Now officials don't have to do that; the economy is doing it for them.
 Included in the influx of job seekers to North Dakota are people from Michigan, which has the highest jobless rate -- 15.2 percent -- in the nation.

HEADLINE: The New Joblessness

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
The U.S. economy is not only shedding jobs at a record rate; it is shedding more jobs than it is supposed to. It's bad enough that the unemployment rate has doubled in only a year and a half and one out of six construction workers is out of work. What truly troubles President Obama's economic advisers is that, even adjusting for the recession, the contraction in employment seems way too high. As one administration official said, ''This has been a very steep job loss.'' One proof, he added, is that the country is deviating from the standard (among economists) jobs predictor known as Okun's Law.
 In the 1960s, Arthur Okun, a prominent economist, claimed to have discovered a mathematical relationship between the decline in output (that is, goods and services produced) and the rise in unemployment. It held up pretty well until recently. But this time around, although the decline in output would have predicted a rise in unemployment to 8 percent, the actual jobless rate has soared to 9.5 percent. So this recession is killing off jobs even faster than the things -- like automobiles, houses, computers and newspapers -- that jobholders produce. 
 The Federal Reserve now expects unemployment to surpass 10 percent (the postwar high was 10.8 percent in 1982). By almost every other measure, ours is already the worst job environment since the Great Depression. The economy has shed 6.5 million jobs -- nearly 5 percent of the total, far outstripping the 3 percent that were lost in the early '80s. Economists fear that even when the economy turns around, the job market will be stagnant. Keith Hall, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, sums it up as ''an ugly picture out there.''
 Explanations for the collapse of the great American job machine begin with the marked absence of what is called labor hoarding. Usually during recessions, firms keep most of their employees on the payroll even as business slows, in effect stockpiling them for better days. In the current downturn, hoarding seems to have gone into reverse. Not only are firms laying off redundant workers, but they seem to be cutting into the bone. Hall says the absence of hoarding means that firms do not expect business to pick up soon. This is supported by other evidence, like a doubling in the number of involuntary part-time workers (there are nine million of them) and the shrinking workweek, now 33 hours -- the shortest ever recorded. Presumably, before companies start to rehire laid-off workers, they will ask their current employees to work more.
 Those who hope for a rebound argue that employers, frightened by the financial shocks and the credit crisis of last fall, effectively panicked. That is, they cut deeper than necessary. And that may be.
 But layoffs are only part of the story. The problem isn't just that so many workers have received pink slips but also that companies are failing to hire. And this, unfortunately, has been a trend for most of the past decade (unnoticed, perhaps, because the mortgage bubble was papering over latent weaknesses). At the end of the Clinton era, which also marked the end of a decade-long boom, companies that were opening or expanding operations added nearly 8 workers for every 100 already on the payroll. During the recession of 2001, the figure dropped to 7 per 100: optimistic firms were a bit less optimistic. The surprising fact is that when the recession ended, the percentage stayed at 7. ''We never got our groove back,'' asserts Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com. In the current recession, the rate has fallen to 6 per 100.
 It's hard to give a definitive explanation for this trend, but among the reasons are a decline in innovation in the aftermath of the tech boom, leading to fewer new businesses, and the aging of the population. More people have dropped out of the work force, and a smaller work force tends to dampen job totals. The percentage of adults who are working has fallen from 64 at the end of the Clinton era to only 59.5 now. Some of those dropouts are retirees, but some may be responding to the economy's declining dynamism. Traditionally, it was a mark of Americans' resiliency that, when times were tough, they relocated from state to state and region to region. Now, according to the Census Bureau, mobility is at an all-time recorded low. Perhaps people with underwater mortgages cannot afford to move. Perhaps the areas they used to move to, typically the Sun Belt, are too devastated by foreclosures. But the vaunted ability of the U.S. economy to renew itself seems a little tarnished. Maybe it's no accident that this time around, folks on the unemployment line are staying there longer.
 In terms of its impact on society, a dearth of hiring is far more troubling than an excess of layoffs. Job losses have to end sooner or later. Even if they persist (as, say, in the auto industry), the government can intervene. But the government cannot force firms to hire. Ultimately, each new job depends on the boss's belief -- or hope -- that sufficient work will materialize. It's a bit of black magic also described as confidence. Over the years, it is why America has not only attracted immigrants (whose arrivals are now slowing) but also generated more opportunities and -- favorite word of politicians -- hope for those born here.
 The administration's tilt toward so-called sustainable new jobs, in green energy and such, shows that it understands what is at stake, both for the country and for its political fortunes. Whether its plans will bear fruit is, of course, another matter. Along with double-digit unemployment, the country is facing a second potential scare headline: falling wages. Even during recessions, businesses don't like to lower pay, because it reduces morale. But layoffs are also a downer. And in this recession, employers ranging from the State of California to publishers (including this newspaper) have cut back on pay. In effect, job losses have been so severe that businesses have been forced to spread the pain. In June, overall wage growth was zero. Zandi thinks the United States could see negative wage growth.
 How would Obama, not to mention Congress, respond to declining employment and falling wages? The pressure for another stimulus (and greater deficits) would be intense. So would that for demagogic solutions like trade barriers. Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, says most lost jobs are not coming back. The huge question is when -- or whether -- new ones will take their place.

HEADLINE: Grab Airfare Deals Now, or Wait?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
SUMMER is half over and you still haven't found that cheap airfare to paradise that everyone seems to be talking about. Should you book now, and take advantage of a recent spate of midsummer sales from the airlines? Or hold out in the hopes of even better deals when the leaves start to fall?
 Recent history suggests that customers should procrastinate. Over the last year, savvy travelers who waited till the last moment were generally rewarded with cheaper fares, as airlines were forced to cut rates to fill empty seats -- even for peak holiday travel when airfares typically soar. Plus, leisure fares usually drop after Labor Day, as children go back to school and summer vacations come to an end. 
 On the other hand, recent deals are almost too good to pass up. It's rare to see sales in the middle of the summer, but right after the Fourth of July weekend, Southwest Airlines ran one of its biggest sales ever, slashing one-way fares below $100 on many shorter routes in the fall, like New York to Baltimore for $30. Other carriers quickly matched those rates. 
 But not all the news is promising. A severe drop in passengers is forcing airlines to make further service cuts. For example, Delta announced last month that it would reduce capacity by 10 percent instead of 8 percent, by making more international reductions. 
 And American will shrink capacity by 7.5 percent, instead of the 6.5 percent it had initially planned. As a result, fares could go back up again, especially if demand goes up as well.
 ''There's no history for where we are now,'' said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare, an online airfare shopping site that tracks prices. ''As much as consumers are struck trying to figure out when to buy, airlines are struggling to price seats.''
 Airfares remain relatively low -- about 18 percent cheaper than last year, according to Bob Harrell of Harrell Associates, a New York-based consulting firm that also tracks airfare. So the question that post-Labor Day travelers face is, when is the best time to buy their tickets? Lock up current relatively low fares or wait to see if they go even lower? 
 Most airfare watchers are advising customers to wait. Deeper discounts, they say, are likely in the coming months. ''Airlines typically post high fares very far out, but do not start to actively manage them until closer to departure time,'' usually 60 days before, Mr. Harrell said. 
 Waiting is a particularly good idea for flights to Europe, where airlines are confronting ''a glut in international capacity,'' said Mr. Seaney of FareCompare. Though carriers are already cutting flights on international routes, the global recession will make it difficult to fill remaining seats, he added.
 ''I'm telling people to be patient,'' he said. ''If you're planning a trip for November or December, give it another month.'' But one caveat seems to be about holiday travel. Fare watchers agree that travelers who must fly on peak holiday travel dates -- like the Wednesday before or Sunday after Thanksgiving -- should consider pulling the trigger now if they spot a decent rate. Bing Travel, the new Microsoft search engine that uses the prediction tools of Farecast, expects that fares will rise as Thanksgiving approaches -- the opposite of what happened last year. 
 ''Last year was atypical,'' said Joel Grus, Bing's so-called fareologist. When the financial crisis started last September, travel plans came to a standstill and airlines were forced to slash fares for the busy period over Christmas and New Year's. 
 This year, he expects prices to follow a more traditional pattern. ''We'll see sporadic discounts, but only for particular dates,'' Mr. Grus said, like Friday departures and Monday returns.
 If you decide to wait, track fares so you don't miss those time-sensitive deals. Sign up for fare alerts, offered by practically every travel site from American Airlines to Travelzoo, to receive e-mail messages of deals on specific routes. Twitterers will be glad to know that FareCompare now tweets about deals for hometown airports you specify, while JetBlue and Southwest tweet about general promotions. 
 Yapta.com, another price-tracking service, alerts travelers when the price of their plane tickets drop after purchase. That way, travelers can call the airline to request a voucher for the price difference, or pay $15 to have Yapta do it.
 Even so, don't wait too long. Airfare prices today are pretty good. According to Bing Travel, in mid-July the average fare for flights from New York City this September was $264 -- down 25 percent from the same period last year. For example, September flights from Kennedy Airport to Heathrow near London were available for $613; a similar flight would have cost $802 last July for September. 
 Base your purchase on real savings rather than waiting for your dream price. ''It's about consumer air travel psychology,'' Mr. Seaney said. Some consumers, he said, have an ideal price in mind -- say, $500 for a round-trip flight to Europe -- and won't buy unless they see that price, no matter how good a deal the fare really is. 
 But that's how some travelers miss out on bargains. ''If you see something that is historically low,'' he said, ''buy it!''

PICK PROGRAMS, NOT PRESTIGE
 ''Apply to multiple schools, public and private, and compare offers carefully,'' says Lauren Asher, president of the Institute for College Access and Success in Berkeley, Calif. Two schools with similar reputations may differ in cost significantly when you factor in tuition, housing, transportation and any tuition discounts or scholarships. Resist paying more for a prestigious university, Ms. Asher says. ''In grad school, it's really the reputation of the program itself that matters.''
 GO WHERE YOU'LL SHINE 
 Ph.D. candidates often get first dibs on teaching assistantships, and professors prefer to hire students whose work they know for research assistantships. But universities use the jobs to lure top students, so increase your chances by applying where you stand out academically. Every university is dealing with the recession differently, so contact each to discuss availability and consider those with more opportunities. 
 Avoid private loans. ''For the most part, they have variable rates with no caps and no limits on fees,'' Ms. Asher says. ''Right now, interest rates look temptingly low, but they won't stay low.'' After a 20- to 25-year term, a private loan is more expensive than a federal one. What's more, private loans usually lack the consumer protections offered with federal loans, like the right to defer repayment while unemployed or to cancel the debt if you die or become disabled. Yet almost a fifth of graduate students who took out Stafford loans in 2007-8 also had private loans, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the financial aid site FinAid.org. And nearly a third with private student loans had not borrowed first via a low-interest federal Stafford. Unless you have a big blot on your credit history, like a bankruptcy or foreclosure that makes it hard to get a Grad Plus loan (after maxing out your Stafford), there's no reason to go private. 
 PARLAY A SKILL
 There may be a market for something you're learning in pursuit of your degree. Kendra Freeman, a doctoral student at Emory University, learned how to use data analysis software in her sociology program and got a part-time job evaluating grants for a local company. ''Thankfully my department has a lot of contact with employers who need data analysis,'' she says. ''If I had to try to find a job at some place like Borders, first of all there aren't jobs, and second of all that's like $7.50 an hour.'' Career service offices try to stay on top of local employment options, says Julie Miller Vick, a senior associate director of the career services office at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Department coordinators,'' she says, ''often know about short-term opportunities, a local business that wants a demographer for six months or a community college that needs somebody to teach.''
 LOWER YOUR PAYMENT
 With the government's new income-based repayment program, graduates with a high debt-to-earnings ratio may be able to lower their monthly nut to less than 10 percent of their income; those earning one and a half times the poverty level ($16,245 for an individual in 2009) or less won't have to make any payments. Money owed after 25 years of qualifying payments will be forgiven. Enroll via your lender. The Institute for College Access and Success has more information at IBRinfo.org.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Financial Invention vs. Consumer Protection'' (Economic View, July 19), in which Robert J. Shiller discussed whether a new consumer agency could walk the line between fostering innovation and protecting the public against abuses: 
 The column used the analogy of the steam engine, invented by James Watt but improved by Richard Trevithick, to support the argument that gradual improvements in financial engineering might help us prevent disasters like the credit mess. 
 The search for historical analogies can lead in other directions, however, when it comes to enabling people of modest means to buy homes otherwise available only to the more affluent. Long before James Watt, ancient innovators tried really hard to convert lead into gold, without much luck. But this analogy, too, is imperfect, because the alchemists didn't receive lavish bonuses for their failures.
 Maybe a ''plain vanilla'' approach might work better -- such as paying working-class people more generously for their labors?

Re ''Love and Marriage, New York Times Style'' (July 12):
 Your column reminded me of a bit of history from my own wedding on Aug. 25, 1956. At that time, The Times had only recently begun to publish engagement and wedding photos of a few African-American brides from prominent families; the young women were almost exclusively graduates of the ''Seven Sisters'' colleges, and their grooms of Ivy League schools. My parents sent in both my engagement and wedding photos (in the 1950s, The Times published engagement photos also), and both were published as my fiance and I met the criteria: I was the daughter of a prominent Connecticut clergyman and an honors graduate of Radcliffe; my fiance, James Lowell Gibbs Jr., was a graduate of Cornell and a doctoral student at Harvard.
 Shortly after my bridal photo was published, a Southern classmate sent me a column from The Montgomery Advertiser in Alabama, criticizing The Times for publishing photos of black brides, but noting that it was a hypocritical gesture because I was so ''light-skinned'' that readers would hardly notice! After nearly 53 years of a happy marriage and successful careers in the academic world (professors at Berkeley and Stanford), my husband and I still laugh about that article. 
 It seems that, as the French say, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Congratulations to the editor Robert Woletz and The New York Times for reflecting changing social standards.
 JEWELLE TAYLOR GIBBS Stanford, Calif., July 13, 2009
 Are you kidding? An editor in charge, rigorous fact-checking, interviews, documentary proof, and three pages of rules to publish each wedding and commitment announcement in The Times? I don't think the controversy should be over which influential, moneyed, high-achieving or inspirational ''other side of the tracks'' couple makes it into the 40 or so available spots. Rather, the controversy should be over justifying the expense, the values and the newsworthiness of this entire section of the ''All the News That's Fit to Print'' newspaper.
 Isn't The Times facing the same economic difficulties that the rest of the world is trying to survive? Isn't The Times facing the same fight for its existence that the rest of the newspapers are? 
 Well, my suggestion to eliminate ''Vows'' will help your newspaper survive and your readers to extinguish the perceived need to know who married whom among the elite or not so elite. Leave the wedding announcements to the very local newspapers, where someone in the story is someone in the town's next-door neighbor.
 MARILYN SICA Teaneck, N.J., July 12, 2009
 Splendid column explaining the choices for ''Vows.'' I'm one who scrutinizes them each Sunday, even forecasting out loud to my husband in bed next to me whose marriage will last, and whose won't (based solely on their pedigrees, and the looks in their eyes). I say, double the listings! More fun for me. 
 SUSAN AGER Northport, Mich., July 14, 2009
 Your column reminded me of one reason why I chose to date the man who is my husband. Now a physicist, he was the first one in his immigrant neighborhood to go to college. I admired what he had accomplished by drive and hard work, and am glad our children have a father like him. 
 I never even had a shot at the ''Vows'' column, as my husband, who came from a traditional culture, would not let me place the wedding announcement in the paper. It would invite the evil eye, he said. Never could tell if he was completely serious, but when one marries, there is a lot that one just takes on faith. Or at least, one humors one's partner.

 Paying for Journalism
 Re ''One Newspaper, Many Checkbooks'' (July 19): 
 Nonprofit newspapers are not a new idea. L.A. Youth was started more than 20 years ago with support by foundations and corporations. There has never been a conflict of interest or pressure from any funding source regarding our investigative reporting.
 In Los Angeles, we have reported fraud and abuse in group homes, we have reported illegal searches of backpacks by school security guards, and we have brought to the Legislature's attention the plight of youths incarcerated in private mental hospitals without the right of due process. These stories were ignored by mainstream media even in the well-financed days of journalism. 
 Our paper is distributed free to more than 1,400 teachers and is used in classrooms for civics lessons in lieu of boring, dated textbooks. Philanthropy and journalism are an excellent partnership. 
 DONNA MYROW Los Angeles, July 20, 2009
 The writer is the publisher of L.A. Youth.
 Protecting a Reporter
 Re ''Journalistic Ideals, Human Values'' (July 5): 
 You write that some readers and journalists recoil at a news organization that ''subordinates its fundamental obligation to inform the public to its human impulse to protect one of its own.''
 Since when did these actions become incompatible? Even the military, with its ''fundamental obligation'' to protect the nation and win wars, nevertheless does not stint when it comes to keeping its men and women from being killed.
 DAVID SMOLLAR San Diego, July 5, 2009
 It would seem that your column was missing the very vital input of the police authorities on this important topic. It would seem essential to hear from those who regularly deal with such matters whether there are statistics that would support one approach or the other.
 If, for instance, the F.B.I. said that there was a two-out-of-three survival rate for those kidnappings in which there was no publicity, whereas there was a two-out-of-three death rate for kidnappings in which there was publicity, then this would become the controlling fact. It must not be a policy decision by journalists and editors, as a group or individually, and must not be based on whether the victim was a journalist or not. Statistical facts alone should shape the policy of whether to report or not.
 If it is clear that reporting a kidnapping would more likely lead to the victim's death, then to report contributes to murder.

HEADLINE: Economic Downturn Forces Groups to Get Creative

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
HIT hard by the economic downturn, arts groups are seeking strength in numbers -- forming alliances, pooling resources, networking and accommodating one another's diminished circumstances.
 The efforts, which sometimes bring together dissimilar groups, don't always go smoothly. But by and large, the atmosphere is one of growing cooperation that works to artists' benefit -- and the public's.
 ''There's more of a willingness to work together because there's a unique cause right now, and the cause is the fact there are economic issues,'' said Stephen Sansone, president of the Untermyer Performing Arts Council in Yonkers and executive director of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District.
 Since May 1, four museums in Westchester County (the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, the Katonah Museum of Art and Purchase College's Neuberger Museum of Art) and two in Fairfield County, Connecticut (the Bruce Museum in Greenwich and the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield) have allowed any of their members to be admitted to all six. The same goes for visitors who buy a same-day pass. 
 The plan -- advertised as an alliance -- has been slow to catch on, with only a handful of museum visitors taking advantage of it in a typical week. Still, arts groups say it is the first pact of its kind in memory among museums in Connecticut and New York, and its very existence is evidence of greater cooperation. 
 ''It's symbolic of our efforts to be creative in a very tough time,'' said Peter C. Sutton, executive director of the Bruce, who, noting that his museum's endowment was down 20 percent over the past year and its corporate support depleted, hosted the meeting in March at which the plan was formulated.
 ''Almost all nonprofits have suffered some loss in their endowments and had to institute economizing efforts, as we have,'' he said, ''and this is a good way for people to make the most of their local museums.'' 
 Another kind of joint effort -- one enjoying greater participation this year, its sixth -- is Art Along the Hudson, a cooperative media campaign to promote the visual and performing arts in seven cities lining the river. 
 ''What we've found is that, working together, we help strengthen each other,'' said Linda T. Hubbard, chairwoman of the campaign. Ms. Hubbard said it has amassed $16,000 this year -- each city contributing $1,750, the rest coming from private donors -- which has paid for 50,000 brochures, posters, a Web site, a kickoff event and print and radio advertising. 
 Joining Kingston, Beacon, Catskill, Poughkeepsie and Newburgh in the campaign this year are New Paltz and Peekskill. Through its participation, Peekskill has been able to multiply the effect of its marketing dollars and mitigate the impact of budget cuts, said Christopher W. Marra, an economic development specialist who helps regulate that city's sprawling artists' district.
 ''It not only helped us,'' he said, ''but connected us to other cities, and now had us look like we were part of a bigger community.'' 
 Some activities being promoted by the Art Along the Hudson campaign take place year-round -- though May to October is the busiest time -- with plenty of music, dance and theater; open-air galleries along waterfront promenades; and tours of historic sites, from the Crawford House in Newburgh to Huguenot Street in New Paltz. 
 The downside of diversity is that it can make reconciling constituents' competing concerns more difficult, Ms. Hubbard said, a comment echoed by Janet T. Langsam, executive director of another joint marketing effort, Arts-Westchester. 
 ''It's not just divvying up the space, it's location, location, location,'' Ms. Langsam said, referring to the ideal placement of information in the brochures produced for her organization's 130 affiliates.
 Both women agreed that at a time when arts groups have less money for marketing, their organizations' ability to produce more brochures and distribute them more widely than they could alone usually trumps parochial interests. ''The more we can collaborate, pooling our resources, the better we can weather the storm and get the word out to all our constituents,'' Ms. Langsam said. 
 Demand is growing, she said, for space in ArtsWestchester's print publications and on its Web site, which in the fall will expand a social networking feature to allow the group's affiliates to interact more easily among themselves and with the public. 
 Networking among artists generally is on the rise, as is agents' sharing of their work, said William C. Maxwell, a longtime printmaker, professor, agent and owner of Maxwell Fine Arts, a gallery and studio in Peekskill. 
 ''We've reduced the competition,'' said Mr. Maxwell, who represents about 50 artists and who has been lending their work more freely, as have many of his counterparts. 
 Wendie Garber, owner of the Flat Iron Gallery, in Peekskill, recently lent the paintings of Nadine Gordon-Taylor, whom she represents, to Mr. Maxwell, who showed them in a gallery he runs, 121 Restaurant, in North Salem. 
 At the same time, Mr. Maxwell lent the ''sculpted oils'' of Leslie Lew, whom he represents, to the Flat Iron, where they are on display. In fact, the work of the artists Mr. Maxwell represents can be seen on, near or leaning against walls throughout Peekskill. 
 But even as he spreads his artists' work more widely, Mr. Maxwell's galleries are suffering amid the downturn, he said, and he is shifting his attention toward cooperation with nonprofits. Come September, he expects to mount a photography show at one of them, the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill. 
 Having established an artists' district nearly 20 years ago, Peekskill has been in the forefront of struggling cities that are trying to revitalize their downtowns by attracting artists to work and live there. The artists' shared circumstance has fostered cooperation, which has increased as the economy has worsened, said Jo-Ann Brody, a sculptor and teacher.
 ''The dialogue is ongoing and increasing as we get more desperate,'' Ms. Brody said as she instructed about 40 children in the creation of Dutch-inspired ceramic tiles. The work is part of a countywide project coinciding with preparations for the September opening of ''Double Dutch,'' an exhibition of installation art from the Netherlands at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art, held in cooperation with the Netherland-America Foundation. 
 The decline in grants in the United States has spurred local museums' interest in collaborating with agencies abroad, said Irma Jansen, associate director of the center, which has become a cultural hub of the city. Among the organizers of ''For the Love of Art,'' a mixed-media show held earlier this year, was Livia Straus, a collector and founder of the center; Ms. Brody; Ben Green, owner of the 80,000-square-foot Hat Factory, a converted space where the show was held; and the art dealers Rick and Penny Yamet. 
 The atmosphere of cooperation extends to performing artists as well, said Mr. Sansone of the Untermyer arts council.
 With his budget down as much as 15 percent from last year, he said, the Connecticut Ballet, which has appeared annually in Yonkers for a decade, agreed to take a cut in its fee. As a result, the performance of Ballet Fest, a crowd-pleasing potpourri of dance styles, went on this month in Untermyer Park. 
 Brett Rafael, the ballet's artistic director and chief executive officer, declined to discuss details of the talks he heldwith Mr. Sansone. But, noting that he was hoping to avoid a repeat of a derailed date in Danbury this year, he said, ''We're making do with less if we have to.''

HEADLINE: On Campus, An Incubator For New Plays

BYLINE: By CELIA McGEE

 BODY:
THERE are dog years, cat years, and then there are theater company years, which can last anywhere between the blink of a critic's dismissive eye and a perennial slog to make art in the face of commercial pressures and fickle audiences.
 Accordingly, the 25th anniversary of Powerhouse Theater, the eight-week summer program at Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is something of a jaw-dropper, not least in the eyes of its co-founders, who are still its producing directors, the once-fledgling theater producers Max Mayer and Leslie Urdang, and Mark-Linn Baker, the actor. Because they also aimed to nurture short films, they named their endeavor New York Stage and Film and the residential partnership with Vassar after the Powerhouse, the performance space converted from the college's early-20th-century power plant. 
 ''When you're in your 20s, you don't imagine anything lasting 25 years,'' Ms. Urdang said of the starry-eyed undertaking hatched in 1984 to provide emerging artists the wherewithal to develop and present new work in readings, workshops and productions, with a ban on reviewers. 
 Ms. Urdang spoke from Los Angeles, where she is president of Olympus Pictures, currently represented by the Sundance hit ''Adam,'' a first film written and directed by Mr. Mayer, who has been away from Powerhouse on publicity tour for the movie. Mr. Baker was in Washington, shooting a movie with Jack Nicholson. Johanna Pfaelzer, associated with the troika in a variety of capacities since 1998, is the artistic director and runs the program with Edward Cheetham, the producing director installed on the Vassar end. The original theater has also since expanded, to three. ''I call it a Fresh Air Fund for city artists,'' Ms. Pfaelzer said. 
 Consequently, this month Lewis Black, the stand-up comedian, sat down with some actors, expletive-deleted happy, as he said, about their readings of ''One Slight Hitch,'' his new play. Several Victorian-era buildings away, Jeffrey DeMunn mulled the emotions of an exiled Russian writer he would play starting July 22 in Keith Bunin's latest, ''Vera Laughed.'' Prowling the 325-seat Martel Theater, Duncan Sheik was observing a late-breaking run-through for a weekend concert reading of his rock musical, ''Whisper House,'' directed by Keith Powell, only latently recognizable as Toofer, his character on ''30 Rock.'' 
 For rehearsing ''The Burnt Part Boys,'' a musical set in 1960s Appalachia -- a co-production with the Vineyard Theater and Playwrights Horizons, which will bring it to New York next spring -- Ms. Pfaelzer had commandeered a vast, wood-paneled hall for formal campus occasions. The Green Day punk musical ''American Idiot'' would quietly slip in for a workout two weeks following ''Burnt Park Boys.'' 
 ''Within the context of the 24/7 news-cycle blogosphere,'' Meryl Streep, an alumna of Vassar and Powerhouse, and a Vassar trustee, said via e-mail, ''Powerhouse has retained its outsider status, giving artists the freedom to truly experiment.''
 But despite the no-review rule, which excepts local news media, Powerhouse cannot exclude anyone with a ticket. The Australian playwright Joanna Murray-Smith, represented this summer by her play ''Ninety,'' remembers the readings series in 1996 that involved her play ''Honour.'' Ms. Streep was a reader, she said (the others were Sam Waterston and Kyra Sedgwick), and Powerhouse's usual audience of locals and whoever else wanted to visit, was joined by ''all these agents and producers from New York.'' 
 A promising play by Warren Leight also arrived, called ''Side Man.'' In 2004 came ''Doubt'' by John Patrick Shanley.
 Together the college and the company stretch a $900,000 operating budget to 20 professional presentations a season, in addition to a noted tuition-based apprenticeship program. As for the relationship building that takes place, ''Marriages have been made and babies conceived here,'' Ms. Pfaelzer said with a laugh.
 The banner-name actors camping out in the dorms with the rest of the summer crew are generally not publicized, which hasn't made audience building any easier for Vassar and the box office it has been trying to cultivate, especially in the face of growing competition from SummerScape at nearby Bard College -- and an economy that has forced even as established a summer institution as the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts to slash two productions. That hurts, said Susan DeKrey, Vasser's vice president for college relations, since Powerhouse ''has become a cultural resource of national reputation that also serves this community.'' 
 As several plays this summer demonstrate, there are tensions in any marriage, and the friction between the company's artistic mission and the college's desire to ''sell and market,'' Ms. DeKrey conceded, is sometimes palpable. But Ms. Pfaelzer and Mr. Cheetham have added more musical theater, a young-playwrights program with regional middle schoolers, the integration of sound painting (a musical improvisation method) into the apprentice program, and a radio-play elective. The film component, run by Ms. Urdang before escalating career demands intervened, will return next season, she said. 
 Powerhouse was in part inspired by the summer retreats of the Group Theater of the 1930s. Vassar is respectful of that tradition. It has the right of first refusal on any work selected for the season, but it has never exercised the prerogative. 
 This is Mr. Sheik's second summer at Powerhouse. His ''Nero'' was there last year. ''I hope to be back next summer,'' he said, ''if they'll have me.''

 The joint efforts, which sometimes bring together dissimilar groups, don't always go smoothly. But by and large, the atmosphere is one of growing cooperation that works to the benefit of artists -- and the public.

 Noting that his museum's endowment was down 20 percent over the past year and that corporate support was being depleted, he said that staff salaries had been cut 10 percent, 12 percent of the museum's employees had been laid off and a major show of Impressionists scheduled for next year had been postponed, as had additions to the museum building, which sits on a hilltop overlooking Greenwich Harbor.
 ''Almost all nonprofits have suffered some loss in their endowments and had to institute economizing efforts, as we have,'' he said, ''and this is a good way for people to make the most of their local museums.''
 The atmosphere of growing cooperation also extends to a willingness among performing artists to work within the shrunken budgets of nonprofit presenting organizations, said Stephen Sansone, president of the Untermyer Performing Arts Council in Yonkers and executive director of the Yonkers Downtown/Waterfront Business Improvement District.
 ''Artists are stepping up to the plate,'' he said. 
 With his arts council's budget down as much as 15 percent from last year, Mr. Sansone said, the Connecticut Ballet, which has appeared annually in Yonkers for a decade, agreed to take a cut in its fee. As a result, the performance of Ballet Fest, a crowd-pleasing potpourri of dance styles, went on this month in Untermyer Park. 
 Brett Rafael, the ballet's artistic director and chief executive officer, declined to discuss details of the talks he had with Mr. Sansone. He noted that a performance in Danbury this year fell through for financial reasons. ''We're making do,'' he said, ''with less if we have to.'' 
 Similarly, artists have been ready to adjust to the budgetary limitations of Jazz Haven, which is producing the New Haven Jazz Festival, said Doug Morrill, the group's president and a fixture in the local arts community.
 After reviving the festival as a three-day affair last year -- financing and organizational problems forced it to go dark in 2007 after 24 years -- the event again found itself in jeopardy this year when institutional support dropped by at least 30 percent after the market collapse last fall, Mr. Morrill said. 
 But, he said, some of the musicians have agreed to work for less -- one slashing his usual $5,000 fee by nearly half -- and small contributors have rallied. The upshot: He has $17,000 in hand -- and that, along with in-kind support, will be enough to stage a first-rate, if attenuated, festival on Aug. 22 on the New Haven Green. It will feature combos led by Hamiett Bluett, the saxophonist; Bobby Sanabria, the drummer; and Shawnn Monteiro, the vocalist.
 ''What you're seeing,'' Mr. Morrill said, ''is an attitude that we have to get involved and do something, and not just let these things disappear.''

HEADLINE: They're Not Paying Anymore

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Melissa Birks is being stalked. Her cellphone keeps ringing, always from a caller marked ''unknown.'' She says she knows it is her credit card company wondering why she stopped making payments. Ms. Birks, who owes $28,830, has nothing to say.
 Those on the front lines of the debt industry say there is a small but increasingly noticeable group of strapped consumers who, like Ms. Birks, are deciding they will simply stop paying. After loading up on debt eagerly provided by the card companies during the boom times, these people now find themselves trapped in an endless cycle where they are charged interest on interest and fees upon fees while the lenders get government bailouts. 
 They are upset -- at the unyielding banks and often at their free-spending selves -- and are pre-emptively defaulting. They could continue to pay for a while longer but instead are walking away. ''You reach a point where you embrace the darkness of default,'' said Adam Levin, chairman of the financial products Web site Credit.com. 
 The lending industry term for these people is ''ruthless defaulters.'' In a miserable economy where paychecks, savings and expectations are all diminished, their numbers will surely grow. 
 ''They've done the math on their account and they're very angry,'' said Corey Calabrese, a Fordham Law student who is an administrator of the school's walk-in clinic for debtors at Manhattan Civil Court. Public sentiment is on their side, she added: ''For the first time, Americans are no longer blaming the borrower but are looking at the credit card companies.'' 
 (That's certainly true in the mortgage crisis. According to a Quinnipiac University poll in February, 62 percent of those polled blamed lenders ''who loaned the money to people who may not be able to pay it back.'' Only a quarter blamed homeowners.) 
 The deteriorating relationship between Americans and their creditors has not yet reached the level of Shays' Rebellion, the 1786 uprising by poor farmers in western Massachusetts during a recession. But the basic issues are strikingly similar, suggesting an eternal tension between creditor and consumer.
 Boston merchants, who were suffering themselves, aggressively sought payment from their customers. When the folks could not pay, which was often, they were jailed. The incensed farmers sought ''reforms that would permit repayment on less destructive terms,'' writes Bruce H. Mann in ''Republic of Debtors,'' a history of bankruptcy in early America. ''Creditors replied with lectures on frugality, luxury, virtue and the sanctity of obligations.'' 
 Shays' Rebellion provoked mixed reactions, then and now. Were the rebels trying to remedy grievous wrongs in the spirit of the Revolutionary War, or were they threatening public order and the fledgling state -- acting as terrorists, in the modern parlance? Shays' followers were quickly arrested and quickly pardoned, although two were hanged. 
 Ruthless defaulters today face different perils. Delinquency destroys credit scores, can prompt a lawsuit and guarantees a very large number of hostile calls from collection agencies.
 Still, all that can seem the better alternative. Like many who default, Ms. Birks first asked her credit card company to lower her 19 percent interest rate. No dice, Bank of America responded. After she tried to get the bank's attention by skipping a payment, it immediately raised her rate to 25 percent. As Ms. Birks' debt swelled, so did a sense of injustice mingled with helplessness.
 Bank of America has its hands full, with a June default rate of 13.8 percent, up from 12.5 percent in May. The other major credit card companies are in a similar fix. Estimates of the total industry losses are over $100 billion for the current recession. 
 Collectors are noticing a shift not only in ability but in willingness to pay. ''With all the bailouts the government is giving everyone, no one has any personal accountability about their own debts,'' said Roger Knauf, who runs a trade group of debt-buying firms. 
 Many of today's debtors were maxed out long before the recession. Much of this debt was of course in the form of junky mortgages on wildly overpriced houses, and it was here that people first began to rebel.
 Countrywide Financial, the country's biggest and most aggressive lender, surveyed its customers about why they were defaulting in the summer of 2007. One of the leading reasons was ''low regard for property ownership.'' In other words, people concluded that owning these houses was a bad deal. 
 That people would intentionally default on loans they never should have gotten in the first place took lenders by surprise. ''I'm astonished that people would walk away from their homes,'' Bank of America chief executive Kenneth Lewis said in late 2007. 
 Nineteen months later, walking away from mortgages is widespread if impossible to quantify, and no cause for embarrassment. Rather the opposite: it shows savviness. ''I'll walk away before I take a loss,'' a Dallas financier recently boasted to Barron's magazine about his efforts to sell his $6 million vacation estate. 
 With credit cards, this type of chest-pounding seems less evident, at least so far. Ms. Birks, 43, readily admits that no one forced her to use her cards. ''Some people are good with money,'' she said. ''I was stupid.''
 Still, just about everyone made mistakes during the boom -- regulators, Congress, Wall Street. If Bank of America got a bailout for making bad loans, Ms. Birks figured, she deserved a bailout for accepting them. 
 ''You have to start looking at the future,'' says Ms. Birks, who has been a writer and editor for various publications. ''I already feel horrible because I can't find a good job.'' She earns $15 an hour as a copy editor for a magazine and does other part-time work.
 In previous downturns, Ms. Birks' only recourse would have been a debt management plan, where she would restructure her payments with the help of a counselor, or bankruptcy. Now there is a third option: debt settlement. This means going on strike until the lender accepts a partial payment.
 Ms. Birks asked Bank of America about a settlement this spring. Since her account was up to date, she was told she didn't qualify. She stopped paying, the bank started calling.
 When Bank of America finally got her on the phone, it agreed for the first time to drastically reduce her interest rate. She did not take the deal, but considered it progress.

HEADLINE: Comb Your Hair (Boys) and Smile (Girls)

 BODY:
Comely people make more money, plain people less. Michael T. French, professor of health economics at the University of Miami, wondered whether the well-documented ''beauty premium/penalty'' applied to grade-point average. 
 To find out, he and three co-authors examined the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which surveyed more than 20,000 7th to 12th graders over time. They focused on interviewers' ratings of students' attractiveness, grooming and personality. 
 In their analysis, recently published in the journal Labour Economics, they reported that of the three traits, grooming had the most significant correlation to boys' grades, and personality to girls'. 
 When all three characteristics were considered together, boys experienced a statistically significant grade premium for good grooming and a penalty for being slovenly. Dr. French says he was surprised to see a ''marginally significant'' penalty for above-average attractiveness. For girls, pleasant personality had the most impact on grades, and to a lesser extent good grooming. Attractiveness didn't rate.
 ''We say this very guardedly, because we don't have direct evidence of teacher bias,'' Dr. French says, ''but what it suggests is that teachers are giving preferential treatment'' in grading. 
 It could also be, he acknowledges, that the same discipline and organizational skills that lead to academic success also cause a boy to comb his hair, and that girls with an unpleasant demeanor just don't do their homework.

 BODY:
 PALACE COUNCIL, by Stephen L. Carter (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) This implausible but entertaining thriller, set between 1962 and 1975, involves a clandestine fraternity of powerful white men working to overthrow the democratic processes of the United States with some prominent black allies. Two complicated and appealing main characters search for truth about loved ones and come to love each other in an absorbingly depicted wealthy Harlem milieu. ''There is . . . a fine novel begging to get out of all this,'' our reviewer, Thomas Mallon, said, praising Carter's ''writerly effects.'' 
 HOUSE OF WITS: An Intimate Portrait of the James Family, by Paul Fisher (Holt, $20.) The James family story has been often told, in individual and group biographies, but Fisher argues that no previous work has taken into account late-20th-century scholarship on same-sex love, gender, illness, repression and alcoholism. Fisher brings an enormous amount of research to his portrait of a complicated family that strikes him, he says, ''as curiously contemporary.'' 
 THE SPIES OF WARSAW, by Alan Furst (Random House, $15.) Furst's spy thrillers are infused with a melancholy romanticism and focus on the moral ambiguities the characters face. This book follows a de Gaulle-like French aristocrat, based in Warsaw in 1937, who studies German preparations for war. 
 THE STONE GODS, by Jeanette Winterson (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) This scary, beautiful novel envisions a post-apocalyptic future -- actually, several of them. Amid ecological disaster and impending war, scientists, space captains and Robo sapiens grapple with love and fate. ''The Stone Gods'' is ''a Baedeker for Earth's future,'' Susann Cokal wrote in the Book Review. 
 ORIGINS,by Amin Maalouf. Translated by Catherine Temerson., (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Maalouf is a historical novelist who has also written about the vagaries of identity. In this lovely memoir, he examines the past of his Lebanese family, ''wanderers who have lost their way.'' In Paris, where he has lived for 30 years, he is warmed by a long white scarf knit for him by his grandmother. A young man's journey from Los Angeles to his father's deathbed in Beirut is the framing tale in THE HAKAWATI,by Rabih Alameddine. (Anchor, $16). The narrator and his relatives exchange tales (hakawati is Arabic for storyteller), some dealing with contemporary events, others drawn from ancient literature, all shaped by Alameddine's comedic sensibility. ''Listen,'' he begins. ''Let me tell you a story.'' 
 HEAD CASES, (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) Mason, a brain injury case manager, describes the day-to-day life on a brain injury ward and the struggles of its patients. ''Is there a part of me that can't be changed by a brain injury?'' Mason asks. The answer appears to be no. (Oddly, the best place for an American to suffer a brain injury is Iraq, where the Balad Air Base hospital provides a ''gateway'' to ''the most aggressive medical system in the world.'') In CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I FORGOT: YOUR MEMORY, YOUR MIND, YOUR FUTURE(Three Rivers, $14.95),Sue Halpern sets out to discover what scientists really know about dementia, educating herself by undergoing several brain scans. Unfortunately, she reports, there is no solid proof that anything stems memory loss -- other than exercise. (It's good to eat blueberries, though.) Jill Bolte Taylor was a neuroscientist working at Harvard's brain research center when, in 1996, she had a stroke. Curiously, it felt great -- the failure of her left brain lobe, the site of ego, analysis and judgment, made her feel like ''a genie liberated from its bottle,'' she writes in MY STROKE OF INSIGHT: A BRAIN SCIENTIST'S PERSONAL JOURNEY(Plume, $15). Now recovered, she urges people to live more spiritual lives by sidestepping the left brain. 
 A VENGEFUL LONGING, by R. N. Morris (Penguin, $15.) In this sequel to ''The Gentle Axe'' ''CSI: St. Petersburg,'' our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, called it -- Morris returns to the city in the late 1860s. His protagonist, once again, is Porfiry Petrovich, who solved Raskolnikov's crime in Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment.'' Here, Petrovich discovers a link between three apparently unrelated murders in a novel that is richly evocative of its time and place. 
 SOLDIERS OF REASON: The RAND Corporation and the Rise of the American Empire, by Alex Abella (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.95.) ''All of us are bastard children of RAND,'' Abella writes in this comprehensive history, the think tank's first. RAND helped shape nuclear strategy, health care (it developed the idea of deductibles and co-payments) and, through its championing of rational choice theory, the Reagan revolution and the current economic crisis. Not to mention the Vietnam War. 
 NOT IN THE FLESH, by Ruth Rendell (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, $15.) The 21st Inspector Wexford mystery begins with a decayed hand dug up by a dog searching for truffles. It proceeds, full of surprises, through a misdirected investigation of the assorted eccentric characters whose homes border the field where the remains and a fresher body are found. 
 In this sequel to ''The Gentle Axe'' -- ''CSI: St. Petersburg,'' our reviewer, Liesl Schillinger, called it -- Morris returns to the city in the late 1860s. His protagonist, once again, is Porfiry Petrovich, who solved Raskolnikov's crime in Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment.'' Here, Petrovich discovers a link between three apparently unrelated murders in a book that is richly evocative of its time and place.

Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Inside the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
We're hurtling down a wide boulevard in suburban Washington, the kids strapped expertly into their regulation car seats, my wife and I breezily discussing open houses and interest rates, when we hear a plaintive cry from the back seat. ''Help, it hurts,'' my 3-year-old son says. Glancing at the space directly behind me in the rearview mirror, I recoil. Ichi has absently grabbed hold of the S.U.V.'s middle shoulder strap and wrapped it around his neck. His eyes are popping slightly, as in a cartoon -- from suffocation or fear I cannot say. ''Hold still,'' my wife instructs him, climbing into the back seat.
 She appears in the mirror, a mother's nimble fingers working at the noose my son has accidentally created. I take the next right and pull onto the shoulder, leap out, assess the situation. There seems to be no way to get enough slack out of the seat belt to free Ichi, who is trying his best to let us help, whimpering softly and involuntarily. His baby sister sleeps in her infant seat, oblivious. Cars pass at leisurely intervals. 
 I have feared such a moment -- expected it, really. This dark impulse comes from my father, who was a defense lawyer specializing in insurance litigation -- airplane crashes, building collapses, Things That Should Not Have Happened. Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the time in this life, your day ends more or less the way you thought it would. My father lived his adult life among the other 0.1 percent, and so, by extension, did the rest of us. 
 He made rules, and the rules corresponded to whatever accordion files happened to line his shelves or clutter his memory. ''I had a case once . . . '' he would begin, and by the time he was finished, I had been instructed never to ride one of those Big Wheels (a kid had skidded into the street and was killed); or dive into water from anything that wasn't a diving board (paralysis would surely ensue); or run with a lollipop in my mouth. I was not to sign up for Pop Warner football or ride my bike on busy streets. Every day, before he left for work, he would slip into my room and mutter the same ominous phrase -- not ''be good'' or ''have a nice day'' but ''don't do anything dangerous.''
 Only later, after he was gone, did I begin to wonder whether it was a reasonable proposition to childproof the world or whether my father's rules were merely an imperfect way of coping with the cruelty of randomness. I saw some awful things in my own job as a city-desk reporter -- a child strangled by his own drawstring on a playground slide, a driver decapitated by a runaway tire -- and yet I considered them aberrations in an otherwise mundane universe. As a new parent, like generations of parents before me, I determined not to do to my son what my dad did to me. Ichi will not live by arcane rules of nonengagement. I'm tempted to steal into his room each morning and whisper, ''Don't live in fear.''
 Except now we are, all of us, a little afraid. Staring at the thick piece of nylon throttling my little boy, I have an idea. The mechanical properties of things often elude me, and this is quite possibly the worst idea I've ever had. I decide to unhook Ichi's car seat so that we can lift it to slacken the strap. What happens, of course, is that the belt instantly retracts instead, tightening around my son's throat and causing him to begin moaning and thrashing about uncontrollably. My wife has to tell me, ''Call 911.''
 I sputter a few times before I can figure out the names of the streets. The operator asks me what state I'm in. It has never occurred to me that when you call 911 from a cellphone, they have no idea where you are. Now I'm running down an embankment and knocking on a door, shouting at a stunned woman in the foyer that I need scissors, while the operator asks me what's happening. The woman reappears with a glint of metal in her hand, and I fly back up the incline to cut down my flailing son. The belt falls away, and Ichi crumples quietly into his mother's arms. Five minutes after driving along blissfully with my family, I find myself embracing a total stranger on the side of a road and thanking her for a pair of scissors.
 Kids recover fast, and Ichi wants to go to the park. I watch him climb the ropes and ladders. When I wake up the next morning, I almost tell him not to do anything dangerous, but I hold back. He will emerge today feeling a little less invincible than the day before. Or so I hope.

HEADLINE: For Veterans, a Weekend Pass From Homelessness

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
The future mix of homeless veterans was signaled here last weekend at Stand Down, an annual three-day tent city that provides respite and aid to former members of the armed forces whose lives have collapsed. 
 The number of homeless veterans who made their way to a high school's athletic fields for the gathering reached a record high, some 950 compared with last year's record of 830. The job-devouring recession is pushing up the numbers, but organizers said they were also starting to see younger veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, some with traumatic brain injuries or psychological stresses, who had fallen through the safety nets with unusual speed. 
 Stand Down, which in military parlance means time out from combat to allow rest and re-equipping, started 21 years ago here in San Diego and is duplicated on a smaller scale in other cities. It still draws a preponderance of Vietnam-era men, many fighting alcohol and drug problems. 
 A ragtag group of veterans, some with overstuffed shopping carts or backpacks, stay here for three days for hot food, haircuts, massages, dental care, legal aid, referrals to drug programs and federal benefits, and above all, for some, a bit of relief from the streets. 
 Reveille is sounded at 6 a.m., the hot meals spooned out by volunteers are called chow, and the portable toilets are called latrines. The olive and khaki tent city strives for a military ambience, organizers said, because many participants have not since felt the pride and success they did while in uniform. 
 Reflecting the changing gender makeup of the military, several dozen homeless women, some with children, showed up, enough to fill two large tents. One was Blair Barrett, 24, a Navy veteran with a 3-year-old son who spent the first five months of this year in a shelter and riding trains to pass the day. 
 Ms. Barrett left the Navy in September 2007 as an electrician's mate and found a maintenance job. Things seemed to be going well, she said, until she was laid off last year, and a spiral of fruitless job searches and depression began. 
 ''I've applied for everything from office cleaner to electrician's assistant, but there are no jobs,'' Ms. Barrett said, adding that even McDonald's had turned her down. 
 Last weekend, Ms. Barrett finally applied for the veterans' disability benefits she is likely to be owed because of a head injury she suffered on her ship. When she first left the Navy, she said, she was handed a huge stack of documents and ''just gave up.'' But applying here, she said, was simpler. 
 He mother has moved here temporarily from Chicago to offer shelter and child care while Ms. Barrett studies cosmetology at a community college and looks for work. 
 Ms. Barrett's parents are divorced, and her father, David Barrett, was also at Stand Down. Mr. Barrett said that since leaving the Army in 2004, he has had a checkered life, spending periods on drugs and on the streets. He said he was staying with friends, but hoped to enter a group home for veterans. 
 The ranks also included young men like Kenneth Kunce, 26, who suffered a traumatic brain injury when his Humvee was hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. The injury left him disoriented, jumpy and temperamental. When he came home he started using Ecstasy and alcohol, he said, and he lost his wife and more than one job. He said he was grateful to the Veterans Affairs hospital for providing speech and physical therapy, but added that he still had trouble coping with noises and anger. 
 Mr. Kunce, who sometimes lost his train of thought as he spoke to this reporter, is living out of his car. He had picked up his two sons, ages 2 and 5, for the day and brought them to Stand Down, where he sought out one of the most popular services: the makeshift courtroom in the outdoor handball courts, complete with robed judges. With the help of a public defender, he got several parking violations dismissed. 
 A flood of veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan has not yet landed on the streets, in part because the Department of Veterans Affairs is making stronger efforts than ever before to identify and help troops with psychiatric problems that could send them on downward spirals, and in part because it usually takes many years for a disoriented veteran to end up homeless, said Phil Landis, chief executive of Veteran's Village of San Diego, which sponsors Stand Down with private donations and some 3,000 volunteers. 
 According to V.A. estimates, the overall number of homeless veterans declined in recent years, from about 250,000 who lacked shelter at some point in 2006 to perhaps 200,000 last year. The share of women is climbing, and while they account for 4 percent of all homeless veterans, they make up 9 percent of those under 45, said Pete Dougherty, director of homeless programs at the department. 
 The agency has so far detected about 3,700 homeless veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, but with one million troops now home from these regions and more returning every week, Mr. Dougherty said, that figure is sure to climb. In an ominous harbinger, a recent study found that more than one-third of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who enrolled in the veterans' health system since 2001 had already displayed post-traumatic stress disorder, depression or other mental health problems. 
 These psychiatric challenges often worsen over time, and then it can take years more for troubled veterans to lose jobs, use up the good will of family and friends and find themselves sleeping in a car or a shelter, said Mr. Landis of Veterans Village. He predicted that the number of deeply troubled homeless veterans like Mr. Kunce would multiply in the years ahead. 
 Mr. Landis's group was able to offer transitional housing to 20 of those attending Stand Down, while another large agency, St. Vincent de Paul Village, gave rooms to 33. Altogether, fewer than 200 people attending the event were offered housing by overstretched agencies, Mr. Landis estimated, with hundreds more who seemed ready to change their lives turned down for lack of space. 
 Indeed, last Sunday afternoon, as troops from a nearby base started to take down the tents, many of the veterans, their hair and beards newly trimmed, gathered their baskets and backpacks and trudged back out onto the streets.

HEADLINE: Attack of the Fine Print

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
THE Rushmore, a new 41-story glass and stone condominium tower on Riverside Boulevard at the Hudson River, seemed serene on a recent visit. The flowers in the interior courtyard were in full bloom; the ground-level pool had been filled. Sixteen buyers had already moved in. 
 And yet an error of a single digit in an arcane document -- the densely worded 732-page offering plan -- could upset that happy picture, and cost the sponsors, the Extell Development Company and the Carlyle Group, tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue, lawyers say. 
 The Rushmore, surrounded by parks and with extensive river views, sold well when it went on the market, and 60 percent of the apartments are now in contract. But as the economy soured and the real estate market slid, sponsors were forced to allow new buyers discounts.
 Buyers at the Rushmore and at other new condominiums began struggling to get out of their contracts and to repocket their deposits -- at the Rushmore, 15 percent of the purchase price. Lawyers pored over the offering plan and pondered obscure state and federal laws looking for ways to invalidate the contracts.
 At the Rushmore, they may have found a loophole. Both the buyers and the sponsors agree that there was an error in a date in the offering plan, a document painstakingly prepared by a major New York law firm. Now they are debating whether the mistake was a trivial clerical error that should simply be ignored, or a one-time opportunity for Rushmore buyers to back out and recover their deposits or negotiate a better deal. 
 Late last month, Richard N. Cohen, a real estate lawyer, filed an application with the New York State attorney general's office seeking a refund of deposits for a group of buyers in contract at the Rushmore. After several buyers joined the action last week, he now represents 23 who paid about $10 million in deposits on $70 million in apartments, including a four-bedroom apartment with a terrace that is in contract for $7.1 million.
 Under state regulations, a sponsor is required to provide an operating budget for the first year of a new condominium, so buyers know what to expect when they move in. If the first closing does not occur by the end of the budget year, the sponsor is required to submit a new budget, and give the buyers a right to rescind their contracts.
 At the Rushmore, somebody goofed. The offering plan promised to give buyers a right to back out of the plan if the first closing did not occur before the first day of the budget year, Sept. 1, 2008, rather than Sept. 1, 2009, after the last day. The first closing occurred in February 2009. 
 At the time the plan was prepared, in 2006, law firms were deluged by developers with plans for new condominiums. In those heady years of rising prices, few buyers paid much attention to the fine print. 
 Now that the market has turned, Mr. Cohen is arguing that the error in the plan was significant. He said that although Extell had a right to choose a deadline a full year later under state rules, it also had the right to choose an earlier date. Many buyers relied on the 2008 date and statements from sales agents that the project would be completed by the fall of 2008, he said. 
 The delay, he said, damaged ''the very fabric of purchasers' lives and their financial obligations.'' Buyers had leases that were expiring, he said, and at least one timed the purchase to a baby's arrival. 
 Extell, in turn, is arguing that the error was insignificant, what lawyers call a ''scrivener's error,'' which should be interpreted to reflect the plain meaning of the state regulations. The plan for the Rushmore was prepared by Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, a firm with 750 lawyers, and reviewed by the development team at Extell, but no one caught the mistake. 
 Michel S. Evanusa, a real estate partner at Stroock, did not return a telephone call or an e-mail message. In an interview, Gary Barnett, the president of Extell, declined to discuss the legal challenge while it is pending.
 Other lawyers were divided over whether the challenge would be upheld. One condominium lawyer noted that the error was an easy one to make in boilerplate paragraphs, but should be enough to give buyers a chance to back out of the contract. The lawyer, who is not involved in the case, declined to give his name because he is a colleague of some of the parties. 
 Steven Sladkus, a real estate lawyer at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz, said that unless other contradictory dates or language appeared in the offering plan or the sales contract, the attorney general was likely to treat the error as a serious one. 
 Yet another real estate lawyer, Adam Leitman Bailey, was of a different opinion. He said the burden was on the buyers to show that a reasonable buyer would have relied on the 2008 date, or that the error harmed a buyer in some way.
 Property records show that in the last few months, buyers have negotiated discounts of as much as 12 percent, and brokers say discounts of as much as 18 percent have been offered to prospective buyers on some units. If all buyers still in contract walk away from the apartments with their deposits, the sponsors will have to resell the units at current market prices and stand to lose perhaps $50 million or more. The building was valued at nearly $800 million under the offering plan prices. 
 But many buyers at the Rushmore don't want to walk away. What they want is the chance to buy in at a lower price, Mr. Cohen said. 
 The complaint before the attorney general does not focus on the construction quality or apartment size discrepancies used in other buyer challenges.
 Mr. Barnett of Extell says that buyers who do close won't be disappointed, no matter what price they pay. He expects the entire Riverside Boulevard development only to increase in value as the neighborhood is completed over the next few years. 
 ''People who move into the building will be getting a bargain,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''They will buy into water views, park views and a super high-quality building.''

HEADLINE: Orender, W.N.B.A.'s President, Says League Is Her Priority

BYLINE: By BRIAN HEYMAN

DATELINE: UNCASVILLE, Conn. 

 BODY:
Before the All-Star Game tipped off at Mohegan Sun Arena on Saturday, members of the news media sat in a circle with the W.N.B.A.'s president, Donna Orender, who took questions on a variety of issues at the unofficial midpoint of season No. 13. Her own future in the league's highest chair was among them.
 Orender has been among those being mentioned as a possible candidate to be the next commissioner of the L.P.G.A. Carolyn Bivens resigned from that position July 13 under pressure from some of the tour's members; she was replaced on an interim basis by Marsha Evans. 
 Orender, who worked for the PGA Tour for 17 years before being named that president of the W.N.B.A., did not say she wanted the job. But she also did not slam the door on the idea.
 ''I'm 100 percent, 1,000 percent focused on the W.N.B.A. right now,'' Orender said. ''At the end of the season, would that change? I don't know that it would change at the end of the season.''
 Asked point-blank if she were interested, she responded, ''I have had no discussions with the L.P.G.A. and I am 100 percent focused on what I'm doing right now.''
 Last week, Orender was in Tulsa, Okla., meeting with a group that wants to start a W.N.B.A. franchise in that city.
 ''They have an investor group that's been very interested in the W.N.B.A. over the past year,'' Orender said. ''They've done a lot of due diligence there. They felt they were ready to bring it public. They have strong support from the city. They have some strong corporate support. Now they're bringing it to the fan base to see if they can put the whole package together.''
 Orender did not say if a potential Tulsa team would be an expansion team or an established team that wanted to relocate.
 ''Right now, it's about finding out whether Tulsa is viable,'' she said. ''And then the next step will be after we found that out.''
 The league has 13 teams this season, and Orender said she was ''fairly confident'' that there would be at least that many next season.
 ''The economy is very challenging,'' she said. ''Could the economy take a dip and knock out all of your newspapers in a month or two? How fairly confident are you? I'm as a confident as I can be looking at our current numbers.''
 The W.N.B.A. took the sagging economy into account when it cut the rosters this season to 11 players from 13. Orender said she did not think that would change next season.
 ''I think the 11-player roster has been successful,'' Orender said. ''I think the players would all agree that the level of competition has gotten so intense, that there's nobody to sit on the end of the bench. Everybody wants to make sure that they're not in that last seat. So in that way, it's been productive. I'm not happy about the fact that there are less jobs. I'd like to have more jobs.''
 Orender said there had not been any problems with the Connecticut Sun's playing its home games at a casino. She was asked if that could open up the prospect of Las Vegas having an N.B.A. franchise.
 ''I can't speak to the men's issue in Vegas, but I can say that the W.N.B.A. would have no problem being in Las Vegas,'' she said.
 Diana Taurasi, an All-Star guard for the Phoenix Mercury who is one of the league's co-leaders in scoring, was cited for three drunken-driving charges on July 2. She is scheduled to be in court Aug. 21. She served a two-game suspension from the Mercury, and Orender indicated that Taurasi would not be penalized further by the league.
 ''There's no doubt that Diana Taurasi made a mistake,'' Orender said. ''She's owned up to it. She stood up tall. She's taken responsibility. The team has given out punishment. The league would give out the same punishment.
 ''The court process, that kind of has a life of its own. But she has paid the maximum penalty for an athlete having that kind of transgression at this point.''
 Orender said she had spoken to Taurasi about the incident.
 ''I would tell you that she has genuine remorse,'' Orender said. ''It's funny. When you're an athlete and you do what you love, sometimes you don't truly understand the impact you have on other people. I think this really hit home with her the kind of responsibility she carries. She's taken it really to heart. I think that's important.''
 Orender said she would be joining the defending W.N.B.A. champion Detroit Shock at the White House on Monday, when President Obama is to honor the team. So what is the W.N.B.A. president going to say to the basketball-playing president?
 '' 'When are we going to get out there and play?' '' Orender said.
 Orender, an All-Star while playing three years in the short-lived Women's Professional Basketball League, said he had met Obama before.
 ''He said, 'Do you have a game?' '' Orender said. ''I said: Yeah, I have a game. Let's go.''

HEADLINE: Renters to the Rescue

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
VALISA AND JAMES TATE were among the first residents to move into One Brooklyn Bridge Park, a condominium project in Brooklyn Heights, in the summer of 2008. A year later, the hallways still feel barren. Only 77 of the building's 438 apartments have closed. Twenty-six are in contract. 
 In order to keep money coming in during a difficult time for sales, the developer, the RAL Companies, has begun renting out some of the apartments. The first tenants moved in this month. 
 ''It's a great project,'' said Robert A. Levine, the president of RAL. ''But we're subject to the real world. The real world is such that financing is an issue for buyers, sale of their current residences is an issue for buyers. All of those factors enter in and slow down the process.'' 
 In the face of the recession, many buildings that began life as condominiums have converted to rentals. But what RAL is doing at One Brooklyn Bridge Park -- and what many other developers of new condos may begin doing in the coming months -- is slightly different. The building becomes a kind of hybrid, a condominium with renters in the mix.
 ''If the developer can't sell, he makes this decision with his lender,'' said Andy Gerringer, who runs the development marketing group at Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''They agree together that in order to get cash flow, they're going to rent units.'' 
 Most condominiums have few restrictions on renting out apartments. Traditionally, individual condo owners have been the landlords. But when developers turn to renting apartments, it's often on a large scale. Regardless of whom tenants are renting from, potential buyers tend to shy away from buildings that are renter-heavy.
 ''It's not a problem if it's a handful,'' Mr. Gerringer added, ''but if you start to rent 25 percent of the building or more, it takes on the flavor of a rental.''
 Units that have been rented, he points out, can't be sold as new when the market picks back up, a problem for developers because they will have to mark down the price. And renters do not always take care of their apartments as well as owners do, which can be a problem for everybody. 
 The idea of renters has made some of the owners at One Brooklyn Bridge Park nervous.
 ''People were concerned,'' said James Tate, 44, who, along with his wife, Valisa, 39, paid $695,000 for a 1,100-square-foot studio. ''Not worried yet, but concerned that if the number goes higher, then it could dilute our investment.''
 But is renting some units worse than letting a building sit half-empty? 
 ''The negative impact to values is far less in a building with vacant units filled with tenants than a vacant building,'' said Jonathan Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''One would assume that the sponsor's ultimate goal over time is to sell out,'' he added. ''In the long run, there's no impairment to value.''
 There is no accurate count of how many buildings in New York City are going this route, though Brooklyn appears to have a high concentration. 
 But Mr. Miller said rental-condo mixtures are likely to become more common. ''You can feel the sentiment changing,'' he said. ''It's just coming down to cash-flow pressure.''
 In order to rent unsold apartments, developers must reserve the right to do so in the original condominium offering plan -- a document filed with the New York attorney general's office that potential buyers are supposed to review before closing on an apartment. 
 If a developer does not do so in the original, he or she can amend the plan to allow for rentals later, but only if no units have closed. So it has become standard practice to include provisions for renting from the start. 
 RAL reserves the right to rent in all its condo projects. But Mr. Levine said the last time the right was exercised was in the early '90s.
 ''This building is not a rental building, it is a condominium,'' Mr. Levine said of One Brooklyn Bridge Park. While his offering plan allows him to rent up to 25 percent of the building, more than 100 apartments, for now he is renting out only 20, fewer than 5 percent. Five have been rented so far, all with one-year leases, and two are part of a rent-to-own program. 
 ''We would like things to be different,'' Mr. Levine said. 
 RAL bought the building about five years ago from the Jehovah's Witnesses, which had used the space as a distribution plant. ''We went into this building and knew what we could do with it.'' Mr. Levine said. ''We had a vision and it turned out to be exactly what we wanted. And then the world fell apart.''
 Jonathan Mellon became one of One Brooklyn Bridge Park's new rental tenants earlier this month. Mr. Mellon, 36, a native of Brooklyn, moved from Washington for a job at the Historic House Trust of New York City, a nonprofit organization that works with the Parks Department to preserve landmark buildings like Gracie Mansion. 
 Mr. Mellon owned an apartment in Washington, which he sold at a small loss this year, and apartments in New York before that. His decision to rent is a sign of the times.
 ''Like a lot of people, I was unsure where New York's real estate market was going,'' Mr. Mellon said. ''This is a building I think long-term I'd strongly consider buying in. I just need to see how things develop a little bit more.''
 So he's sitting out the dance for now, paying $2,200 a month for a 600-square-foot studio with a 300-square-foot terrace. He has a washer-dryer, a dishwasher, high-end appliances like a Sub-Zero refrigerator, and free access to almost all of the building's amenities, including the gym and the golf simulator. He does have to pay for storage. 
 ''You can see, especially for a rental, it's got all the bells and whistles,'' Mr. Mellon said.
 But One Brooklyn Bridge Park still has more than 300 vacant apartments, waiting for buyers. 
 Developers in some smaller buildings have decided to take the rental-condo route as well, filling up all vacant apartments with renters rather than holding several open for prospective buyers. 
 Only three apartments have sold in a 10-unit development at 195 Classon Avenue in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn; the rest will be rented out. 
 ''It got to a point where everyone was making us such low offers, they were at our cost,'' said Reuben Pinner, a partner in IVIZ, the building's developer. ''But this is our job. This is how we make money. How can we survive?'' 
 Mr. Pinner calculates that by renting out the seven unsold apartments -- so far, leases have been signed for five -- he can cover most of his bills. He will lose a little money each month, but not more than he can afford, he said.
 ''Hopefully we can ride out this little storm we're having and things will work out later,'' he said. 
 Chris and Sonja Martin, who moved to New York from Indiana earlier this month, rented an apartment in Mr. Pinner's building. They think of it as a rental like any other. 
 ''We thought we'd get a year lease to figure out the neighborhoods,'' Ms. Martin said. Both 37 years old, they pay $2,650 a month for their two-bedroom with a washer-dryer and a patio. ''We didn't want to make an economic commitment somewhere without knowing where we really wanted to be.''
 But Manny and Celine Enriquez have made a commitment to 195 Classon. They closed on a two-bedroom apartment this spring for $500,000, some $200,000 below the original asking price.
 ''We're looking to keep this place for at least 5 or 10 years, and then we'll see what happens,'' said Mr. Enriquez, 49, an architect affiliated with Ted Moudis Associates. He is not concerned about the long-term return on the investment. ''We got a pretty good deal,'' he said. ''When the economy kicks in, the property will appreciate well enough.''
 In the meantime, while they don't consider living in a building full of rental tenants to be ideal, they say it is an acceptable way to adapt to the market.
 ''As long as we have stringent house rules,'' said Ms. Enriquez, 51, an interior designer. ''It's all verbal now, but it has to be put into writing and everybody has to cooperate.''
 Christopher Broshears, a condo owner at 285 Driggs Avenue in Greenpoint, has run up against the disarray that some owners fear from renters.
 Mr. Broshears, 37, an architect and a partner in Broshears Stancil Projects, bought his one-bedroom apartment for $569,000. It has two terraces and sweeping views of the city through broad glass walls. He moved into the 12-unit condo building late last summer. 
 Four other apartments in the building have sold, but there have been no sales this year, according to StreetEasy.com, a Web site that tracks listings. The remaining apartments have been put up for rent, and according to Mr. Broshears only one is still vacant. 
 The offering plan for 285 Driggs filed with the attorney general's office gives the developer the right to rent units out temporarily if prices fall below a certain point. As the rented apartments become vacant, the developer must again try to sell them if that minimum can be met. 
 The offering plans lists the building's sponsor as 285 Driggs L.L.C. and the principal as Aaron Tyrnauer. He did not return calls for comment. 
 In general, Mr. Broshears says, the rental tenants are good neighbors. But there have been a few incidents, like a raucous party given by a renter at which guests smoked in the elevator and littered a hall with empty beer cups.
 ''I don't mind the idea of having rental tenants in the building,'' Mr. Broshears said, ''as long as they respect that they're living in a condominium building, rather than a college dorm or a fraternity crash pad.''
 But a greater concern, Mr. Broshears says, involves unfinished repairs in the building. The developer started work on an external wall to patch up some waterproofing several months ago and, he says, still hasn't finished the job. 
 ''Later on we'll focus on creating regulations for tenants,'' he said.
 Many condo developers are reluctant to discuss rental plans.
 ''A lot of buildings seem to be doing this on the q.t. or the hush-hush,'' said Patrice A. Mack, an associate broker and a vice president of Core Group Marketing, the realty firm handling 72 Steuben Street, a 10-unit condo building in Clinton Hill that has just started renting out unsold apartments. 
 ''I don't think it's necessarily a negative thing,'' Ms. Mack said. ''Your other option is places sitting empty. And when a building is partially occupied, it leaves a bad feeling, a bad sense, in a lot of people.''

HEADLINE: A Ticking Clock on Affirmative Action

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Race in 2028'' (column, July 20), Ross Douthat quotes the former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's statement famously setting limits on race-based affirmative action six years ago in Grutter v. Bollinger by writing that ''the Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.''
 But in her memoir, ''The Majesty of the Law,'' Justice O'Connor argued that a timefree standard could more generously measure equality for her gender. She wrote that until the percentage of women in important positions comes ''closer to 50 percent, we cannot say we have succeeded.'' 
 In Justice O'Connor's formulation, achieving fairness for women is not time-limited; for people of color, sadly, the fairness clock is ticking fast.
 Julian Bond Chairman N.A.A.C.P. Board of Directors Washington, July 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat protests too much over the obvious: Affirmative action was always meant to be a temporary remedy for historical injustice.
 But should not the policy be based on the ''situation on the ground,'' rather than on some arbitrary timeline? Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's 2003 decision was moored both to the highest principle -- liberty and justice for all -- and to the simple observation that it had not yet been achieved.
 Now, as in 2028, reasonable people may disagree about how much remedy is enough, and how much too much, but despite the election of Barack Obama, no reasonable person can look at our society's disparities in income, employment, education and incarceration rates and argue that the job is done.
 David Berman New York, July 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat argues that affirmative action programs need to be phased out over time because of the potential for corruption and because affirmative action ''condescends to its beneficiaries, and corrodes the racial attitudes of its victims.''
 I, too, hope that affirmative action will, at some point in the future, not be needed. However, it is not affirmative action that corrupts and condescends and corrodes, but rather a society in which unequal educational and economic opportunities are provided to some of its citizens because of the color of their skin.
 Affirmative action is a necessary corrective for our imperfect society.
 Cathleen Barnhart White Plains, July 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Ross Douthat seems to take it as a given that race-based preferences will become unjustifiable as minorities begin to outnumber whites. But often the most galling kind of racial disparity occurs when an area of society remains dominated by whites despite the changing racial makeup of the community. This can be intentional or incidental, or a mixture of both.
 Mr. Douthat may think that the backroom machinations of a black preacher better account for New Haven's decision to scrap the results of its firefighters exam, but it is just as plausible that the city wanted to eliminate exactly this sort of racial gap between the fire department and the community whose confidence it needs.
 Sam Barr Somerville, Mass., July 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I agree with Ross Douthat that ideally affirmative action would not be a part of the political and social landscape forever. But it is a bit disingenuous to suggest that just because there will be a higher percentage of nonwhites in the population, discrimination will automatically cease and desist.
 Regarding college admissions, besides social barriers, we still have an archaic way of financing education, so that there are huge regional and local disparities between rich, middle class and poor. It's a no-brainer that wealthier communities are generally going to have a better school system than poorer communities. I wouldn't be surprised to find public schools becoming more de facto segregated, especially in big cities, than they were 30 years ago.
 How about federally financed education based on student enrollment and a cost-of-living pay differential for teachers as a first step toward a truly level playing field? Perhaps, after a generation or two, affirmative action would not be needed.

HEADLINE: Late Morning, Late Night

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
Carol Miller is a veteran classic-rock disc jockey in New York City and has rocked out at concerts by the Beatles, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. She can be heard weekdays from 7 p.m. to midnight on Q104.3 FM, where she also records her popular ''Get the Led Out'' dispatches, and on daily programs she hosts on Sirius XM Radio. She lives on the Upper West Side with her husband, Paul Logus, the mixing engineer and producer, and birds, Br-Br and Baby Gracie; as for her age, she said only that her first concert was a Beatles show. MICHAEL WILSON 
 WAKEUP For me, it's early. It's noon. I work nights, so I'm a night person. Sunday is not a very relaxing day for me, but that's O.K. With the economy and everything, I'm happy to work seven days a week. I have a little breakfast, and I say hello to my pet parrots. We have a little conversation. One is 28 and one is 12 this year.
 FUEL Breakfast. My favorite. I have a toasted English muffin with Maxwell House instant coffee, with Smart Balance light margarine, Lactaid low-fat cottage cheese, a nice slice of lox and a slice of tomato. Lunch is like a foreign country to me.
 MEMOIR TIME I have a contract, and the book has to be done by December. I'm writing longhand. I write for about an hour in my notebook. 
 WORKOUT There's a gym in my building. Sometimes after I eat, I go down there for 15 minutes. Some people might not call it a workout. I call it fooling around with the machines. 
 THEN WORK I go to the studio and for half an hour or so, I finish recording ''Get the Led Out.'' It's all the adventures of Led Zeppelin. It's often a calendar. Sometimes it's, 'In June, somebody jumped out a window.' I have a minute five days a week and an hour on Mondays. I'm not some kind of a looney-tune. It's simply because people like it. 
 LONG ISLAND SCHLEP Usually, the whole family, we take our parents out to dinner. My parents have been married for 66 years, and we're very proud of them. It's either at ''the diner'' or what we call ''the fancy place,'' which is a nice restaurant in a shopping center in the Roslyn Heights area. 
 MORE WORK Then it gets a little nutty. I get back, it's probably 10 or 11 o'clock. I go to Sirius XM for about an hour. I'm on two channels. Then I stop in to visit the wonderful Elaine Kaufman, the legendary proprietor of Elaine's restaurant. 
 MOONLIGHT SHOPPING About 1 a.m., I go, with my husband, food shopping in New Jersey at an all-night supermarket, because they let you push the wagon in the parking lot. In New York they don't let you do that. We visit, I call her the Empress of Checkout, Miss Tina. Then we come back and unload the groceries, and if there's something good that we've TiVo'd, we watch it then.

HEADLINE: Many Failing Roads, Little Repair Money

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
OF all the tattered swaths of pavement that pock the New York area's road system, home to some of the country's most bone-rattling stretches of asphalt, few can match the combination of structural disrepair and functional obsolescence of the Pulaski Skyway. 
 Opened in 1932, the hulking 3.5-mile elevated highway connecting Jersey City, South Kearny and Newark stands today as a kind of industrial Acropolis: its entrance ramps and lane widths dangerously outdated, its roadbed and concrete railings crumbling so badly that the state has installed netting to catch the falling debris. New Jersey spends tens of millions of dollars each year to maintain the worn roadway, but it will likely be a decade or more before the state can afford the $1.2 billion needed to replace or refurbish it. 
 ''When you get on the entrance ramp of the Pulaski Skyway, you feel your pulse start to race, your adrenaline starts to pump and your eyes dart back and forth looking for holes,'' said Jeff Jotz, who lives in Rahway, N.J., and lost all four of his car's hubcaps during two months of commuting on the Pulaski. ''People are darting in and out, and there's no shoulder. You're up in the air, and there's just nowhere to go.'' 
 Mr. Jotz and the 85,000 other people who drive the Skyway daily are hardly alone in their distress. A June study by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials ranked road conditions in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey 43rd, 44th and 50th, respectively, among the states.
 The shoddy conditions are partly due to the sheer volume of traffic in the country's most densely populated region. But urban planners and infrastructure experts say the deterioration of the area's roads is also the result of shortsighted policy decisions by state government officials who have often been more eager to build new highways than repair existing streets or alleviate traffic by improving mass transit, and who have repeatedly tapped transportation funds for other projects.
 Drivers may finally notice some relief this year as states use federal economic stimulus money to pay for billions of dollars in road improvements. 
 New York City is spending $261 million of its stimulus money on road and bridge improvements, including repairing access ramps on the Belt Parkway in Brooklyn and Queens, and reconstruction projects on the Brooklyn Bridge and East Houston and West 125th Streets in Manhattan. New Jersey is anticipating $652 million for road and bridge projects, including repaving parts of the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 295.
 Connecticut plans to spend $302 million on, among other things, upgrades to the Merritt Parkway and a bridge on busy Route 5. New York State is using $154 million to make improvements on roads and bridges on Long Island, including the Meadowbrook, Sagtikos and Southern State Parkways.
 But the stimulus money is a one-shot deal to finance repairs long delayed. To redress years of neglect, states would need to find a way to significantly increase spending and refocus their priorities, transportation planners say.
 Federal money finances the bulk of major highway costs, but state and local governments around New York have been inconsistent, at best, at picking up the rest. Since 1984, New Jersey has used a gasoline tax to underwrite a transportation trust fund, but the fund has piled up so much debt that officials have said it could cease taking on new projects by 2011. Local officials in New York State have long complained that Albany diverts millions in tax revenue intended for road repairs to pay for other projects. 
 Officials in Connecticut, which relies more on federal aid for road projects than most other states, have also been criticized for siphoning off road repair money to the general budget. 
 ''They're hijacking the money to pay for other pet projects in the budget,'' said Donald Shubert, executive secretary of the Connecticut Road Builders Association, an advocacy group for construction firms. ''And the drivers in the state are paying for it.''
 The recession has made a bad situation worse, because most roads belong to counties, cities and towns that are facing mounting budget problems. 
 ''We've created this bind, this suburban-oriented society, where we want more roads and use them more quickly, but aren't willing to pay for them,'' said Robert E Paaswell, a civil engineering professor and director of the University Transportation Research Center at the City University of New York. 
 Years of putting off maintenance have left the 84,000 miles of roads traversing New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island and Westchester County in pitiable shape. The national highway study found that the percentage of local roads in poor condition exceeded the national average of 13 percent: in New Jersey it was 46 percent, New York, 22 percent, and Connecticut, 14 percent. That caused more than just frayed nerves: the study estimated that bad roads cost a typical New Jersey driver $596 per year in repairs and vehicle wear and tear. 
 New Jersey officials say they have begun the long process of upgrading: this year, a transportation spokeswoman said, the state is repaving 623 miles.
 Since 2000, New Jersey has spent less than 5 percent of its capital budget for transportation on expanding the capacity of its roads. During the 1990s, the state spent more than 50 percent of it some years on new roads, a practice that Kate Slevin of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an infrastructure planning group, called ''misguided.'' 
 Transportation officials in the region say they are making incremental progress in improving road conditions. Eileen Peters, a spokeswoman for New York State's Department of Transportation, said that 86 percent of roads maintained by the state in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were rated good or excellent in 2007. 
 But those numbers offer little comfort to drivers who travel the thousands of miles of county and municipally maintained roads on Long Island, where, local officials say, there is an extensive backlog of streets in need of repair or replacement. In Hempstead, for example, road engineers usually have enough money to repave six to eight of the 300 miles of roads each year, so residents must endure pockmarked streets for weeks, months and sometimes years. 
 The situation is even more pressing in the Westchester city of Peekskill. Last year, city engineers assessed its 50 miles of streets, some of which are so badly worn that grass grows through the pavement, and estimated that $9 million would be needed just to restore them to average condition.
 But the amount of state aid Peekskill gets for road repaving -- $245,000 -- has stayed the same for a decade, so city officials are considering a bond issue of $1.3 million to buy 11 tons of asphalt and repave about five miles.
 ''They say they're going to fix things, but they usually don't,'' said Ralph Nardone, who is 83 and has lived in Peekskill for 35 years. ''Maybe they patch a pothole or fill a hole. But repaving? They're not going to spend that kind of money. There are so many problems all over Peekskill that no one would even know where to start.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: August 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 26 about deteriorating roads in the New York region, and the shortage of funds to repair them, misidentified the source of money that New Jersey is using to repave parts of the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. That work is being financed with toll revenue collected by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, not federal stimulus money.

HEADLINE: Sudden Finale

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN; Claudia La Rocco contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 AS a sulfurous smell from the nearby mineral springs drifted past, a half-dozen dancers looked into the waning light of a cool Saturday night here recently and took their final bows as members of the New York City Ballet.
 They were among 11 members of the company's corps de ballet, some barely in their 20s, who have joined the swelling ranks of laid-off workers nationwide struggling to find new ways in the recession. They were told in February, shortly before the deadline for new contracts to be issued, that their employment would not be renewed, mainly for economic reasons. Some left soon after. Others gave their final performances the week ending July 18, as the company closed its summer season at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center.
 The layoffs have produced a complicated set of responses among these dancers, who, since childhood, have endured grueling hours of cloistered study to achieve a remarkable level of artistry, a position at the pinnacle of the ballet world and then, suddenly, unemployment: anger mixed with grief but also a sense of new possibility and youthful optimism.
 The emotions are especially acute because, more than many other workers, ballet dancers define themselves and their self-worth by their profession. Losing a job is like losing one's identity. 
 ''You're just erased, as if you were never there,'' said one of the dancers, Sophie Flack, 25 and an eight-year veteran of the corps. ''It was the end of the life I knew since I was a little girl.''
 Some, like Ms. Flack, have decided to quit dancing and go to college. Others will audition for other companies, a task made all the tougher by hard times at performing-arts institutions around the country. One, a recent mother, is moving back to Ohio, where her husband will look for a job. Another, a 21-year-old woman, plans to study costume design.
 Those leaving their cosseted sphere are moving into a scary world where they have to learn about financial-aid packages and job training. They are receiving severance pay and an extra three months of union health coverage, and are generally eligible for unemployment insurance.
 The layoffs, though part of the company's cost-cutting strategy, produced a round of questioning for each individual: Did I have too many injuries? Too many outside interests that made it seem dance was not my top priority? An inability to attract the ballet masters' favor? Was I not attending class regularly?
 In short, why me? 
 ''Everyone's asked themselves that question,'' said Darius Barnes, 21, who was let go after only one season in the corps. ''You can't possibly know.''
 Mr. Barnes said he had auditioned for several companies and for Broadway shows, ''but no bites yet.'' He did receive a job as an understudy for a Metropolitan Opera production of ''Aida'' next season.
 Some of the dancers also questioned why new members were being added to the corps when they were been dismissed, and why other companies had managed to find cost savings without resorting to dancer reductions.
 For some, the way the layoffs were handled only reinforced the anonymity of their existence. 
 The corps, like the chorus in an opera, is the body of workhorses who provide the backbone for most of the repertory. Individual members often have featured roles and some may nourish hopes of achieving principal status someday. While listed in the program, they rarely receive the spotlight of soloists and principal dancers, who are often showered with flowers and recognition when they retire.
 In this case City Ballet tried to keep a lid on information about the dancers, refusing to release their names or even to ask them if they wanted to be interviewed, for what it called reasons of privacy. The ballet master in chief, Peter Martins, who was the subject of grumbling by the laid-off dancers, declined to be interviewed, although when he announced the layoffs he called the decision ''the hardest thing I've done my entire professional career.'' 
 City Ballet's general manager, Kenneth Tabachnick, agreed to make limited comments on the nonrenewals. They were determined by ''an extremely difficult process for everyone,'' he said, and they came in the context of a $7 million deficit this year on a budget of $62.3 million and an expected $5 million deficit next year. The reduction, he said, would save $1.2 million. He said the size of the roster would drop from an unusually large 101 -- a result of relatively little attrition in recent years -- to about 90. The company has also cut staff salaries, imposed a staff hiring freeze and reduced administrative spending. 
 Mr. Tabachnick confirmed that an undisclosed number of new corps members would be promoted from the ranks of eight apprentices, but he said the promotions would be part of a renewal of company talent vital to keeping City Ballet artistically healthy. The apprentice spots will be filled by members of the School of American Ballet, the company's feeder, thus creating openings for new students. So the talent pipeline will continue to flow.
 ''Everything happens in the context of managing our business,'' Mr. Tabachnick said. 
 Some of the dancers took their departures into their own hands. Ms. Flack took an extra-flamboyant bow after her last performance and gave herself a party. Others invited family and friends to last performances.
 Six of the departing corps members agreed to speak; three declined to comment or did not respond to messages; and two could not be identified without the company's help.
 Those who spoke described a day of tears and interminable walks down the long hallway to Mr. Martins's office in February to hear the news, frantic phone calls comparing notes and a slow acceptance of the reality.
 ''We just can't afford to keep you,'' Ms. Flack said she was told by Mr. Martins. And that was it.
 ''My first reaction was to rid myself of the ballet world,'' she added, saying that her dismissal felt like receiving a diagnosis of terminal illness. ''It was so painful.'' 
 But as the news settled in, Ms. Flack said, she decided to leave dance to explore the broader world, away from a place where adult corps members are usually called girls and boys. ''I feel more like a grown-up now,'' she said, ''more like a woman.'' She said she would attend Columbia University.
 A Boston-area native, Ms. Flack followed a route to the corps typical of that of many dancers. She said she had wanted to join the company since she saw her first Balanchine ballet at 11. Then came admission to the company's School of American Ballet at 15, followed by two years of intense work and competition. 
 ''On top of that I starved myself,'' Ms. Flack said. She lost so much weight that company officials had to intervene. 
 She won a coveted spot as an apprentice at 17. ''It was the happiest moment of my life, getting in,'' she said. She described the grueling hours of classes and rehearsals, and coming home exhausted but deeply satisfied. ''Wow, I lived today,'' was how she described the feeling. As a more senior member of the corps, Ms. Flack earned about $70,000 to $80,000 a year at the end.
 Eventually, she said, she began feeling frustrated at not being assigned more important roles. She said she approached Mr. Martins, who agreed to give her more responsibility, but nothing came of it. ''That was a blow,'' Ms. Flack said. In 2006 she tore a hamstring, another setback.
 But Ms. Flack was also discovering a world outside the ballet bubble, moving to Greenwich Village, acquiring her first boyfriend, visiting museums.
 ''I never wanted to be a 'bunhead,' '' she said, speculating that she had been chosen to be laid off either because her attention was not totally on the company or because Mr. Martins felt less concerned about releasing a dancer with better prospects of coping with the outside world.
 Another dancer, speaking on condition of anonymity because she was changing careers and did not want her layoff to become the focus of attention, said Mr. Martins had noted a lack of attendance at company class or early departures from it. ''He said that I lost my spark,'' she added.
 Mr. Tabachnick declined to comment on the criteria for choosing who was not renewed. 
 Normally a City Ballet pedigree would be a big boost in finding a job at another company. But less so now. Layoffs have occurred recently at several companies, including Ballet Florida, which folded this month, and Miami City Ballet, and post-dance career counselors say requests for help are pouring in. 
 ''There's nowhere hiring,'' said Briana Shepherd, 22, a native of Perth, Australia, and one of the nonrenewed corps members. ''It's not like I'm saying: 'Pat on the back for getting into City Ballet. I must be talented, and I'll go somewhere else.' ''
 But other companies have managed to make budget cuts and maintain their roster, including Boston Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet and American Ballet Theater in New York, where dancers agreed to forgo vacation pay and pension contributions.
 The dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, said City Ballet was well within its rights not to rehire the dancers. ''We would have preferred to have a discussion about it and see if there was a way to preserve jobs, which is what we've done elsewhere.'' said James Fayette, the guild's New York area dance executive. ''They just moved forward and were not interested in having that discussion.''
 Mr. Tabachnick said comparisons to other companies should not be made, because of City Ballet's large roster and huge repertory.
 Ms. Shepherd last danced in March but stopped to recover from a torn ankle tendon, the latest in a series of injuries that kept her idle for half of her four years at the company.
 She said she had contemplated leaving dance in 2008 but the loss of her job coupled with the latest injury changed her mind. ''That was a little bit sad,'' she said. ''I don't want to end on that note. I want to make sure if I do give up ballet it's for the right reasons.''
 Ms. Shepherd said she planned to return to Perth, undergo rehabilitation and then audition in Europe. She said she sympathized with the difficult task Mr. Martins faced. ''When the chips were down, he had to choose 11,'' she said.
 Katie Bergstrom, 25, who has been in the corps for seven years, said her dismissal proved ''incredibly scary and intimidating.''
 ''But I feel really liberated,'' she added, speaking in a Saratoga Springs diner on her day off. She had been feeling restless for several years, she said, and City Ballet's decision was the nudge she needed to leave the company and the field of dance. She is considering becoming a yoga teacher and plans to attend Hunter College.
 Like the other dancers interviewed, Ms. Bergstrom said she would chiefly miss the camaraderie of the corps -- ''being able to walk into the dressing room and just feel like you're at home'' -- and the joy of performance. ''It's a liberating experience, the only time of the day where you just get to dance for yourself,'' she added, and not for ballet masters or others judging her abilities.
 Ms. Bergstrom also lamented the lack of recognition for the departing dancers. ''It's pretty pathetic,'' she said, but added that she preferred to slip away quietly. She, like several other dancers, had hard words for Mr. Martins, although she acknowledged his skill at running the company and the necessity to cut costs. ''Do I think he treats his dancers with respect?'' she said. ''Absolutely not. He has absolutely no idea who we are.''
 Max van der Sterre, 23, who was also let go, said City Ballet's entire system, with its unusually heavy workload, is based on the interchangeability of dancers, who, because of injuries, are often replaced.
 ''I've seen so many dancers come and go,'' he said. ''Everyone is expendable. Even principal dancers are replaceable. It's all about the system, the end product.''
 Mr. van der Sterre, whose energy keeps him constantly in motion, plans to return to San Francisco, his hometown, and seek freelance jobs before striking out on a European audition tour in the winter. He said an ''amazing four years'' at City Ballet helped him see the world, on tours, and gave him the capacity to absorb steps quickly. 
 The day after he was interviewed at the house he was renting with friends and family, Mr. van der Sterre was back on the Saratoga stage, wielding a crossbow as a huntsman in ''Swan Lake.'' On July 18 he took his final bow as a member of New York City Ballet.
 He said he was leaving with mixed feelings: ''It was really emotional to be working here and having such amazing times, and also some really hard times. It was definitely not my choice to have to leave so soon, but it is what's happening.''
 Truth be told, he added, he is happy to be free to do other work.
 ''It's always nice,'' he said, ''to change it up.''

HEADLINE: Wireless: A Success Story

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Who Rules the Mobile Bands?'' (editorial, July 22):
 The wireless sector of the high-tech industry shines as an economic bright spot. Competition has driven huge investment, innovation and lower consumer costs. 
 The 85,000 United States-based employees of Verizon Wireless appreciate the opportunity to respond to a recent editorial about the industry that former Vice President Al Gore called one of the most competitive on the globe. Virtually all Americans can choose from among at least four providers. 
 Wireless is a great value, and Americans actually pay less than Europeans. An analysis comparing 26 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development with the United States showed that Americans use the most wireless minutes per month while paying the lowest price per minute.
 Investment in 4G networks will improve health care by carrying medical records securely, mitigate climate change by making telecommuting easier, advance energy efficiency with smart grid technologies and lead the economy to new prosperity. 
 Wireless is a success story even our critics can be proud of.
 Lowell McAdam President and Chief Executive Verizon Wireless Basking Ridge, N.J., July 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 To say that the United States wireless industry is not competitive is to simply ignore the most basic and compelling of facts.
 You mention the ''Big Four'' as if somehow the choice of four wireless carriers is a problem. In most competitive industries the choice of two is a benefit. In the wireless industry more than 95 percent of us can choose from at least three competing carriers, and more than half of us have a choice of at least five. How many industries can make that claim? 
 Evidence of a dynamically competitive wireless industry is all around us, and in all regions of the country. In just eight years the number of wireless subscribers went from 100 million to more that 270 million. And Americans have far more choices, and pay far less than their European counterparts, for both devices and minutes. 
 For proof of a thriving market, one need look no further than the variety of ads in The New York Times itself. Every day multiple wireless carriers advertise, each offering a full array of smartphones and wireless handsets, and arguing the merits of their devices, networks or pricing plans. In short, choices abound and consumers are reaping the benefits. In the face of this, it is hard to argue that government intervention is needed.

HEADLINE: When Career Switching ...

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON

 BODY:
WHAT TO KNOW
 Career changers hoping for admission to a competitive alternative teacher-training program should worry less about academic and job accomplishments and more about the personal traits that helped them succeed. Problem-solving skills, emotional intelligence, a belief in the power to create change: these are a few of the elements that generate success in underprivileged classrooms. 
 Timothy Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, which helps career changers get teaching positions across the country and runs the New York City Teaching Fellows program, says he is looking for candidates who are ''in it for the right reasons'' and not, say, waiting for the current economic wave to pass. 
 He suggests career changers visit a classroom, observe good teaching and ask, ''Is this something I really see myself doing?''
 JOB MARKET
 This year, many school districts have had to make cuts. In New York City, a hiring freeze meant fewer than half the 1,500 teaching fellows placed last year. Still, prospects remain high for those who are interested in needy schools, who are willing to relocate to underserved districts, or whose expertise is math, science or special education. Bilingual educators are also in demand as non-English-speaking enrollment continues to grow. 
 EXPECTED EARNINGS
 New England, Mid-Atlantic and Far West states pay best, on average. California ($63,640), Connecticut ($61,039), 
 New Jersey ($59,730) and New York ($59,557) lead. New Jersey, though, pays the nation's highest salary for new teachers: an average $44,523, compared with a national average for new teachers of $35,284, according to the American Federation of Teachers. 
 Advanced degrees and acculumated years in a district increase salary. In New York City, for example, teachers with a master's degree can earn more than $94,000 a year. But charter school teachers make 24 percent less than the average teacher over all. 
 WHERE TO TRAIN
 Other than Teach for America (teachforamerica.org), there are more than 600 state-sponsored alternative routes to training and certification. The National Center for Alternative Certification lists them by state (teach-now.org). The New Teacher Project (tntp.org) runs programs in 40 districts, including Philadelphia, New Orleans, Denver and Oakland, Calif., as well as New York (nycteachingfellows.org). 
 Urban Teacher Residency United (utrunited.org) offers apprenticeships and master's degrees in exchange for five-year commitments in city schools. Its founding programs are Boston Teacher Residency (bpe.org/btr), the Boettcher Teachers Program in Denver (boettcherteachers.org) and the Academy for Urban School Leadership in Chicago (ausl-chicago.org).

HEADLINE: Television Fledgling Keeps It Real

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 THE phone rang late on a summer Sunday morning, and the request was urgent: Can you get to the set of ''Top Chef'' in an hour? 
 It was the call that Doneen Arquines had been awaiting since she finished a job as a production assistant on the show's first season eight months earlier. Since then she had moved on to other shows, adding an associate producer title to her resume, all the while hoping to move back to ''Top Chef'' in a more senior position.
 When she raced downtown to the warehouse headquarters of Bravo's hit cooking show, she found most of the crew packing up to begin shooting on location. ''I was like, 'How can I help?' '' she recalled recently. ''And they said: 'You're staying here. You're going to do dishes.' ''
 For all the hyped-up glamour of reality television -- the exotic beaches, the fake Italian villas and sculptured bodies by the pool -- the picture is quite different behind the camera. And for those looking to enter the television business, it is also far different from how many of the most recognized producers in the field worked their way up through the scripted side of the industry. 
 In the last decade reality television has changed both the economics of prime-time programming and the aspirations of those looking to break into the industry. Since the debut of ''Survivor'' on CBS in 2000 reality programming has grown to account for more than one-quarter of prime time on the five broadcast networks. The economics are compelling: network reality shows cost about $1 million an hour, or one-half to one-third as much as scripted shows. The writers' strike two years ago accelerated the trend, so that reality programming now accounts for 30 percent more prime time than it did before the strike. Meanwhile some of the most popular cable channels, including Bravo, A&E and Discovery, are essentially all-reality networks that replay episodes of their most popular series dozens of times each week. 
 The lesson here for anyone entering the television industry is pretty stark: Reality is where the jobs are. 
 ''It's definitely the real growth part of the television business,'' said Mark Itkin, a senior agent in the television department at the William Morris Endeavor agency. Chris Coelen, chief executive of RDF Media USA, whose productions include ''Don't Forget the Lyrics'' for Fox and ''Wife Swap'' for ABC, added that young people wanting to make a career out of television are going after what they know. 
 ''They grew up watching 'The Hills' or 'American Idol,' '' Mr. Coelen said. ''They are not watching 'Law & Order' and 'CSI,' and so when they come looking to work in the business, those are not the shows they go after.'' 
 On the scripted side an aspiring executive would traditionally get a low-level job as a production assistant on a network comedy or drama, where the duties would begin with fetching coffee, and extend to running a copier and knocking on trailers to alert actors that they are needed on the set. Aspiring writers would then spend their nights banging out potential scripts, while those who wanted to work on the business side would seek a way into the studio or network's training programs. After moving into a studio's series development department or, for writers, being invited to one day sit in the writers' room and contribute to scripts, the eventual goal would be to create a new scripted series. 
 In reality television the jobs differ on the middle rungs of the ladder. There, instead of writers, reality shows employ ''producers'' who wade through hours of footage trying to assemble a coherent story line. The rewards have also changed. Reality television pays only a fraction of what scripted television often pays, in part because fewer of the creative types are represented by unions. 
 According to people who have worked in the field, salaries for those ''producer'' positions on reality series start at about $1,000 a week, one-third the rate for a beginning writer on a scripted show. At the bottom rung production assistants earn half that.
 Reality workers are also usually independent contractors rather than regular employees, so their jobs come with limited benefits and little job security. And because reality series often take only a month or two to shoot a full season of 10 to 15 episodes, compared with nine months to shoot 22 episodes of a network drama, time between jobs is more frequent for reality producers.
 None of which deters people like Ms. Arquines, 27, who grew up in Marysville and Whidbey Island, Wash., north of Seattle, and graduated from Washington State University with a degree in communications and anthropology in 2005. She briefly considered pursuing a career in scripted television but found more similarities between her anthropological studies and reality television. 
 Like almost everyone in the industry, Ms. Arquines relied on connections to get her start. A professor at Washington State for whom she had worked as a teaching assistant knew some people working in television production in Los Angeles, and someone she met there knew an assistant producer on ''Top Chef,'' which was just beginning its first season and needed a production assistant. Just weeks after moving to Los Angeles, Ms. Arquines got the job.
 ''I think at the beginning I was really excited to get into everything,'' she said. ''I didn't say no. I'll go get coffee for people. I'll run up the street and grab your lunch. I just did whatever I could to help, and I got lucky. They ended up taking me to San Francisco to shoot for the first season.'' 
 Dan Cutforth, one of the two founders of Magical Elves, the production company behind ''Top Chef,'' said Ms. Arquines quickly made an impact. 
 ''Everyone always notices good production assistants,'' he said. ''They are willing to do what the job actually is and not walk around thinking they should be an executive producer.''
 A lot of those tasks are the type that cannot be learned in a film school, said Jane Lipsitz, Magical Elves' other founder. ''It requires hands-on experience: troubleshooting, solving problems under pressure and on tight deadlines,'' she said. ''It's the stuff you learn from just being there.''
 When her three-month engagement on the first season of ''Top Chef'' ended, Ms. Arquines bounced around from one reality job to the next, working on pilots for MTV and Logo before being offered a chance to move up to a job as an associate producer on ''Breaking Up With Shannen Doherty,'' which lasted for a single season on the cable channel Oxygen. 
 ''But the whole time I was there,'' Ms. Arquines said, ''I was wishing I was working on 'Top Chef.' I was always telling my friends there, 'Hey I'm only shooting five days a week, so if you need someone on the weekend to help, I'm available.' ''
 Soon after her dishwashing stint, Ms. Arquines returned to help finish the second season of ''Top Chef'' and quickly moved up to associate producer. After taking a short-term assignment on the VH1 show ''I Love New York,'' she joined ''Top Chef'' for the taping of the third season, in 2007, and later that year was promoted again, to segment producer, for the fourth and fifth seasons.
 Now production assistants sometimes bring coffee to her. Backstage recently during a taping of ''Top Chef Masters,'' the current iteration of the series and the first to feature world-famous chefs competing for charity, Ms. Arquines looked chagrined when an assistant dropped off a Starbucks cup at her desk. As a segment producer, she outlines and pulls together the pieces of the short ''quickfire'' challenges, the first of two competition events in each episode, in which the contestants have to prepare a mini-meal in about 45 minutes. 
 Since her promotion two years ago Ms. Arquines has also developed an expertise in lining up guest judges, usually well-known chefs who would come to the set for one or two days, sample meals made by the aspiring-chef contestants and help the regular judges, Tom Colicchio and Gail Simmons, decide who got sent home.
 When Magical Elves decided to produce a version of ''Top Chef'' featuring famous chefs, it fell to Ms. Arquines to draw on her list of culinary contacts for potential contestants. Last fall, even as the fifth season of ''Top Chef'' was just beginning to be televised, Ms. Arquines started working on the next cycle, contacting chefs and their handlers about the possibility of the new masters-level show.
 The fruits of her labors can now be seen on Wednesday nights on Bravo, where this week the sixth group of four chefs will face off for a spot in the finals. 
 Because she is still a midlevel producer, she is not guaranteed full-time work after each season concludes. After ''Top Chef 5'' finished taping last summer, ''there was a good month and a half I had of downtime, where I was looking for a job,'' she said. ''It was the first time since I've been here that I had to file for unemployment.''
 She still pays for her own health insurance and does not have benefits like a company-sponsored 401(k). She shares an apartment -- a two-bedroom on the west side of Los Angeles -- with a roommate. 
 Unlike a television drama or comedy that promises steady five-day weeks for roughly 40 weeks a year, reality programs often shoot seven days a week to take maximum advantage of contestants' time and to keep costs down. And if a show is shooting out of town, the crew has to go with it, making for an itinerant lifestyle. 
 ''Top Chef Masters'' proved to be a boon, then, because it was set in Los Angeles. On a cool, clear morning in February the guest judges arrived at a soundstage near downtown for that day's quickfire challenge, which Ms. Arquines was helping to produce. (Because the episode being shot that day will not be shown until next month, the exact task, the guest judges and the five chefs who remained in the competition will not be revealed here.) 
 In the seven hours between her arrival on the set and the chefs' completion of the day's cooking competition, Ms. Arquines bustled around making sure everything was going smoothly. She met with the judges, chatted with the chefs and watched from behind the cameras as the host, Kelly Choi, taped a segment with the guest judges. On her way to the control room Ms. Arquines checked on the pantry, lined with products from Glad, Stella Artois and other sponsors, which sat next to boxes of pasta and bags of flour whose labels had been taped over because they were not paying sponsors. After the season's competition finished taping a couple of weeks later, editors would begin boiling down that day's hours of tape to roughly 12 minutes of a 46-minute episode.
 Her long-term goal is to develop her own program, to follow in the footsteps of reality producers whose names are as recognizable as their shows, like Mark Burnett of ''Survivor'' or Ben Silverman, now co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, who got his start with reality shows like ''The Restaurant'' and ''The Biggest Loser.'' 
 Then there is Cris Abrego, who cut his teeth as a glorified gofer on the set of the MTV show ''The Real World'' and went on to produce ''Flavor of Love,'' ''The Surreal Life'' and ''Rock of Love.''
 Hired as a tape logger -- his job was to watch all the footage and note the exact spot where each action happens or line is spoken -- Mr. Abrego worked his way around the set, doing ''almost literally every job there is to do,'' he said. What he learned is that while scripted television is a writer's medium, reality is a producer's. 
 ''There are still a lot of people who turn up their noses at unscripted television,'' he said, though skeptics might be fewer since Mr. Abrego and his partner, Mark Cronin, sold their company, 51 Minds Entertainment, to the reality giant Endemol for more than $200 million last year. 
 Hoping to follow a similar path Ms. Arquines has been developing an idea for a reality show in partnership with Shauna Minoprio, the executive producer of ''Top Chef Masters.'' The idea is food-related, the two said, although they declined to offer details because they have been pitching it to networks.
 Whether they will find takers is uncertain, in part because even the reality business is going through some changes. According to Mr. Cutforth and Ms. Lipsitz of Magical Elves, cable channels have become more conservative in the last year, given the economic downturn. ''They want to know who will be running a new show rather than being willing simply to bank on a new concept,'' Mr. Cutforth said. 
 In the meantime Ms. Arquines has plenty more to learn, including the rigors of postproduction, where the stories that emerge in each episode are combined with an overall story arc that develops over the entire season. Even in so-called unscripted television, Ms. Lipsitz said, ''you have to learn how to tell stories.'' 
 Ms. Arquines says she is ready: ''I'm game for anything.''

HEADLINE: Lifelines for Those 'Underwater'

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS property values in the New York area slide, more borrowers are finding themselves ''underwater,'' which means they owe more than their homes are worth. 
 Now the government is throwing a lifeline to such homeowners, along with similar borrowers nationwide.
 This month, the Federal Housing Finance Agency unveiled a new version of its Home Affordable Refinance Program, whereby lenders can offer new mortgages to borrowers even if their home's value exceeds the mortgage amount by as much as 25 percent -- as long as the borrower hasn't missed loan payments in the past year. 
 Under the initial plan announced in February, lenders could refinance a loan only if the borrower's mortgage was no more than 5 percent greater than the home's value. With property values in many areas down sharply from their peak levels, 5 percent wasn't enough to help many borrowers.
 So why help borrowers who have not missed a payment? 
 Without a way to refinance into better loans, some of these borrowers could become part of the next wave of foreclosures. 
 Many are stuck with high interest rates or with rates that could adjust upward in the coming years. To make matters worse, lenders and mortgage insurers have tightened underwriting rules, typically requiring borrowers to have at least 15 percent equity in a home. 
 There is some fine print in this refinancing program. Borrowers must hold a loan that was purchased by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, the government-controlled companies that buy most mortgages. To determine whether you have a Fannie or Freddie loan, go to the ''loan lookup'' tab on the Web site MakingHomeAffordable.gov. 
 Most fixed-rate mortgages under $417,000 were financed through Fannie or Freddie, as were some more recent loans of up to $729,750 in higher-cost areas like Manhattan.
 Also, borrowers who are 25 percent underwater cannot apply for new loans for at least a few weeks, depending on how quickly lenders prepare their systems to accept these new applications. October is probably the earliest these loans will close.
 If you qualify, your interest rate will very likely be slightly higher than the market's best loan rates, especially if you refinance with someone other than your current servicer. And if you are 5 to 25 percent underwater with a Fannie Mae loan, you must refinance with your current servicer to qualify. 
 (A servicer is different from a mortgage originator. You might, say, have taken out a mortgage from Countrywide. That loan was probably acquired by Fannie Mae, which then resold it, in a package of mortgages, to an investor. That lender may have hired a bank like Chase to collect payments, or ''service'' the loan.)
 When borrowers seek to refinance through a new lender on loans where the borrower is merely 5 percent underwater, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will issue surcharges that can add four-tenths of a percentage point on the interest rate, or can be paid in the form of points.
 Tom Kelly, a spokesman with JPMorgan Chase, said that his bank had not yet determined its charges for applicants whose loans it services, specifically those whose loans are 25 percent greater than a home's value. 
 ALTHOUGH these rates may be higher than those paid by so-called prime borrowers, they are a boon for those who are underwater and who would otherwise have no choice but to keep their loan and hope property values rebound, or walk away from their investment.
 Michael Moskowitz, the president of Equity Now, a lender based in Manhattan, says he believes that New York-area borrowers will benefit from the recent changes.
 The area, he said, is among the last in the nation to experience significant drops in real estate values. 
 ''But because of the unemployment on Wall Street, that will continue,'' Mr. Moskowitz said. ''So this program will have a very meaningful effect here.''

HEADLINE: Will G.M.'s Story Have a Hero?

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
SATURDAY, May 30, offered the kind of warm, sunny afternoon that rain-soaked New Yorkers had longed for all spring. In the theater district, crowds were gathering to catch a glimpse of Barack and Michelle Obama, who were planning to attend a Broadway show so the president could fulfill his campaign promise to his wife of a date night in Manhattan.
 Fourteen blocks north, high up in a boardroom at 767 Fifth Avenue, Fritz Henderson was about to make the toughest decision of his life, and one that Mr. Obama and his advisers had seemingly foisted upon him. 
 As the clock ticked toward 6 p.m., Mr. Henderson told directors of General Motors that management believed the struggling auto company's only path was into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
 ''I'd been at G.M. 25 years, I'd been the C.E.O. 60 days, and here I was, recommending that G.M. file for bankruptcy,'' Mr. Henderson said in an interview last week. 
 Mr. Henderson, Mr. Obama and the scores of lawyers, financial experts and restructuring advisers whose careers were at stake were guiding G.M. along a financial, political and emotional tightrope a few months ago, and their decisions shaped what G.M. has become today. And it is not yet clear whether the risks they took, and the government's enormous investment, will pay off. 
 A successful G.M. turnaround could rank as one of the greatest restructuring efforts in business history, said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania.
 But if G.M.'s bureaucratic culture and consumers' disinterest continue to plague the company, the long days, intense negotiations and legal maneuvering -- not to mention tens of billions in taxpayer money -- will have been for naught. ''The stakes are about as big as they've ever been for a company's remake,'' Professor Useem said.
 The responsibility for keeping G.M. on track falls to its new board, led by the former AT&T chief Edward Whitacre Jr. The new directors include executives and financial advisers schooled in aviation, transportation and telecommunications. 
 Mr. Henderson, meanwhile, shook up G.M.'s senior ranks last week. As a flock of longtime executives announced their retirements, a single executive committee was named to run the entire company, replacing various regional fiefs.
 There is little time to waste. In just the few short weeks since G.M. emerged from bankruptcy on July 10, Washington's stance toward the industry has shifted. 
 Steven Rattner, who led the president's automotive task force at the Treasury Department, left his post Friday, as New York State and the Securities and Exchange Commission step up an investigation into pension fund management involving his investment firm.
 Hundreds of car dealers, angry at plans to eliminate their franchises, have started a lobbying charge on Capitol Hill for legislation aimed at reversing those decisions -- a step that both G.M. and Chrysler say could undermine their restructurings.
 Mr. Obama, meanwhile, has moved on to his next sticky political challenge -- promoting his health care package -- after emphasizing that Detroit has received all the federal aid he is willing to grant.
 ''We have been as clear as we could possibly be that we have zero intention of providing any more money to either of these companies,'' said Brian Deese, a special assistant to the president for economic policy who was the White House's point person on the auto industry bailout.
 While Mr. Obama may now be tightening the federal purse strings, he made a fundamental decision, even before taking office, that his administration would build on the lifeline extended by George W. Bush at the end of his presidency to assure that G.M. and Chrysler remained in business.
 The White House's rescue plan evolved from simply providing billions more and letting the companies plot their fate to taking the automakers by the hand and escorting them through bankruptcy court. 
 That decision, which some analysts liken to Japanese industrial policy, marked a rare time that an American president waded directly into the automobile industry's affairs. It has generated a heated debate across the country that is likely to continue for years in classrooms, boardrooms and the halls of Congress.
 Why, after all, should the automakers receive the equivalent of a Technicolor dreamcoat, giving them favorite-son status, when other industries, like airlines and retailers, also have suffered from the national recession? 
 And, having received federal aid, should the carmakers be required to build greener automobiles, as some environmental activists have urged, in keeping with Mr. Obama's focus on climate change?
 Mr. Obama dealt with the first point on March 30. ''We cannot and must not, and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish,'' he said. ''This industry is like no other -- it's an emblem of the American spirit, a once and future symbol of America's success.''
 Mr. Deese, meanwhile, said these broader issues were not the objective. ''The question we were focused on was not what larger policy objectives we should be trying to achieve,'' he said, but ''what is a commercially viable restructuring that will allow them to succeed in a way that they have not in the past?''
 TO many, G.M.'s decision to file for Chapter 11 was the logical result of a saga that began last November, when Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, joined other auto industry leaders in seeking government aid.
 ''That was the point where you realized they had no shot at making it on their own, absolutely no shot,'' said Ray Wert III, editor in chief of Jalopnik, a Web site for car enthusiasts. ''They went from fighting for market share to fighting for their lives.''
 Memories of the scolding that Detroit received from members of Congress over the use of private jets were still fresh in February, when the administration began assembling the group that would see G.M. and Chrysler into their new worlds.
 Along with Mr. Deese, among the first to join the effort were Mr. Rattner and Ron Bloom, a restructuring expert who had advised unions representing steelworkers and pilots.
 Faced with the prospect of spending tens of billions to restructure the companies -- some experts said G.M. alone might require $70 billion to $100 billion to fix -- Mr. Obama told his automotive task force to approach the matter with a commercial mind-set, not a political one, according to several members of the group. As it turned out, the group acted like a private equity firm, demanding quick answers and making fast decisions, rather than getting bogged down in government bureaucracy.
 To date, the G.M. case has cost roughly $50 billion, while Chrysler has received about $15.5 billion.
 ''We tried to ask ourselves what we would do if this was our money,'' said Mr. Bloom, who has replaced Mr. Rattner as head of the task force. ''The president made the fundamental decision to do it, but the direction was also, 'Don't spend more than you need to spend.' ''
 In Detroit, Mr. Wagoner repeatedly said a bankruptcy could be devastating for G.M. because consumers would not buy vehicles from a bankrupt company -- a fear echoed by Michigan's governor, Jennifer M. Granholm, an adviser to the president.
 They were not alone. ''We were all afraid of bankruptcy,'' Mr. Rattner said. ''There is virtually no precedent for a company making consumer durable goods going into bankruptcy and surviving.''
 He added: ''We weren't sure whether people would be willing to buy cars from a bankrupt company. If they had stopped buying cars, the cash hemorrhage would have been enormous.''
 Yet, early on, the auto panel and its advisers knew that the best hope for keeping G.M. in business was most likely the courts. 
 ''We came to believe, within a short time of arriving, that inside of old G.M. was what we used to call 'shiny new G.M.,' '' Mr. Bloom said. ''We also knew that finding it and pulling it out would require a huge amount of work.''
 Even before the task force was created, the Treasury Department hired Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a New York law firm, to advise the government.
 In mid-February, ''we were given to consider a hypothetical: how could you get a car company through bankruptcy in the shortest amount of time?'' recalled John Rapisardi, the co-head of Cadwalader's restructuring practice.
 For Mr. Rapisardi, the assignment came a few weeks before he was headed to Delray Beach, Fla., over Presidents' Day weekend to visit his mother. Because she didn't have a fax machine, he persuaded a clerk at a local supermarket to let him use the store's to receive hundreds of sheets of paper from Washington. 
 After about a week of strategizing, Mr. Rapisardi and Todd Snyder of Rothschild, an investment banking firm also advising the task force, came up with the bankruptcy framework eventually used by Chrysler and G.M. 
 Each would seek bankruptcy protection; then a sale of the best assets would be performed under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to create a new company. These new entities would emerge from bankruptcy and go back into business -- G.M. on its own, Chrysler as part of Fiat.
 Despite seeing a Section 363 sale as a likely course of action, the government and the companies initially tried to avoid it. Chrysler and G.M. -- in what would prove to be their last chances to control their own fates -- were allowed to submit restructuring plans to the White House on Feb. 17.
 Those plans, Mr. Rattner said, fell far short of what was needed to overhaul the companies. He believed that G.M., especially, had made assumptions about auto sales and its ability to handle its liabilities that were at odds with the task force's conclusions.
 It was not only the flawed revitalization plan. Mr. Wagoner also had presided over a company that veered close to running out of money, despite receiving nearly $20 billion from the Bush and Obama administrations since late 2008.
 For more than three years, Detroit had regularly swirled with rumors that Mr. Wagoner was in jeopardy. G.M. always denied it. As late as March 20, Mr. Wagoner insisted that he was in his job to stay.
 But in his discussions with the Treasury under both presidents, Mr. Wagoner made clear that he was willing to step aside if necessary, according to participants in those meetings. On March 29, before a meeting with the task force, Mr. Rattner asked to see him privately and told him he would have to go. 
 Despite his offer, Mr. Wagoner appeared surprised by his ouster, which in turn surprised members of the task force. So did the heated reaction several days later in Detroit, when Mr. Wagoner's departure came to light -- touching off fears within the industry that General Motors would morph into Government Motors.
 In truth, the task force had no interest in running G.M. But the only available alternative to Mr. Wagoner was Mr. Henderson, a lifelong G.M. employee, and he did not initially impress some task force members, according to administration officials involved in the discussions. 
 When asked at an early meeting to discuss G.M.'s culture, he gave what some members of the task force described as a long, meandering answer, concluding: ''I've been here 25 years. This is the only culture I know.'' However, Mr. Henderson quickly added that he was determined to change it.
 The panel considered making him an interim chief executive, but decided that G.M. employees, rattled by the financial crisis and the departure of their boss, could not handle more uncertainty. 
 Likewise, the task force sought to demonstrate that it did not plan to run G.M., but to fix it. To prove that this was possible, the panel had to start with Chrysler.
 CHRYSLER'S repackaging in the courts took 36 days and was a key to making G.M.'s own trip, which lasted 40 days, an easy one, Mr. Bloom said. The showdown between the government and Chrysler's financiers over the terms of its restructuring was also pivotal, Mr. Bloom noted. 
 ''They all thought government would blink. They all thought we wouldn't have the chutzpah,'' he said. ''That was the breakthrough on Chrysler. People understood Uncle Sam wasn't going to be Uncle Sucker.'' 
 But it was harder for many to understand the role played by the United Automobile Workers union in the G.M. rescue. Mr. Obama had gone out of his way in his March 30 speech to praise workers and blast debt holders, who he implied had forced Chrysler into Chapter 11.
 To the union, one of the crucial issues was the fate of a health care fund expanded during contract talks in 2007 to shoulder the automakers' enormous burden for retiree medical benefits.
 The contracts called for the carmakers to invest cash and stock in the funds, which in turn would make them the automakers' biggest shareholders. But the cash the union was owed had run short, especially at G.M., and it was clear that the U.A.W. would have to make concessions as part of any deal to save the company.
 It had already reached an agreement at Chrysler, giving the fund a 55 percent stake in the company, when talks with G.M. accelerated in May. Ron Gettelfinger, the union's president, argued that because G.M. had more retirees than Chrysler, its fund required more cash. 
 On May 19, in talks at Cadwalader's Washington offices, the task force proposed giving the union a 16.5 percent stake in G.M., as well as a $2.5 billion note and $6 billion in preferred stock.
 Mr. Gettelfinger, saying his members would not accept the deal, made a counterproposal: 20 percent, $6.5 billion in preferred stock and the $2.5 billion note. Then he left the bargaining table. 
 The next morning, as he was packing to leave for Detroit, he received a call from Mr. Bloom. The government was willing to offer $6.5 billion in stock and a 17.5 percent stake, along with warrants that could raise the stake to 20 percent in the future.
 Asking for time to think about it, Mr. Gettelfinger walked the Washington streets for two hours, according to a person close to the discussions. When he returned, he acquiesced, and G.M. workers later accepted the deal.
 The U.A.W. declined to comment for this article. But Mr. Bloom praised the group. ''The U.A.W. was an indispensable part of the puzzle,'' he said. ''We needed to make peace with the U.A.W. If you didn't have a deal with labor, you didn't have a deal.''
 For years, a G.M. bankruptcy seemed daunting.
 ''The case would last my lifetime, my son's lifetime, my grandson's lifetime and maybe my great-grandson's lifetime,'' Stephen P. Yokich, the late president of the U.A.W., said in a 1995 interview, talking about an earlier G.M. crisis.
 Instead, the Section 363 sale that created what is now officially the General Motors Company went on for little longer than the Tour de France, stunning legal experts and surprising members of the task force, who initially expected the case to take 60 to 90 days. (The remains of G.M., now called the Motors Liquidation Company, will take years to unwind, however.)
 ''It was remarkable how much we accomplished in such a short period,'' Mr. Henderson said. 
 Making the case even more unusual was that the government provided both bankruptcy funding and the financing that allowed the companies to emerge. 
 Some experts say the government's role cowed creditors, who might have tied up both cases much longer. Mr. Rattner disagreed.
 ''The reason this worked was not because we were the government,'' he said. ''The reason this worked was because we were the lender and investor of last resort to two companies that judges recognized were melting ice cubes.''
 Mr. Rattner, who declined to discuss his company's legal situation, said he was leaving the task force confident that his work was done.
 Indeed, Chrysler's fate is now in Fiat's hands. And G.M. is just embarking on a long and uncertain journey, albeit with protections that few companies have ever enjoyed.
 Though the car market remains dismal, the steep decline in auto sales that Mr. Wagoner and Governor Granholm warned would accompany a bankruptcy did not occur, in part because of a government program to back the warranties on G.M. cars bought during its bankruptcy. (The program ended last week.)
 ''We had to foam the runway,'' Mr. Rattner said, referring to the tactic used at airports when crippled planes are about to land. 
 G.M.'s liabilities have been reduced so that it can break even in an overall market of just 10 million cars a year, roughly the current sales level, compared with the market of 16 million to 17 million it needed before its bankruptcy.
 STILL, no one can force consumers to want G.M.'s products, Mr. Wert said, and there is little indication that the overall industry will soon rebound from its slump. Like Mr. Rattner, Mr. Wert is also concerned that G.M.'s deliberate and nonconfrontational corporate culture could stymie the changes that Mr. Henderson must pursue. 
 ''Their culture is built to react like it's 20 or 30 years ago'' when G.M. controlled more than a third of the American car market ''versus the G.M. of now and in the future -- G.M. with a smaller market share, G.M. that's the underdog,'' Mr. Wert said.
 The situation is certainly not what Alfred P. Sloan Jr., whose portrait hangs near the New York boardroom where G.M.'s directors met in June, would have envisioned for the company. Mr. Sloan led the company from 1923 to 1946, and his management tenets still infuse it. 
 Mr. Henderson, who invoked his renowned predecessor on the day G.M. sought bankruptcy protection, said Mr. Sloan would never have seen a quick bankruptcy as a victory. ''He'd say: 'You have a second chance at life. Make sure you make it pay.' ''

HEADLINE: Forget Who Pays, It's Who Sets Costs

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 -- Every fight over health care reform is different, and every fight over health care reform is the same.
 In 1929, Michael Shadid, a doctor in western Oklahoma, proposed an idea for making medical care affordable to farmers. Rather than pay piecemeal for treatments, farmers would each contribute $50 a year to a cooperative. Dr. Shadid and his colleagues would pay their own salaries and expenses with the aggregate sum, and no farmer's annual bill for family medical care would exceed $50.
 Horrified by the plan, other Oklahoma doctors tried to revoke Dr. Shadid's license. The conflict was soon duplicated across the country; cooperatives sprang up, and the American Medical Association tried to beat them back. The A.M.A.'s members, as the historian Paul Starr has written, felt threatened because the cooperatives ''subjected doctors' incomes and working conditions to direct control by their clients.''
 The issue was clear: Who controls the doctor-patient relationship? That question has been at the core of every big subsequent battle over health care. Should doctors determine not only their patients' treatment but also their own pay, through the fee-for-service system that has survived since the 1920s? Or should patients have more power in the relationship? And who could claim to act on patients' behalf, monitoring treatments and bargaining with doctors? 
 A succession of presidents -- from Harry S. Truman to Richard M. Nixon to Bill Clinton -- volunteered the government for the role of patients' advocate, and their grand efforts all failed. Now it is President Obama's turn to try to remake America's medical system. 
 Last week's back and forth, when Congressional Democrats squabbled and Mr. Obama took his case to the public, highlighted how difficult his task will be. Reform of health care has the potential to threaten profits and incomes that make up one-sixth of the economy. More daunting, perhaps, Americans seem to have great trust in their doctors -- more, certainly, than they trust the government on medical matters. 
 More than three in four Americans are ''very satisfied'' or ''somewhat satisfied'' with their own care, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. But a substantial majority also say that the health care system needs fundamental change and that rising costs are a serious threat to the economy -- a view that economists strongly share. 
 Thus the political challenge facing any effort at an overhaul: Americans say they want change, but they also want to preserve their own status quo. 
 The disconnect can be explained partly by the peculiar economics of health care. Because third parties -- the government or a private insurer -- typically pay the bill, many people miss the fact that the money originally comes from them. They see the benefits of medical care without seeing the costs.
 But trust in doctors is a factor as well. Even when doctors order costly treatments with serious side effects and little evidence of their being effective, as studies find is common, patients are loath to question the decision. Instead of blaming such treatments for the rising cost of medicine, many people are inclined to blame forces that health economists say are far less important, like greedy insurance companies or onerous malpractice laws.
 Mr. Obama is well aware of the public perception. This is why he directs his criticism not at doctors but at insurers and drug companies. In his news conference on Wednesday night, he advocated creating a government panel with the power to begin moving Medicare away from its fee-for-service model and emphasize outcomes instead. But he described it in doctor-friendly terms -- as ''an independent group of doctors and medical experts who are empowered to eliminate waste and inefficiency.''
 His rhetorical choices highlight one of the least discussed but most important conflicts in the current health care debate. The fight isn't just a matter of Democrats vs. Republicans, Blue Dogs vs. liberals or patients vs. insurers. It is also doctors vs. doctors.
 That's the same as in Oklahoma in 1929. And what has happened to Dr. Shadid's model? It has survived. He built a team of doctors who collaborated closely and were not paid based on how many procedures they performed. Today, this description fits the Mayo Clinic and the Cleveland Clinic (which Mr. Obama visited on Thursday), as well as less-known groups around the country. 
 Medicare data shows that these groups generally provide less expensive care and appear to deliver better results. Armed with this data, the doctors who run the groups have been lobbying Congress to make their model a bigger part of health reform. Two weeks ago, 13 such groups released a letter saying that recent versions of proposed legislation did not control costs enough.
 Their goal is to weaken the fee-for-service system. In its place, doctors might receive a lump-sum payment to treat a patient with a certain condition, based on average costs elsewhere and on what scientific evidence had found to be effective. Hospitals with especially good outcomes might earn bonuses.
 Advocates say such a system could ultimately give doctors more control. Rather than having to organize their schedules around the tests and procedures that insurers agree to reimburse, doctors could opt for the treatments they deem most effective. ''It's a lot more accountability, which is why it's scary for physicians,'' said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former head of Medicare under George W. Bush. ''But in some ways it's also more autonomy.''
 On Tuesday, doctors and hospital executives from 10 cities with below-average cost growth gathered in Washington for a conference called, ''How Do They Do That?'' They were a diverse lot, only some of whom hailed from providers resembling the Mayo Clinic. While crediting a range of factors for their success, they generally agreed about what ails American medicine. 
 When Dr. McClellan, who helped organize the conference, asked how many people thought the fee-for-service system was ''archaic and fundamentally at odds'' with good practice, most hands shot up. In effect, they were siding with Dr. Shadid and against a system that provides incentives for more and more care, regardless of its benefit. 
 ''There are no consequences right now to over-utilization,'' Dr. Anthony F. Oliva, chief medical officer of the Guthrie Healthcare System, in northeast Pennsylvania, said later. ''If you don't have consequences, you won't change the culture. If you don't have consequences, the people that are killing themselves to control cost are going to say, 'Why am I doing this?' ''
 It is a message, of course, that a doctor can deliver more easily than anyone else.

HEADLINE: New Biden Criticism Surprises Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Just weeks after a summit meeting intended to show a thawing in relations between the United States and Russia, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made blistering references to Russia's failing economy, loss of face and a leadership that is ''clinging to something in the past,'' in an interview published on Saturday. 
 Speaking on the heels of his trip to Georgia and Ukraine, Mr. Biden said flatly that the Obama administration would make no deals and accept no compromises with the Kremlin in exchange for better relations. 
 Russia itself, he said, should find it in its own interest to repair relations. 
 The Kremlin immediately responded to the comments, made in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, with a demand for a clarification of the administration's intentions toward Russia, saying essentially that it was receiving a mixed message so soon after President Obama had visited Moscow for the summit meeting. 
 Calling the criticism ''perplexing'' in light of the diplomatic overtures initiated by the United States and described as ''pressing the reset button,'' the chief foreign policy adviser to President Dmitri A. Medvedev told the Interfax news agency, ''The question is: who is shaping the U.S. foreign policy, the president or respectable members of his team?'' 
 The adviser, Sergei Prikhodko, said the atmosphere between the countries had improved since Mr. Obama's visit early this month. 
 ''If some members of Obama's team and government do not like this atmosphere, why don't they say so?'' Interfax reported him as saying. ''If they disagree with the course of their president, we just need to know this.'' 
 In the interview, Mr. Biden set aside diplomatic finesse and offered an unflinching analysis of the state of affairs in Russia. 
 With falling oil prices, a corruption-ridden banking system and failing courts, Russia has seen the steepest swing from growth to recession of any major economy in the financial crisis. 
 Mr. Biden has a reputation for speaking volubly, and sometimes going beyond official policy. It was not immediately clear if he was sending an officially sanctioned message.
 The White House did not back away from the vice president's remarks on Saturday, but attempted to smooth over the frayed relations with Russia. 
 ''The president and vice president believe Russia will work with us not out of weakness but out of national interest,'' Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said in a statement on Saturday night.
 ''The president said in Moscow that the United States seeks a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia -- one that will be an even more effective partner in meeting common challenges, including reducing nuclear arsenals, securing vulnerable nuclear materials, contending with nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran, defeating violent extremism and advancing global security and economic growth,'' Mr. Gibbs said.
 Mr. Biden spoke after visits to Ukraine and Georgia intended to reassure those countries that American support for their independence would not be weakened by the administration's efforts to improve ties with Russia. 
 ''The reality is the Russians are where they are,'' Mr. Biden told The Wall Street Journal, according to excerpts posted on the newspaper's Web site. ''They have a shrinking population base, they have a withering economy, they have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years, they're in a situation where the world is changing before them and they're clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable.''
 Mr. Biden rejected recent Russian assertions of a restored sphere of privileged interests in the former Soviet Union, made after the war in Georgia. 
 In the most frank discussion yet on Russian expectations of the new diplomatic exchanges, Mr. Biden said the Russians anticipated that the United States would enter into diplomatic bargaining. 
 Mr. Biden said: ''They think we'll be duplicitous and say, 'Yeah, O.K., we got it. We'll make a deal with you on something else we need in return.' ''
 He referred to the absence of strong American criticism of Russian military operations against separatists in the republic of Chechnya. ''Some argued the last administration made a deal on Chechnya in return for no response on Iraq,'' he said. ''We're not going to do that. It's not necessary to do that.''
 The Russian retort had its own reference to the previous administration, albeit an oblique one. 
 After noting the ambiguity of who was shaping policy for the administration, the president or his deputy, Mr. Prikhodko said, ''We have been there already.''

HEADLINE: Cracking Down, Antitrust Chief Hits Resistance

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's top antitrust official and some senior Democratic lawmakers are preparing to rein in a host of major industries, including airline and railroad giants, moving so aggressively that they are finding some resistance from officials within the administration.
 The official, Christine A. Varney, the antitrust chief at the Justice Department, has begun examining complaints by the phone companies Verizon and AT&T that their rivals -- major cable operators like Cablevision and Cox Communications -- improperly prevent them from buying sports shows and other programs that the cable companies produce, industry lawyers said. 
 At the request of some lawmakers, notably Senator Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, Ms. Varney is examining whether small agricultural operations are being hampered unfairly by large food processors, particularly in the milk industry, congressional aides said. 
 Ms. Varney has also challenged agreements that the Federal Trade Commission and consumer groups say discourage pharmaceutical companies from marketing more generic drugs. And she is examining a settlement between Google and book publishers and authors to make more books available online. 
 The more aggressive antitrust policy was described in interviews with officials at the White House, the Justice Department, other agencies and Congress. It is a major policy reversal from the Bush administration, which did not prosecute cases in which some dominant companies engaged in potentially anticompetitive behavior, often because those officials maintained such behavior was not harmful to consumers. 
 Democrats have spent years trying to gain the support of businesses, and the policy changes under way may have long-term political implications for their party. Some companies would like to see more aggressive antitrust enforcement against their rivals, while others could be hurt by it. 
 In some cases, though, the new approach is being opposed by administration officials. Some fear that the crackdown is coming at a bad time, as corporate America reels from the recession. Other officials embrace the Bush administration's view that larger companies and industry alliances can provide consumer benefits by making their businesses more efficient. 
 One clash played out recently when the Transportation Department, rejecting many of Ms. Varney's recommendations, approved an antitrust immunity request involving a global alliance of nine airlines; Continental Airlines wanted to join the alliance to share routes, marketing and revenue. 
 The antitrust division argued the immunity was unnecessary for approving the newly reconstituted alliance and that it could lead to rates rising from 6 to 15 percent for many routes, according to public filings. The Transportation Department rejected that analysis for most of the routes and instead endorsed a policy popular during the Bush administration that favored such industry agreements out of a desire for efficiency.
 The disagreement became so heated that the president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, was called in to mediate. 
 Administration officials said that Mr. Summers did not take sides in the dispute but urged the two agencies to reach an agreement as they sought to balance the interests of the industry against those of consumers. 
 In a second area, senior Democrats are proposing legislation to eliminate an exemption from antitrust law for commercial railroad companies. It would give the antitrust division the authority to scrutinize the railroads for anticompetitive practices. 
 The proposal, by Senator Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin, who heads the antitrust subcommittee, and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, has been sought by a coalition of railroad shippers. But so far the administration has not taken a position on the measure. 
 In a third area, a White House effort to overhaul financial regulation, officials weighed but rejected a significant antitrust role as a way to reduce the size of large companies considered too big to be allowed to fail.
 ''The struggles between the expert agencies and the Justice Department get to the heart and soul of exactly what the competition policy of the Obama administration will be,'' said Mark Cooper, an antitrust expert and director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. 
 He added: ''Now you have an antitrust division that cares about competition, and it is running up against the expert agencies that haven't changed their attitudes yet.''
 Ms. Varney returned to government after working as a partner at Hogan and Hartson, a Washington law firm. During the Clinton administration she served in the White House as Cabinet secretary and a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission.
 The antitrust division under Ms. Varney scrapped the Bush administration's monopoly guidelines, which had sharply limited the government's ability to prosecute large corporations that used their market dominance to elbow out competitors. 
 Now the division has opened inquiries in the financial services and wireless phone industries. The division's wireless inquiry is looking at, among other things, whether it is legal for phone makers to offer a particular model, like the iPhone or the Palm Pre, exclusively to one phone carrier. It is examining the sharp increase in text-messaging rates at several phone companies. And it is scrutinizing obstacles imposed by the phone companies on low-price rivals like Skype.
 Though Ms. Varney has the backing and encouragement of senior Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate, some agencies have been less open to the change in policy. 
 In the case of the airline alliance, the Justice Department and consumer groups had maintained that it was potentially harmful to customers to grant such immunity and that it would not promote the opening of new markets because the flights involved routes to countries that had already approved ''open skies'' agreements. But Transportation officials sided with the airlines for many of the routes and criticized the department's antitrust analysis. 
 In its July 10 order, the Transportation Department criticized the approach of the Department of Justice: ''Were we to suddenly change our antitrust immunity and public interest approach, as D.O.J. suggests, the credibility of the U.S. government with its international aviation partners would be significantly compromised and our ability not only to reach new Open-Skies agreements but also to maintain those agreements that we have already achieved would be undermined.'' 
 Senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, concerned that the order gave short shrift to rigorous antitrust analysis, are preparing to hold a hearing soon. A pending major expansion of a different airline alliance, involving American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA, is expected to provoke further disagreement between the agencies. 
 Justice Department officials have also been urged by major commercial shippers to examine the potentially anticompetitive practices of the highly concentrated commercial railroad industry. But the department's authority to examine that industry is curtailed by a law that gives such authority to another agency affiliated with the Transportation Department. That agency, the Surface Transportation Board, has traditionally been sympathetic to industry concerns.

HEADLINE: The Losers Hang On

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: Jalozai Camp, Pakistan 

 BODY:
 After spending a week traveling the frontline of the ''war on terrorism'' -- from the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Ronald Reagan in the seas off Iran, to northern Iraq, to Afghanistan and into northwest Pakistan -- I can comfortably report the following: The bad guys are losing. 
 Yes, the dominos you see falling in the Muslim world today are the extremist Islamist groups and governments. They have failed to persuade people by either their arguments or their performances in power that their puritanical versions of Islam are the answer. Having lost the argument, though, the radicals still hang on thanks to gun barrels and oil barrels -- and they can for a while. 
 Because, while the radicals have failed miserably, our allies -- the pro-Americans, the Muslim modernists, the Arab moderates -- have not really filled the void with reform and good government of their own. They are winning by default. More on that later.
 For now, though, it is obvious that everywhere they have won or seized power, the Islamists -- in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Algeria, Lebanon or Gaza -- have overplayed their hands, dragged their societies into useless wars or engaged in nihilistic violence that today is producing a broad backlash from mainstream Muslims. 
 Think of this: In the late-1970s, two leaders made historic trips -- President Anwar Sadat flew from Egypt to Israel and Ayatollah Khomeini flew from Paris to Tehran. For the last 30 years, politics in the Middle East and the Muslim world has, in many ways, been a struggle between their competing visions. 
 Sadat argued that the future should bury the past and that Arabs and Muslims should build their future based on peace with Israel, integration with the West and embracing modernity. Khomeini argued that the past should bury the future and that Persians and Muslims should build their future on hostility to Israel, isolation from the West and subordinating modernity to a puritanical Islam.
 In 2009, the struggle between those two trends tipped toward the Sadatists. The fact that Iran's ruling theocrats had to steal their election to stay in power and forcibly suppress dissent by millions of Iranians -- according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Iran has surpassed China as the world's leading jailer of journalists, with 41 now behind bars -- is the most visible sign of this. The Taliban's burning down of secular schools that compete with its mosques, and its peddling of heroin to raise cash, are also not exactly signs of intellectual triumph.
 The same day that President Obama spoke to the Muslim world from Cairo University, Osama bin Laden released a long statement on Islamic Web sites and on Al Jazeera. As the Egyptian Middle East expert Mamoun Fandy noted: ''Obama beat Osama hands down. Ask anyone about the content of Obama's speech and they will tell you. Ask them what Osama said and most people will say, 'Did he give a speech?' ''
 In Iraq's elections last January, nationalist and moderate Muslim parties defeated the sectarian, radical religious parties, while in Lebanon, a pro-Western coalition defeated one led by Hezbollah. 
 Here in Pakistan, the backlash against the Taliban has been building among the rising middle class. It started in March when a mobile-phone video of a teenage girl being held down and beaten outside her home by a Taliban commander in Pakistan's Swat Valley spread virally across this country. In May, the Pakistani Army began an offensive against Taliban militants who had taken control of key towns in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), and appeared to be moving toward the capital, Islamabad.
 I followed Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he visited a vast, choking-hot and dust-covered refugee tent camp in Jalozai, where some 116,000 refugees have fled the NWFP, as the Pakistani Army moved into their hometowns to smash the Taliban in a popular operation. 
 ''People are totally against them, but the Taliban don't care,'' a Pakistani teacher, Abdul Jalil, 41, told me while taking a break from teaching the Urdu alphabet to young boys in a sweltering tent. ''They are very cruel. They chopped people's heads off.'' 
 To the extent that the radical Islamists have any energy today, it comes not from the power of their ideas or examples of good governance, but by stoking sectarian feuds. In Afghanistan, the Taliban play on Pashtun nationalist grievances, and in Iraq, the Sunni jihadists draw energy from killing Shiites. 
 The only way to really dry up their support, though, is for the Arab and Muslim modernists to actually implement better ideas by producing less corrupt and more consensual governance, with better schools, more economic opportunities and a vision of Islam that is perceived as authentic yet embracing of modernity. That is where ''our'' allies in Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan have so consistently failed. Until that happens, the Islamist radicals will be bankrupt, but not out of business.

HEADLINE: Obama Defends Proposed Health Office

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said Saturday that a new agency proposed by President Obama as a way to cut health costs might save only $2 billion in its first four years, and that there was a high probability that ''no savings would be realized.''
 The report came as Mr. Obama tried to build support for his health care plan, arguing that small-business owners would benefit because they could buy coverage through an insurance exchange and receive tax credits to help pay for employee health benefits. 
 In his weekly radio and Internet address on Saturday, Mr. Obama said that small businesses were being ''crushed by skyrocketing health care costs.''
 ''Because they lack the bargaining power that large businesses have and face higher administrative costs per person, small businesses pay up to 18 percent more for the very same health insurance plans -- costs that eat into their profits and get passed on to their employees,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Republicans and some Democrats say Mr. Obama's proposals to cover the uninsured would fuel the growth of health spending. In draft legislation sent to Congress on July 17, the president proposed creation of an ''independent Medicare advisory council,'' which could set payment policies for Medicare, subject to approval by the president. The administration could put the policies into effect unless they were blocked within 30 days by Congress.
 The budget office said the proposal did not have enough teeth to guarantee substantial savings. The draft legislation ''does not explicitly direct the council to reduce'' Medicare spending, ''nor does it establish any target for such reductions,'' said Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the budget office. 
 Under the president's proposal, the five council members would be doctors or experts in medicine or health policy. As a result, Mr. Elmendorf said, ''the council could be weighted toward medical providers who might not be inclined to recommend cuts in payments to providers or significant changes to the delivery system.''
 The council could produce greater savings if it had clear authority to recommend broad changes in Medicare coverage and benefits, Mr. Elmendorf said. Likewise, he said, Congress could guarantee greater savings by requiring an across-the-board reduction in Medicare payments if cost-cutting goals were not met.
 However, health care providers, which are already lobbying against Mr. Obama's plan, would object even more strenuously to such proposals.
 Under the president's bill, Mr. Elmendorf said, the first potential savings would occur in 2016, and savings could total $2 billion from 2016 to 2019. That is a relatively small share of Medicare spending in those years, which the budget office says will total at least $2.8 trillion.
 Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, insisted that the president's proposal, with some minor changes, could save money in the long run. ''The point of the proposal was never to generate savings over the next decade,'' Mr. Orszag said. ''Instead, the goal is to provide a mechanism for improving quality of care for beneficiaries and reducing costs over the long term.'' 
 Influential House Democrats oppose Mr. Obama's call for a Medicare council. Representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Pete Stark of California, chairman of the panel's health subcommittee, say Congress has a duty to set Medicare payment policy. And they worry that a future Republican president could use the council as a tool to make deep, damaging cuts in Medicare. 
 In his radio address, Mr. Obama pressed ahead with his argument for why the nation's health care system must be overhauled, barely mentioning that the legislation has been delayed in the Senate until after the August recess. The White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report Saturday to counter Republican criticism that Democratic health care plans would be costly to small-business owners. In the weekly Republican address, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington State argued that the Democratic proposals were ''bankrolled by a small-business tax.'' She said that jobs would ''evaporate'' under the Democratic plan because businesses would not be able to afford to meet their payrolls.
 The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses, opposes the Democratic health care legislation under consideration in the House.
 ''Now is not the time to burden our nation's job creators with new, expensive mandates, punitive payroll taxes and a new government-run program,'' said Brad Close, the association's vice president for public policy.
 Congressional aides returned to Capitol Hill on Saturday to keep trying to reach a compromise.

HEADLINE: Obama, Gates and the American Black Man

BYLINE: By GLENN C. LOURY. 
Glenn C. Loury, a professor of economics and social sciences at Brown University, is the author, most recently, of ''Race, Incarceration and American Values.''

DATELINE: Providence, R.I. 

 BODY:
 IN a speech delivered earlier this year, during Black History Month, Attorney General Eric Holder drew headlines by criticizing the tenor of public discourse on race. ''Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot,'' Mr. Holder said, ''in things racial we have always been and I believe continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.'' The nation's leading law enforcement officer -- who happens also to be an African-American man -- was widely criticized for making this provocative comment.
 Yet during this past week -- as I have watched the controversy unfold over the arrest of a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates Jr., by a white Cambridge, Mass., police officer, James Crowley -- I have come to appreciate the prescience of Mr. Holder's remark. It is as though we are determined to prove him right -- as if our talk about race must be forced into a comfortable and familiar, if false, narrative where villains (''racists'') and heroes (''victims of racism'') are clear-cut, and where all one need do to stand on the right side of history is to engage in a bit of moral sanctimony. 
 This convenient story line is reflected in an all-too-familiar narrative: ''Here we are, 45 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with a black man in the White House. And yet, it is still the case that a distinguished Harvard professor, standing on his own front step, can be treated like a common criminal simply because he's black. Obviously it is way too soon to declare that we have entered a post-racial era ... .''
 As far as I am concerned, the ubiquity of this narrative shows that we are incapable of talking straight with one another about race. And this much-publicized incident is emblematic of precisely nothing at all. Rather, the Gates arrest is a made-for-cable-TV tempest in a teapot. It is the rough equivalent of a black man being thrown out of a restaurant after having berated an indifferent maitre d' for showing him to a table by the kitchen door, all the while declaring what everybody is supposed to know: this is what happens to a black man in America.
 Certainly, the contretemps shed no relevant light on the plight of the millions of black men on society's margins who bear the brunt of police scrutiny and government-sanctioned coercion. I find laughable, and sad, Professor Gates's declaration that he now plans to make a documentary film about racial profiling. Is that as far as his scholarship on the intersection of race and policing in America extends? Where has this eminent scholar of African-American affairs been these last 30 years, during which a historically unprecedented, politically popular, extraordinarily punitive and hugely racially disparate mobilization of resources for the policing, imprisonment and post-release supervision of those caught up in the criminal justice system has unfolded?
 Moreover, it is a shame that it takes an incident like this to induce a (black!) president to address these issues forthrightly. President Obama spoke to the N.A.A.C.P. this month, reaffirming the standard racial narrative while lecturing the black community on the need for better family values. But he barely uttered a word about the ways in which public policies -- policies over which he might exert no small influence -- have resulted in the hyper-incarceration of poor black men. 
 During his press conference on Wednesday, President Obama declared that the Cambridge police had acted ''stupidly'' by arresting his ''friend'' for disorderly conduct. I wouldn't necessarily disagree with this judgment, though I seriously doubt that calling the police stupid is something the president's pollsters encourage. 
 I recall that, during the height of last year's primary campaign, when Mr. Obama was asked to comment on the acquittal of New York City police officers in the fatal shooting of a young black man, Shawn Bell, who was celebrating with friends on the night before his wedding, the candidate was less condemnatory of the police or the courts. (''The most important thing for people who are concerned about that shooting is to figure out how do we come together and assure those kinds of tragedies don't happen again.'')
 It is depressing in the extreme that the president, when it came time for him to expend political capital on the issue of race and the police, did so on behalf of his ''friend'' rather than stressing policy reforms that might keep the poorly educated, infrequently employed, troubled but still human young black men in America out of prison. This is to say that, if Mr. Obama were going to lose some working-class white votes to the charge of ''elitism,'' I'd much rather it have been on countering the proliferation of ''three strikes'' laws, or ratcheting down the federal penalties for low-level drug trafficking, or inveighing against the racial disproportion in the administration of the death penalty. 
 Readers should know that I have had my own run-ins with the law. Twenty-two years ago a former girlfriend accused me of assault. While the charges were dropped, I had to endure the indignity of being ''processed'' by the police and judged in the press. Later that year, I was caught in possession of a controlled substance, spent the night in jail, and was required to enroll in a drug treatment program for my sins. My interest in the issues of race and law enforcement reflects more than academic curiosity.
 Yet anyone who looks closely into the issue of crime and punishment in America cannot fail to notice that the institutions of domestic security -- policing, surveillance, prisons, anti-drug policy, post-release parole supervision -- have grown hugely over the past two generations. The number of Americans in prison and jail has risen nearly five-fold since 1980. Another inescapable fact is that most of those incarcerated are black and Hispanic men. (They constitute approximately two-thirds of those being held in state prisons and municipal jails.) Overrepresentation of blacks among lawbreakers is the result as much as it is the cause of our overrepresentation among the imprisoned -- a fact about which the conventional racial narrative has too little to say. Nevertheless, this is a principal source of the tension in interactions between the police and black men like me.
 So, while I have had my ''problems'' with the police, when I consider the realities of contemporary society I have to acknowledge that they have a tough and often thankless job to do. The institutions I am wont to denounce -- the police, courts and prisons -- are the principal means by which we as a nation have chosen, through our politics, to deal with the antisocial behaviors of our fellow citizens. 
 However, such behavioral problems reflect failures elsewhere in our society -- racial and class segregation in our cities; inadequate education for the poor; and the collapse of the family as an institution in some communities. Because of these failures, we have large numbers of under-socialized, undereducated and virtually unemployable young men in our cities and towns. (They are not all black, to be sure, but they are disproportionately so.) Domestic violence is a serious problem in many of our communities; drug trafficking and gang activity are important parts of the social economy of the inner city. 
 Necessarily, such unlovely realities must be dealt with daily, and the police are at the front line in our society's response to them. We should be slow to judge them, and slower still to embrace crude stereotypes about their motives -- just as they should be slow to conclude that someone is a likely criminal suspect because he happens to be black and male. 
 The police are our agents, charged with the imperative to control the unruly behavior of people who don't act within the norms of society. This does not excuse ''racial profiling'' by police officers. It is merely to acknowledge an essential aspect of the circumstances that fuel suspicion and antipathy between black men and the police.
 I hope that something of lasting value might come from the uproar surrounding the Gates arrest. But my firm conviction is that change will not come about from the moral posturing of politicians or from more intense ''sensitivity training'' for police officers. Nor will it come from the president having a beer with Professor Gates and Sergeant Crowley, as Mr. Obama suggested in his follow-up meeting with the press on Friday. 
 Rather, along with Senator James Webb, Democrat of Virginia, I believe we should be pursuing far-reaching reforms in our criminal justice system. We should invest more in helping the troubled people -- our fellow citizens -- caught in the law enforcement web to find a constructive role in society, and less in punishing them for punishment's sake. We need to change the ways in which we deal with juvenile offenders, so that a foolish act in childhood doesn't put them on the road to lifetimes in prison. We should seriously consider that many of our sentences are too long -- ''three strikes'' laws may be good politics, but they are an irrational abomination as policy. We should definitely consider decriminalizing most drug use. We need to reinvent parole. 
 And, most important, we should weigh more heavily the negative and self-defeating effects that our policy of mass incarceration is having on the communities where large numbers of young black and Hispanic men live.

HEADLINE: Does Bernanke Deserve Another Term?: The Great Preventer

BYLINE: By NOURIEL ROUBINI. 
Nouriel Roubini is a professor of economics at the New York University Stern School of Business and the chairman of an economic consulting firm.

 BODY:
LAST week Ben Bernanke appeared before Congress, setting off a discussion over whether the president should reappoint him as chairman of the Federal Reserve when his term ends next January. Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed. Both the conventional and unconventional decisions made by this scholar of the Great Depression prevented the Great Recession of 2008-2009 from turning into the Great Depression 2.0. 
 Mr. Bernanke understands that in the Great Depression, the collapse of the money supply and the lack of monetary stimulus during contractions worsened the country's economic free fall. This lesson has paid off. Mr. Bernanke's decision to keep interest rates low and encourage lending has, for now, averted the L-shaped near depression that seemed highly likely after the financial collapse last fall. 
 To be sure, an endorsement of Mr. Bernanke's reappointment comes with many caveats. Mr. Bernanke, a Fed governor in the early part of this decade, supported flawed policies when Alan Greenspan pushed the federal funds rate (the policy rate set by the Fed as its main tool of monetary policy) too low for too long and failed to monitor mortgage lending properly, thus creating the housing and credit and mortgage bubbles. 
 He and the Fed made three major mistakes when the subprime mortgage crisis began. First, he kept arguing that the housing recession would bottom out soon (it has not bottomed out even three years later). Second, he argued that the subprime problem was a contained problem when in reality it was a symptom of the biggest leverage and credit bubble in American history. Third, he argued that the collapse in the housing market would not lead to a recession, even though about one-third of jobs created in the latest economic recovery were directly or indirectly related to housing. Mr. Bernanke's analysis was mistaken in several other important ways. He argued that monetary policy should not be used to control asset bubbles. He attributed the large United States current account deficits to a savings glut in China and emerging markets, understating the role that excessive fiscal deficits and debt accumulation by American households and the financial system played. 
 Still, when a liquidity and credit crunch emerged in the summer of 2007, Mr. Bernanke engineered a U-turn in Fed policy that prevented the crisis from turning into a near depression. He did this largely with actions and programs that were not in the traditional toolbox of monetary policy. The federal funds rate was effectively pushed down to zero to reduce borrowing costs and prevent the collapse of consumer demand and capital spending by business. New programs encouraged skittish institutions to resume lending. For the first time since the Great Depression, the Fed's role as lender of last resort was extended to investment banks. 
 Mr. Bernanke also introduced a wide range of other programs, like those to maintain the functioning of the commercial paper market (which makes short-term loans to companies so they can cover operating expenses like payrolls). The Fed was involved directly in the rescue of financial institutions like Bear Stearns and American International Group. It lent money to foreign central banks to ease a global shortage of dollars. The Fed even committed to purchasing up to $1.7 trillion of Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities and agency debt to reduce market rates. These are all radical actions that had almost never been undertaken before. 
 Some of these moves have raised important questions: Did the Fed help bail out institutions that should have been allowed to fail? Did it cause moral hazard as reckless lenders and investors were effectively bailed out? How and when will the Fed mop up the excess liquidity that its actions have created? Will these actions eventually cause inflation and a sharp fall of the value of the dollar? Has the Fed lost its independence as it has accommodated the fiscal needs of the government by bailing out banks and printing money to cover large fiscal deficits? 
 Still, the basic point remains: The Fed's creative and aggressive actions have significantly reduced the risks of a near depression. For this reason alone Mr. Bernanke deserves to be reappointed so that he can manage the Fed's exit from its most radical economic intervention since its creation in 1913.

HEADLINE: Taking a Hit July 19-25

 BODY:
THE NEWS In a victory for President Obama, the Senate voted 58 to 40 to kill $1.75 billion in financing for seven more F-22s, the world's costliest fighter jet.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The F-22 has been a flashpoint in the president's efforts to shift more of the Pentagon's resources to fighting insurgencies. The jet (187 have been ordered) was designed to counter Soviet combat aircraft in the 1980s. A big issue this time was jobs: an estimated 25,000 are tied directly to work on the plane. Siding with the president was Senator John McCain, his Republican rival last year, who said the vote ''really means there's a chance of us changing the way we do business in Washington.''
 THE NEWS A two-year corruption and money-laundering investigation in New Jersey resulted in federal charges against 44 people, including three of the state's mayors and two of its legislators. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS What began as a bank fraud case against a developer ballooned into a sweeping government corruption scandal when that man became an informant and posed as a crooked builder, dispensing bribes of $5,000 here, $10,000 there, prosecutors said. For New Jersey, which has seen a long list of corrupt officials go to jail in recent years, it seemed, amazingly, like same old, same old. Said one observer: ''It's going to just reinforce the stereotype of New Jersey politics and corruption.''
 THE NEWS Gun advocates failed to push a measure through the Senate that would have allowed gun owners with valid permits in one state to carry concealed weapons in other states.
 BEHIND THE NEWS This latest effort to expand the rights of gun owners was attached to the must-pass annual military authorization bill. But the amendment fell two votes short of the 60 needed under Senate rules. Critics accused the mostly Republican supporters of abandoning states' rights; those Republicans argued that gun carriers would still have to obey state and local laws. The measure was bitterly opposed by a number of big-city mayors, including Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.
 THE NEWS With their state broke and its credit rating shot, California lawmakers cut more than $15 billion in programs to close a huge budget gap and shore up the state's finances.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The California Dream is, if not dead, at least delayed. At no point in modern history has the state, once a model of fierce economic independence, cut so deeply, reaching across every aspect of life. Lawmakers have cut some $30 billion over two fiscal years, ending in 2010, from schools, colleges, health care, welfare, corrections and more, leaving residents without services they are used to receiving. ''We are now the state that can't,'' said one expert on the California economy.
 THE NEWS Microsoft, the world's largest software company, reported its worst fiscal year since it first sold stock to the public in 1986.
 BEHIND THE NEWS With revenue down 3 percent and net income down 18 percent, Microsoft has been humbled both by the recession and problems of its own making. Business customers in particular have scaled back new PC purchases. The company's Windows Vista software has also failed to attract businesses because of problems with compatibility and speed. Still, analysts say Microsoft seems poised to capitalize on large-scale PC upgrades when companies finally buy new machines. ''They are at a great stage now,'' said one.

HEADLINE: What You Might Not Know About the Recovery

BYLINE: By JOE BIDEN. 
Joe Biden is the vice president of the United States.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 SIX months ago, when President Obama and I took office, we were confronted with an economic crisis unparalleled in our lifetime. The nation was hemorrhaging more than 700,000 jobs a month, the housing market was in free fall, and the fate of the financial system hung in the balance. Credible economists were handicapping the probability of a depression. The actions we took -- passing the Recovery Act, stabilizing the banking system, pressing to get credit flowing again and helping responsible homeowners -- brought us back from the precipice. Monthly job losses are down, financial markets are improved, and economic contraction has slowed. We still have a long way to go, but clearly we are closer to recovery today than we were in January. The Recovery Act has been critical to that progress. 
 Notwithstanding this progress, the nature of the Recovery Act remains misunderstood by many, and misconstrued by others: critics have suggested that the entire $787 billion is being spent on pet programs. As the person leading the administration's efforts to put the Recovery Act into effect, I want to set the record straight. 
 The single largest part of the Recovery Act -- more than one-third of it -- is tax cuts: 95 percent of working Americans have seen their taxes go down as a result of the act. The second-largest part -- just under a third -- is direct relief to state governments and individuals. The money is allowing state governments to avoid laying off teachers (14,000 in New York City alone), firefighters and police officers and preventing states' budget gaps from growing wider. 
 And those hardest hit by the recession are getting extended unemployment insurance, health coverage and other help to get through these tough times. The bottom line is that two-thirds of the Recovery Act doesn't finance ''programs,'' but goes directly to tax cuts, state governments and families in need, without red tape or delays. 
 As for the final third, the act is financing the largest investment in roads since the creation of the Interstate highway system; construction projects at military bases, ports, bridges and tunnels; long overdue Superfund cleanups; the creation of clean energy jobs of the future; improvements in badly outdated rural water systems; upgrades to overtaxed mass transit and rail systems; and much more. These investments create jobs today -- and support economic growth for years to come. Far from being a negative, the wide array of these investments is needed given the incredible diversity of the American economy. 
 Projects are being chosen without earmarks or political consideration, and many contracts have come in under budget. More than 30,000 projects have been approved, and thousands are already posted on recovery.gov -- providing a high level of transparency and accountability. Taxpayers should know that we have not hesitated to reject proposals that have failed to meet our merit-based standards. 
 The care with which we are carrying out the provisions of the Recovery Act has led some people to ask whether we are moving too slowly. But the act was intended to provide steady support for our economy over an extended period -- not a jolt that would last only a few months. Instead of quick-hit rebates, we are giving Americans a tax cut in each paycheck. Instead of pumping out all the state aid immediately, we are spreading it over the two years that it will be needed. Road projects, energy projects and construction projects are being started as soon as they pass review, contracts are competitively bid and reporting systems are in place. 
 Even with such care being taken, we have already committed more than one-fourth of the Recovery Act's total funds, and we are on track to meet the deadline set when the act was passed in February -- spending 70 percent by the end of September 2010. 
 The Recovery Act is not the cure for all our economic ills -- no single piece of legislation could be. But how many government initiatives can point to both large numbers of projects coming in under budget and a Government Accountability Office finding that we are ahead of schedule in key areas?
 It is true that the act's effort to address multiple problems simultaneously makes it an easy target for second-guessing. Critics have argued that the tax cuts are too small (or too large); that too much (or not enough) aid is going to rural areas; that too little (or too much) is being spent on roads. Recently, some have even criticized the act for helping support soup kitchens and food banks. 
 But the way I see it, our balanced approach recognizes that there is no silver bullet, no single thing, that can address the many and complex needs of America's vast economy. We need relief, recovery and reinvestment to cope with our multifaceted crisis -- and only 159 days after it was signed by President Obama, the Recovery Act is already at work providing all three.

HEADLINE: They're All Supporting Actors Here

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 FOR the first time perhaps since Ronald Reagan, an honest-to-goodness, real live Hollywood celebrity is at work inside the White House. But as soon as he arrived from the Left Coast, the Obama administration promptly put Kalpen Modi under wraps.
 Mr. Modi -- better known as Kal Penn to fans of the television medical drama ''House'' and the raunchy stoner ''Harold and Kumar'' movies -- now toils in obscurity inside the warrenlike Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The bureaucrat formerly known as Mr. Penn is now the associate director of the Office of Public Engagement, a job that requires him to do two things: run public outreach, with a focus on young people, the arts world and Asian-Americans; and keep his head down. 
 ''I expect to be treated just like any other staff member,'' he said during a conference call on his first day of work, July 6, in what the White House described as a one-time-only opportunity to interview the former star. The call was cut off after 17 minutes (Mr. Modi had a meeting to attend), but not before he revealed these juicy tidbits: he brushed his teeth that morning just like everybody else does, took the bus to work and was ''deeply honored to be here.''
 Mr. Modi's somewhat uneasy transition from L.A. celebrity to D.C. nobody provides a glimpse into the larger picture of the conflicted relationship between Hollywood and Washington in the age of Obama. After eight years of generally icy feelings toward President George W. Bush, the entertainment industry is once again wrapping its arms around the nation's capital in a warm embrace.
 But the Obama White House is careful not to look as if it is hugging back.
 Mr. Obama makes no secret that he has entertainment industry friends; Oprah Winfrey remains a close supporter, Barbra Streisand raised millions for his campaign, Bruce Springsteen rocked the town on inauguration weekend. As president, Mr. Obama has made aggressive use of the White House as a platform to promote cultural events, hosting concerts featuring artists as varied as Stevie Wonder and Tony Bennett and, just last week, the bluegrass-country star Alison Krauss.
 But in the six months since taking office, Mr. Obama has also entertained a quiet behind-the-scenes parade of movie stars and other celebrities, who may traipse through the West Wing and Oval Office unannounced during the work week. They include Pierce Brosnan, Reese Witherspoon, Ben Stiller, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jon Bon Jovi, to name just a few. 
 Some slip in just for tours. Ms. Witherspoon, with her co-star Paul Rudd and her boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, dropped in on Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when she and Mr. Rudd were here filming a movie. (The White House photographer took a picture of the president and Ms. Witherspoon in the Oval Office; it hangs in the working quarters of the West Wing, out of view of most visitors.)
 Others come with an agenda.
 Mr. Brosnan met with Obama administration officials in May to talk about his favorite cause, saving the whales. Mr. DiCaprio spent 10 minutes with President Obama in the Oval Office a couple of months ago to talk about the environment. Mr. Clooney weighed in on the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. Mr. Bon Jovi, who has been active with United We Serve, Mr. Obama's initiative to promote volunteerism, had lunch in the White House mess not long ago with David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser; later, the president dropped in to say hello.
 The meetings have happened quietly with good reason: At a time when ordinary Americans are struggling through the darkest economy since the Great Depression, and the president is confronting epic problems like health care and the nuclear ambitions of Iran, Mr. Obama can ill afford to be seen cavorting with Hollywood types. 
 ''Hollywood is not the political asset, especially in the middle of the country, that people might think it is,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and former executive vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie industry's trade organization. ''If you use it correctly, Hollywood can be very helpful in fund-raising. But it can also be a liability.''
 Some longtime Washingtonians take umbrage at this kind of celebrity diplomacy. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have declared the White House ''the people's house.'' So why is it, their critics wonder, that the doors of the people's house seem to open more easily to certain kinds of people than others?
 ''Why does the opinion of a movie star matter, except insofar as he or she is a citizen?'' asks Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, adding, ''There is something a little risible about these people being invited to the White House for their perfectly conventional views on, say, climate change.''
 Mr. Axelrod, though, says it is a mistake to imagine that Hollywood stars are flocking to the White House. ''Weeks and months can go by before I see anyone, a movie star or a television star around here,'' he said, adding, ''I have always felt that there is a certain cultural quality about Washington and L.A. that is similar. They are two towns that are filled with very smart, creative people who spend a lot of time talking to themselves.''
 Bill Clinton, with his thirst for the limelight while president, seemed to crave attention from Hollywood; he once slipped away from an international summit meeting for a late-night drink with the actors Richard Dreyfuss, Richard Gere and Sharon Stone.
 Mr. Bush seemed indifferent. As Mr. Wieseltier said, ''For Bush, Hollywood was the Soviet Union, only better looking.''
 Mr. Obama, by contrast, clearly enjoys associating with stars. But with his cool, detached reserve, he does not seem to need them, which may be one reason they find him so attractive.
 ''What makes Obama intriguing is that he's the biggest celebrity in the world -- he's bigger than any of them,'' said Ron Brownstein, political director of Atlantic Media and the author of ''The Power and the Glitter,'' a 1991 book about the Hollywood-Washington nexus. ''You don't get the sense that Obama is stargazing. If anything, you feel like it's the other way around.''
 That may have been the dynamic that propelled Mr. Modi to swap his lucrative acting career for a midlevel White House job. In 2007, he signed on with the Obama campaign as a volunteer, going door to door and making phone calls; eventually he joined candidate Obama's arts policy committee. Friends say that Mr. Modi, 32, who is Indian-American, has a deep interest in policy and in promoting Asian-Americans in the arts. Last year, he taught a course at the University of Pennsylvania on how Asian-Americans are portrayed in the media. Although he played a terrorist in 2007 on ''24,'' he told an entertainment reporter at the time: ''I have a huge political problem with the role. It was essentially accepting a form of racial profiling.'' 
 ''He's extremely serious,'' said Grace Kao, a sociology professor at Penn who worked with Mr. Modi there. Still, she says, she was a bit puzzled by his request to teach. ''I couldn't quite figure out why someone like him would be interested in spending time with us,'' she said.
 In Washington and Hollywood, people are also scratching their heads. Long before Mr. Obama had even sealed the nomination, David Shore, the executive producer of ''House,'' said Mr. Modi -- then still Kal Penn -- came to him and told him that there was a possibility he would go work for Mr. Obama should he win the presidency. 
 ''We just kind of rolled our eyes and said, 'Good for you,' '' Mr. Shore said. ''He had many opportunities to change his mind, but he never wavered.''
 In April, four months after Mr. Obama came into office, the deal was sealed; his television character, a medical diagnostician, committed suicide. But while his ''House'' obligations are over, it appears Mr. Modi may still have at least one more Hollywood commitment: Warner Bros. has announced the release of ''A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas'' in November 2010. On the White House conference call, Mr. Modi hinted that he is trying to wriggle out of that obligation to reprise his role as Kumar; he said he is taking a sabbatical from acting and hopes ''the folks who make the Harold and Kumar films will respect my decision.''
 In the West Wing, his new colleagues seem impressed, if a little amused. 
 ''He's probably the only guy in the Office of Public Engagement,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''who has a publicist.''

HEADLINE: At the Crossroad of Empires, a Mouse Struts

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan 

 BODY:
-- The first high-level customers to arrive at this stop on the Silk Road in July were two of Vladimir V. Putin's confidants. Got some land for stationing Russian troops -- say, something with a nice long runway? Soon after, a senior American diplomat dropped by. Can we put the final touches on that deal to keep our own military base here? (Oh, and by the way, anything else we can do for you?)
 Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous nation in Central Asia that has long been a contender for the title of most obscure former Soviet republic, has suddenly become prime real estate, like a once-homely neighborhood that all the A-listers now covet.
 Its unexpected emergence onto the international stage says much about how the war in nearby Afghanistan, the struggle for political influence in the former Soviet Union, and the competition to control Central Asia's bountiful oil and gas reserves are reshaping priorities of the world's military and economic titans. 
 Kyrgyzstan is the only country in the world that hosts separate military bases for the United States and Russia, and both major powers are bent on sustaining or deepening their presence. That in part explains why neither has publicly condemned the heavy-handed tactics of the Kyrgyz president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who easily won another term last week in an election that his opponents said was rigged.
 The United States believes that it must have a sizable military base in Central Asia to support the NATO mission in Afghanistan, especially now that supply routes through Pakistan are perilous. The American installation on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital is crowded with C-17 cargo planes and KC-135 tanker planes that readily reach the Afghan skies for mid-air refueling of fighters. As many as 30,000 military personnel cycle through the base monthly.
 Those troops and planes have stirred deep unease in the Kremlin, which tried to persuade Mr. Bakiyev to oust the Americans, in the end unsuccessfully. Central Asia is Moscow's former territory and current backyard, and the Kremlin evinces a sense of entitlement here, not to mention a desire to dominate natural resources.
 At the same time, the Russians seem torn over the American venture in Afghanistan. They understand that failure could threaten even Russia, which has grappled with Islamic extremism in its south, so they have allowed American military goods to flow across Russia. The Kremlin also can sympathize with Washington's plight, given painful memories of the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.
 Still, the Kremlin fears that the United States is setting down lasting roots in Central Asia.
 Russia's role in the former Soviet republics has been a constant source of friction between the two sides. Just last week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visited Ukraine and Georgia and rebuked Russia for its ''19th-century notion of spheres of influence.'' 
 The other major player in Central Asia is China, which is also wary of the spread of Muslim fundamentalism. The Chinese concerns were underscored in recent weeks by the uprising by Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group, in the Chinese region that borders Central Asia. Chinese companies are also investing billions of dollars in Central Asia.
 The Chinese do not have a base here, though rumors have abounded that they want one. The French, Germans and Indians all have small installations in Central Asia.
 ''Everyone, all these powers, have a vital interest in this region,'' said Andrei V. Fedorov, an analyst at the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy in Moscow. ''It is not just economic. It is also stability. If something goes wrong in Central Asia, it will hit everyone around -- Pakistan, Afghanistan, China -- and will have great repercussions.''
 Major nations have long skirmished in Central Asia. But the current state of affairs is more than an update of the Great Game, that 19th-century battle for regional supremacy between Britain and Russia. This time, the dynamic is more complicated, with more players and arguably more at stake.
 In recent months, Kyrgyz military bases have been the point of contention, especially the American one on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, which was established in December 2001 after the American incursion into Afghanistan.
 The Russians have regularly insinuated nefarious doings at the base, which is at Manas International Airport; state-controlled news media in Russia have aired rumors that the base is a hub for smuggling heroin, prostitutes, babies and even body parts. ''The main thing is to instill fear in occupied territory,'' said the narrator in a recent documentary on Russian television that insisted that the base was a massive espionage complex.
 American military officials in Kyrgyzstan roll their eyes in response to these charges. They do say they have polite, if sparse, contact with their local Russian counterparts, who are concentrated at a Russian base not far from the capital.
 Kyrgyzstan has turned into a preferred location in part because its society is considered relatively open and its government, while authoritarian, is somewhat less so than those of its neighbors.
 The president, Mr. Bakiyev, seems quite aware that his country is the place to be. In February, while he was in Moscow to receive a roughly $2 billion package of loans and aid from Russia, he vowed to close the American base.
 The move was seen as a master stroke by the Kremlin. In retrospect, Mr. Bakiyev was working both sides.
 He wanted more money from the Americans, as well as face-saving measures so it would look as if he had not caved, and in June, he got both. The rent on Manas will rise to $60 million annually from $17.4 million, and Kyrgyzstan is to receive more than $100 million in other grants.
 Mr. Bakiyev also received a warm letter from President Obama, as well as a visit this month from William J. Burns, the senior American diplomat.
 Under the new arrangement, Manas is rebranded a ''transit center,'' and American officials no longer refer to it as a ''base,'' apparently to avoid implying that it is permanent.
 ''The cynic could go, 'Well, that's just eye wash,' '' said Col. Blaine D. Holt, director of the base -- er, transit center. ''But there is some good rationale behind why some of those actions were taken.''
 Whether or not the Kremlin was angered by Mr. Bakiyev's turnabout (there is a conflicting evidence), it reacted swiftly.
 Earlier this month, Mr. Putin sent two loyalists, Deputy Prime Minister Igor I. Sechin, and Defense Minister Anatoly E. Serdyukov, to see Mr. Bakiyev. The message: Russia wants another base. 
 A deal is expected soon. The military need is not entirely clear, but that is perhaps beside the point.
 ''It is a symbolic action -- symbolic of Russia's presence, symbolic of its greatness, symbolic of its getting up off its knees,'' said Sergei A. Panarin, a prominent Central Asia specialist in Moscow. ''It's nostalgia for an empire.''

HEADLINE: Obama's BFF

BYLINE: By ROBERT DRAPER

 BODY:
On Jan. 25, 2008, the day before the South Carolina Democratic primary, Barack Obama endured a grueling succession of campaign events across the state. When his staff informed him that the evening would conclude with a brief show-up at the Pink Ice Ball, a gala for the African-American sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha, Obama flatly refused to attend. ''I've been to sorority events before,'' he said. ''We're not gonna change anybody's mind.'' 
 Rick Wade, a senior adviser, Stacey Brayboy, the state campaign manager, and Anton Gunn, the state political director, took turns beseeching their boss. The gala, they told Obama, would be attended by more than 2,000 college-educated African-American women, a constituent group that was originally skeptical of the candidate's ''blackness'' and that the campaign worked tirelessly to wrest from Hillary Clinton. State luminaries like Representative James Clyburn -- himself an undeclared black voter -- would be expecting him. They would be in and out in five minutes. 
 Obama's irritation grew. ''Man, it's late, I'm tired,'' he snapped. ''I'm not going to any sorority event.'' 
 The three staff members knew what their only option was at this point. ''If you want him to do something,'' Gunn would later tell me, ''there are two people he's not going to say no to: Valerie Jarrett and Michelle Obama.'' 
 At the day's penultimate event, a rally in Columbia, Gunn, Brayboy and Wade pleaded their case to Jarrett, the Obamas' longtime friend and consigliere. When they were finished, Jarrett told them, ''We can make that happen,'' as Gunn would recall it. Jarrett informed Michelle of the situation, and when the candidate stepped offstage from the rally, Obama's wife told him he had one last stop to make before they called it a night.
 ''I told Anton I'm not going to any Pink Ice Ball!'' Obama barked. 
 Then Jarrett glided over to the fuming candidate. Her voice was very quiet and very direct.
 ''Barack,'' she said, ''you want to win, don't you?''
 Scowling, Obama affirmed that he did. 
 ''Well, then. You need to go to Pink Ice.''
 ''And he shuts up,'' Gunn recalls, ''and gets on the bus.''
 One year later, Barack Obama convened his first presidential town-hall meeting, in Elkhart, Ind. Responding to a question about the economy, Obama took the opportunity to warn corporate recipients of TARP money that ''you are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you pay taxpayers back. You can't get corporate jets. You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers' dime.'' 
 Officials in the already-reeling hospitality industry felt sucker-punched by Obama's remark. ''We began experiencing a serious downturn in business,'' Jonathan Tisch, the chief executive of Loews hotels, told me. ''There were mass cancellations, especially from the financial-services sector.'' Tisch commiserated with Penny Pritzker, a developer, hotel entrepreneur and Obama campaign adviser, and word got around to her good friend and fellow Chicago businesswoman, the White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. 
 Jarrett raised their concerns with the president during his morning senior staff meeting. Obama was dismissive. His comments, he said to Jarrett, were not directed at ordinary business travelers but rather at companies that were bailed out at taxpayers' expense. ''And he moved on,'' says an administration official familiar with the conversation, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the subject. ''It was a done deal -- the president had spoken. But Valerie has a lot of credibility with him, and she can speak to him honestly. So she decided to go back to the president.'' 
 ''This is still an issue,'' she told Obama on the morning of March 11, during an economic briefing in the Oval Office. ''Even though you said what you said, people are taking it a different way, and it's hurting the industry.'' 
 The president relented. Obama directed Robert Gibbs, his press secretary, to clarify his remarks. Jarrett didn't think that was enough, however. Before the meeting broke up, she mentioned that her staff had arranged for a dozen hospitality-industry chief executives to gather in the Roosevelt Room that morning with Obama's economic adviser Lawrence Summers. Jarrett had just learned that Summers might miss the meeting. Why not seize the moment, she urged Obama: ''Let them hear from the president directly.'' 
 A few minutes later, Jarrett left the Oval Office, walked down the hall to the Roosevelt Room and greeted the travel executives. She had barely finished telling them, ''The president really cares about this,'' when the door flew open, and Obama strolled in. He shook everyone's hand and then, to their astonished delight, took a seat. For the next half-hour, he listened closely and asked pointed questions. ''It was the first time,'' one amazed participant would later say, ''that any president has sat down with our industry in any meaningful way.''
 Before departing, Obama gestured to the unassuming African-American woman at the other end of the conference table. ''Valerie's my business liaison,'' he told them. ''She'll be working very closely with your industry.'' 
 That Jarrett had pulled strings to facilitate the meeting was inferred by the C.E.O.'s, one of whom said, ''It all happened because one of his senior advisers clearly has a feel for things.'' The executive didn't know that the ''feel'' ran deeper than policy -- that it was about trust: if Valerie Jarrett told Barack Obama that something was the right thing to do, he would very likely do it. 
 ''I mean, he's really by far smarter than anybody I know,'' Valerie Jarrett said one morning this spring in her spacious West Wing office while elaborating on her close friend, the president. Jarrett is divorced and has a daughter, who attends Harvard Law School. She lives in the same Georgetown apartment complex as her close Chicago friends Desiree Rogers, the White House social secretary, and Susan Sher, the first lady's chief of staff. She tends to dress elegantly, as if planning to head straight from the office to an evening event (which is often the case), and that day was no exception. She also tends to keep her emotional thermostat set at room temperature, much like the president -- unless the subject is the president, in which case the 52-year-old Jarrett can be almost breathless, as was the case now. ''Not just smart-intelligent,'' she went on, ''but he's perceptive, he watches body language. We just had a meeting, and one of his staff people. . . .'' Jarrett offered a knowing smile. ''If you weren't really paying close attention, you wouldn't notice that she was getting rather emotionally involved in the issue. It was clearly -- to me, as a woman -- something she cared passionately about. And I was watching him look at her, and he's reading her completely. I look around at the other guys in the room. And none of 'em got it. None of 'em got it!''
 ''But you got that he got it,'' I ventured.
 ''Oh, yeah,'' she acknowledged casually. ''Well, I know him pretty well. So I could tell by the look on his face. And I would've bet a dollar that when the meeting was over, he was going to hold her back. Sure enough, he said to her, 'I want to talk to you for a second.' '' 
 Among the narrative threads that course almost uninterrupted throughout the history of the American presidency is the inevitable presence in the White House of The One Who Gets the Boss. Karen Hughes got George W. Bush. Bruce Lindsey got Bill Clinton. Jim Baker got the elder Bush. And so on, back to William Seward's evolving closeness with Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson's lifelong reliance on the counsel of James Madison. Each such aide has served his or her president in a way that reveals the latter's psychology. H. R. Haldeman understood the abiding social discomfort of Richard Nixon (who preferred communicating by memo, at times even with his own wife), and Haldeman spent much of his time as chief of staff keeping others away from the Oval Office. Bert Lance alone among the Georgians in Jimmy Carter's White House could divine when their fussy boss required a budget-policy huddle, a joke or a moment of prayer. Michael Deaver, the deputy chief of staff who Nancy Reagan would say was ''like a son'' to Ronald Reagan, deployed the latter's sunny aloofness with a P.R. man's acumen, thereby elevating the former ''Grade B movie actor'' to Great Communicator status. 
 Valerie Jarrett is a Washington outsider with a Washingtonian's mind-deadening job title: senior adviser and assistant to the president for intergovernmental affairs and public engagement. Roughly translated, she is Obama's intermediary to the outside world. But Jarrett is also the president's closest friend in the White House, and it is not lost on her colleagues that when senior staff meetings in the Oval Office break up, she often stays behind with the boss. Her influence leaves few fingerprints. Over a four-month period of reporting, I struggled to understand Jarrett's ineffable raison d'etre in the Obama White House. Perhaps proving that nothing succeeds like failure, my plaintive queries were unexpectedly rewarded one afternoon by a telephone call from the president himself. ''Well, Valerie is one of my oldest friends,'' Obama began. ''Over time, I think our relationship evolved to the point where she's like a sibling to me. . . . I trust her completely.'' 
 Before long, his monologue slid into banality. Jarrett served ''as my eyes and ears,'' a ''sounding board'' and was ever helpful with ''midcourse corrections.'' When Obama was done, I pressed him for clarity. What was unique about their relationship as to make a Valerie Jarrett indispensable to the president of the United States? Surely, I said, it wasn't simply the longevity of their friendship.
 ''No, as I said, she's someone I trust completely,'' Obama replied. ''She is family.'' Then he hesitated, appraising his own sentiment. ''She's family -- she combines the closeness of a family member with the savvy and objectivity of a professional businesswoman and public-policy expert. And that's a rare combination to have. You know,'' he went on to say, ''there are other friends of mine who are close to me but who don't really understand the nature of my work. There are others who are extraordinary experts in policy and politics but don't have that track record with me.''
 Obama then explained what that combination of kinship and competence meant to him. As his surrogate, Jarrett is trusted ''to speak for me, particularly when we're dealing with delicate issues.'' At the same time, he could rely on her ''to monitor the dynamics inside the White House. She's got a very good antenna about the disgruntled young staffer or tensions between a couple of principals.'' (He declined to be more specific, saying, ''Where she serves most ably involves issues that can be sensitive. . . . So I'm not sure I've got the killer anecdote.'') 
 From Obama's professorial elucidation, those two recurring words -- ''trust'' and ''family'' -- insistently rang out. After our conversation, I began to reflect on Jarrett's portfolio. Broadly speaking, it consists of ''outreach'' -- endless meetings, conferences and speeches. The kind of job, in other words, that even a president who claims to be all about reaching out might assign to someone he can't stand. But the bond between Obama and Jarrett indicates that her duties are important to the president, and in a very personal way.
 Jarrett functions as Obama's de facto conduit to the business community. Among the president's economic team, only Jarrett, the former president of a Chicago real estate development firm, has actually run a multimillion-dollar business. (''The pendulum has swung from an administration that had a lot of experience in business to one that's filled with regulators and academics,'' one of Wall Street's most prominent chief executives told me recently.) Her street cred with the private sector is an obvious asset to a president confronting a major recession. That said, Valerie Jarrett's exquisite business connections have been important to Obama since his political ambitions first took hold more than a decade ago. ''I think Valerie is the glue between the Obamas and their relationship with the external world,'' a mutual friend says. ''First Chicago, and then the network expanded exponentially, all over the country. She's opened a lot of doors.'' 
 Jarrett also serves as the White House's unofficial champion of minority issues. This may seem superfluous, given that a black man inhabits the Oval Office -- until it's noted that Obama's inner circle consists largely of white males, same as it ever was. As a top adviser acknowledged, ''At the end of the day, when he's with his closest staff, she's the only one who has a sense of what it's like to have a different background from everyone else.'' 
 Jarrett's shared experience with the Obamas is about race -- and on a deeper level, about the coexistence, in the post-King African-American psyche, of conscience and ambition, activism and accommodation. Their identity rests on that fulcrum; it is, as Barack Obama would say, who they are. ''I think the thing that's important to the president and the first lady is this whole notion of authenticity,'' says Martin Nesbitt, a Chicago parking-lot entrepreneur whose closeness to Barack Obama rivals that of Jarrett. ''And knowing them as well and being as close a friend as she is, Valerie's always there to say: 'Yeah, but you know what? That's not you. You wouldn't say that. Somebody else is saying that. Barack Obama wouldn't say that.' '' 
 Authenticity has a lot to do with place, of course. Obama was a 23-year-old gifted transient who had yet to connect to the American Experience when he showed up in Chicago in 1985. His quest for identity ended there. ''It's the city that sucked in this kid Barack Obama and made it his home,'' Michelle Obama told me. ''He considered himself a native of Chicago, because of his community-organizing work, before I ever met him.'' 
 The Obama White House is now populated with as many Chicagoans as it previously housed Texans. Their presence has produced a whipsawing change in ethos at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that cannot be explained in strictly partisan, racial or even geographic terms -- and of which the new occupants themselves seem unaware. The Texans and the Chicagoans each boast of their larger-than-life politicians, of their native hospitality (be it Southern or Midwestern). ''When it comes to family and community, those values are very strong'' in Chicago, Michelle Obama told me -- eerily echoing the words of Laura Bush at the 2000 Republican National Convention: ''Midland was a place of family and community. . . . '' 
 The similarities end precisely there, because Mrs. Bush finished her thought about Midland with, ''and it had a sense of possibility as big as the West Texas sky.'' That notion of boundlessness, of pastoral exceptionalism, suffuses the Texas psyche. By contrast, the Chicago that has seen its way through urban malaise, balkanized wards, iron-fisted local governance and epic civil rights clashes has imbued the Obama White House with a far less gauzy mind-set. But the tenets underlying that worldview -- struggle is a virtue; united we stand; cities matter -- are every bit as fundamental to American idealism as the Texas-bred reverence of vastness and individualism.
 The Obamas and Valerie Jarrett experienced firsthand the hard-won progress of a Chicago beset with racial and class divisions during the administrations of Harold Washington, who was the city's first black mayor, and Richard M. Daley. ''There was a certain sense we all shared that people can change, communities can change, cities can change,'' Jarrett said when I asked her to talk about what Chicago means to her and the Obamas. ''Overcoming adversity not only makes you stronger. It makes you more hopeful. Living through the transformation of the city -- maybe we gained our confidence having lived through those days.'' 
 Still, she told me, what Chicago provided Obama with most of all was family -- beginning, of course, with Michelle Robinson. ''In this narrow question of identity, it was that although they grew up in totally different worlds, she had the same kind of 'decency and work ethic and sense of responsibility to give something back,' '' Jarrett said. ''But where she was totally different was how she was raised. She had these two parents who loved her dearly and sacrificed greatly so that she and Craig could go to the best colleges. My guess is that her dad was home for dinner every night -- he was a huge force in her life -- and she had the role model of what a good marriage could be and how to be a role model as a parent. Barack's mother was very important to him, but he spent a great deal of his life living in a different place. So as all kids do, you always have a fantasy of what perfection would be. And my guess is that Michelle's childhood was his idea of perfection. It allowed him to anchor himself with her and with her family. To me, that's the most special thing about Chicago for him.'' 
 It didn't take long for Jarrett to become part of Obama's patchwork family. As Daley's deputy chief of staff, Jarrett was already one of the city's power brokers in 1991, when her friend and co-worker, Susan Sher, suggested that she take a look at the resume of a promising young African-American lawyer named Michelle Robinson. The applicant made an impression on Jarrett, and vice versa. ''When we interviewed,'' Michelle Obama recalls, ''we connected because we had similar paths. She'd practiced law but had struggled with some of the same questions: Do I want to stay in a big firm? How do I build a life that's meaningful and interesting?'' 
 In less than a year, Michelle's fiance began to confide in Valerie Jarrett. He showed her pages from a book he was writing. That book, ''Dreams From My Father,'' explored Barack Obama's inner struggle in a way that would later astound the friends of his youth, who knew only the mentholated unflappability that prefigured today's Obama Cool. With Jarrett, he found himself doing what Barack Obama simply did not do: itemizing his self-doubt out loud. ''He talked about how hard it was -- things he hadn't dealt with yet,'' she recalled. '' 'It isn't just a matter of writing a simple story,' I told him. 'You've got to deal with the fact that your father left you at a very young age. And you lived in a variety of different settings at an age where it could've been discombobulating. Your grandparents are white, and you look black. Your friends in Hawaii all are different-looking, and that's great -- but you come to the mainland, and things are much more black and white, literally.' '' 
 Jarrett was born of African-American parents in Shiraz, Iran, where her physician father was running a hospital as part of an American aid program. Obama's fabled ''exoticism'' was therefore comprehensible to her, the president told me. ''I think we both share an appreciation of the world outside our borders that ironically probably makes us appreciate more the values of America,'' he said. ''It also allows us to maybe travel between worlds and cultures in ways that have proven to be not only professionally important but emotionally satisfying. I guess another way of putting it is, she and I both are constantly looking for links and bridges between cultures and peoples. That's central to who we are. And that probably has contributed to forging an even closer relationship than we might've otherwise had.'' 
 Obama, as his memoir would reveal, sought connection to the heroes of the civil rights movement. Jarrett's struggle had been of a different sort: how to measure up to the role models who filled her life. Her father, Dr. James Bowman, was an eminent pathologist given to wearing bow ties and trekking his young daughter across Africa for her summer vacations. Equally influential was her mother, Barbara, a childhood-development expert and the daughter of Robert Taylor, the first African-American to head the Chicago Housing Authority. 
 The fast track laid out for Valerie Bowman -- a Massachusetts boarding school, then Stanford, then a law degree at Michigan, then marriage and work at a corporate law firm -- was one she pursued without either resistance or zeal, ''kind of like an automaton,'' she told me. While Jarrett's family rejoiced when Harold Washington was elected mayor on April 22, 1983, the atmosphere at her nearly all-white firm the next day was one she would remember as ''polite silence.'' Four years later, as a 25-year-old community organizer was wading into the tumult of her hometown, Jarrett, then 30, decided at last to reconnect herself to it. She quit both her marriage and her job, and in 1987, as the mother of a 2-year-old daughter, she went to work for Mayor Washington's corporation counsel -- relinquishing her high-rise office for a cubicle in the city law department. But like the ''sibling'' she had yet to meet, Valerie Jarrett had found a path of her own.
 Over the next 15 years, her upward trajectory would outpace even Obama's. Jarrett's unhappy years as a real estate lawyer now paid off in a city law department tasked with maintaining Chicago's business base. Washington died of a heart attack in 1987, but her work ethic and supple intelligence distinguished Jarrett in the eyes of Richard M. Daley, who took office two years later. The new mayor promoted her to deputy chief of staff -- and later to the post of planning commissioner, thereby baptizing Jarrett in the racially charged torrent of urban affairs. 
 The experience of infuriating developers and neighborhood groups alike ''toughened me greatly,'' Jarrett says. From 1991 until 1995, she presided over a rancorous but largely successful makeover of the city's landscape, tearing down blighted housing projects and relocating residents -- those who qualified anyway -- to far more attractive new developments in racially mixed neighborhoods. (After her tenure, the infamous projects bearing her grandfather's name were demolished.) Meanwhile, she was raising her daughter and developing a social life that revolved around an intimate community of like-minded black urban professionals who, like Jarrett, sought advancement not only for themselves but for the local African-American community. Chief among them were the Obamas. Jarrett brought Michelle into the Daley administration, attended their wedding, threw a book-signing party for the ''Dreams From My Father'' author and generally assumed a big-sisterly presence in the young couple's lives such that ''I don't think either of them made major decisions without talking to her,'' Susan Sher said. 
 As Obama told me, ''We've seen each other through ups and downs.'' And for Jarrett, one such low point came in 1995, when she began to lose the mayor's support. Wounded, Jarrett bolted for the real estate development firm Habitat -- only to have Daley ask her to keep a foot in the public sector by offering her the post of chairwoman at the Chicago Transit Board. She accepted. Soon other boards beckoned, including the University of Chicago Medical Center and the Chicago Stock Exchange. Habitat made her an executive vice president. By 2002, it was as if the city had awakened one morning to find that Valerie Jarrett had taken over. For Barack Obama, her arrival was right on schedule.
 ''It was a lousy idea,'' Jarrett said as she recalled the decision by Obama, then a state senator, to run for U.S. Senate after he was trounced two years earlier in a bid for Congress. ''He called and said: 'I want to come over. Let's invite my closest friends. There's something I want to bounce off of you.' 
 ''Well, Michelle had already told me what it was. She said, 'So we're not in favor of this, right?' 'Absolutely not!' 'That's the right answer!' We conspired against it for all the obvious reasons. He'd just lost to Bobby Rush. He'd have to raise a ton of cash, and he didn't have it. The field was unknown. He would have to travel all over the state. Michelle hadn't been happy about him going off to Springfield, so the thought of him being away more with these two young children was not terribly appealing to her. And she didn't really think he could win.
 ''So I cooked breakfast for him, Marty [Nesbitt], John [Rogers, an investment banker and close friend], Michelle and me. And rather than do what he normally does, which is going around the room and say, 'What do you think?' he said: 'I want to run for U.S. Senate. Let me tell you why. I've talked to [the veteran state senator] Emil Jones, he's a huge political force and he's prepared to support me. When I ran for Congress I didn't have that kind of support. And if I lose, then Michelle, I'll give up politics.' (She's like, 'Yes!') 'If I can't do it this time, I promise I'll get a normal job in the private sector, so this'll be the last time I ask you to do this -- unless I win. And money's a problem, so Valerie I think you should help me because you're in the business community, you and John. You two should think about helping me do this.'
 ''And he did this obviously far more eloquently and for 10 minutes or so. So I said, 'So, what if you lose?' He said: 'If I'm not worried about losing, why are you? If I lose, I lose. But I think I'll win.' He didn't convince me he'd win at that moment. He convinced me that it was worth a try -- and that therefore he could. Which is always where he's kind of been able to get me.'' 
 Over the ensuing five years, the role Jarrett played in Obama's political ascent was important but also confined. For his senatorial campaign, she made key introductions to the donor community, which helped the underfinanced candidate achieve legitimacy among a field of well-financed competitors. (At the same time, Jarrett did not dissuade Obama from involvement with the developer and influence peddler Tony Rezko, whom she regarded as ''a snake,'' according to a friend.) She was among the handful of close advisers who met in the Chicago office of the political strategist David Axelrod at the close of 2006 to carry on a rolling discussion of the risks entailed in a presidential run. And during the first six months of Obama's presidential campaign, Jarrett remained in constant contact with him but otherwise stayed in Chicago to run Habitat -- she had become chief executive in January -- and the Chicago Stock Exchange. 
 That arrangement began to change on the evening of July 17, 2007, when Obama again convened a meeting at Jarrett's Chicago town house. The presidential campaign was not gaining traction in the national polls, and several of Obama's associates openly fretted that the emphasis on winning Iowa and the other early states had come at the expense of building a broad base of support across the map. The candidate was also not happy about fielding so many calls from African-American leaders who were critical of the campaign's ''postracial'' demeanor. ''Lots of things were bubbling up, and no one was really handling issues that would arise, either in Chicago [at headquarters] or on the road,'' says Penny Pritzker, who was one of the meeting's participants and the campaign's finance chairwoman. ''You needed another smart, capable, really close adviser involved who could play a bridging role. Valerie was the perfect solution.'' 
 Not everyone would agree with Pritzker. Though the Obama campaign possessed scarcely a fraction of the melodrama afflicting John McCain's operation, tension when it did exist tended to revolve around Jarrett. She never actually moved into headquarters, ''and that was good and that was bad,'' says the White House senior adviser, Pete Rouse, who at that time was Senator Obama's chief of staff. ''In the campaign, that she was sort of outside and free-floating complicated things at times.'' Jarrett's ambiguous role particularly annoyed the campaign manager, David Plouffe, who, several campaign sources say, did not care for her. Jarrett and Plouffe tangled over issues ranging from where the campaign should be spending its money to where the candidate should be spending his time. Outside advisers who could not persuade Plouffe on a matter knew they could then turn to Jarrett as a ''court of appeals,'' according to a campaign official. 
 Today Plouffe offers unqualified praise for Jarrett's work as a campaign surrogate but says, ''She wasn't terribly involved in strategic issues.'' This is probably true -- but only because the campaign did not consider the matter of race to be a ''strategic issue.'' On this subject, Jarrett consistently and forcibly weighed in. It was Jarrett, several aides say, who helped convince otherwise skeptical senior staff members that Michelle Obama should go to South Carolina in November 2007 and give a speech addressing fears in the African-American community that harm might come to the black candidate. It was Jarrett who strongly encouraged Barack Obama to give his race speech -- convinced when other senior advisers were not, says Dr. Eric Whitaker, a close friend of Obama, ''that he could actually pull off the speech,'' and that in the wake of the incendiary Jeremiah Wright tapes, now was the time to do it. Numerous campaign officials credit Jarrett, along with the communications director Anita Dunn and Stephanie Cutter, Michelle Obama's chief of staff, for helping to rehabilitate Mrs. Obama's angry-black-woman image. (Three staff members say Jarrett encouraged the future first lady to focus on military families.) According to Clifford Franklin, one of the campaign's African-American media consultants, ''Having Valerie at the table kept African-Americans and Hispanics and women at the forefront of our outreach -- where before it had been an afterthought.'' 
 As Obama told me, the opportunities afforded him and Jarrett by their predecessors in the civil rights movement gave them both ''a shared sense of obligation.'' To her and the Obamas, failing to acknowledge the racial dimension of the 2008 campaign constituted dereliction of duty, even if silence on the subject was considered politically expedient by other senior campaign staff members. A moment of truth occurred last July, when the candidate predicted to a Missouri crowd that his opponents would be focusing on how Obama ''doesn't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.'' Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager fired back that Obama had ''played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck.'' Momentarily flummoxed, the Obama campaign responded with a tepid insistence by Gibbs that the senator was merely ''describing that he was new to the political scene.'' 
 ''But within the campaign, Valerie had been saying, 'You guys, you're not getting this issue right,' '' recalls a top official. ''And Obama communicated to his senior advisers that he thought we were a little gun-shy on race issues; that the reality was, he did look different. There were also African-Americans on our staff, some in relatively senior positions, who were clearly upset that we had not consulted them in the response. And she actually organized a meeting to discuss it.
 ''And that's not just a process thing,'' the adviser said. ''Because moving forward, the candidate made it very clear to us that we were just a bunch of white people who didn't get it -- which, by the way, was true.'' 
 That Obama required the presence of someone who did ''get it'' inevitably meant that he would want Jarrett in the White House. (''Of course!'' Jarrett remembers Obama's wife exclaiming back in September 2007. ''Hasn't he said anything to you yet?'') Last July, however, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois floated an intriguing alternative -- namely, that Jarrett consider filling the Senate seat that would be vacated by Obama should he win the presidency. The notion gained enthusiastic support from different quarters. To her friends and family, becoming a U.S. senator would allow her to flourish on her own. To less admiring colleagues in the Obama campaign, it meant that they would not have to deal with her in the White House. 
 Jarrett discussed her options with the Obamas the weekend before the election. The candidate was typically analytical. Michelle was not. Jarrett says: ''She came down very hard, saying that's not what she wanted me to do. She said, 'We need you in the White House.' You have to understand. This is right before the election. We're all really nervous. We knew by that point that chances are he's gonna win. She's about to embark on this entirely new episode in her life. And her attitude was like: 'You've come all this way, and you thought this was a good idea, and now you're gonna bail on me? No way!' '' 
 A few days after the election, the president-elect told his new chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, ''I want her inside the White House.'' Those who knew Obama understood what motivated his decision. How the decision would play out was less predictable. As one close adviser would say: ''It's like bringing in a family member. You can say all you want that they'll be held accountable and that you'll treat them like anybody else. But you can't.''
 One day this past December, Jarrett and her new chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis (formerly a paralegal at the firm where Michelle Obama worked), met in the West Wing with the Bush administration political strategist Barry Jackson. Two of the offices under Jackson's purview -- public liaison and intergovernmental affairs -- were about to become Jarrett's responsibility. After a cordial discussion about the duties she would inherit, Jarrett thanked Jackson and left the building. Strautmanis stayed to finish the meeting. Except for the Roosevelt Room, he had never seen the West Wing before and wondered if Jackson would mind showing him around. Jackson was happy to do so, and they spent a few moments walking the halls. Within a couple of days, Rahm Emanuel himself visited the West Wing to confer with his counterpart, the Bush chief of staff Joshua Bolten. In the course of their conversation, Bolten told Emanuel that Jarrett had been by, looking at office space.
 Emanuel was not happy to learn this. He confronted Jarrett, and today he says: ''There was a misunderstanding. . . . It wasn't a dust-up.'' As it would develop, Pete Rouse and Jim Messina, the deputy chief of staff, assigned Jarrett the airy second-floor office suite formerly commandeered by Karl Rove and before that the first lady, Hillary Clinton. But Emanuel's reaction, at bottom, had little to do with West Wing real estate. Instead, it conveyed the understandable wariness with which the other top Obama advisers greeted the only one among them who could claim to be a close personal friend of both the president and the first lady. 
 When I asked Emanuel what advice he gave Obama on Jarrett's role in the White House, he smirked and replied, ''My two cents to the president stays my two cents to the president.''
 ''Can you give me one cent?'' I asked.
 ''One cent,'' Emanuel said, ''was: 'If you do it, this will be unique, so here are the upsides and downsides we've got to be conscious of. This will be different.' He said, 'That's fine, but this is how I would like to do it.' '' 
 According to Jarrett, Obama urged her to take on a concretely defined profile, saying, ''You don't just want to come in as my friend, because you could be marginalized.'' Rouse suggested the same solution but voiced the opposite concern. He recalls telling her, ''If you don't have line responsibility, you tend to wander, swim outside your own lane and get into other people's work and irritate people and complicate things.'' 
 Jarrett herself could recognize the potential complications, according to her chief of staff. ''She said that one thing she doesn't want is for people to believe that she would use her relationship with the president and leverage it against them,'' Strautmanis told me. ''It would be natural for people to have their radar up for that. And I think she's been successful at establishing to the rest of the senior staff that they can trust her -- that she's not going to back-channel them to the president, that she doesn't want to be a mini-chief of staff.'' 
 ''This town loves and is dying for a whiff of a Rahm/Valerie power struggle,'' Cecilia Munoz, Jarrett's director of intergovernmental affairs, says. ''And there isn't one.'' Certainly that is the case when compared with the gladiatorial clashes within previous administrations. But things have not been seamless between the two -- and Munoz would know, since Emanuel had lobbied her to take the intergovernmental-affairs job without even discussing the matter with Munoz's actual boss to be, Jarrett, who at that point had never spoken with Munoz. The chief of staff has since been respectful of Jarrett's turf, and the two get along ''better than anyone's expectations,'' as Martin Nesbitt delicately puts it. Still, Emanuel talks to a lot of people around town, and when the subject is Valerie Jarrett, it's fair to say that his words fall short of effusive. Their opposing qualities -- deliberateness and sensitivity in Jarrett; speed and brutal practicality in Emanuel -- may reside harmonically in Barack Obama. But what the two aides represent isn't simply a function of velocity or decibel level. While both of them obviously want the president to succeed, Emanuel's criteria for ''success'' are straightforward. Jarrett, according to Munoz, is ''very focused on why he ran in the first place'' -- a psychological calculation that only Jarrett would presume to undertake and which therefore is bound to drive others nuts. 
 ''We have kind of a mind meld,'' Jarrett told me about Obama. ''And chances are, what he wants to do is what I'd want to do.'' Jarrett's discernment of What Barack Wants has sometimes found her taking unorthodox positions. In recent weeks, senior staff members have fought among themselves over an executive memorandum relating to the Recovery Act. Section 3 of this memo severely restricts contact with White House officials by registered lobbyists to discuss specific stimulus projects. Jarrett has argued that this requirement, while virtuous in theory, means that certain disadvantaged communities -- represented, for example, by civil rights organizations whose directors happen to be registered lobbyists -- will not be heard. ''So there are these tough meetings,'' one participant says, ''where there are some very strong, very male voices basically saying, 'The president said we were going to do it this way, and we have to do it this way, come hell or high water.' And Valerie is one of a group of folks who are saying: 'You know what? We said we were going to try it. We said we were going to see how it's going to go. And we need to make sure we do this in a way that's ultimately consistent with the values we brought to Washington and making sure that we accomplish what we set out to accomplish.' '' 
 When I asked Obama if he runs every decision past her, he answered without hesitation: ''Yep. Absolutely.'' Some of their Oval Office one-on-ones find Jarrett -- whose acute familiarity with the business community is unique in the West Wing -- playing the impersonal role of trusted financial counselor, the president told me. ''Throughout, for example, the debates taking place on how to deal with the financial crisis, I would sit down and get her read in terms of how we strike the appropriate balance between intervention to stem panic and not being so heavy-handed that we were changing in fundamental ways the nature of our free-market economy,'' he said. ''And her experience as a businesswoman and contacts with C.E.O.'s around the country was very helpful.'' 
 But many of their conversations are far less clinical. Obama as president unburdens himself to his sibling/adviser just as he did while anguishing his way through the writing of ''Dreams From My Father.'' Jarrett shares his scorn for Beltway insularity and, attuned as she is to his determination not to lose touch with everyday American life, she usually accompanies him to town-hall events. Recalling a flight back on Air Force One with Obama after one such gathering, Jarrett told me: ''He talked about -- there was one family, nine people in the family lost their jobs. We talked about, 'What does that do? You can't even rely on your relatives, no support network.' We always go through the day's stories and talk about what touched either of us.'' 
 It's hard to imagine Obama conducting that kind of empathy session with Emanuel, Gibbs or even Axelrod. ''She and Axelrod are the two he's closest to but in very different ways,'' a friend of both advisers said. ''He gets brilliant political advice from David, and from Valerie he gets wisdom.'' When I asked Axelrod himself to explain how Jarrett's counsel might prove uniquely valuable to the president, he squinted a little and said: ''Well, first of all I think, I mean, he is more likely to come to her with issues of personal concern -- family issues, because he has a full plate and she's also a very close friend. It's important to have people like that around.''
 ''Can you recall a particular moment when she's been that person for him?'' I prodded.
 The strategist assumed his basset-hound countenance. ''There are issues all the time, but, uh, I'm trying to think of some that I would share with you. Because you know the nature of this is that there aren't that many I want to share because of. . . . I need to think about it.''
 Evidently Axelrod does not see in her the utility that Obama does. A weekly Wednesday-night gathering at Axelrod's house -- to discuss what one participant describes as ''hard-core politics'' -- pointedly excludes Jarrett. Otherwise, she attends pretty much whatever she wishes. Though her portfolio -- overseeing the Office of Public Engagement (formerly Public Liasion), the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the newly created Office of Urban Affairs -- is dauntingly packed, her chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis, told me that he sees his job as ''to run her office so that she can play that advisory role with the president.'' Jarrett therefore has wide latitude over how she spends her day. She assisted her friend Desiree Rogers in selecting a chef for the White House's Cinco de Mayo reception. Practically on a whim, she spent a day with Michelle Obama in Manhattan and that night donned a black gown to accompany the first lady to Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People gala.
 That Jarrett can pick and choose among meetings and priorities does not exactly ingratiate her with her White House colleagues. On one hand, she has devoted enormous energy to helping Chicago's campaign for the 2016 Olympic Games -- even pledging, rather ostentatiously, to personally direct a department out of the White House that would assist the Games' operations in her hometown. By contrast, Jarrett has shown little interest in the White House effort to bring the World Cup soccer tournament to the United States in 2018 or 2022. More bothersome to her colleagues was that she seldom attended the senior staff briefings leading up to the Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, even though it was long understood that Jarrett would be on the front lines when the rollout of Sotomayor proceeded. 
 Still, the Obamas clearly benefit from Jarrett's ability to freelance. In the early months of the administration, she often stepped in to assist the understaffed Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, by communicating with jittery chief executives in the financial-services sector. When Michelle Obama decided last month to beef up her first-lady portfolio, Jarrett slid over to the East Wing to lend a hand. She organized a dinner of the presidential historians Robert Caro, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Michael Beschloss, Douglas Brinkley, Robert Dallek and Garry Wills with her and the Obamas at the White House residence on June 29. And two days later, Jarrett was at the president's side to moderate a health care town-hall meeting in Annandale, Va. 
 When I asked Michelle Obama's chief of staff, Susan Sher, if she had seen Jarrett's advisory role evolve in ways not anticipated, she smiled abashedly. What she didn't appreciate then but did now, Sher said, was ''how incredibly instrumental she'll be in virtually everything.'' 
 ''Where's my picture?'' Valerie Jarrett exclaimed, addressing no one in particular. She stood up from the conference-room table in her office and walked over to the bookshelf. ''They brought these to me today.''
 She handed me two unframed prints. The first was of Jarrett standing on a staircase with a familiar-looking yellow creature. ''I spent five years of my daughter's life watching 'Sesame Street,' '' she said fondly -- and indeed, in the photograph with Big Bird, Jarrett wore a meek smile as if in the presence of childhood royalty.
 The image I turned to next was no less odd. It featured five figures seated on the couches and chairs of the Oval Office: the president, Jarrett, the Rev. Al Sharpton, the former Republican House speaker Newt Gingrich and the New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Standing over me, and in a voice no less sentimental than before, Jarrett said, ''I love that photo.'' 
 That unlikely meeting -- which took place two days after her and Michelle Obama's appearance on the set of ''Sesame Street'' -- had been arranged by Jarrett. Sharpton, Gingrich and Bloomberg were part of a group convening in Washington to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education school-desegregation decision by promulgating education as a civil right (though with obvious disagreements among them as to just how this civil right would be advanced). Sharpton had contacted Jarrett to see if a few of them could meet privately with the president so as to obtain the strong backing of Arne Duncan, the secretary of education. At a White House senior staff meeting in the Oval Office, Jarrett brought up the idea of having Sharpton and a few others over to the Oval Office. 
 ''I liked the idea of getting this odd quartet together to come around an issue,'' Jarrett told me. ''Because it would show the American people that this is what the president is about, getting unlikely combinations together.''
 When I talked earlier to Robert Gibbs about the gathering, he mentioned something that I now relayed to Jarrett: ''If you would've started out a line by saying, 'Reverend Sharpton, Newt Gingrich and Mayor Bloomberg walked into the White House together,' I would've thought it was the start of a joke.'' But the press secretary had also said, ''I think it shows how important she thought that event was that it ultimately got on [Obama's] schedule.'' Of course, Gibbs wasn't exactly saying that he thought such a meeting was important -- which, judging by the measured smile on her face, Jarrett seemed to understand.
 Pressing the point anyway, I asked, ''If you hadn't suggested that this meeting take place, do you think anyone else would have suggested it?'' 
 Jarrett looked across the table at her friend, the White House communications director, Anita Dunn, who had dropped in on the interview. Dunn stopped taking notes and flashed Jarrett a look of abiding doubt. 
 ''Probably not,'' Jarrett then murmured.
 ''Probably not?'' exclaimed Dunn, who had been virtually silent until now. ''Absolutely not!'' 
 Dunn's outburst was freighted with a depth of appreciation that I had not picked up on elsewhere in the West Wing. Though Dunn is white, her words reminded me of the interviews I conducted with several African-Americans who had served at high levels in the Obama campaign. To them, Valerie Jarrett was something of a heroine. As they saw it, she got that Obama's work as a community organizer in poor black neighborhoods wasn't just a touching bit of back story but instead bespoke a personal commitment to change. She got the importance of campaigning for better schools and job opportunities for African-Americans, even if such talk wouldn't make red states turn blue. She got that simply electing a black man would not make all urban traumas disappear. And she got that Obama got it, that this was central to his ''authenticity'' of which she was guardian -- reminding the candidate, ''Barack Obama wouldn't say that.''
 Without Jarrett, these officials said they believed, their opinions and the often-legitimate concerns voiced by black leaders like Sharpton would have been thoroughly disregarded by the white-dominated senior staff. ''There's a cultural nuance that they just didn't get,'' one such African-American staff member told me. ''And the landscape of our campaign is littered with hundreds of stories where she intervened and voices got heard and decisions got made that might've gone a different way.'' 
 As to just how much difference Valerie Jarrett's various interventions had made, the staff member admitted he couldn't say. It wasn't for him to judge, anyway. That was between Obama and Jarrett.

HEADLINE: Chile's Antibiotics Use on Salmon Farms Dwarfs That of a Top Rival's

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: ASUNCION, Paraguay 

 BODY:
Chile used almost 350 times more antibiotics in its farmed salmon in 2008 than Norway, its chief competitor and the largest salmon producer in the world, according to official data from both countries. 
 Chile's Economy Ministry revealed this month that Chile used almost 718,000 pounds of antibiotics in 2008 and more than 850,000 pounds in 2007. 
 Based on information published by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, that was about 346 times the amount of antibiotics Norway used in 2008 (2,075 pounds), and almost 600 times the amount Norway used in 2007. 
 Chile's economy minister, Hugo Lavados, detailed Chile's use of antibiotics in salmon production in response to a request for information by the environmental group Oceana under the country's new information access law. It was the first time the government had released such figures publicly, environmental groups said.
 ''The ministry's numbers confirm that the Chilean salmon industry has abused the use of antibiotics,'' said Alex Munoz, Oceana's vice president for South America. ''They also show that the Chilean government has placed a higher priority on ensuring the profitability of a business sector than protecting consumers and the nation's ecosystems.'' 
 Chile, the world's second biggest salmon exporter, has been struggling since 2007 to contain the spread of a virus that is killing millions of its fish. The industry has said it needs the antibiotics to combat other fish-borne illnesses like rickettsia, parasitic bacteria carried by sea lice, which causes infection-prone lesions. Environmentalists have blamed unsanitary conditions, including cramped pens, for giving rise to the illnesses.
 In recent years Chile has been the biggest supplier of salmon to the United States. Some companies, including Safeway and, more recently, Wal-Mart, have reduced purchases of Chilean salmon because of concerns about the illnesses.
 Officials from SalmonChile, the industry group, could not be reached for comment on Sunday. In an interview on CNN Chile on Friday, Cesar Barros, president of SalmonChile, defended the use of antibiotics as necessary to prevent bacterial illnesses. He said that in Norway's early days of salmon farming it had used twice the amount of antibiotics that Chile is using, before eventually developing vaccines to deal with its illnesses. 
 ''You have to use antibiotics so that the fish don't die,'' Mr. Barros said in the interview.
 The information from the Economy Ministry showed about one-third of the antibiotics being used in Chile corresponded to antibiotics from the quinolone family, which are not approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Last year the F.D.A. cited three salmon companies operating in Chile, including a Norwegian company, for using unapproved antibiotics and other unapproved drugs.

HEADLINE: Internship Is Secured, But a Seat? That's Tricky

BYLINE: By SIMON AKAM

 BODY:
Susan Cho's internship at the Kings County district attorney's office this summer has presented some different challenges than her previous stint working alongside prosecutors in Rochester. ''There's sometimes trouble finding a seat,'' Ms. Cho, 26, who is soon to be a second-year student at Villanova University School of Law, said of her spell at 350 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn. 
 Last summer, 135 law students toiled as unpaid interns with the Brooklyn district attorney. This year there are 195 -- a number that Carol L. Moran, the director of legal hiring, believes is a record. 
 The bumper crop of interns, whose placements end July 31, is the result of an increase in both applications and the percentage of students who accepted offers, most likely a fallout of the recession, as many corporate law firms have cut back on their summer programs. In addition to the intensified competition to score a full-time -- and paid -- job after graduation, the intern glut has put a premium on office chairs, desk space and meaty assignments. 
 ''It's much harder for them to find stuff for us to do,'' said one intern who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating his bosses. ''Definitely some people feel they haven't done anything.'' 
 Ms. Moran, the hiring director, said the Brooklyn office received about 500 applications for this summer's positions, up from 400 in 2008. ''We made close to 200 offers last year, and ended up with 135,'' she said. ''This year we made slightly more offers -- close to 250. I was looking for 150 interns, and ended up with 195.''
 Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said the glut ''appears to be economy related,'' saying that fewer students this year asked to defer the decision to accept an unpaid internship -- which many did in the past while waiting to see if they had snared lucrative employment. 
 The Queens district attorney has also seen an uptick in interns, with 83 (from 60 last year); but Manhattan (about 50) and the Bronx (20) have their usual number this summer. A spokesman for the Staten Island district attorney said the office had seen more interest, but kept hiring stable, at 27, to ensure proper supervision and space. 
 The popular internships come amid a brutal legal job market: according to the National Association for Legal Career Professionals, the employment rate for 2008 graduates -- 90 percent as of February 2009 -- represented the first decrease since 2003. 
 ''We know law firms hired smaller groups of summer associates,'' said James G. Leipold, the group's executive director. ''There's a lot of competition for a smaller number of opportunities.''
 Meg Reuter, assistant dean for career planning at New York Law School, said that while students are considering the public sector as an alternative to scarce corporate work, such jobs are not immune to economic conditions. 
 ''The federal government can deficit spend, so they can hire even when they don't have the tax revenue, but state and local government cannot,'' she said. 
 In Brooklyn, Ms. Moran said that although about 75 percent of the lawyers on Jay Street had once been interns, only a few of this summer's cohort would get job offers. She said the office was now hiring about 7 to 8 percent of applicants, down from 10 to 12 percent in previous years.
 Those who supervise interns, and some of the interns themselves, said there has been enough work to go around. ''I do research, draft motions, call witnesses,'' said Venice Choi, 22, who is working in the homicide bureau.
 But other interns pass the hours doing crossword puzzles or playing games on the computer; some have taken to observing random court proceedings to fill their days. 
 Surviving an unpaid summer in New York is another challenge. Some interns received grants from their schools -- typically about $5,000 -- intended to support students with an interest in public interest law. Others are living with relatives or working at paid jobs in May and August to make ends meet. 
 ''I'm receiving credit,'' said Stephanie Mishler, an intern in the homicide bureau who will start her second year at Seton Hall University School of Law this fall. ''It'll pay off in the long run.''
 The swell of interns has helped in at least one area: On Wednesday evening, the rackets division took on the green zone trial bureau in a softball game at Prospect Park, and each team fielded a brace of students. 
 Before the game, John Rudikoff, an assistant district attorney, said that one of the rackets interns, Evan Gidez, 24, soon to be a third-year student at Brooklyn Law School, had already proved his worth on the field. 
 ''In the first game Evan made an amazing catch; he's an excellent ballplayer,'' Mr. Rudikoff said. ''We didn't know that, but it would have given us even more reason to hire him.''

HEADLINE: Who's That on the Court? For $295, We'll Tell You

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
After driving three hours to watch a basketball recruit play a game at a tournament in Memphis earlier this month, Vanderbilt Coach Kevin Stallings turned around minutes later and went home.
 Just after sitting down with some fellow college coaches, two tournament employees told Stallings that he had to pay $295 for a packet of rosters and information that doubled as an admission fee for college coaches. The coaches in attendance told him that they had been required to do the same thing. 
 Stallings said he had paid a $10 admission fee and did not want or need the packet, so he hit the road out of principle.
 Ryan Luttrell, the tournament organizer, denied trying to force Stallings to buy the packet. But Stallings said he would not cut a deal with Luttrell and left because it would not be fair to the other coaches. 
 ''I'm not protesting or insisting that my moral compass is better than anyone else,'' Stallings said. ''But mine won't allow me to do something like that that is that blatantly wrong.''
 Tournament organizers and summer basketball coaches have long charged significant fees for packets of information about potential Division I recruits -- player rosters, phone numbers and e-mail addresses -- that are the lifeblood of the billion-dollar college basketball business.
 But with the economy sagging, college recruiting budgets being slashed and tournaments in the April recruiting period being eliminated because of an N.C.A.A. rule change, the costs and the complaints have risen sharply this summer.
 Coaches have been especially irate at tournaments where the packet is a mandatory part of admission, in some cases making it cost hundreds of dollars to watch one game. They point to the N.C.A.A., which approves all the tournaments coaches can attend, as an enabler.
 Not all packet purchases double as admission costs. But this week in Las Vegas, where five tournaments featured thousands of players, the packet costs ranged from $180 to $275, with cash being preferred.
 A black market of bootleg packets and copies of receipts flourished so freely that tournament directors policed copy centers to prevent coaches from making duplicates. At numerous events this summer, coaches have changed out of their university-logoed shirts to watch games disguised as fans to save hundreds of dollars.
 ''It's a crazy racket,'' said Yale Coach James Jones, who once paid $350 to watch one player play a single game in South Carolina. His other option was to buy the tournament organizer Jeff Schneider's $600 recruiting service. 
 ''It's extortion,'' Jones said.
 Stallings's experience offers a window into the complicated subculture of recruiting. The Memphis tournament, called the River City Showdown, was put on in part by a local Amateur Athletic Union program, the Memphis Magic. Stallings said Luttrell, one of the tournament's organizers, told him that part of the $295 was going to help ship the Memphis Magic A.A.U. team around the country to play in other tournaments.
 Many college coaches pay the fees because they do not want to alienate the teams' coaches, who often control the recruiting of their players.
 Luttrell denied the tournament was a direct fund-raiser for the Memphis Magic but said he was hired to put on the tournament by Eric Robinson, who runs the Memphis Magic program.
 Stallings said that college coaches directly supporting a summer basketball program in which prospects are playing is, ''by definition,'' a violation of N.C.A.A. rules. ''If I'm knowingly giving you money, I'm not allowed to do that,'' Stallings said. ''It's really an indirect funneling of money to summer programs, which again is not what the institutions should be doing.''
 While not all tournaments have direct financial relationships with summer basketball teams, most coaches are keeping their thoughts to themselves. While many coaches agreed that the cost of tournament packets was egregious, few spoke on the record. Those who declined included the Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, the U.C.L.A. Coach Ben Howland and the Ohio State Coach Thad Matta. ''It's one of the important things on our agenda,'' said Michigan Coach John Beilein, the head of the N.C.A.A.'s new Ethics Coalition. ''That's all I'm going to say.''
 Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo refused to pay $100 for admission to the Summer Jam tournament in Milwaukee earlier this month after one of his assistants had already paid $250 for the packet that doubled as an entry fee. Izzo said the tournament director should visit him if he had a problem.
 Antonio Curro, the tournament director, defended his prices, saying that he provided food for the tournament coaches and that he needed to feed his family. Curro also cited the costs of gym rental, employees and referees. He said that three coaches sneaked into the gym to avoid paying the $250 and that he made them purchase the packet because bootlegs were so prevalent.
 ''Everything we did was legitimate by the N.C.A.A.,'' he said. ''There is no rule for anyone setting the price.''
 The N.C.A.A. spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said, ''It is misleading for event organizers to state that the N.C.A.A. allows them to charge elevated prices.''
 While Izzo confirmed the story about the Milwaukee tournament, he declined further comment. His silence and the hesitancy of other prominent coaches to speak underscores the importance of their relationships with summer basketball programs.
 ''That's exactly what's wrong with our business,'' Stallings said. ''There's a mentality where coaches want to cover themselves and not get out there and say what's right and call out the people that are wrong.
 ''That's precisely why things are the way they are. That's why we have culture issues in our game. It's a darn shame. The people who could have influence and do have a voice, they choose not to use it because it doesn't help them. They don't want anything unsettling their smooth little boat ride.'' 
 Traditionally strong programs rarely need the expensive packets. Universities like North Carolina, Texas and Connecticut rarely recruit more than a dozen players, so they're already familiar with them. 
 At the other end of the spectrum, Texas-Pan American Coach Ryan Marks, whose recruiting budget is $25,000, needs the packets to identify and reach out to undiscovered players. ''We could spend a fifth of our recruiting budget on packets in July alone,'' he said.
 While the packets usually cost hundreds of dollars, they rarely have pertinent information, like players' jersey numbers.
 ''I refuse to pay $250 for a blank piece of paper,'' the Louisville assistant Steve Masiello said.
 Still, the packets and the issues surrounding them have become an accepted part of the recruiting process.
 ''The N.C.A.A. should get involved,'' Jones said. ''These events have to be sanctioned. They need to have these guys validate some of the things they're doing.''

HEADLINE: Impact of Health Care Measures

BYLINE: By FARHANA HOSSAIN

 BODY:
Three health care bills are working their way through Congress. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions approved its bill this month. Two House committees have approved bills, and a third is still working. The Senate Finance Committee is also working on a plan. Many decisions have yet to be made and the details are in flux. Health care options vary by state, making it difficult to gauge the proposals' impact on various groups. Below, some of the ways the measures will affect certain types of households.
 Unemployed, single woman ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME $14,000 AGE 24 DEPENDENT CHILDREN None HEALTH STATUS Healthy
 Uninsured She was a dependent on her parents' employer-sponsored insurance plan until she graduated from college (Rules and age limits for dependents under employer plans vary by state.) Childless adults are generally not eligible for Medicaid under current rules. 
 She could qualify for Medicaid, which would be open to individuals with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level ($14,400 a year for an individual). She could stay on her parents' plan through age 26. She would also be eligible for Medicaid. The proposal would expand the program to all individuals with incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty line ($16,245 a year for an individual).
 Self-employed, single man ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME $28,000 AGE 42 DEPENDENT CHILDREN None HEALTH STATUS Recently had a heart attack
 Uninsured As a self-employed person, he would not have access to group coverage in most states. Group coverage is generally more affordable and is prohibited from denying coverage on account of a person's health status. If he wanted to buy insurance, many plans might deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of his heart condition.
 He could receive subsidies to buy health insurance from a health insurance exchange, which, under both proposals, would offer a menu of private plans and a public plan. His out-of-pocket medical expenses would also be capped at a share of his income. Insurers could not charge higher premiums or deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. If he still cannot afford to buy insurance, he may be eligible to apply for a hardship waiver. The bills do not specify standards for the waivers.
 Employed, single mother ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME $38,000 AGE 34 DEPENDENT CHILDREN Two; under six years of age HEALTH STATUS Healthy
 Uninsured Employer does not offer health benefits and the family cannot afford private insurance. The children and their mother are not eligible for coverage under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program. In general, families with income above 200 percent of poverty are not eligible for the public programs in most states. 
 The family could receive assistance to buy insurance from an exchange and out-of-pocket medical costs would be capped. Democrats say an exchange, and a public plan, could stimulate competition among insurers and hold down premiums. If the family still cannot afford to buy insurance, they could apply for a hardship waiver.
 Employed, married couple ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME $125,000 AGE Husband 33, wife 35 DEPENDENT CHILDREN None HEALTH STATUS Healthy
 Insured The couple receives health benefits from an employer.
 The couple could keep their current plan. Employer-sponsored health plans would have to meet certain standards of coverage within five years of the the bill's enactment. The couple could keep their current plan, which would not be immediately affected by the legislation. Current plans might have to meet new coverage standards if they made significant changes in benefits or cost-sharing.
 Small business owner, married couple ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME $70,000 AGE Husband 50; wife 48 DEPENDENT CHILDREN A 17-year-old HEALTH STATUS Wife has high blood pressure 
 Family is insured The family buys health insurance, but the wife's hypertension drives up the cost of coverage. This year, a typical American household spent roughly $15,000 on health care. Employees are uninsured The couple owns a furniture store that employs five people and has an annual payroll of $150,000. They do not offer insurance to their employees.
 The couple may pay less in premiums because the proposals would limit the ability of insurers to charge higher rates because of health status, gender and other factors. The family could also buy insurance for themselves, and their employees, through the exchange. The family will most likely be required to have insurance or pay:About $1,282 in penalty (2.5 percent of adjusted gross income over a certain level, which is $18,700 for a couple). About $2,250 in penalty ($750 for a person). The couple would not be required to provide insurance to their employees, or help with premiums because the business's annual payroll is less than $250,000. the business employs fewer than 25 people. If they buy insurance for employees through the exchange: They could receive a tax credit to help pay the premium costs. Credits are available to employers with 25 or fewer employees and average wages of $40,000 or less. The amount, up to 50 percent of premium costs, phases down as employer size increases. They could receive a tax credit of up to $1,000 for a single employee and $2,000 for family coverage, if they pay at least 60 percent of their employees' premiums. The credit would be available to employers with 50 or fewer full-time workers for up to three consecutive years. The amount would phase down as employer size increases.
 Business owner and executive, married couple ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME $1 million AGE Both 60 DEPENDENT CHILDREN None HEALTH STATUS Healthy
 Family is insured The couple receives health benefits from the wife's employer. Employees are uninsured The husband's restaurant employs 15 people and has an annual payroll of $400,000. The business does not offer health insurance to the employees.
 The couple could keep their current plan. They would pay $9,000 in surtax (imposed on couples with an adjusted gross income above $350,000). The husband's business would have to offer full-time employees insurance or pay $24,000 -- 6 percent of the payroll -- to help finance coverage for them (Employers with an annual payroll of more than $400,000 would pay 8 percent of wages). He could buy insurance at the exchange a year after it is established. The exchange would be open to employers with 10 or fewer employees in the first year and 20 or fewer in the second year, and possibly to larger employers over time. The couple could keep their current plan. The husband's business would not have to offer health benefits to its employees. The proposal requires employers with 25 or more workers to contribute at least 60 percent of the premium costs for their full-time employees or pay a penalty of $750 for each full-time worker and $375 for each part-time worker.

HEADLINE: Mexico Wins Gold Cup, Ending Drought in U.S.

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
It may have fielded a mostly B-list roster, but Mexico unleashed an A-list celebration Sunday after defeating the United States on the road for the first time in a decade to win the Gold Cup with a dominating 5-0 victory.
 Although the second-tier American team was humiliated before a pro-Mexico crowd of 79,156 -- apparently the largest soccer crowd at Giants Stadium -- the outcome is likely to have little effect on the Aug. 12 World Cup qualifying match between the two countries at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. 
 ''You can't carry history with you,'' Javier Aguirre, Mexico's coach, said. ''Aug. 12 is a completely different game.''
 Both teams, the United States in particular, are expected to significantly alter their lineups for the qualifying match. But that mattered little Sunday. After struggling to defeat the Americans anywhere but Azteca, with its 7,200-foot altitude, Mexico desperately needed the cathartic victory it experienced in the Gold Cup final.
 This was Mexico's first win against the United States outside Mexico City since March 13, 1999. Since then, Mexico had experienced nine defeats and two ties against the Americans away from home, including a 2-0 loss in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea.
 Sunday, all of Mexico's goals came during a furiously counterattacking second half. The first four were delivered or facilitated by a pair of 20-year-old forwards, Giovani dos Santos and Carlos Vela. They have struggled to get regular playing time with their British club teams -- dos Santos with Tottenham and Vela with Arsenal -- but both were too fast and creative for the Americans, who wilted in the heat.
 So after failing to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and placing its qualification for the 2010 World Cup in jeopardy, Mexico rebounded Sunday to reclaim the championship of the North American, Central American and Caribbean region.
 The win in Mexico's national sport also brought some temporary good news to a country struggling with a cratered economy, a swine flu epidemic and murderous drug wars. For Mexico's coach and players, who have come under enormous pressure from fans and the news media for their fumbling performances during World Cup qualification, Sunday's victory will buy some good will, at least until Aug. 12. 
 ''It gives us a lot of confidence,'' dos Santos said. ''This win was a huge step forward. We've been working very hard despite a lot of criticism. We showed pride and a lot of heart today. Fans, like the media, will now believe in the national team.''
 The United States played Sunday without Landon Donovan, Tim Howard and virtually every other regular player. Still, the defeat was embarrassing and gave the American reserves a harsh lesson about their international standing. The United States had not lost by 5-0 since a defeat to England in 1985 and had not surrendered five goals since a 5-1 defeat to the former Czechoslovakia in the 1990 World Cup.
 In a dull first half, neither team managed a shot on goal. But Vela came on to open the second half, and the game changed almost immediately, as Mexico began to show more speed and urgency. In the 56th minute, Vela played a pass into the penalty area to dos Santos, who was yanked down by defender Jay Heaps. 
 Mexico was awarded a penalty kick, and the captain Gerardo Torrado confidently placed the ball into the upper-right portion of the net for a 1-0 lead. The score quickly snowballed as the Americans regularly gave the ball away and their defense was stretched.
 In the 62nd minute, a rebound shot by dos Santos made it 2-0. On a counterattack in the 67th minute, dos Santos passed to Vela, who chipped a shot over the charging American goalkeeper Troy Perkins. The score began to roll up like prices on a gas pump.
 ''Look at anybody in the United States and this loss has to anger you,'' the American forward Brian Ching said.
 Now comes the rematch. The United States is 0-22-1 in Mexico. But never has Mexico appeared so vulnerable at Azteca, where it has lost only one World Cup qualifier -- to Costa Rica in 2001.
 With half of the final round of World Cup qualifying remaining, Mexico sits in fourth place in the region; the Americans are second. The first three teams automatically qualify for next year's World Cup in South Africa, and the fourth team enters a playoff against the fifth-place team from South America. A loss to the United States in August could be as crippling as Sunday's victory was uplifting.
 ''Pressure exists today, and it will always exist,'' Aguirre said. ''Tonight I will sleep well. Tomorrow, the pressure begins again.''

HEADLINE: Of Banks and Bonuses

 BODY:
Earlier this month, when Goldman Sachs reported record quarterly profits -- and prepared to pay juicy bonuses -- it was widely, and correctly, noted that the firm was leading the way back to a future in which outsized pay for short-term gains could once again foster excessive risk taking. 
 Sure enough, last week, Morgan Stanley explained its quarterly loss by saying that some of its traders were still ''gun shy'' after last year's near-death experience in the financial markets, but that the firm now planned to increase its risk taking. To try to stay competitive with Goldman and other banks, Morgan Stanley has also allocated a big chunk of its net revenue for compensation. 
 This from a couple of firms that 1) probably wouldn't even be around today were it not for ongoing government rescues of the financial system and 2) by dint of being too big to fail, now enjoy an implicit guarantee of future bailouts if their bets go wrong. The financial system may be stabilizing for now, but the danger to taxpayers if markets were to buckle again is at least as great as ever. 
 Financial regulatory reform is supposed to control that danger. For example, both the Obama administration's proposal and ideas from Congressional committees sensibly call for banks to hold more capital with which to absorb losses. A wise variation on that basic notion is that the bigger the bank, the higher the capital requirement should be. Insurance premiums paid to the government could also increase along with a bank's size. Such provisions would create incentives for banks to limit their size and in so doing, reduce the risk they pose to the system. 
 The problem is that the bonus-driven risk culture is reasserting itself now, while comprehensive reform will probably take until next year, if it occurs at all. A solution is for Congress to handle bankers' compensation as a stand-alone issue, as the House Financial Services Committee has said it is ready to do. There is no question about the need to end the perverse incentives that helped to set off the financial crisis. There is ample, and justified, anger among Americans about outsized pay -- often to the very same bankers who profited from the bubble -- to warrant fast-tracking the issue. 
 Among the needed pay reforms are rules to tie executive payouts to long-term results, like prohibitions against cashing out equity-based compensation until many years after options or shares have vested. Bonuses need to be delayed to ensure that the profits on which they are based do not prove transitory. An insightful reform recommended by Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard Law professor and director of the law school's Program on Corporate Governance, would require that executive compensation be tied not only to the company's stock performance, but also to the long-term value of the firm's other securities, like bonds. That would encourage executives to be more conservative about using borrowed money to juice returns to capital, because it would expose them to the losses that leverage can exert on all the firm's investors.
 Reforming the way bankers and traders are paid needs to be part of a newly regulated financial system. But it needn't and shouldn't wait for comprehensive reform to see the light of day.

HEADLINE: Recession Shadowing Chicago Bid For Games

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, Mayor Richard M. Daley delivered his annual speech on the condition of the city he has run for 20 years. Revenues may fall $250 million short. Some city workers must take 15 unpaid days this year, including Mr. Daley. More than 400 workers were laid off that very afternoon, after talks with two unions collapsed.
 In the same address, Mr. Daley pressed forward with the city's efforts to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, which carry an expected $3.3 billion price tag. A decision by the International Olympics Committee is due in October, and Chicago is considered a favorite among the four finalists. 
 Polls here suggest broad support for bringing the Olympic Games to the city. But increasingly, the economic downturn is taking a central role in the local debate over the bid as more residents raise concerns that Chicago taxpayers, already struggling, could be left paying the bills despite assertions from organizers that no city dollars will be needed. 
 ''How do we know?'' a resident, Douglas Brown, demanded of leaders of the Olympics bid during a recent neighborhood meeting on the South Side. 
 ''We can't take your word for it,'' Mr. Brown said, adding, ''When do we get our guarantees to make us sleep at night?''
 At the same time, Mr. Daley and other supporters of the Games argue that the Olympics would be a force -- perhaps the force -- to lift Chicago from this financial gloom, with seven years of new construction, jobs and tourism. 
 Asked about the difficulties of lobbying for an Olympics bid during a recession, Lori Healey, the president of Chicago 2016, the bid committee here, said: ''I think it makes it easy. People are hungry for jobs and opportunities.'' 
 Earlier events that placed Chicago on an international stage, Ms. Healey said, also came during periods of financial gloom: a World's Fair in 1893 and again in 1933.
 To hear Ms. Healey and other bid leaders tell it, there is no downside. If the International Olympics Committee were to choose Chicago over Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo on Oct. 2, advocates predict the Games would not only break even but would also make money (as have, they say, earlier Olympics in the United States), generate more than $22 billion in indirect economic impact on the city and create $1 billion in new tax revenue. Many of the sites needed for the events would not require construction because they already exist.
 Organizers say private financial support is mounting, with $60 million raised so far for the bid, and no city dollars are expected to be needed for either the bid or the Games.
 On that last point, however, residents of Chicago seem skeptical. They have heard promises before.
 This spring, a $1.15 billion deal to privatize the city's parking meter system turned into a fiasco after City Hall's inspector general called it a dubious financial deal and after motorists said they poured money into fancy new meters that, in turn, spat out error messages. A few years ago, Millennium Park, a downtown centerpiece, opened behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget.
 ''You all are projecting we're going to make a lot of money,'' a resident, Robin Kaufman, told Olympics planners at a neighborhood meeting, one in a series intended to shore up support. ''But the bankers were projecting they were going to make a lot of money. Bernie Madoff was predicting he was going to make a lot of money.'' 
 Ms. Kaufman lifted a sign that read, ''No Blank Checks.''
 At a high school auditorium on the West Side, where the bid leaders showed glossy Olympics schematics and stood beside toned former Olympians, Stephanie Patton asked, ''Why should we trust you?''
 Even without a city having been picked for the 2016 event, Chicago agreed this summer to spend $86 million on land for an Olympics village. Bid leaders say private developers will ultimately foot the bill for a project that is to create permanent housing regardless of the Olympics.
 Bid leaders say the Games themselves are expected to make $450 million in profits. In case of a shortfall, though, a ''safety net'' package for the Games will include an expected $1 billion in private insurance, according to bid leaders, as well as pledges from the State of Illinois of $250 million and the City of Chicago of $500 million.
 Then last month, Mr. Daley indicated that he would sign a host contract required by international Olympics officials, including a standard blanket provision offering the city's backing -- one that Chicago leaders had earlier said they hoped to modify. 
 The notion that the city could then be responsible beyond $500 million ''set off some alarm bells'' for aldermen, one of them, Joe Moore, said. Mr. Moore added that the City Council was seeking more details before it signed off on it. And a group here opposed to the event, No Games Chicago, said the prospect seemed to have suddenly stirred an outpouring of interest from people who had been silent on the Olympics. 
 ''The levee broke around that issue,'' said a founder of the group, Bob Quellos. 
 What strikes some residents as particularly puzzling is the bid committee's refrain that, as a private nonprofit entity, it is separate from city government and public money. Technically, that may be, but skeptics note the committee and City Hall share goals and often seem intricately intertwined; Ms. Healey, for instance, stepped down as the mayor's chief of staff to lead the committee.
 Crucial to maintaining residents' support for the Games, polls suggest, is convincing them that their dollars will not be spent. In February, a poll by The Chicago Tribune found that 64 percent of residents of Chicago and its suburbs favored having an Olympics but that 75 percent were against the use of tax money to cover shortfalls. 
 At one of the community forums, a city official likened the efforts of those planning the Olympics Games to Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, who is believed to have been the first non-Indian settler of Chicago, and Daniel H. Burnham, whose 1909 Plan of Chicago largely designed the city with the long strip of lakefront parkland that defines it. 
 Then the bid leaders brought out their big guns for these crowds: a videotape of Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, in Chicago, his hometown, smiling and shaking hands with Mr. Daley during a rally last summer for the bid and declaring his wish that an Olympics reveal Chicago as ''not just a city that works, but a city that inspires.''
 Patrick G. Ryan, the founder of the Aon Corporation and the chairman of the bid committee, told one crowd that the thought that private money being raised for the Games might otherwise pay for schools, garbage collection or city workers' salaries was wrong. 
 ''To say we could spend the money either hosting the Games or on something else is really a false choice,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''This money only comes in if we win.''

HEADLINE: Scrambled States of America

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
The National Conference of State Legislatures had its annual summit meeting last week in downtown Philadelphia, at the corner of Gloom and Doom. Attendance was down, thanks to the rotten economy. Lawmakers from the host state were among the no-shows, since they were (and still are) wrangling over a bad-news budget in Harrisburg. 
 Those who did make it came fresh from battles to force their books into balance, mostly through anguished combinations of tax increases, service cuts and borrowing, with a little help from the federal stimulus. After scrambling to close deficits that totaled $113 billion in fiscal 2009, the conference reported, lawmakers faced a staggering shortfall of $143 billion for 2010. That does not include any new budget holes that many states fear will open in coming months.
 The dire outlook was underscored by a report in Friday's Times by Jason DeParle, who found the unemployment system in a state of crisis. With joblessness doubled by the recession, unemployment funds across the country are quickly drying up. States are borrowing billions to keep the checks coming, and forcing workers to wait ever longer for benefits to start, putting them in danger of missing rent and meals. 
 If any clear lesson is emerging from all this darkness, it's that heedlessness in good times makes bad times even worse. The unemployment emergency, Mr. DeParle explained, has exposed years of neglect by states that chose to cut taxes rather than maintain support for unemployment programs. The federal commitment lagged as well. 
 In Philadelphia, lawmakers repeatedly visited the theme of doing more with less -- or with nothing. Their safety nets are strained by newly unemployed people unfamiliar with the world of social services. Panelists were urging lawmakers to make relatively small investments in user-friendly technology, in the hope of saving money later. People with streamlined access to timely benefits will be more likely to avoid eviction, homelessness, medical emergencies and other catastrophic -- and far costlier -- outcomes. Governments should stop shuttling applicants from place to place, which causes eligible people in need to fall by the bureaucratic wayside. 
 The lawmakers' summit revealed some bright spots, in places like Kentucky, where housing officials have pioneered a unified system to help homeowners at risk of foreclosure. With one phone number, one Web site, one data collection system, nonprofit agencies and government work together to try to restructure loans and get people on a stable footing. With so many agencies sharing the same administrative load, no single nonprofit is overwhelmed. A few thousand families are better served. These are small consolations in a world of hurt, but for now it's about all there are.

HEADLINE: Watching You Watching Ads

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex. 

 BODY:
A technician in a black lab coat gazed at the short, middle-aged man seated inside the Walt Disney Company's secretive new research facility here last week, his face shrouded with eye-tracking goggles. Read ESPN.com on that BlackBerry, she told him soothingly, like a nurse about to draw blood. ''And have fun,'' she added, leaving the room.
 In reality, the man's appetite for sports news was not of interest. (The site was a fake version anyway.) Rather, the technician and her fellow researchers were eager to know how the man responded to ads of varying size. How small could the banners become and still draw his attention?
 A squadron of Disney executives scrutinized the data as it flowed in real time onto television monitors in an adjacent room. ''He's not even looking at the banner now,'' said Duane Varan, the lab's executive director. The man clicked to another page. ''There we go, that one's drawing his attention.'' 
 Like other television companies, Disney Media Networks -- which includes ABC, ESPN, ABC Family and Disney XD -- has long conducted intense consumer research about its programming. But now, as the Web and DVRs uproot the way people consume television, and thus rip apart the industry's business model, the unit is adding advertiser research as a fresh focus of intense inquiry.
 Disney will unveil some of the lab's early findings, including some surprises about new forms of online ads, on Tuesday in a presentation to about 200 advertisers in New York.
 It is relatively easy for Internet companies and their advertisers to measure precisely how often Web site visitors click on advertisements, and which kinds of ads draw the most clicks. But what about those who do not click, the many millions of others whose eyes merely flit across the screen? Disney and other companies say they believe that not nearly enough is known about them -- what kinds of ads in which configurations are likeliest to draw them, and hold them?
 A good deal is at stake. Although the recession has slowed its growth, nearly $25 billion will be spent on Web advertising this year, eMarketer, an Internet research company, estimates -- a mother lode that will grow to more than $37 billion by 2013.
 The goal, quite simply, is to increase ad revenue by offering skittish clients serious research about what works and what does not in new media, said Peter Seymour, the unit's executive vice president for strategy and research. There is also a focus on new forms of advertising in programming shown on actual televisions.
 Are ads that play before video clips, known as prerolls, more effective when paired with banner ads? Do animated ads keep viewers' attention on mobile devices better than live-action ones? How well do so-called watermark ads -- an image that sits on part of a Web page like etched glass -- affect buyer intent?
 ''The goal is ultimately to have laws that apply,'' Mr. Seymour said.
 The Austin facility -- a squat, gray building alongside Interstate 35, north of downtown -- is not identified as part of the Disney empire (a sign outside simply reads ''Media Panel'') so the brand cannot influence how participants respond to questions. 
 The tools are advanced: in addition to tracking eye movement, Dr. Varan and his 14-member team use heart-rate monitors, skin temperature readings and facial expressions (probes are attached to facial muscles) to reach conclusions.
 Among the researchers findings is that, when it comes to online video, ''flyout'' ads that appear next to the media player deliver the same punch as see-through ''transparency'' ads that appear over the content, but are less intrusive. And keeping the news ticker running during commercial breaks on ESPN does not take away from the commercials -- people only spend about 12.6 percent of ad time looking at it -- and instead helps retain viewer attention. 
 ''Negative results are also important to share,'' Dr. Varan said. ''Advertisers need to trust that we will tell them, 'Hey, this thing that you want to spend money on isn't actually that valuable.' '' (In this category, consumers learn to ignore watermark promos.)
 ''Completely invaluable'' is how Tracey Scheppach, video innovations director for Starcom MediaVest Group, describes Disney's work. ''Everybody is trying to figure out the ad models of the future, but nobody is doing it on this scale,'' she said. Starcom's clients include Allstate, Kellogg and Bank of America.
 Other companies are also pursuing this type of research. The rise of new media platforms paired with the ubiquity of DVRs has made it a business imperative for television companies, especially since advertisers now pay rates based on how many people watch the commercials. (For decades, largely because the technology could not measure audiences so finely, advertisers paid rates based on how many people watched programs.)
 In 2001, CBS opened a research facility in Las Vegas called Television City, with a primary aim of testing pilot programming. But the company has recently moved deeply into advertising and new media testing. Through a partnership with NeuroFocus, a company based in Berkeley, Calif., that is partly owned by Nielsen, CBS monitors the brain activity of people while they watch television and ads. In 2008, about 70,000 people participated in one of CBS's tests.
 ''You're seeing science moving into the marketing sector in a major way,'' said David Poltrack, CBS's chief research officer.
 Disney hopes to also use its research to design Web sites and advertise its own wares. 
 ''We see this as a very powerful research and development tool for the entire Disney company,'' said Artie Bulgrin, ESPN's senior vice president of research and analytics.
 The smattering of research labs that already exist, most of them based at universities, cannot conduct research as quickly, Mr. Bulgrin said. ''As ideas arise, we want to research them and have the results in the hands of our sales force as fast as possible,'' he said. 
 Dr. Varan is based primarily in Perth, Australia, where he is director of the Interactive Television Research Institute at Murdoch University (which is not connected to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian head of the News Corporation). Disney picked Austin -- a 26-hour flight for Mr. Varan, who spends one week a month there -- largely because residents represented a wide demographic range.
 Austin also offers a pool of participants from a wide political spectrum. Currently, none of the research involves children.
 The facility, which operates seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., has eight research rooms decorated as living rooms or home offices, with hardwood floors, soft lighting and comfortable furniture. There is also a theater that allows a dozen people to participate in a simultaneous experiment. Disney's investment is estimated to be in the low seven figures.
 The rooms are built around a central command post, where researchers scrutinize participants via video monitor -- one room has 20 cameras -- and through one-way mirrors. 
 Dr. Varan cautioned that more research was needed before the media industry caught up with the evolving way people consume its product. He equates Web advertising to the early days of television advertising, noting that networks just relied on the radio model they knew.
 ''Everybody is still shooting in the dark,'' he said. ''We're trying to turn on the lights.''

 BODY:
If the key to happiness is low expectations, then stock investors must be over the moon. More than a third of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have reported second-quarter earnings. While overall profits were down by about a third from a year earlier, more than three-quarters of the companies beat analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters. That is on track to be the highest ratio ever. 
 Investors should not get ahead of themselves, however. Optimism that companies are handling tough times better than many had predicted has helped lift the S.& P. 500 index by more than 20 percent since late March. Yet the foundations of a sustainable recovery look shaky. Nonfinancial companies have managed to increase earnings mostly by sharply cutting costs. Manufacturing and trade inventories have been falling all year, according to the Commerce Department. 
 The relatively quick and easy fixes of the last quarter will be harder to replicate as time goes on. If companies cut too deeply, eventually nobody will be there to answer the phone. Inventories sink to the minimum levels required to do business. 
 What companies will need is revenue growth, which is closely tied to economic growth. This is where the news is worrisome. At the S.& P. 500 companies that have reported so far, revenue shrank 2 percent, on average, from the second quarter last year. 
 A rise in spending by American consumers and businesses that might increase revenue does not look imminent. Companies are planning further cutbacks in both employees and capital expenditures, according to a recent National Association for Business Economics survey. That probably means lower sales of everything from clothes to power plants. Also, consumers and businesses are squirreling away cash, so even when spending does turn up, the rebound will be slow. 
 Combined with more optimistic forecasts from analysts, all this suggests that expectations will be much tougher to beat the next earnings season. Unless businesses and consumers open their pocketbooks soon, the stock market rally could easily falter.
 Backed-Up I.P.O.'s 
 When will European initial public offerings bounce back? The market for new stock issues has been virtually shut for over a year. Companies raised just 465 million euros ($661 million) in the first half of 2009 -- a pittance compared to the billions in recent years. Yet bankers are back on the marketing trail, pitching furiously. Investors, they say, are warming up to risk. Add to the mix a backlog of companies waiting to go public, and the stars are aligning for a return of I.P.O.'s after the summer break. 
 European companies are taking their cues from the United States, Brazil and Asia, where the market has already thawed. Brazilian companies, for example, raised $6 billion in the first half of the year. In Europe, asset managers have so far concentrated on handing money over to already-listed companies in secondary offerings.
 On the supply side, there is a backlog of companies waiting to go public. Private equity companies are looking to exit investments in companies via I.P.O.'s. The pipeline is slowly filling up. Yoox, an international online fashion retailer, wants to list at the end of this year or next. In theory, no industries are off limits, say bankers, as long as companies have powerful brands or are market leaders -- and provided they can demonstrate that their earnings have bottomed. In practice, regulated and less cyclical sectors, like renewable energy, might have an easier time. 
 The biggest problem seems to be valuation. Investors will be cautious at first, and will scrutinize new issues carefully. For highly indebted companies owned by private equity firms, this may be a problem. Low valuations could make it difficult for existing owners to turn a profit. 
 That said, the market seems likely to reopen in the fall. If history is any guide, as soon as a window opens, companies will try to dash through it. Given that it typically takes three to six months to ready a company for an I.P.O., the real flood may not arrive until early next year. At that point, the risk could be a glut of I.P.O.'s. But that is not a worry for today.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Suddenly in Need,
 But Where to Go?
 Where do I go to apply for food stamps? Am I eligible for government help with utilities and rent? Even welfare? 
 Many middle-class people are asking themselves those unfamiliar questions for the first time, after being abruptly laid off, losing their health insurance and struggling to pay their bills. 
 And as officials across the nation gird for an all-time high in the number of families in shelters, families who have never needed help before often realize that they have no idea where to begin.
 In New York, some people simply pick up the phone and call 311, the free catch-all line for city services. Others contact well-known nonprofit agencies like the United Way. Googling around can produce thousands of links and still no clear guidance, especially for those without much Web savvy.
 In the small towns and suburbs surrounding New York, connecting with social services is even trickier, since smaller counties are often not as well equipped to handle applicants.
 Toni Dolan is the executive director of the Beth-El Center, a soup kitchen and small temporary shelter in Milford, Conn. The recession has brought in many of the recently unemployed, she said.
 ''With the families, many of them are here for the first time,'' she said. ''They don't really know where to go. People are confused about where to go and how to get help.''
 Have you or someone you know considered seeking help from the government, a nonprofit group, a synagogue, a church, a shelter? If you already have, how did you navigate the system?

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Approves $2.6 Billion Sri Lanka Loan

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has approved a $2.6 billion loan to help Sri Lanka shore up its economy in the midst of the global economic crisis and the aftermath of a bloody civil war. 
 But several countries, including the United States and Britain, abstained when the fund's board voted Friday to approve the loan, reflecting growing unease among many Western nations about alleged human rights abuses during and after Sri Lanka's prosecution of the war against the Tamil Tiger insurgency.
 That war ended in May, with the government's stunning defeat of the Tigers on a narrow strip of beach in northern Sri Lanka. The entire senior command of the separatist group was killed, along with an untold number of Tamil civilians who had been used as human shields by the Tigers. 
 Since the end of the fighting, about 280,000 ethnic Tamils have been held in sprawling military-run camps in northern Sri Lanka. 
 Residents are not free to leave the camps, a measure government officials say is necessary to root out insurgents hiding among the population. 
 As the months wear on, the camps have posed an increasing problem for the Western countries that are paying for most of the food, shelter and medicine for the displaced.
 Human rights organizations and diplomats say that serious questions linger about the manner in which the government prosecuted the war. 
 The United Nations has estimated that 7,000 civilians died near the end of the war, when hundreds of thousands of people were herded into a small area by the Tigers, who made their last stand among civilians. No reliable count has been made of the dead in the bloody last weeks of the fighting. 
 Sri Lanka has managed to avoid any international accounting of the civilian casualties, maneuvering votes in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, an intergovernmental body established by the United Nations, to stop calls for an independent investigation. Sri Lankan government officials have said that they are conducting their own inquiry, and that the war ultimately saved lives by halting a seemingly endless conflict. 
 The government has also pledged to get 80 percent of those displaced by the war back in their homes by the end of the year.
 Human rights organizations had pressed the International Monetary Fund to hold back the loan, which Sri Lanka needs to stabilize its economy, until the government demonstrated a sincere commitment to respecting human rights.
 ''It is a simple matter of the government thumbing its nose at the international community and then coming to the international community for relief,'' said Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. 
 Usually such loans are not controversial and are decided on the basis of the economic criteria set out by the monetary fund's staff, with the board vote being mostly a formality. 
 But some Western countries were agitating to hold back the loan until Sri Lanka met certain benchmarks, like allowing Tamils displaced by the fighting to return to their homes.

HEADLINE: Forget Aloof, Bernanke Goes Barnstorming

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo. 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is on a publicity campaign with a message: the central bank is here to help, and it is not as mysterious or menacing as people might think.
 In a profound departure from the central bank's tradition as an aloof and secretive temple of economic policy, Mr. Bernanke has plunged into the public spotlight to an extent that none of his predecessors would have contemplated. 
 He has given a television interview to ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, including a tour of his hometown, Dillon, S.C.; held what amounted to a televised news conference; and written newspaper commentaries to explain the Fed's efforts to fight the financial crisis. 
 On Sunday, Mr. Bernanke reached another milestone in his evolution from Fed chairman to Fed showman, participating in a one-hour town hall-style forum here organized and moderated by Jim Lehrer of ''The NewsHour'' on PBS. 
 Like a political candidate on the campaign trail -- indeed, his four-year term expires in January -- Mr. Bernanke fielded questions from local residents and tried to rebuff charges that the Fed was either conspiring with big banks, stifling free-market capitalism or possibly doing both at the same time.
 When a small-business owner asked Mr. Bernanke why the Fed helped rescue big banks while ''short-changing'' small companies, Mr. Bernanke answered that he had decided to ''hold my nose'' because he was afraid the entire financial system would collapse. 
 ''I'm as disgusted by it as you are,'' he told the audience of 190 people. ''Nothing made me more angry than having to intervene, particularly in a few cases where companies took wild bets.''
 It was a far cry from what any other Fed chairman has been willing to do, but it was just the latest example of Mr. Bernanke's attempt to communicate directly with the public. Last week alone, Mr. Bernanke published a lengthy commentary in The Wall Street Journal, then testified before three separate Congressional committees and presided over a public Fed meeting to announce new regulations of credit card practices.
 Of course, the Fed had already become more open in the decade before Mr. Bernanke took the reins, and his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, achieved rock-star fame during his long tenure as chairman. But Fed officials still cloaked themselves with a mantle of technocratic detachment from both partisan politics and day-to-day business life. They almost never spoke in public outside the controlled confines of scheduled speeches or Congressional hearings. 
 Fed policy makers make their decisions about interest rates behind closed doors, then communicate those decisions primarily through brief, cryptic statements that analysts busily decode in the days that follow.
 But that kind of distance has become impossible in the two years since the American economy plunged into its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. These days, Mr. Bernanke and the Fed have been bailing out financial institutions, printing money in unheard-of volumes and stepping in to fill the lending gap left by the crippled capital markets. 
 Even in better economic times, Mr. Bernanke, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006, would be under pressure to get out the Fed's message: his term as Fed chairman ends at the end of next January, and President Obama will have to decide in the next few months whether to nominate him for another term or replace him with his own choice.
 The Fed has never wielded as much power as it does right now, but the very expansion of its mission has exposed it to more second-guessing and more challenges to its political independence than ever before.
 ''The Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the giant banks, has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen,'' Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, said at a House hearing last week in which Mr. Bernanke testified about the state of the economy. 
 Republican lawmakers portray the Fed as the embodiment of heavy-handed big government, and have called for scaling back the central bank's regulatory powers. But liberal Democrats, like Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, have accused the Federal Reserve of caving in to demands by banks for huge bailouts, for failing to protect consumers against dangerous financial products and for being too secretive about its emergency rescue programs.
 More than 250 lawmakers have signed a bill sponsored by Mr. Paul that would allow the Government Accountability Office to ''audit'' the Fed's decisions on monetary policy -- a move that Fed officials see as a direct threat to their political independence in carrying out their central mission of setting interest rates.
 Even those sympathetic to the herculean challenges confronting Mr. Bernanke acknowledge that the Fed has lost some of its aura of infallibility.
 ''When you have a terrible mess, it is unlikely that those who try to alleviate the danger of that mess will come out looking clean,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
 The Fed chairman and the central bank are also caught in a political cross-fire over how to overhaul the nation's system of financial regulation. 
 President Obama has proposed a sweeping plan that would make the Fed more powerful in some respects and less powerful in others. Mr. Obama's plan would put the Fed in charge of regulating systemic risk, like the buildup of dangerous mortgages during the housing bubble, and would give the Fed power to impose tougher regulation over financial institutions deemed too big to fail. 
 At the same time, the administration plan would strip the Fed of its current authority to regulate mortgages and other forms of consumer lending, including credit cards. Those powers would be shifted to a new regulatory agency with broad power to regulate consumer financial products.
 Mr. Bernanke strongly supports putting the Fed in charge of risk regulation, but he and Fed officials are resisting Mr. Obama's plan for a separate consumer regulatory agency. That puts him in the potentially awkward position of alienating the Fed's most important supporter -- the president.
 At the town hall event, which will be shown on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer'' this week in three parts, Mr. Bernanke set out to reassure people that the economy would regain its strength ''within a few years.'' But he cautioned that the unemployment rate would probably climb above 10 percent before it gradually started to fall next year.
 By the end of the session, he had fielded questions about home foreclosures, the risks of inflation and President Obama's proposals to overhaul the system of financial regulation.

HEADLINE: In 2 Big West Bank Settlements, a Sign of Hope for a Deal

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER and ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: MODIIN ILLIT, West Bank 

 BODY:
Seen from afar, this fast-growing settlement embodies everything that the Obama administration wants to address through its demand for a freeze on settlement building: it sits on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and, with 45,000 residents and 60 births a week, it is the largest and fastest-growing Jewish community in the West Bank. 
 If, as is widely believed abroad, ''natural growth'' by Israeli settlers is blocking the creation of a viable Palestinian state, this community should show why.
 But appearances are deceiving. Modiin Illit and its sister community, Beitar Illit, are entirely ultra-Orthodox, a world apart, one of strict religious observance and study. They offer surprising potential for compromise. 
 Unlike settlers who believe they are continuing the historic Zionist mission of reclaiming the Jewish homeland, most ultra-Orthodox do not consider themselves settlers or Zionists and express no commitment to being in the West Bank, so their growth in these settlement towns, situated just inside the pre-1967 boundary, could be redirected westward to within Israel.
 Their location also means it may be possible, in negotiations about a future Palestinian state, to redraw the boundary so the settlements are inside Israel, with little land lost to the Palestinians. And the two towns alone account for half of all settler growth, so if removed from the equation, the larger settler challenge takes on more manageable proportions.
 ''If I thought this was a settlement, I would never have come here,'' said Yaakov Guterman, 40, the mayor of Modiin Illit and a grandfather of three, his Orthodox fringes hanging from his belt, his side locks curled behind his ears. Asked about the prospect of a Palestinian state rising one day on his town line, he said: ''We will go along with what the world wants. We have gone through the Holocaust and know what it means to have the world against us. The Torah says a man needs to know his place.'' 
 Whether or not Mr. Guterman will be as pliant as he says, Middle East peace negotiators on all sides -- Israeli, Palestinian and American -- have long viewed small border adjustments and land swaps as key to a deal that would include a solution to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who have settled in the West Bank over the past four decades. 
 This week, three senior American officials will be in Jerusalem for talks that will include settlements: the Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell; the White House Middle East adviser, Dennis Ross; and the national security adviser, Gen. James Jones. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates will also be in talks in Jerusalem. 
 Break With Settler Movement 
 The ultra-Orthodox inhabitants often express contempt for the settler movement, with its vows never to move. The people here, who shun most aspects of modernity, came for three reasons: they needed affordable housing no longer available in and around Jerusalem or Tel Aviv; they were rejected by other Israeli cities as too cult-like; and officials wanted their presence to broaden Israel's narrow border.
 Yet they are lumped with everyone else. The settler movement and the Israeli government point to ultra-Orthodox settlements, with their large and ever-increasing families, to argue that there is no way to stop ''natural growth'' without imposing acute human suffering. Those seeking a freeze use the settlements as evidence that growth is so out of control that drastic action must be taken. More broadly, opponents say the settlements violate international law, legitimize force by armed messianic Jews and ruin the chance of establishing a viable Palestinian state.
 But even those who strongly favor a complete freeze acknowledge that the annual settler growth rates of 5 and 6 percent owe a great deal to these two towns that have little to do with the broader settler enterprise.
 Dror Etkes of Yesh Din, an antisettlement group in Israel, noted that half of all construction in West Bank settlements was taking place in these two ultra-Orthodox communities, adding that given their location next to the boundary, it was highly likely they would be in Israel in a future deal through a redrawn border. ''From a purely geographic point of view, construction there is not as destructive as elsewhere,'' he said. 
 But he does not want building to continue in Modiin Illit or Beitar Illit without a deal for a Palestinian state, nor does he mean to imply that these settlements have been a benign force. ''Land has been taken from Palestinians, in some cases from private landowners, for the building in these settlements, and there are many other issues like sewage flow into Palestinian villages that must be addressed,'' Mr. Etkes said. 
 Settler leaders reject any distinction. The fact that the ultra-Orthodox came to the West Bank to solve their housing problems is ''completely O.K. with me,'' said Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yesha Council, the settlers' political umbrella group. ''They are an integral part of our endeavor and our achievement.''
 The Palestinian View 
 But even in Bilin, the Palestinian village that abuts Modiin Illit and has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance against Israel's West Bank separation barrier, the settlers over the fence are viewed as different from the Jewish nationalists in, say, Hebron.
 Abedallah Abu Rahma, a teacher from a farming family and a leading activist in the village, pointed toward the settler high-rise buildings visible across the valley from his living room window and said: ''They tell us, 'We are poor, the apartments here are cheaper and we did not know it was a settlement.' Many told us, 'Give us our money back and we will leave.' ''
 The Palestinians, who hold weekly demonstrations against the barrier, have even joined forces with some of the settlers. Two years ago, Bilin won a major Supreme Court case that forced a change in the route of the barrier, and some of the documents the victorious villagers used, Mr. Abu Rahma said, had been secretly passed to them by ultra-Orthodox settlers feuding with their own municipal leaders.
 Still, none of that lessens the harm to the villagers caused by the very existence of Modiin Illit and the contest over its land. Mr. Abu Rahma said he would respect any agreement reached between the Palestinian leadership and Israel, including one that had Modiin Illit standing in Israel. But noting the village's reliance on agriculture, its own housing needs and the settlement's encroachment on Bilin's territory, he insisted, ''We need our land.'' 
 Moreover, protecting the settlements from attack has meant construction of numerous barriers, checkpoints and bypass roads that impair economic development and disrupt daily life.
 Across the West Bank and excluding East Jerusalem, there are nearly 300,000 settlers living on scores of settlements among 2.3 million Palestinians. And while some say they will fight to stay put, a third are the reluctant ultra-Orthodox, known in Israel as Haredim, Hebrew for the fearful ones, or those who tremble in awe of God. 
 They believe it important to live in the land of Israel, because certain commandments can be performed only here. But some Haredim actively reject the formation of a Jewish state before the arrival of the Messiah, while others are ambivalent. They also say that protecting life trumps holding territory. Very few serve in the military because the ultra-Orthodox say they do more good for the nation by studying the Torah and praying than fighting.
 Until his death in 2001, Rabbi Eliezer Schach was the religious authority of the Haredim of European origin. He opposed building Jewish settlements that extended over the 1967 line into territory Israel seized in the war, once calling them ''a blatant attempt to provoke the international community'' and complaining that they endangered Jewish lives. In fact, when first offered housing for his followers in Beitar Illit, he took it as an insult, according to Yitzchak Pindrus, a former mayor of the settlement.
 ''Our people live around their families and rabbis, and they were terrified of the idea,'' Mr. Pindrus recalled. But with thousands of new couples marrying every year, and the traditional ultra-Orthodox communities expensive and crowded, the Haredim needed homes.
 Because few ultra-Orthodox men work, because on average their families have eight children and because they do not integrate easily into the larger community, Teddy Kollek, who was mayor of Jerusalem in the late 1980s, wanted to keep down their numbers. Other cities rejected them. Yitzhak Rabin, as both defense minister and then prime minister, championed the creation of large settlements around Jerusalem to fortify Israel's hold on the capital, in line with his Labor Party's strategic plan, so he and the Haredim struck a deal for Beitar Illit in the early 1990s.
 For those wanting to remain closer to longstanding Haredi communities in the center of the country, Modiin Illit was an alternative. Private Israeli developers bought tracts of Palestinian land as its base, although the legitimacy of those sales has been challenged. Mr. Guterman, the mayor, said Mr. Rabin ''gave his blessing to the city,'' telling Rabbi Schach's disciples that its strategic location on the first rise above Israel's international airport guaranteed that it would not be given back.
 There are smaller pockets of Haredi settlement deeper in the West Bank, where the arm's-length attitude toward Zionist settlement has shifted toward a more distinctly right-wing ideology. Zvi Kastelanitz, of the Immanuel settlement, who produces silver-inlaid Jewish handicrafts, for example, said he had no objection to two states for two peoples, ''but not here.'' Still, the Haredi settlers even there remain distinct. After Palestinians ambushed two buses on the road to Immanuel, southwest of Nablus, in 2001 and 2002, killing a total of 20 people, the Haredi settlers did not react like their nationalist counterparts, defiantly setting up another settlement outpost. Instead, about a third of Immanuel's 4,000 residents left. 
 Shunning Secular World 
 The Haredi world is all about being together and apart from secular temptations, an intricate patchwork of groups with allegiances to different rabbinic dynasties and courts. In the new cities, Haredi rules apply. At the entrance to Beitar Illit, a sign warns visitors to dress modestly. The streets are all named for rabbis and sages from Poland to Yemen. There is Internet access, officially intended for professional use only. Televisions are allowed, but nobody admits to having one. And there is poverty: about 40 percent of wives support their large families because their husbands do not work. There are few cars, lots of buses and baby strollers.
 Dov Fromowitz, a father of nine who moved to Beitar Illit from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn 12 years ago, runs a central charity fund that collects money from better-off residents and distributes it to the poor, while connecting them with other social welfare services outside the settlement. He says he has 1,200 needy families on his books.
 Without most Israelis noticing, Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit have turned into the Haredi towns of the future, cleaner and saner versions of their often decrepit and densely packed neighborhoods elsewhere. They contain open space, even some greenery, and apartments with lots of bedrooms. Their young are shielded from secular Israel, and secular Israelis never see them, thereby reducing the tensions found in Jerusalem over driving on the Sabbath and sexy advertising at bus stops.
 The Question of Coexistence 
 Even if the ultra-Orthodox appear to be less ideologically committed to the West Bank, the longer they live here, the more invested some have become. 
 In Modiin Illit, Mayor Guterman has ambitions to build what he calls ''the largest Haredi residential community in Israel.'' Over the past three years, he has set up a business center that he considers the wave of the future. Now 1,000 women, mostly mothers in their 20s, sit at work stations providing phone services to Israeli credit card clients and paralegal research for real estate businesses in the United States. It is outsourcing that seeks to take advantage of the educational level and work ethic of Haredi women.
 The question of coexistence with Palestinians hovers, however. In Beitar Illit, farmers from the village of Husan enter daily in cars and on donkeys to work their lands in the valleys among the settlements' built-up hills. The new mayor, Meir Rubinstein, is proud of the city's cooperation with local Palestinians, whom he calls ''the neighbors.''
 ''We very much want there to be peace here,'' he said. ''We pray for it three times a day.'' But the question of peace at what price remains.
 Avraham and Riva Guttman, who arrived in Beitar Illit 15 years ago from Toronto and have seven children, look out from their street at Palestinian villages. They believe strongly in living in the land of Israel, they say, and they are happy for the parks and space lacking in traditional Haredi areas of Israel. But they do not insist that it is there or nothing. ''We are not here for political reasons,'' Mr. Guttman said. ''Ninety percent of the people are here for the affordability, not for ideology. Haredim don't fight with Arabs.''
 Perhaps not, but his wife, Riva, bristled at the idea of moving. ''If you told me to move elsewhere because Arabs needed a place to live, it would not sit quietly on my conscience,'' she said. ''I am a Jew in the Jewish homeland.''
 And increasingly, the Haredim have vested interests over the 1967 line. Yaron and Sara Simchovitch arrived in Beitar Illit from Jerusalem 13 years ago with a group led by their rabbi. The couple now have a thriving butcher shop.
 Yoseph Shilhav, an expert on the ultra-Orthodox at Bar-Ilan University, said that almost every Haredi family now had a member beyond the 1967 border, subtly shifting their attitudes about settlement and withdrawal. The Haredim make up 10 percent of Israel's population and are a fast-growing electoral force. The Chabad movement and Sephardic or Middle Eastern-origin Shas party have increasingly adopted the nationalist agenda. 
 The rocket fire into Israel that resulted after its withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 has also taken its toll on Haredi views. ''In general, Haredim are very practical people,'' said Mr. Pindrus, the former Beitar Illit mayor. ''We are not right or left. If we get up in the morning and see that leaving Gaza means missiles, then no, we're not leaving another centimeter.'' He added, ''We want to live, and our children not to blow up.''
 Still, a surprising number do not oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state if safety can be guaranteed. Since housing is the No. 1 Haredi concern and they feel no need for it to be in the West Bank, redirecting the building of their new homes inside Israel could go a long way toward a solution. 
 ''If the Americans can convince us there will really be peace and we won't be living in fear of rockets, we'll bring a recommendation to our rabbis,'' said Mr. Guterman, the mayor of Modiin Illit. ''Our rabbis want peace. We are not against withdrawing from territory. But life is above all.''

HEADLINE: A Bid to Tax Health Plans Of Executives

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs is one of the nation's richest banks, and hundreds of top Goldman employees have a health care package to match -- one of the ''gold-plated Cadillac'' plans cited by those involved in the health care debate in Washington. 
 Goldman's 400 or so managing directors and its top executive officers participate in the bank's executive medical and dental program as part of their benefits, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The program generally costs the bank $40,543 in premiums annually for each participant's family. 
 Those taking part in the plan include the company's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and four other top officers, as well as managing directors, whose base salary is $600,000. 
 Goldman's medical coverage entered the health care discussion on Sunday when David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Obama, cited the Goldman program as an example of the expensive benefits the administration might consider taxing to help pay for its health care program. 
 ''The president actually was asked this the other day by Jim Lehrer, and what he said was that this was an intriguing idea to put an excise tax on high-end health care policies like the ones that the executives at Goldman Sachs have, the $40,000 policies,'' Mr. Axelrod said. 
 Goldman did not return messages on Sunday to comment about Mr. Axelrod's comments. 
 A proposal by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, would impose an excise tax on the insurers that issue policies like Goldman's, with the expectation that the insurers would pass along most, if not all, of the cost to employers who buy the plans.
 Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, which is working on bipartisan version of the health care legislation in Congress, had long expressed interest in taxing some employer-provided benefits -- a move many budget experts say would help slow the steep rise in health costs. 
 A number of Democrats opposed the plan, so negotiators began looking for other ways to cover the roughly $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the bill. 
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and an author of the Finance Committee's health bill, endorsed taxing rich plans during an appearance Sunday on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos'' on ABC.
 Asked if Congress would tax high-end plans, Mr. Conrad said: ''I think we've got to. Again, virtually every economist that's come before us has said you've got to reduce that tax subsidy as part of an overall strategy to really contain costs.'' 
 An aide to Republicans involved in the Finance Committee negotiations said the idea was ''on the table in discussions as a serious effort by Senator Kerry to restart the conversation on bending down the cost curve.'' Aides to Senator Max Baucus confirmed that he, too, was considering the proposal, and House leaders said they were as well. 
 Negotiators have not yet determined the value of the plans that would set off a tax on the insurance companies; the numbers under discussion range from $20,000 to $40,000 annually, a senior administration official said. 
 The lower end of that range would increase the amount of money the tax would raise but would also hit some middle-class workers, whose unions in some cases negotiated robust health benefits in lieu of pay increases. Typical employer-provided plans cost $13,000 to $20,000 per family, depending on the location and the age of the plan participants.
 A health care package costing $40,000 or more a year would generally have no co-payments or deductibles, according to Paul Fronstin, an analyst at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a Washington nonprofit that studies benefits. It would also have no limits on doctors or procedures, no restrictions on pre-existing conditions and no requirements for referrals. 
 Few people have such policies, Mr. Fronstin said. ''It would only be top executives who run big businesses, mainly people in the C suite,'' said Mr. Fronstin, referring to companies' chief officers.

HEADLINE: A Presidential Pitfall: Speaking One's Mind

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There is no owner's manual for the Oval Office, no school to learn how to be a president. Perhaps most challenging for any new president is learning how powerful that megaphone really is. Every offhand word, every spontaneous remark, every comment informed more by emotion than calculation risks profound consequences.
 President Obama was reminded of that again last week when he declared that the police in Cambridge, Mass., had ''acted stupidly'' in arresting a prominent black scholar at his own home. He did not anticipate how those words would inflame an already searing national debate on race. But he soon concluded that, as aides quoted him, ''it was stupid to use the word stupid.'' 
 Many political observers were surprised because Mr. Obama seems so disciplined. When he speaks extemporaneously, he often pauses before he speaks and appears to be thinking his answers through even as he gives them. 
 But his comment last week on the case of Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard professor, was not a slip of the tongue, advisers said. Mr. Obama said what he wanted to say. The question is whether presidents can really do that. 
 ''They want to be genuine, they want to speak their mind,'' said Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary for President George W. Bush. ''But there's the recognition that you're no longer able to muse the way you're used to. If you're too candid, that can really haunt you. So presidents learn the art of being circumspect. And they chafe at it. They want to be genuine. But in many ways, they all become more guarded as time goes on.'' 
 Mr. Bush eventually regretted the swagger of some of his early ''dead or alive'' rhetoric after Sept. 11, 2001. But that could extend to smaller issues, like sports. Mr. Fleischer recalled how Mr. Bush, a former part-owner of the Texas Rangers, concluded that he should not discuss baseball as president and instead ''gave boring, bland answers.''
 As it happens, Mr. Obama has not shied away from weighing in on sports. He bluntly urged college football to adopt a playoff system, picked North Carolina to win the college basketball tournament this year and favored Michael Jordan over Kobe Bryant when asked who was the better professional basketball player. 
 But he has learned on several occasions that spur-of-the-moment remarks can come back to bite him. A joke about Nancy Reagan's holding seances required him to call her to apologize. (She told Vanity Fair that he said he was actually thinking of Hillary Rodham Clinton.) He had to make another apology after joking that his bad bowling skills qualified him for the Special Olympics.
 When Mr. Obama was outraged by hefty bonuses paid to executives at firms receiving federal bailouts, he scolded them not only for that but for flying to, say, Las Vegas for fancy conferences -- unwittingly causing a raft of cancellations in that city even by conferees not receiving taxpayer money. To remedy the situation, his senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, arranged for him to meet with hospitality industry leaders.
 David Axelrod, another senior White House adviser, acknowledged that Mr. Obama's comments on the Gates case had reflected a president still getting accustomed to his new position.
 ''I think there's something to that,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''The fact of the matter is he's a human being. As gifted and bright and disciplined as he is, every once in a while, he doesn't use words exactly as he intended or in retrospect discussion it had meaning beyond what he wanted to express.'' 
 Eventually, most presidents learn that what they could say as a governor or a senator is magnified a thousand times when coming from the most powerful man in the world. President Bill Clinton, just a few weeks after he took office, sharply scolded an aide at a photo opportunity without realizing that his words would be caught on camera. Chagrined, he learned for the most part to keep his temper in check in public. 
 John D. Podesta, who was Mr. Clinton's chief of staff and has advised Mr. Obama, said the new president would learn, too. ''The remarkable thing about President Obama is his discipline -- it is always business, never personal,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''This got a little personal, and I suspect we won't see that happen again, at least in the near future.''
 If Mr. Obama needs any lessons, of course, he has only to look to his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., who after 36 years as a senator continues to make a career out of explaining away impolitic statements -- as recently as this weekend.
 Mr. Biden's assessment of Russia as a weak nation with a ''withering economy'' that would ultimately have to bend to American interests undercut the message of reconciliation that Mr. Obama took with him to Moscow early this month. Unhappy White House aides put out a statement trying to clean it up. 
 In the end, Mr. Obama said he did not regret weighing in on the Gates case, only the wording he chose because it had offended police officers in Cambridge, Mass., and because it had distracted from his push for health care legislation. He tried to fix that Friday by saying he should have ''calibrated'' his remarks more carefully while still maintaining that the arrest was unjustified.
 George C. Edwards III, a scholar at Texas A&M University and editor of Presidential Studies Quarterly, said presidents needed to be careful to not let their agendas be hijacked. ''It takes iron discipline to remain on message, and it is easy to understand why the president had strong feelings about the Gates incident,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''Nevertheless, given the nature of race as an issue in America, he needed to say something like, 'I certainly sympathize with anyone who has to prove that he is in his own house, but I really cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.' ''
 But there is a cost to that, too, and others said they hoped Mr. Obama did not take that lesson from the episode. Lonnie Bunch, director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, said plenty of other presidents had talked about race. ''What might be deemed different about Obama's statement is how clearly the weight of the presidency supported a minority,'' Mr. Bunch said. ''It is a new day.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Says Nuclear Aim Of Iran Is Fruitless

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Brian Knowlton contributed from Washington.

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned Iran's leaders on Sunday that if they were seeking nuclear weapons, ''your pursuit is futile,'' and ruled out explicitly the possibility that the Obama administration would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection.
 Mrs. Clinton made her statement, on NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' days after she raised the possibility of an American-created ''defense umbrella'' over the Middle East to counter Iran's efforts to build its power in the region by trying to develop weapons capacity. Soon after Mrs. Clinton spoke of the shield on Wednesday, senior members of the Obama administration tried to walk back her comments, saying that she was speaking ''personally'' and that such an umbrella had always been implied by America's strong interests in the region, including oil interests. 
 But on Sunday she did not back away from her statement. ''I think it's clear we're trying to affect the internal calculus of the Iranian regime,'' she said, adding, ''What we want to do is to send a message to whoever is making these decisions that if you're pursuing nuclear weapons for the purpose of intimidating, of projecting your power, we're not going to let that happen.''
 It is unclear what a ''defense umbrella'' in the region would look like, however, and Mrs. Clinton offered no details when asked whether the United States was willing to extend the same defense over Middle East allies that it has already extended across Europe, Japan and South Korea. 
 ''We are not talking in specifics,'' she insisted. ''You hope for the best; you plan for the worst.''
 While the Obama administration has often said that it would not allow Iran to possess a nuclear weapon, some officials have hedged slightly when asked whether they could envision a situation in which Tehran, as part of a broader deal, might be permitted to produce its own nuclear fuel, called a fuel cycle in the nuclear industry. Reformers and hard-liners in Iran have said the country should produce its own fuel and have argued that it has that right as a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 But President George W. Bush had argued that Iran forfeited that right by conducting secret nuclear activities for 18 years. In contrast, Mohamed ElBaradei, the departing head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nonproliferation watchdog, has argued that the best way to avoid a confrontation is to allow Iran a token of nuclear fuel capacity, under toughened inspection rules to assure that fuel is not diverted for weapons. On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton seemed to side with the Bush administration. 
 ''You have a right to pursue the peaceful use of civil, nuclear power,'' she said, as if addressing Iran directly. ''You do not have a right to obtain a nuclear weapon. You do not have the right to have the full enrichment and reprocessing cycle under your control. But there's a lot that we can do with Iran if Iran accepts what is the international consensus.'' 
 Her phrase ''under your control'' seemed to leave open the possibility of having others enrich uranium on Iran's behalf, perhaps on Iranian soil.
 Mrs. Clinton also found herself in the uncomfortable position of explaining the recent comments of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who on returning from a visit to Georgia offered a surprisingly downbeat assessment of Russia's future and its intentions.
 ''They have a shrinking population base,'' Mr. Biden told The Wall Street Journal. ''They have a withering economy. They have a banking sector and structure that is not likely to be able to withstand the next 15 years. They're in a situation where the world is changing before them and they're clinging to something in the past that is not sustainable.''
 Asked whether Mr. Biden's message was that ''the U.S. now has the upper hand when it's dealing with Russia,'' she replied, ''No, and I don't think that's at all what the vice president meant.''
 ''We want a strong, peaceful and prosperous Russia,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Subsidies' Reach Is Critical Issue For Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The major health care bills moving through Congress would require nearly all Americans to have health insurance. But as lawmakers struggle to achieve the goal of universal coverage, a critical question is whether the plans will be affordable to those who are currently uninsured.
 All the bills offer some kind of assistance to lower-income people who do not get health benefits through the workplace. The bills would provide premium subsidies to millions of people and would establish limits on consumers' out-of-pocket costs. But lawmakers and consumer groups say insurance could still be out of reach for many families with modest incomes who receive small subsidies or none at all.
 ''We have to make sure that the health plans are affordable to average Americans, and to low-wage workers who are not eligible for Medicaid, because they would confront a penalty if they do not have health insurance,'' said Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a Republican who is leading efforts to forge a bipartisan bill. 
 The question of how to make insurance affordable to all Americans is just one of the difficult issues facing Congress as it debates what is President Obama's top domestic priority. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, despite resistance from conservative Democrats, vowed on Sunday that a health care overhaul would pass. ''When I take this bill to the floor, it will win,'' Ms. Pelosi said on CNN.
 Under the legislation, insurers generally must accept all applicants and could not deny coverage because of a person's medical history.
 But Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, acknowledged that ''there are some questions'' about whether insurance would be affordable. ''People who are making $50,000 or $60,000 a year and are spending $13,000 on health insurance may not get much of a subsidy,'' said Mr. Wyden, a member of the Finance Committee. ''Those people will ask, 'How am I going to make this work for me and my family?' ''
 When President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to overhaul the health care system in 1993-94, they proposed an employer mandate requiring companies to pay about 80 percent of the cost of coverage for their workers. In response, many businesses rallied against the Clinton plan and helped defeat it.
 Besides requiring employers to help finance coverage, Democrats this year would also require individuals to have insurance and would impose financial penalties on those who do not meet the requirement.
 Under all the major bills, people could obtain exemptions from the requirement to carry insurance if they could show financial hardship. But such exemptions do not help achieve the purpose of the legislation, which is to get people insured. More than 45 million people do not have health coverage.
 In a letter to Congress last week, advocates for patients -- including AARP, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association -- said the affordability of insurance was ''of paramount importance.'' 
 After analyzing the leading House and Senate bills, Stephen E. Finan, a health economist at the cancer society, said, ''Subsidies do not appear to be adequate even for coverage in the lowest-cost plans.'' 
 ''Under the bill approved by the Senate health committee,'' Mr. Finan said, ''a family with annual income of $40,000 could obtain subsidies, but would still have to pay premiums of $1,760 a year and might have to pay as much as $2,320 in co-payments and deductibles, for a total of $4,080, or 10 percent of family income. And they might have to pay more if they use specialists outside the network of doctors in their health plan.''
 Subsidies are a major factor in the cost of the legislation, and lawmakers are desperately hunting for ways to pay for it. The Congressional Budget Office says the government would spend $773 billion on subsidies from 2013 to 2019 under the House bill. Among people who receive assistance, it said, the average subsidy would be $4,600 in 2014, rising to $6,000 a person in 2019.
 Under the House bill and a similar measure approved by the Senate health committee, premium subsidies would be available to families with incomes up to four times the poverty level, or $88,200 for a family of four. With income at that level, a family could be required to pay as much as 12.5 percent of its income in premiums under the Senate bill and 11 percent under the House measure. 
 Lower-income families would receive more help. A family of four with income of $34,000 might pay 1 percent to 3 percent of its income in premiums.
 But lawmakers said that federal aid for low-income families could be pared back as Congress struggles to hold down the overall cost of the legislation.
 Premiums, which increase with health care costs, are rising much faster than personal income. So federal subsidies must also increase to keep insurance affordable.
 The Senate Finance Committee is considering proposals to limit eligibility for subsidies, a move favored by some fiscally conservative Democrats in the House Blue Dog Coalition. One proposal would bar subsidies for people with incomes over 300 percent of the poverty level ($66,150 for a family of four.)
 Richard J. Kirsch, the national campaign manager of Health Care for America Now, a consumer group, expressed concern. ''If Congress sets the limit at 300 percent of the poverty level,'' Mr. Kirsch said, ''millions of middle-income families would not be able to buy insurance because they could not afford the premiums on their own.'' 
 The median income for married-couple families was about $73,000 in 2007, the last year for which Census Bureau figures are available.
 Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a bipartisan advocacy group for children, said, ''We are very concerned that as the legislation evolves, insurance will become less and less affordable than under the original proposals.''
 Asked whether insurance would be affordable to everyone, Senator Snowe said: ''That's unknown. That will really be a test of this initiative in the final analysis.''
 Still, Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said the proposed subsidies would ''make health insurance significantly more affordable than it is today.'' 
 In addition, sponsors of the legislation said it would make insurance more affordable by slowing the growth of health costs in the long run.
 The Senate health committee bill says ''coverage is defined to be unaffordable if the premium paid by an individual is greater than 12.5 percent'' of the person's adjusted gross income.
 In Massachusetts, which requires all adults to have health insurance, about 76,000 people qualified for hardship exemptions in 2007, the first year of an innovative state program to expand coverage. Nearly 430,000 are newly insured, the state says.
 The major bills moving through Congress would set annual limits on out-of-pocket spending for co-payments, deductibles and similar charges. The limits would be $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family under the House bill, and $5,800 and $11,600 under the Senate health committee bill.
 Premiums are not counted against the limits. Nor are the extra charges that people often must pay when they go to doctors and hospitals outside an insurer's network. People with insurance are often startled to find that they are responsible for thousands of dollars in such extra charges.

HEADLINE: Competing Brands Of Republicanism

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
In this uncertain moment for the party of Lincoln, behold the jaunty, robust specimen of Republican centrism.
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California strides into a conference room in his Sacramento office with a smile, having wrestled down his state's mammoth budget deficit in a compromise with a Democratic-controlled Legislature. 
 Public service ''brings me joy'' just as Hollywood stardom did, he declares, walking a visitor toward the outdoor tent where he shares stogies with fellow politicians in the search for common ground. As sour as the nation feels toward most incumbents, tourists still crane to glimpse the Austrian emigre who first gained fame as a champion bodybuilder. 
 Now, across the country, see the slight, dour spokesman for orthodox Republicanism. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of the shrunken Republican minority, will never be mistaken for a bodybuilder or a movie star.
 In his Southern-accented monotone, the Alabama native urges colleagues on Capitol Hill to block President Obama's agenda and lower their sights toward incremental changes in health and energy policy. While Mr. Schwarzenegger exhorts the White House to ''never give up,'' Mr. McConnell criticizes the president's push to ''raise taxes in the middle of a recession'' to cover those without insurance. 
 Six months after President George W. Bush left the stage, neither brand of Republicanism fares especially well with the public. But there is no doubt which holds more midsummer box-office appeal among the party faithful -- and it is not the Terminator's.
 At Center Stage
 Combining star power with can-do enthusiasm, Mr. Schwarzenegger seems at first blush a model for Republican resurgence. His blend of fiscal conservatism and social moderation produced two lopsided election victories in the blue-state colossus of California.
 ''It's important that we are in the center,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in an interview. ''Because that's where the action is.''
 Yet that formulation has proved more successful in campaigns than governance. California's political culture represents an exaggerated version of the nation's, with starkly polarized parties and rules that inhibit leaders from acting.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger has appealed directly to Californians -- most recently in springtime ballot initiatives designed to attack the deficit by capping spending and raising taxes. Voters shouted ''No!'' -- forcing last week's deal to cut spending on state services so deeply that even the governor declined to declare victory.
 The results have estranged him from both sides, producing Bush-like approval ratings of under 40 percent. As he prepares to leave office next year, he sometimes sounds closer to Mr. Obama than his own party.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger does not rule out an Obama administration post, and urges the president to press ahead with a health care overhaul that tracks his own failed push on the issue in California.
 ''People say, 'Well, he has taken on too many things,' '' Mr. Schwarzenegger said of Mr. Obama. ''But if he doesn't take on the too many things, then they say, 'Well, he hasn't taken on enough.' ''
 Contrasting his approach with that of Sarah Palin, the conservative celebrity who has quit the Alaska governorship, he concluded, ''I would never give up.''
 Strength in Numbers
 Inside the Capitol, Mr. McConnell has a different Republican message: stick together in resisting Mr. Obama's ambition. 
 ''We have an example, in my view, of not doing it right, and that was the hurry-up job on the stimulus,'' Mr. McConnell said in an interview. ''They said we had to get it done almost immediately. If we didn't do it, unemployment would go over 8 percent. We did do it; unemployment is now going to go over 10 percent.''
 He continued, ''And the assumption that doing health care is going to help the economy, which the president's been selling, is utter nonsense.'' 
 That message gains traction with every new caution from the Congressional Budget Office, every tick up in unemployment, every slip in Mr. Obama's approval ratings. It emboldens a cadre of Senate Republicans -- including Senators Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine -- in their protracted negotiations with the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, on a possible compromise.
 ''I view them as somewhat like agents of the rest of our conference,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''They don't want to be part of an agreement that doesn't have widespread support among Republican senators.''
 That is a daunting negotiating burden, given the ideological gulf between the two parties. And because Republican resistance makes centrist Democrats waver, too, it means Mr. Obama's ''don't bet against us'' confidence faces a severe test even if Democrats move ahead without bipartisan support.
 ''The Senate is a place where it's pretty hard to steamroll the minority,'' said Mr. McConnell, flexing political muscles that have begun looking unexpectedly formidable.

HEADLINE: Science Is in the Details

BYLINE: By SAM HARRIS. 
Sam Harris is the author of ''The End of Faith'' and co-founder of the Reason Project, which promotes scientific knowledge and secular values.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA has nominated Francis Collins to be the next director of the National Institutes of Health. It would seem a brilliant choice. Dr. Collins's credentials are impeccable: he is a physical chemist, a medical geneticist and the former head of the Human Genome Project. He is also, by his own account, living proof that there is no conflict between science and religion. In 2006, he published ''The Language of God,'' in which he claimed to demonstrate ''a consistent and profoundly satisfying harmony'' between 21st-century science and evangelical Christianity.
 Dr. Collins is regularly praised by secular scientists for what he is not: he is not a ''young earth creationist,'' nor is he a proponent of ''intelligent design.'' Given the state of the evidence for evolution, these are both very good things for a scientist not to be. 
 But as director of the institutes, Dr. Collins will have more responsibility for biomedical and health-related research than any person on earth, controlling an annual budget of more than $30 billion. He will also be one of the foremost representatives of science in the United States. For this reason, it is important that we understand Dr. Collins and his faith as they relate to scientific inquiry. 
 What follows are a series of slides, presented in order, from a lecture on science and belief that Dr. Collins gave at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2008:
 Slide 1: ''Almighty God, who is not limited in space or time, created a universe 13.7 billion years ago with its parameters precisely tuned to allow the development of complexity over long periods of time.''
 Slide 2: ''God's plan included the mechanism of evolution to create the marvelous diversity of living things on our planet. Most especially, that creative plan included human beings.''
 Slide 3: ''After evolution had prepared a sufficiently advanced 'house' (the human brain), God gifted humanity with the knowledge of good and evil (the moral law), with free will, and with an immortal soul.'' 
 Slide 4: ''We humans used our free will to break the moral law, leading to our estrangement from God. For Christians, Jesus is the solution to that estrangement.''
 Slide 5: ''If the moral law is just a side effect of evolution, then there is no such thing as good or evil. It's all an illusion. We've been hoodwinked. Are any of us, especially the strong atheists, really prepared to live our lives within that worldview?''
 Why should Dr. Collins's beliefs be of concern?
 There is an epidemic of scientific ignorance in the United States. This isn't surprising, as very few scientific truths are self-evident, and many are counterintuitive. It is by no means obvious that empty space has structure or that we share a common ancestor with both the housefly and the banana. It can be difficult to think like a scientist. But few things make thinking like a scientist more difficult than religion.
 Dr. Collins has written that science makes belief in God ''intensely plausible'' -- the Big Bang, the fine-tuning of nature's constants, the emergence of complex life, the effectiveness of mathematics, all suggest the existence of a ''loving, logical and consistent'' God.
 But when challenged with alternative accounts of these phenomena -- or with evidence that suggests that God might be unloving, illogical, inconsistent or, indeed, absent -- Dr. Collins will say that God stands outside of Nature, and thus science cannot address the question of his existence at all. 
 Similarly, Dr. Collins insists that our moral intuitions attest to God's existence, to his perfectly moral character and to his desire to have fellowship with every member of our species. But when our moral intuitions recoil at the casual destruction of innocents by, say, a tidal wave or earthquake, Dr. Collins assures us that our time-bound notions of good and evil can't be trusted and that God's will is a mystery.
 Most scientists who study the human mind are convinced that minds are the products of brains, and brains are the products of evolution. Dr. Collins takes a different approach: he insists that at some moment in the development of our species God inserted crucial components -- including an immortal soul, free will, the moral law, spiritual hunger, genuine altruism, etc. 
 As someone who believes that our understanding of human nature can be derived from neuroscience, psychology, cognitive science and behavioral economics, among others, I am troubled by Dr. Collins's line of thinking. I also believe it would seriously undercut fields like neuroscience and our growing understanding of the human mind. If we must look to religion to explain our moral sense, what should we make of the deficits of moral reasoning associated with conditions like frontal lobe syndrome and psychopathy? Are these disorders best addressed by theology?
 Dr. Collins has written that ''science offers no answers to the most pressing questions of human existence'' and that ''the claims of atheistic materialism must be steadfastly resisted.'' 
 One can only hope that these convictions will not affect his judgment at the institutes of health. After all, understanding human well-being at the level of the brain might very well offer some ''answers to the most pressing questions of human existence'' -- questions like, Why do we suffer? Or, indeed, is it possible to love one's neighbor as oneself? And wouldn't any effort to explain human nature without reference to a soul, and to explain morality without reference to God, necessarily constitute ''atheistic materialism''? 
 Francis Collins is an accomplished scientist and a man who is sincere in his beliefs. And that is precisely what makes me so uncomfortable about his nomination. Must we really entrust the future of biomedical research in the United States to a man who sincerely believes that a scientific understanding of human nature is impossible?

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Jump As Prices Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Sales of new homes in the United States posted their largest monthly gain in nearly eight years in June, the government reported on Monday, a sign that the housing market is bottoming as buyers take advantage of lower prices.
 The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 11 percent in June; economists' expected a 3 percent increase. 
 The pace of home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 384,000 a year, the highest level since November. 
 But the figures offered no sign that the housing market had returned to health.
 Despite the monthly increase, sales of new homes were still down 21 percent from June 2008. The market is still swamped by a glut of for-sale houses. And new homes, facing competition from cheap foreclosures, are sitting on the market for close to a year before they sell, compared with a median time of six months on the market in 2007.
 ''These are still really bad numbers,'' an economist at IHS Global Insight, Patrick Newport, said. ''The market just couldn't have dropped much further.''
 Compared with June 2008, sales of new homes fell 11 percent in the Northeast, were down 10 percent in the West and plunged more than a third in the South. New-home sales were up only in the Midwest, by 6 percent. 
 As sales rose in June, median prices of new homes continued to fall, slipping to $206,200, from $232,100 a year ago. 
 The figures were the latest evidence that a three-year slump in the country's housing market was leveling off as prices fell back and some builders and buyers began to step tentatively back into the market. 
 Earlier this month, the government reported that housing starts rose 3.6 percent in June from a month earlier, and a trade group reported that sales of previously owned homes also rose for another month.
 ''Sales are picking up a little,'' a senior economist at 4Cast, David Sloan, said. ''Whether it's going to pick up any momentum is really the key. I think we have to be doubtful about that.''
 Many economists expect prices to continue to slide, weighed down by heavy supplies, competition from distressed sellers and tepid demand from potential buyers.
 ''Prices will continue to edge lower at the bottom end of the market even as demand for these homes picks up a bit,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a research note. ''And conditions remain brutal in the middle and upper ranges of the spectrum, with rising unemployment and prices that are still considerably too high in many markets being major impediments to gains in activity.''
 On Tuesday, a closely watched measure of home prices will be released, offering some hints about whether the long plunge in housing values is abating. Economists are expecting a 17.9 percent year-over-year decline in prices in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index of 20 major metropolitan areas.
 Although new-home sales have risen for three months, many economists worry that rising unemployment, stagnant wages and continued tightness in lending markets will weigh down the housing market for the rest of the year.
 ''There's still worries that the lack of employment growth and lack of wage growth is restraining consumer income, and that's going to ensure that the recovery is quite modest,'' Mr. Sloan said.

HEADLINE: Lawsuit Seeks To Save Art Museum at Brandeis

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Three overseers of the Rose Art Museum filed a lawsuit on Monday in state court in Massachusetts, seeking to halt Brandeis University's plans to close the museum and clear the way to sell some of its works, which include pieces by Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly. The university's trustees voted in January to close the museum and sell the works, collectively estimated to be worth a total in the area of $350 million, as a way to help the university contend with an endowment that has been seriously diminished during the financial crisis. Brandeis later backtracked, saying that no works would be sold in the immediate future and that the building would remain open as an art study center, though not as a public museum. 
In their suit the overseers -- Jonathan O. Lee, Lois Foster and Meryl Rose, a member of the family whose donations created the museum in 1961 -- contend that Brandeis's plans to close the museum ''contradict the charitable intentions'' of the museum's founders, ''abrogate Brandeis's promises that the Rose would be maintained in perpetuity'' as a modern and contemporary art museum, and violate its commitments to those who donated art to the museum. In a statement, attorneys for the university called the lawsuit frivolous and without merit, arguing that the Rose's endowment is part of the larger Brandeis endowment, and that the university is focused first and foremost on ''providing its students with a first class education and ensuring that Brandeis continues to provide financial assistance to needy students.'' 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Homeless Families Could Face Eviction From Shelters Over Rules

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Homeless families can be kicked out of city shelters for repeatedly breaking rules like staying out past curfew or for refusing apartments offered to them, according to a tougher policy that takes effect Tuesday. 
 The new policy gives the city greater latitude to push families out of the shelter system, which had swelled to a near-high of 9,720 families as of Sunday. Families could always be evicted for illegal behavior like bringing in drugs or weapons, but they can now be ousted for any of 28 violations, including failing to sign in and out or not keeping an active case file with city welfare agencies. 
 The new policy is also meant to encourage families to more readily accept permanent housing, even if it is not to their liking. 
 ''We would only expect to use this process in the most egregious of situations,'' said Robert V. Hess, the commissioner for homeless services, in an interview on Monday. ''We do have a small number of families where temporary emergency shelter is really being used as permanent housing.''
 Evictions are for a 30-day period.
 The five homeless shelters that are fully operated by the Department of Homeless Services will be the first to test out the new rules, which go into effect there on Tuesday. Shelters operated by the roughly 150 organizations that hold contracts with the city will begin by Aug. 17. 
 Steven R. Banks, the attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society who has represented homeless families in decades-long litigation against the city, said he believed that the policy would be harmful to children and especially to adults with physical and mental impairments, who might be at risk of sanction. 
 ''With all of the problems that the state has and all of the problems that the city has right now, in the midst of this economic downturn, it's shocking that the state and the city are prepared to invest the resources to put innocent children and their families out of safety-net shelters onto the streets,'' Mr. Banks said. ''You have to wonder who needs this, with all of the other issues that are going on.'' 
 Several nonprofit shelter providers, who asked not to be identified because they feared retaliation from the administration, said that they did not intend to evict any families from shelters. 
 But others said they were grateful for the ability to threaten the most difficult families with ejection. 
 ''If you need a big stick now and then, for certain families, so be it,'' said Richard Motta, the president and chief executive of Volunteers of America of Greater New York, which runs three family shelters. 
 The lack of such a threat was a problem, Mr. Motta said.
 ''There's not a caseworker alive that wants to realize that threat, and as an agency, we don't want to move people to the streets,'' he said. ''That's not what we're in business to do. But if you enter the shelter, if you know there's a threat of being put out of the shelter, you'll be more likely to follow the rules.''
 The city already has the power to eject single adults from shelters. 
 State approval was required to put into place the new policies for families. After months of lobbying from city officials, and opposition from local advocates for the homeless, the approval was granted by David A. Hansell, the commissioner of the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, on June 25, his second-to-last day on the job. Mr. Hansell, a former Bloomberg administration official, resigned from his post to take a job with the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
 Mr. Hansell decided that the policy would be in effect for only one year as a ''demonstration project,'' a move that Mr. Hess said he supported. Ten months after the policy begins, the city will be required to write a report on the results to that point. 
 Mr. Hess said it was not clear where families removed from shelter might turn. ''The most likely outcome is that the family would demonstrate that they do have a place to go,'' he said.
 An instructional guide provided to shelter operators appears to leave open the possibility that families will be subject to the elements. It instructs shelter operators that no families should be ejected during a ''Code Blue Winter Weather Alert,'' or when the temperature drops to 32 degrees.

HEADLINE: Budgets by the People, for the People

BYLINE: By CHRIS ELMENDORF and ETHAN J. LEIB. 
Chris Elmendorf is a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. Ethan J. Leib is a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.

 BODY:
NEARLY a month after the June 30 deadline, California's Legislature and governor have finally agreed on a budget for the new fiscal year. The embarrassing debacle of paying the state's bills with i.o.u.'s will come to an end -- at least for a while. Though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had pledged not to ''kick the can down the road,'' the budget he intends to sign today relies on $8 billion in accounting and revenue gimmickry, virtually guaranteeing another fiscal crisis next year. 
 For states as well as families, hard economic times require difficult choices. But some states find themselves in budget battles even when they don't have the bad economy to use as an excuse. California is the prime recidivist, but since 2002, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin have also failed to close the deal on a budget on time. Government shutdowns resulted on five occasions. 
 Budget breakdowns most often occur under conditions of divided government -- when Democratic and Republican lawmakers must compromise with one another to get a budget passed. Yet many voters like divided government, and for good reason. Distrusting of the extremes in both parties, these voters want their states to follow middle-of-the-road fiscal policies. 
 California's Constitution has long required the Legislature to adopt a budget with a two-thirds vote; eight other states now necessitate supermajorities for some budget items. Such rules effectively force the majority party to negotiate with the minority on the budget since it is rare for one party to win two-thirds of the seats in a state legislature. 
 In California and elsewhere, politicians and analysts have called for constitutional conventions to revise the basic charter of state government. Believing that fed-up voters will reject any reforms on which political insiders have left their prints, some have suggested that delegates to the convention consist of ordinary citizens selected at random in a process akin to being called for jury duty. 
 But jurors are given a pretty limited task. They decide one case at a time and their basic choice is binary: guilty or not guilty, victory for the plaintiff or for the defendant. It is probably wishful thinking to expect random citizens to redesign state government from top to bottom.
 We suggest a more modest role for an assembly of ordinary citizens: breaking budget stalemates. Here's how it would work. If the Legislature and the governor fail to adopt a budget four weeks before the deadline for the new fiscal year, a group of randomly selected citizens -- one from each legislative district -- would be convened to resolve the stalemate. Three competing budgets would be drawn up: one by the governor, one by the Democratic caucuses in the legislative branch and one by the Republican caucuses. (These proposed budgets would have to be finalized before the citizens were selected.)
 For two weeks, the citizens' assembly would hear from and question government leaders, policy experts, interest groups and other supporters and critics of the proposed budgets. The citizens would then deliberate among themselves and vote by secret ballot on which of the budgets to adopt. The vote would take place on the budgets as originally submitted; neither the citizens nor lawmakers would be able to make amendments. The winning budget would become law.
 This arrangement would have a number of virtues. First, it would ensure that states adopt budgets in a timely fashion, protecting bond ratings and freeing lawmakers to attend to other important business. 
 Second, it would give the three institutional actors in the budgetary process -- the governor and the Democratic and Republican caucuses -- strong incentives to devise budgets that appeal to middle-of-the-road voters, not political ideologues or special-interest favor seekers. Citizens who participate in the two-week assembly would also learn an awful lot about their state's fiscal situation and competing legislative priorities. These citizen participants would not be as susceptible to sound-bite misinformation as in more traditional exercises of direct democracy. 
 Our scheme would also do wonders for accountability. When budgets are adopted under divided government (or supermajority requirements), it is hard for voters to figure out exactly who is responsible for the shape of the compromises. If the upside of divided government is centrist compromise, the downside is weakened retrospective accountability at the polls. Our approach to budgeting promotes accountability because the enacted budget would unequivocally belong to ''the governor,'' ''the Republicans'' or ''the Democrats.'' Dissatisfied voters would know exactly whom to reward or fault when they go to the polls at the next election. 
 Finally, our proposal honors Americans' insistence on a strong popular voice in government, without demanding too much of citizen participants. It would require them to perform only a fairly simple task: rank your preferences among three proposed budgets, after hearing out the proponents and opponents of each. 
 Elsewhere, citizens have already proven themselves able to make measured, well-reasoned decisions about budgetary issues in small-group deliberative settings. The Brazilian city of Porto Alegre has been doing participatory budgeting since 1989, which has helped to equalize severe disparities in the standards of living among its residents. In Zeguo Township, China, citizens have been convened through statistically random sampling to establish spending priorities for road, building and construction projects. 
 Here at home, our participatory budgeting procedure would not be a panacea. But it should result in timely budgets, tailored to the concerns of average voters, for which elected officials can be held to account. That's definitely better than the mess we have now.

HEADLINE: In Tennessee Corner, Stimulus Meets New Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: LINDEN, Tenn. 

 BODY:
Critics elsewhere may be questioning how many jobs the stimulus program has created, but here in central Tennessee, hundreds of workers are again drawing paychecks after many months out of work, thanks to a novel use of federal stimulus money by state officials.
 Here in one of Tennessee's hardest-hit areas, some workers were cutting down pine trees with chainsaws and clearing undergrowth on a recent morning, just past the auto parts factory that laid them off last year when it moved to Mexico. Others were taking applications for unemployment benefits at the very center where they themselves had applied not long ago. A few were making turnovers at the Armstrong Pie Company (''The South's Finest Since 1946'').
The state decided to spend some of its money to try to reduce unemployment by up to 40 percent here in Perry County, a rural county of 7,600 people, 90 miles southwest of Nashville where the unemployment rate had risen to above 25 percent after its biggest plant, the auto parts factory, closed.
 Rather than waiting for big projects to be planned and awarded to construction companies, or for tax cuts to trickle through the economy, state officials hit upon a New Deal model of trying to put people directly to work as quickly as possible. 
 They are using welfare money from the stimulus package to subsidize 300 new jobs across Perry County, with employers ranging from the state Transportation Department to the milkshake place near the high school. 
 As a result, the June unemployment rate, which does not yet include all the new jobs, dropped to 22.1 percent.
 ''If I could have done a W.P.A. out there, I would have done a W.P.A. out there,'' said Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, referring to the Works Progress Administration, which employed millions during the Great Depression. 
 ''I really think the president is trying to do the right thing with the stimulus,'' Mr. Bredesen said, ''but so much of that stuff is kind of stratospheric. When you've got 27 percent unemployment, that is a full-fledged depression down in Perry County, and let's just see if we can't figure out how to do something that's just much more on the ground and direct, that actually gets people jobs.''
 Tennessee is planning to pay for most of the new jobs, which it expects will cost $3 million to $5 million, with part of its share of $5 billion that was included in the stimulus for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the main cash welfare program for families with children. The state did not wait for the federal paperwork to clear before putting residents of Perry County back to work. 
 Other states are still drawing up plans for spending the welfare money, which is typically used for items like cash grants for families and job training. Some are likely to use part of it to subsidize employment, as Tennessee is doing, but it is hard to imagine many other places where the creation of so few jobs could have such an immediate and outsize impact as it did in this bucolic county. 
 A stimulus job came just in time for Frank Smith, 41, whose family was facing eviction after he lost his job as a long-haul truck driver. Then he landed a job with the Transportation Department.
 ''The day I came from my interview here, I was sitting in the court up here where I was being evicted,'' Mr. Smith said after a sweaty morning clearing trees under a hot sun to make room for new electric poles. ''Luckily I'm still in the same place. There's a lot of people that were totally displaced.''
 Scott and Allison Kimble married after meeting on the assembly line at the Fisher & Company auto parts plant. When the factory closed last year and relocated to Mexico, the Kimbles, along with many of their friends and neighbors, found themselves out of work. Now Mr. Kimble has a stimulus job working for the Transportation Department, and Ms. Kimble has one in what has become a growth industry, taking telephone applications for unemployment benefits. 
 ''I know what they feel like,'' she said between calls. ''I've been in their position.'' 
 Michael B. Smith, 53, who drove a forklift at the plant for 31 years, now drives a Caterpillar to clear land for a developer. Robert Mackin, 55, who lost his job, his health insurance and his home, now has a job with the Transportation Department, a rental home, health insurance and an added benefit: the state employee discount when his daughter goes to a state college.
 ''With a degree, she can always go somewhere,'' Mr. Mackin said. 
 The impact has been enormous, all across the county. Even the look of the place is changing, following the old W.P.A. model. In addition to the jobs for adults, there are 150 summer jobs for young people, some of whom have been working with resident artists to paint murals depicting local history on the buildings along Main Street in Linden, the county seat. 
 Over all, two-thirds of the new jobs are in private sector businesses, which are reimbursed by the state for the salaries of eligible stimulus workers. Some, in retail, might be hard to sustain when the stimulus money runs out in September 2010. Other businesses say the free labor will help them expand, hopefully enough to keep a bigger work force. 
 The Commodore Hotel Linden, a newly restored 1939 hotel that has brought new life to downtown, has seen an increase in its bookings since it has expanded its staff thanks to the stimulus. And the Armstrong Pie Company expects to be able to keep on the new bakery assistants and drivers it hired with stimulus money, saying the new workers have helped the company triple its pie production and expand its reach through central Tennessee.
 The county mayor, John Carroll, has been working to lure new industry to the area. Walking through the cavernous, empty Fisher plant, Mr. Carroll pointed to a forgotten display case filled with dozens of awards for safety and manufacturing excellence. ''What we can offer,'' he said, ''is a great work force.''
 Mr. Kimble said the new jobs had given him and his wife paychecks, health insurance and a reason to get up each morning. But he said he hoped that a big, long-term employer would move in soon. 
 ''This job here is not a permanent fix,'' he said. ''We still need some kind of industry to look and come into Perry County. But for right now we've got hope, and when you've got hope, you've got a way.''

HEADLINE: Jobless, and Willing to Help if a Hurricane Hits

BYLINE: By YOLANNE ALMANZAR

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Robert Tabler would rather be paid for his expertise in disaster management. But despite having a doctorate and much experience, Mr. Tabler could not find a job for most of the past year. So he worked for a time without pay at the Hillsborough County emergency operations center near his home in Tampa, Fla.
 ''Volunteering keeps me out in the community where I feel like I'm making a difference,'' he said. 
 Such are the unexpected blessings of hurricane season in a time of high unemployment. Even as the recession has led to reduced budgets, it is also bringing forth a class of highly skilled volunteers who agree to work for only a thank you. 
 These volunteers, like Mr. Tabler, are most visible in the areas of Florida hardest hit by the economic downturn. In some southern counties, volunteer numbers have risen 25 percent since 2006. 
 Whether they will be enough to handle a large storm, given budget cuts of around 16 percent in some areas, remains to be seen. But emergency managers say the new volunteers will help at a time they are forced to make do with less.
 Cynthia Gutierrez-White, of the American Red Cross of Greater Miami and the Keys, said she received an e-mail message almost every day from someone recently laid-off and looking to give back. With about 1,200 trained volunteers, Ms. Gutierrez-White's chapter can open 25 shelters to handle a hurricane. Just two years ago, with half the number of volunteers, only five shelters could be opened.
 The volunteer crop this year, she said, is an especially diverse group. It includes an unemployed chef who wants to help out in the kitchen, a former engineer who conducts shelter surveys and inspections, and the owner of a logistics company who runs the Red Cross's supply warehouse at no charge as part of his business.
 ''These people have valuable skill-sets,'' she said. ''They can hit the ground running sooner, and that's advantageous for us.''
 Chuck Lanza, director of the Broward County Emergency Management Division, said the budget this year was a little more than $1 million, about 10 percent less than four years ago during Hurricane Wilma. Mr. Lanza said two vacant positions in his office might be cut next year before they were even filled. To him, that means getting creative.
 ''There's certainly a possibility that we'd use volunteers for positions they're normally not used for,'' he said.
 One new program initiated by the county trains residents in assessing damage so devastated neighborhoods are identified sooner. In the past, fire and police officials would do this. Mr. Lanza said a person with relevant experience might even get into the emergency operations center, a place normally reserved for staff members.
 Also in Broward County, more than 10,000 residents have been trained in a federally financed program called the Community Emergency Response Team, a 25 percent increase from three years ago, said Kimberly H. Spill, emergency manager at City of Pompano Beach Fire Rescue.
 They include Steven J. Madson Sr., 57, of Pompano Beach, who joined after being laid off as a project manager for disaster recovery at a telecommunications company. And now, Mr. Madson is among the county's most skilled volunteers, with training in fire suppression, search and rescue techniques, and basic disaster medical operations.
 ''Part of it was because I hadn't been working for so long that I needed to stimulate myself and I needed to do something more with myself,'' he said. 
 Mr. Tabler, 52, had a similar experience in Hillsborough County. He had just finished his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of South Florida, and for the last two decades he had specialized in gerontology and disaster management, volunteering at special-needs shelters in his spare time. But since his last job creating an all-hazards plan for the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center, he had only a few jobs writing grants and creating disaster booklets for disabled individuals.
 ''I've never ever had a problem getting a job,'' he said. ''Usually had two or three at a time.'' 
 For the third time in nine years, a temporary position was created for Mr. Tabler at the emergency operations center. But when the job ended a few weeks ago, he still had no new leads. He reduced his hours at the emergency operations center to look for work, but he said he still planned to be on hand in the case of a storm. 
 Laura Zublionis, director of the volunteer center at United Way of Volusia-Flagler Counties, said it was still unclear whether volunteers like Mr. Tabler would appear when they were needed. Mrs. Zublionis said that her area had also found more skilled volunteers -- the number of callers seeking to help has nearly doubled this year -- but that some who were unemployed might not be able to offer assistance if they became victims themselves.
 ''The folks who are already unemployed are tapping into the assistance system of food stamps and rent assistance,'' she said. ''A hurricane would be a double impact on them.''
 Richard Moore, a planner in Volusia County's emergency management office, said his department was hoping to draw upon other places for volunteers, like religion-based organizations that could provide hundreds of people in a short amount of time.
 ''I'm seeing a change in volunteerism,'' Mr. Moore said, ''from the government structured organizations to faith-based, unaffiliated volunteers, like the people who don't belong to the Red Cross or Salvation Army.''
 Mr. Tabler said he finally found a job, starting in August. Whether or not it works out, he said that he would continue to volunteer at the emergency operations center and that he planned to be on hand in the event of a hurricane.
 During a storm, he said, ''that's when you're needed the most.''

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PILLAR IN PAKISTAN AREA IS AMONG MISSING

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and PIR ZUBAIR SHAH

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Even as hundreds of thousands of people stream back to the Swat Valley after months of fighting, one important group is conspicuously absent: the wealthy landowners who fled the Taliban in fear and are the economic pillar of the rural society. 
 The reluctance of the landowners to return is a significant blow to the Pakistani military's campaign to restore Swat as a stable, prosperous part of Pakistan, and it presents a continuing opportunity for the Taliban to reshape the valley to their advantage. 
 About four dozen landlords were singled out over the past two years by the militants in a strategy intended to foment a class struggle. In some areas, the Taliban rewarded the landless peasants with profits of the crops of the landlords. Some resentful peasants even signed up as the Taliban's shock troops. 
 How many of those peasants stayed with the militants during the army offensive of the last several months, and how many moved to the refugee camps, was difficult to assess, Pakistani analysts said. 
 But reports emerging from Swat show that the Taliban still have the strength to terrorize important areas. The army continues to fight the Taliban in their strongholds, particularly in the Matta and Kabal regions of Swat, not far from the main city, Mingora, where many refugees have reclaimed their homes.
 In those regions, the Taliban have razed houses, killed a civilian working for the police in Matta and kidnapped another, worrying counterinsurgency experts, who fear that the refugees may have been encouraged by the Pakistani authorities to go back too soon. 
 The rebuilding of Swat, a fertile area of orchards and forests, is a critical test for the government and the military as they face Taliban insurgencies across the tribal belt, particularly in Waziristan on the Afghanistan border. 
 In a sign of the lack of confidence that Mingora was secure, the Pakistani military declined a request by the Obama administration's special envoy to Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke, to visit the town last week. 
 There was nervousness, an American counterinsurgency expert said, that the plans by the Pakistani authorities to build new community police forces in Swat would not materialize quickly enough to protect the returning civilians, who are also starved of basic services like banks and sufficient medical care. 
 ''There is no apparatus in place to replace the army,'' said an American counterinsurgency official. ''The army will be the backstop.'' 
 About two million people have fled Swat and surrounding areas since the military opened its campaign to push back the Taliban at the end of April. The United Nations said Monday that 478,000 people had returned to Swat so far, but it cautioned that it was unable to verify the figure, which was provided by the government. 
 Assessment trips by United Nations workers to Swat scheduled for Monday and Tuesday were canceled for security reasons, and the United Nations office in Peshawar that serves as the base for Swat operations was closed Monday because of a high threat of kidnapping, a spokesman said. 
 The landlords, many of whom raised sizable militias to fight the Taliban themselves last year, say the army is again failing to provide enough protection if they return.
 Another deterrent to returning, they say, is that the top Taliban leadership, responsible for taking aim at the landlords and spreading the spoils among the landless, remains unscathed. 
 If it continues, the landlords' absence will have lasting ramifications not only for Swat, but also for Pakistan's most populated province, Punjab, where the landholdings are vast, and the militants are gaining power, said Vali Nasr, a senior adviser to Mr. Holbrooke, the American envoy. 
 ''If the large landowners are kept out by the Taliban, the result will in effect be property redistribution,'' Mr. Nasr said. ''That will create a vested community of support for the Taliban that will see benefit in the absence of landlords.'' 
 At two major meetings with the landlords, the Pakistani military and civilian authorities requested that they return in the vanguard of the refugees. None have agreed to do so, according to several of the landowners and a senior army officer.
 ''We have sacrificed so much; what has the government and the military done for us?'' asked Sher Shah Khan, a landholder in the Kuz Bandai area of Swat. He is now living with 50 family members in a rented house about 60 miles from Swat. Four family members and eight servants were killed trying to fight off the Taliban, he said. 
 At one of the meetings, Mr. Khan said he had asked the army commanders to provide weapons so the landlords could protect themselves, as the landowners had in the past. 
 The military refused the request, he said, saying it would fight the Taliban. Yet Pakistani soldiers had failed to protect his lands, he said. Twenty of his houses were blown up by the Taliban after the army ordered him and his family to leave their lands on two hours' notice last September, he said. 
 A letter he sent last month to Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the head of the Pakistani military, asking for compensation has gone unanswered, he said. In the meantime, one of his tenants called asking if he could plant crops on Mr. Khan's property. He refused but had little idea what was happening back home, Mr. Khan said. 
 Other landlords are equally frustrated. The mayor of Swat, Jamal Nasir, fled after his father, Shujaat Ali Khan, regarded as the biggest landlord in Swat, narrowly avoided being killed by the Taliban. Mr. Nasir, a major landowner himself, now stays in his house in Islamabad. 
 The top guns of the Taliban are still in Swat, or perhaps in neighboring Dir, Mr. Nasir said. ''These people should be arrested,'' he said. ''If they are not arrested, they are going to come back.'' 
 Another landlord, Sher Mohammad, said he was still bitter that the army refused to help as he, his brother and his nephew fought off the Taliban last year for 13 hours, even though soldiers were stationed less than a mile away. Mr. Mohammad was hit in the groin by a bullet and lost a finger in the fight. 
 At one of the meetings with the military in Peshawar, Mr. Mohammad, a prominent politician with the Pakistan Peoples Party, said he told the officers that he was not impressed with their performance. 
 ''They said, 'We will protect you,' '' he recalled. ''I said, 'We don't trust you.' ''

HEADLINE: Selling Gum With Health Claims

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
THE slogan for Trident in the 1970s -- ''four out of five dentists surveyed recommend sugarless gums for their patients who chew gum'' -- typified how sugarless gum was marketed for decades after Trident, now a division of Cadbury North America, first introduced a saccharine-sweetened gum in 1964. Those much-cited dentists were saying not that sugar-free was good, of course, as much as preferable to regular gum. 
 Today, however, sugarless brands claim not that they do less harm but untold good. In the last two years, the two dominant gum makers, Cadbury and Wm. Wrigley Jr., a division of Mars, have won approval to carry the American Dental Association seal on several sugarless brands. Chewing gum after eating helps reduce cavities, an A.D.A. statement on packages indicates. 
 Chewing gums also promise to whiten teeth or kill germs that cause foul breath, and consumers are biting: for the 52 weeks that ended July 12, revenue for sugarless brands -- many of which claim some dental benefit -- rose 6 percent over the previous year, totaling $2.2 billion, according to Information Resources Inc., whose totals exclude sales at Wal-Mart. Sugarless gum -- which now accounts for more than 80 percent of gum sold, compared with 48 percent in 1998 --posted year-over-year growth in each of the last 12 months, despite the financial slowdown. 
 ''As long as the deep economic recession lasts, millions of Americans will think of saving money on postponed visits to the dentist, every time they select a chewing gum,'' Packaged Facts, a market research firm, said in a recent report. 
 ''For many years, gum played in the mint category,'' said Doris Tancredi, a vice president in Cadbury's science division. ''But now the oral care segment is clearly outpacing the overall category.''
 In a commercial for Trident Xtra Care by the JWT unit of WPP that was shown earlier this year, a man in a library discreetly slips a piece of gum in his mouth, only to have his teeth start loudly singing ''thank you.'' A voice-over explains that the gum contains Recaldent, which ''strengthens tooth enamel to help prevent cavities.''
 Beginning this September, the brand, which was introduced in 2008, will distribute four million sample packs through dentists, hoping Novocain-numbed patients will view the gum in the same cavity-fighting light as the free toothbrushes and toothpaste dentists hand out.
 In 2001 the company introduced Trident White, which, along with Wrigley's Orbit White, is among the 10 best selling sugarless gums. While the target demographic for sugarless gum typically has been 18- to 34-year-olds, Ms. Tancredi said the company was now focusing on older Americans with its ''wellness agenda,'' which also pitches gum as a diet aid for ''snack avoidance.'' 
 Wrigley, whose Orbit brand carries the dental association seal and tops the sugarless gum category, also aims at dieters. The company's Extra brand has sponsored ''The Biggest Loser,'' the weight-loss reality show on NBC, for four seasons, enjoying prominent placement, like a coach holding up a pack and recommending it by name to contestants.
 Wrigley, which declined interview requests, provided a statement saying that for ''more than 25 years, Wrigley has pioneered independent, clinical research to support the oral health care benefits of chewing sugar-free gum,'' adding that it projects ''significant growth opportunities in wellness and oral care.''
 The company formed the Wrigley Science Institute in 2005 to help underscore ''the benefits of chewing,'' a trademarked term. Some research has more validity than other efforts, with studies suggesting that gum helps in areas like oral health, dieting, stress relief and focus and concentration; one study even suggested that chewing gum helped adolescents improve standardized math test scores. (''Research conducted in the area of chewing gum and cognitive performance is complex,'' Wrigley says in a typical caveat on its Web site, ''but results are emerging on a number of fronts that may point us toward a better understanding.'')
 Rather than crediting some special ingredient, the dental association's statement on gum labels says simply that ''the physical action of chewing'' gum for 20 minutes after eating ''stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth.'' Saliva has naturally occurring calcium and phosphate, which strengthen tooth enamel.
 Brands that make the boldest dental claims do not carry the dental association's seal, because they have not applied for it, which would require submitting scientific verification. Neither Trident White nor Orbit White carries the seal, though both Wrigley and Cadbury say their studies demonstrate efficacy. 
 Wrigley's Eclipse, which brags of ''natural germ killing'' properties because it contains magnolia bark extract, or M.B.E., and Trident Xtra Care, with its professed strengthener Recaldent, also lack the dental association's stamp. Concerning those brands, in fact, Wrigley and Cadbury have accused one another of overblown claims, filing challenges with the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureaus. 
 Concerning the complaint against Eclipse, the advertising panel ruled in April that the brand's ''germ killing'' claim should be ''discontinued or modified to indicate that there is emerging evidence as to M.B.E.'s germ-killing capability without expressly or by implication communicating that there is credible scientific evidence that the gum has been proven to kill the germs that cause bad breath.'' Wrigley filed an appeal, which has yet to be heard.
 As for Trident Xtra Care, when Cadbury declined to participate in the inquiry in October 2008, the Better Business Bureau panel referred the matter to the Federal Trade Commission, which has not yet issued a ruling. (Both companies declined to comment on the proceedings.)
 Whether brands dial down claims or not, though, dental benefits are likely to remain a selling point. Packaged Facts predicts that sales of gums that make oral health claims will increase nearly 40 percent by 2014 over 2008.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Sugarless gum accounts for more than 80 percent of gum sold, and in ads and Web sites, big brands like Trident and Wrigley are increasingly leaning on claims that their gums can whiten teeth, kill germs and more.

HEADLINE: In War and Isolation, a Fighter for Afghan Women

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
Everybody wants Pashtoon Azfar. Her government, American aid groups and her own colleagues, the midwives of Afghanistan, all want her to work for them, lead them, help them rebuild a health system from the rubble of war. 
 Ms. Azfar, 51, is trying to oblige. By day she directs Afghanistan's Institute of Health Sciences, by night she works for a nonprofit group from Johns Hopkins University that focuses on women and children's health, and somehow she also manages to serve as president of the Afghan Midwives Association. 
 Visiting from Kabul recently, she was the star at a Capitol Hill briefing titled ''Maternal Health in Afghanistan: How Can We Save Women's Lives?'' Her audience included members of the Congressional caucus for women's issues. 
 Afghanistan has the world's second-highest death rate in women during pregnancy and childbirth (only Sierra Leone's is worse). For every 100,000 births, 1,600 mothers die; in wealthy countries the rates range from 1 to 12. In one remote northeastern province, Badakhshan, 6,507 mothers die for every 100,000 births, according to a 2005 report in the medical journal Lancet. In all, 26,000 Afghan women a year die while pregnant or giving birth. 
 The main causes of these deaths are hemorrhage and obstructed labor, which can be fatal if a woman cannot obtain a Caesarean section. Even if the mother survives, obstructed labor without a Caesarean usually kills the baby. Most of the maternal deaths -- 78 percent, according to the Lancet report -- could be prevented. Against this bleak history, Ms. Azfar told her Washington audience, ''I would like to share some successes with you.''
 An intense woman with short, graying hair, Ms. Azfar rarely smiles. She ran through statistics showing notable increases recently in the country's number of midwives, their education and the percentage of women who give birth with the help of a ''skilled attendant,'' usually a midwife. The United States, the World Bank, the European Commission, Unicef, the Hopkins group (known as Jhpiego) and other donors have all helped Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health to make improvements. 
 But there is a long way to go. Most women in Afghanistan, as many as 80 percent, still give birth without skilled help, and only a third receive any medical care at all during pregnancy. 
 Afghanistan's problems mirror those of many other poor countries: shortages of personnel, supplies and transportation to clinics or hospitals, especially in remote regions and mountainous areas that are snowbound half the year. The deeper problems are cultural, rooted in the low status of women and the misperception that deaths in childbirth are inevitable -- part of the natural order, women's lot in life. 
 During her talk in Washington Ms. Azfar quoted Dr. Mahmoud Fathalla, an Egyptian physician and advocate for women's health: ''Women are not dying of diseases we can't treat. ...They are dying because societies have yet to make the decision that their lives are worth saving.'' 
 Ms. Azfar works 12 hours a day, seven days a week. She has irked relatives by missing weddings and other family events because of work.
 ''My children are not happy,'' she said in an interview after her speech. 
 Ms. Azfar grew up in a village about an hour from Kabul. 
 ''Everywhere then, girls went to school,'' she said. ''Women's rights before the Taliban were the same as in Western countries. Women had the right to vote.''
 Her mother had 10 children, 2 of whom died. She always gave birth alone, behind a closed door. When Ms. Azfar was 9, she began to help, by waiting outside the door to receive the newborn baby and wash and swaddle it, while her mother then delivered her own placenta. 
 Ms. Azfar never actually saw a birth until she began studying midwifery at age 16, and only then, she said, did she realize how brave her mother had been. She finished the rigorous three-year program at the top of her class in 1976. 
 ''It was a very well-respected profession in my country,'' she said. 
 But decades of war destroyed midwifery and much of health care, she said. Professionals fled the country, and many never went back. 
 ''One day, 100 rockets came into Kabul,'' she said. She and her husband, a physician, took their four children and moved to Pakistan, living there from 1992 to 2003. She had a fifth child there. 
 By the time she returned to Afghanistan, she said, midwifery was in a shambles. Spots in professional schools of all kinds were being filled by people with political connections instead of those with good grades. The midwives who had stayed behind had not received any continuing education. Their skills were outdated, and their attitudes were even worse. 
 ''A culture of war was going on,'' Ms. Azfar said. ''If a mother came for delivery they didn't treat her as she deserved or needed to be treated. There was no emotional support.'' 
 Attitude counts in midwifery: if midwives and other health workers seem indifferent or disrespectful, women start to avoid the clinics, and they miss out on the help they urgently need. 
 Ms. Azfar acknowledged that it was hard to change attitudes, but she insisted that it could be done, by making ''interpersonal skills'' part of the training and the tests that students must pass to be allowed to practice. In Afghanistan, these things became part of the midwifery curriculum in 2004. 
 ''Does she greet the mother properly?'' she asked. ''Offer her a chair? A drink of water? Introduce herself? Let the mother ask questions? They are trained. They have to do it.'' 
 She has seen signs of progress, of hope. 
 ''Just five years ago we started the reconstruction of this profession,'' Ms. Azfar said. ''These midwives, they are champions. Oh, I love them. They are my heart.''

HEADLINE: Linguist's Preservation Kit Has New Digital Tools

BYLINE: By CHRIS NICHOLSON

DATELINE: TEI, Sierra Leone 

 BODY:
Jogue, yipe, simoi are three short words for foods in Kim, a language in Sierra Leone that Tucker Childs has been trying, for the past three years, to write down, record and understand. 
 Kim is a dying language, and Dr. Childs a field linguist. From his base here in Tei, a small fishing village on the Waanje River, he canoes up the narrow waterways that cut across the river's floodplain, and hikes a few miles inland, to where the last Kim communities remain. Based on recordings taken there, he has devised an alphabet and compiled a dictionary and is finishing a book on the grammar.
 Africa has about 2,000 of the world's 6,000 languages. Many are still unwritten, some have yet to be named and many will probably disappear. For centuries, social and economic incentives have been working against Kim and in favor of Mende, a language used widely in the region, until finally, Dr. Childs speculates, the Kim language has been pushed to the verge of extinction. 
 It used to be that field linguists like Dr. Childs, a scattered corps working against time to salvage the world's endangered tongues -- more than 3,000 at last count -- scribbled data in smeared notebooks and stored sounds on cassette tapes, destined to rot in boxes. But linguistics has gone digital. Dr. Childs now uses a solid-state recorder, and he has applications that will analyze the elements of a vowel in seconds or compare sounds across languages. 
 Using Geographic Information Systems, software that translates data into maps, he and his research assistants, Hannah Sarvasy and Ali Turay, pinpoint villages that are not to be found on any official map. ''There's a whole bunch of reasons linguists want these languages preserved,'' Dr. Childs said, ''but for me it's more an emotional thing. It's not noblesse oblige, it's capitalist oblige. These people are totally peripheralized.'' 
 In its new digital form, this kind of research is more accessible. It allows larger projects to share the world's linguistic heritage with a wider public of teachers and learners, including, when possible, the original speakers.
 The aim is not just to salvage, but to revive. Financed by the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project and the National Endowment for the Humanities, Dr. Childs's recordings will find their way, once his study ends and he returns to his post as a professor at Portland State University in Oregon, to a huge data bank in the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. 
 The director of the endangered languages archive at S.O.A.S., David Nathan, said the school's Web site, elar.soas.ac.uk, is set to start sharing data at summer's end. ''What we're trading in with language documentation is a new genre of stuff which doesn't have any publication channel,'' he said.
 Until now, anyway. The new genre is really a grab bag that includes audio recordings of conversations and folktales, videos of songs and dances, and text transcriptions. But as with most new genres, this one is coming into the world with birthing pains.
 Just getting decent recordings can be difficult. The villages of Nyandehun and Mosenten, for example, are roadless, low-tech places. With more elaborate equipment, batteries fail unexpectedly, miles from an electrical outlet. Humidity and dust creep into machines.
 Also, some linguists have had trouble mastering the new machines. ''For most linguists, audio is just an inconvenience on the way to transcription,'' Mr. Nathan said. In the past, he added, ''the quality would be so bad, it was really just evidence that they had gone there, a talisman that they had gone to the field.''
 The relationship between linguistics and technology goes deeper than what format the sounds are recorded in. Dr. Childs, who remembers working with computers as large as a room when he was a doctoral student, said that theories of language often shaped themselves to resemble the tools at hand.
 In the beginning, he said, linguists imagined that the mind processed language with many rules and little in storage. ''What happened over time was that more and more stuff was moved into the lexicon, was listed there, and that sort of paralleled developments in the computer industry of storage getting cheaper,'' he said. 
 S.O.A.S. is not alone in trying to document endangered languages. The Max Planck Institute in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, has been operating an archive for 10 years. Dagmar Jung, a linguist in Cologne, Germany, is working with the elders of the Beaver, or Dane-Zaa, tribe in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta to gather material and make it accessible through a community portal. ''It's there for later generations,'' Dr. Jung said. ''But it's not user-friendly for the moment.''
 Beaver speakers do have access to some recordings of their songs and stories online. Gary Oker, 49, a former chief of the Dane-Zaa, said putting recordings of elders online was part of a project to take traditional world views and make them part of the present. Dane-Zaa youth were involved throughout the process, from producing the recordings of elders that went online, to using them later as references in school.
 Although he saw his language slipping away, he said that as the young people had ''taken an oral tradition and documented it in many forms,'' the contact had made them ''prouder of their history and who they are.'' The stories, he said, helped them learn their identity and how they related to the land.
 Because of oil and gas development, Mr. Oker said, ''our environment is changing so quickly, we need to capture as much as we can.'' Even if the language is lost, he said, ''the wisdom can be transmitted.''
 Of course, online resources are useful only to communities with Internet access. Communities without that access, like the Kim, still require books to be printed, and recordings to be copied onto CDs or tapes.
 Holding more promise are programs that put electronic dictionaries on mobile phones. James McElvenny, a linguist at the University of Sydney, has led the development of software to help revitalize vanishing languages. Mr. McElvenny has been working with Aboriginal groups like the Dharug of Sydney to give learners, many of them no older than 16, a portable reference that supplies the definition and the sound of words that are otherwise no longer spoken, because Dharug is a dead language. 
 ''A lot of the older members are technophobic,'' he said, ''but the kids are really getting into it.''
 As for Kim, these efforts may be too late. A language, like a person, usually ages before it dies. Four people have died since Mr. Childs's project began, and the 20 fluent Kim speakers are all over 60. 
 ''People today can't speak Kim because their parents didn't speak it to them,'' said Fasia Kohlia, one of Kim's best speakers. ''Parents used to call their children to breast-feed in Kim -- 'kun moga, kun moga, kun moga,' '' she said. But when she had children, she called to them in Mende.

HEADLINE: Politicians Accused Of Meddling In Bank Rules

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Accounting rules did not cause the financial crisis, and they still allow banks to overstate the value of their assets, an international group composed of current and former regulators and corporate officials said in a report to be released Tuesday.
 The report, from the Financial Crisis Advisory Group, also deplored successful efforts by politicians to force changes in accounting rules and said that accounting standards should be kept separate from regulatory standards, contrary to the desire of large banks. 
 ''The message to political bodies of 'Don't threaten, Don't coerce' flies in the face of some of what has been coming from the European Commission and from members of Congress,'' said Harvey Goldschmid, a co-chairman of the group and a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 The report itself, written by a group that included Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a former Italian finance minister; Lucas Papademos, a vice president for the European Central Bank, and Michel Prada, a former head of the French stock market regulator, used considerably more diplomatic language.
 ''We have become increasingly concerned about the excessive pressure placed on the two boards to make rapid, piecemeal, uncoordinated and prescribed changes to standards, outside of their normal due process procedures,'' the group wrote in its report, which was commissioned by the Financial Accounting Standards Board of the United States and the International Accounting Standards Board.
 ''While it is appropriate for public authorities to voice their concerns and give input to standard setters, in doing so they should not seek to prescribe specific standard-setting outcomes,'' the report added.
 Earlier this year both boards, under pressure from banks and politicians, made rapid changes to allow banks more leeway in valuing assets and thus reduce the losses they would otherwise have to report.
 The group, whose other co-chairman is Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, said that despite arguments that the financial crisis was worsened by forcing banks to write down their assets to market value, the overall effect had been the opposite.
 Pointing to rules that delayed the write-down of bad loans and allowed banks to hide risks off their balance sheets, the group said the net impact of accounting rules ''has probably been to understate the losses that were embedded in the system.''
 Banking regulators have been looking for ways to make the regulatory system less ''pro-cyclical,'' perhaps by allowing banks to postpone recognition of profits in good times so that losses would not be as large in bad times.
 The group cautioned that there could be conflicts between the aim of accounting rule makers to accurately reflect a company's financial position and the goals of banking regulators. ''For example,'' the group wrote, ''transparency may not always be the best way to prevent a run on the bank.''
 When those differences arise, it said, it may make sense for regulators to measure bank capital differently than accounting rules would call for, but ''the effects of those differences should be disclosed in a manner that does not compromise the transparency and integrity of financial reporting.''
 Despite the apparent conflict with both bankers and bank regulators, the Financial Crisis Advisory Group included a number of people with experience in those fields. Among them were Gerry Corrigan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and now an official with Goldman Sachs; Nobuo Inaba, a former executive director of the Bank of Japan; Gene Ludwig, a former comptroller of the currency; and Klaus-Peter Muller, the chairman of the supervisory board of Commerzbank in Germany.
 The group also warned against changing rules in ways that would make it easier for banks to manage earnings.
 At the center of the arguments are fundamental differences in the purpose of financial statements. In one comment letter submitted to the Financial Crisis Advisory Group, the French Banking Federation argued that only assets that banks intend to trade should have to be shown at fair value, with most others valued at the original cost unless the bank had determined that losses were likely. Using market value for such assets, the bankers said, has unreasonably damaged bank capital levels.
 ''In the current financial crisis, financial statements could be hardly used as a tool to evaluate the economic performance of entities from a financial stability perspective as they have more reflected the collapse of financial markets,'' the bankers wrote.
 A competing view was voiced by Edward Trott, a former member of FASB and former partner in KPMG, a large accounting firm, who said that the banks imposed different standards on their customers than they wished to have imposed on them.
 ''The area for bank regulators to be involved with accounting standards setting is to help identify the financial information the banks need from others to make appropriate lending and investing decisions,'' Mr. Trott wrote. ''In my experience, banks want current fair value information about assets that serve as collateral for loans. They do not want information about what assets cost two or three years ago.''

HEADLINE: The Quest for New Batteries To Alter the Energy Equation

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: ALLENTOWN, Pa. 

 BODY:
In a gleaming white factory here, Bob Peters was gently feeding sheets of chemical-coated foil one afternoon recently into a whirring machine that cut them into precise rectangles. It was an early step in building a new kind of battery, one smaller than a cereal box but with almost as much energy as the kind in a conventional automobile.
 The goal of Mr. Peters, 51, and his co-workers at International Battery, a high-tech start-up, is industrial revolution. Racing against other companies around the globe, they are on the front lines of an effort to build smaller, lighter, more powerful batteries that could help transform the American energy economy by replacing gasoline in cars and making windmills and solar cells easier to integrate into the power grid. 
 This summer the Obama administration plans to announce how it will distribute some $2 billion in stimulus grants to companies that make such advanced batteries for hybrid or all-electric vehicles and related components. International Battery is vying for a modest chunk of it. 
 The hope is that the grants will spur far higher levels of experimentation and production, pushing down the costs that have prevented these batteries from entering the mass market. 
 The batteries would not only replace the fuel tanks in millions of cars and trucks, but would also make windmills and solar cells more practical, by absorbing excess energy when their production jumps and giving it back when the wind suddenly dies or the sun goes behind a cloud. 
 But first, companies like International Battery will have to tweak the chemistry of their devices and improve the manufacturing process, bolstering the batteries' capabilities. And prices will have to come down -- a problem that is far more daunting when it comes to batteries for vehicles and the grid, because the packs are hundreds or thousands of times the size of those for handheld electronics.
 Nearly all battery research now focuses on lithium ion batteries, which made their consumer debut in 1991 and have since replaced nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride technologies in many portable electronics. 
 Lithium is the third-lightest element on the periodic table, which allows for far greater energy density. A lithium ion battery that will move a car one mile weighs less than half as much as a nickel metal hydride and one-sixth as much as lead acid. 
 Advanced battery manufacturing is mostly based in Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea, where laptop computers and similar devices are built. 
 International Battery bought machines from China that manufacture the components and has been tweaking them to make them run faster, use fewer materials and produce a better product. Each button on the control panels is labeled in Chinese characters, with English penciled in by hand underneath. Near Mr. Peters's machine, a cardboard box awaiting unpacking bears hand lettering that says, ''Glass Please Carefully.'' 
 Other companies are also trying out new chemistries and materials, at the positive and negative terminals of the battery. As technicians try to improve battery assembly, the first requirement is a strikingly clean work environment. Mr. Peters, in goggles and spotless rubber gloves, declined to shake hands recently, just as a surgeon might on the way into the operator room. 
 The gloves protect him from the chemicals in the battery, which include nickel, cobalt and manganese, and shield the battery's delicate tissues from the natural oils on his fingers. 
 ''We don't want any debris,'' said Mr. Peters, who formerly worked at a nearby factory that made bulletproof glass. (International Battery's pristine new showplace was previously an appliance repair shop.) 
 The engineers face a difficult challenge. The batteries have to store a lot of energy in a small, light package, scoring high in a quality known as energy density. They also have to absorb energy and give it back quickly, a factor called power density. 
 Think of a battery as a bottle for energy, and the power density as the size of the bottle's neck. Good power density means a shape like a peanut butter jar, easy to fill or empty; low power density is more like a wine jug with a narrow neck. 
 The batteries have to charge quickly and withstand thousands of cycles of charge and discharge. They have to dissipate heat without catching fire, a product problem that a giant like Apple Computer could survive but a start-up electric car company probably could not. The batteries must function in Maine winters and Texas summers. 
 Engineers have met almost all of these goals, but not simultaneously in one product. And they are still way off on price: the components remain far too costly. But they are trying, devoting more and more resources to meeting that goal. 
 A few yards away from Mr. Peters, workers were getting ready to tear out the cafeteria so new cubicles could be built for more engineers as International Battery's production expands. 
 ''The battery is an enabler'' of electric vehicles and other technologies, said Ted J. Miller, a technical specialist at the Ford Motor Company, referring to the models being produced in Allentown and others relying on different chemistry. 
 Mr. Miller represents Ford at the Advanced Battery Consortium, an organization formed with federal encouragement in 1991 to coordinate research on technology. Ford, Chrysler and General Motors have contributed, often with research scientists and facilities, and the Energy Department has written checks. 
 Automakers need improvements in batteries ''everywhere we can get it,'' Mr. Miller said.
 In 1991 the Advanced Battery Consortium was founded and set a near-term target for developing a battery that would cost $150 per kilowatt-hour of storage. (A kilowatt-hour sells for about a dime and will move a car three or four miles.) 
 Eighteen years later, prices are in the range of $750 to $1,000. By comparison, a lead-acid battery in a conventional car costs less than $100 for that much capacity, although it is much too heavy to build an electric car around and not durable enough.
 Now the Energy Department has a new goal: $500 by 2012. 
 ''We think we can make that,'' said Patrick Davis, the program manager at the Energy Department's vehicle technologies program. 
 One reason for the optimism is the infusion of money that Washington is preparing to get the job done. The $2 billion in new grants planned this summer includes $1.2 billion for companies manufacturing battery cells and complete battery packs, $350 million for electric drive component manufacturing and $25 million for battery recycling. The cell and battery- pack companies could get up to $150 million each. Companies have already applied for more than $6 billion in grants. 
 The Obama administration is also hoping to drum up market demand. In March, President Obama, visiting a testing center for electric vehicles run by Southern California Edison in Pomona, announced tax credits of up to $7,500 for consumers who buy plug-in hybrid vehicles. Such models get some of their energy from the power grid and some from gasoline. 
 ''This investment will not only reduce our dependence on foreign oil, it will put Americans back to work,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It positions American manufacturers on the cutting edge of innovation and solving our energy challenges.''
 Some industry experts say that simply getting electric cars to market will touch off a cycle of new research, investment and product improvement. 
 ''If there is a demand for all-electric vehicles, as opposed to small hybrids, you're going to have a monumental scale-up of the battery industry,'' said Kevin Czinger, chief executive of Coda Automotive, which plans to offer a $45,000 four-door all-electric sedan in California next year. 
 But when it comes to a genuine mass market for an affordable plug-in hybrid or all-battery car, ''we don't quite know how to get there,'' said Mr. Miller, of Ford. 
 Consumer Reports magazine detailed the price problem in its February issue, reviewing an after-market conversion of a Prius to a plug-in. For $10,875 the magazine had a five-kilowatt-hour battery installed by a Toyota dealership in Massachusetts. It got a 67 miles a gallon, a 35 percent improvement over the stock version.
 ''Our Prius's conversion to plug-in power cost more than you could ever expect to recoup in gas savings,'' the magazine said. Still, ''as a sign of things to come, we found it encouraging.'' 
 Carl A. Picconatto, a battery expert at Mitre, a technology consulting firm, and other scientists suggest that materials reduced to the nano scale are a promising avenue. Nano-materials have huge surface areas in small, light packages; batteries work through chemical reactions that unfold on surface structures. 
 In batteries, charged particles travel through electrolytes. Crawling through an electrolyte consumes energy that does not get delivered to the consumer. But pushing through a nano-material could be like ''pushing your hand through sand, versus pushing your hand through a big pile of rocks,'' Dr. Picconatto said.
 Still, in some applications, nano-materials gum up the works, or break down after a few dozen charges and discharges, experts say. Solving that problem could allow a cheaper, lighter battery pack.
 The plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt, due out in November 2010, will carry 16 kilowatt-hours and go up to 40 miles on a full charge; if estimates from Mr. Miller hold when it goes into mass production, the battery pack alone would run from $9,600 to $16,000. And that does not count related parts like the system that maintains the temperature of the cells within an acceptable range and manages the charging and discharging.
 G.M. would not disclose the price of the battery pack but expressed optimism that it would fall. 
 ''We believe electrification is the future if the industry,'' said Bob Kruse, the company's executive director for global vehicle engineering, hybrids, electric vehicles and batteries. 
 ''The mastery of battery technology is key,'' he said. ''We still have a lot of work to do.''

HEADLINE: Business-Class Bargains For Overseas Travelers

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FROM the airlines' point of view, these are tough times for premium overseas travel. In May, according to the International Air Transport Association, global demand for business- and first-class seats was down over 26 percent from May 2008. It was the 12th consecutive month of year-on-year declines in demand for those premium seats, which at one time were a gold mine for airlines.
 But a crisis for airlines has also created opportunities for business travelers bound overseas and determined to make the trip in productive comfort (lots of space to work in and those cushy lie-flat beds to rest in, for example) -- without buying a ticket that can cost as much as a good used car. 
 With a degree of flexibility in travel plans, you can now fly overseas in business class for a fraction of what it used to cost. Airlines started introducing spot fare sales for international premium seats last fall when demand fell in a deteriorating economy. Now, as conditions have worsened, airlines seem to be settling into a basic restructuring of international premium-class fares that resembles the way airlines have long priced leisure fares in the back of the plane.
 ''I don't know even what counts as a sale anymore,'' said Joe Brancatelli, who publishes Joesentme.com, a subscription Web site for business travelers. ''Airlines are now yield-managing fares up front like they do in the back. It's looking like a permanent sale environment.''
 Airlines adopted yield-management strategies in the 1980s to sell coach seats efficiently. Yield management assumes that airline seats are perishable and can be marked at fluctuating prices based on calculations for demand, starting months in advance and continuing until the time the plane takes off.
 Because of reductions in corporate spending, business travelers have begun behaving more and more like leisure travelers, eschewing immediate convenience for lower prices -- even in the international premium niche. 
 I can't begin to summarize the current discount fare environment. But here are a few current and arbitrarily chosen examples. Contemplating a business trip to Shanghai? With a little flexibility, you can travel in luxury and sleep in a lie-flat bed. Air Canada has a sale in which a first-class ticket between Los Angeles and Shanghai is available for less than $3,500. A year ago, a traveler could have easily paid over $15,000 on various airlines for that ticket. 
 Business class from New York to London? For the British Airways swanky Club World cabin, that will be about $2,544 round trip for late summer travel, with an advance purchase. The walk-up fare for Club World on that route used to be about $11,000 and is still about $7,500.
 New York to Amsterdam? On the mostly business-class planes operated by OpenSkies, a British Airways subsidiary, the summer fare is about $1,300, round trip. 
 As always, you need to check individual airline Web sites for the fine print on advance purchase restrictions and fees. 
 Or, given the current free-for-all in high-end fares, you may even want to consult with a real live travel agent. That's because finding the right premium fares at the right time has become cumbersome even for business travelers who used to book travel themselves in a less frantic environment.
 ''We all know the airlines are reducing capacity, but that's going to take time,'' said Fran Kramer, who specializes in international bookings for DePrez Travel, a big agency in Rochester with clients all over the country. ''While they do that and figure out what works,'' she added, ''there are certainly a lot of opportunities'' for finding major fare discounts on international premium travel. 
 Ms. Kramer said that airlines, desperate for whatever revenue they can get, sometimes reach out to agents with last-minute offers for premium seats that are unsold, even at promotional fares, just before a flight. ''Yesterday, we got a call 24 hours in advance offering my client the option to go to Europe in business class for $500 extra,'' she said. 
 Airlines can't continue losing money indefinitely, but they're still flying those fancy cabins overseas. So big discounts on premium travel will continue until supply can be brought into some profitable relationship with demand. Even then, those stunning $11,000 round-trip business-class fares between, say, New York and London may be a thing of the past. 
 Airline executives have been looking ahead with reduced expectations. 
 ''This industry can always reduce prices,'' said Willie Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways. ''The challenge now is, can you adjust your cost base to reflect that different price point, or ideally can you take the costs out quicker than the prices are going down?''

HEADLINE: As Profit Falls 21%, Verizon Plans to Slash 8,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELl

 BODY:
The recession is having two effects on Verizon Communications business. Businesses are cutting back sharply, and laid-off people no longer need corporate cellphones and laptop data cards. 
 As a result, the company said on Monday, after it reported a 21 percent decline in net income for the second quarter, that it would eliminate 8,000 jobs in the second half of the year.
 Consumers, by contrast, keep buying wireless phones and Verizon's FiOS TV-phone-Internet package, although the company continues to lose a significant share of home phone business to cable operators. 
 All of Verizon's job cuts, which will hit employees and contractors, will be made in its landline unit, the part of Verizon's business that offers traditional communications services over copper or fiber cables to businesses and home users. Verizon lost nearly two million home phone customers in the last year, leaving it with 17.2 million residential voice customers. 
 Of the company's 235,000 employees, 148,000 work in the landline unit, with the rest in Verizon Wireless, which is 45 percent owned by Vodafone. The cuts are in addition to 8,000 positions Verizon cut in the last year. 
 AT&T, the other large phone company, has been affected by many of the same trends, although it has been quicker to cut costs. The company has eliminated 14,000 positions this year. 
 AT&T's wireless business has been growing faster than Verizon's, largely because of AT&T's exclusive deal to offer Apple's iPhone. AT&T, which reported second-quarter earnings last week, added 1.4 million wireless customers compared with 1.1 million at Verizon. But that growth came at a price. Because of the heavy subsidy AT&T pays to Apple for each iPhone, its wireless profit margins of 38 percent were far lower than the 46 percent at Verizon.
 On the landline side, it is Verizon that has increased its growth through investment, but at a cost of profitability. Verizon has invested more in its FiOS fiber optic system than AT&T has spent on upgrading its network, but has lower margins than AT&T. Verizon's revenue from residential customers is essentially flat over a year ago, while AT&T's fell by 6.3 percent. Verizon's average home customer pays the company $72.59 a month, but the average FiOS home pays more than $135 a month.
 Verizon added 300,000 FiOS TV customers in the quarter and 303,000 FiOS Internet customers. 
 For the second quarter, Verizon reported net income of $1.48 billion, or 52 cents a share, down from $1.88 billion, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Most of that decline was related to costs of its planned sale of some rural phone systems to Frontier Communications. Excluding the one-time charges, Verizon earned 63 cents a share, in line with analysts' estimates and down 6 percent from a year ago.
 Total revenue increased by 11.6 percent, to $26.9 billion, but most of that growth came from its acquisition of Alltel. The company's core business grew by only 1.9 percent, sharply slower than the 5.3 percent pace of a year ago. 
 Wireless revenue was $15.5 billion, up 9 percent (excluding the acquisition), driven by increased use of data plans by cellphone customers. The most profitable group of wireless customers are those that pay bills every month directly to Verizon. The company added 1.1 million such customers in the quarter, down from 1.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. 
 Landline revenue was $11.5 billion, down 5.2 percent. The decline came entirely from business customers. The company has stayed in Wall Street's good graces, however, by cutting costs fast enough to compensate for the decelerating growth. ''Their second-quarter results reveal a tightly run ship,'' Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to clients.
 On a conference call with investors Monday, Dennis F. Strigl, Verizon's president, told investors that he was not concerned about the impact of Apple's popular iPhone. He said Verizon had many new handsets coming out, including the Palm Pre, which it will start selling early next year. And it is planning to open its own store for smartphone applications by the end of 2009. 
 Mr. Strigl said AT&T's exclusive deal with Apple helped everyone. ''It accelerated innovation,'' he said. ''It is very good for our customers. Everyone is coming out with their own iconic devices.''

HEADLINE: A Debate Rages in Iceland: Independence vs. I.M.F. Cash

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: REYKJAVIK, Iceland 

 BODY:
Just months after an epic banking collapse forced Iceland into the arms of the International Monetary Fund, this island nation is locked in a fierce debate over how to pay off its creditors without ceding too much of its vaunted independence.
 The balance Iceland strikes between bowing to the policy demands of the global financial community and satisfying the desires of its increasingly resentful population of 300,000 will be closely watched as I.M.F. programs in beaten-down economies from Latvia and Ukraine to Hungary and Romania enter a crucial phase.
 ''When you impose austerity, it becomes very painful and comes at a cost,'' said Simon Johnson, a former I.M.F. economist who now teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But many Icelanders are blaming the I.M.F. and in this case, he says, that is not warranted.
 ''Iceland is a rich country that behaved recklessly and helped destabilize the world financial system,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They will have to take their medicine.'' 
 While those in Iceland's left-leaning government will not put it so bluntly, that is broadly the case they are making.
 The first country to throw its government out of office as a result of the global financial crisis, Icelanders could see the government that replaced it topple too, leaving the country rudderless -- unless it wins approval for a deal to repay Britain and the Netherlands the $5.7 billion loan it used to compensate foreign depositors for losses in Icelandic banks. 
 A vote on the measure in the country's Parliament is scheduled for next week. But even Iceland's own government is riven.
 ''This is an attack on our sovereignty,'' said Ogmundur Jonasson, the country's health minister. ''It reminds me of old colonial times. Gordon Brown had no harsh words for the United States when Lehman Brothers went down and billions of pounds went to the U.S. That was friendship -- this is 'Take the little guy and nail him to the wall.' '' To not pass the bill, the government says (most of it anyway), would lead to the I.M.F. and other outside lenders withdrawing funds, further jeopardizing the country's fragile condition.
 But detractors say passing it would increase Iceland's debt burden to 200 percent of gross domestic product, making it one of the most leveraged nations in the world. Ultimately, they say, it could drive Iceland to default.
 At the crux of this debate is the Icesave, or ''Iceslave,'' as it is called here. Icesave accounts were a top-of-the-market gambit by Landsbanki, the most aggressive of the failed Icelandic banks, to raise cash by extending its branch network from tiny Reykjavik to the high streets of London. The reaction to the agreement to make good on the accounts encapsulates all the swelling anger that Icelanders now bear toward bankers, foreign creditors and I.M.F. technocrats -- not necessarily in that order.
 Lilja Mosesdottir is an economist and a back-bench member of Parliament in the governing Left Green party. But if she were to vote now, she says, she would vote against the government bill. Ms. Mosesdottir, new to politics, swept into power this winter when the conservative party was overturned by the ''pots and pans revolution.''
 ''It is like after a war and you are the loser,'' she said, taking a quick coffee break from back-room negotiations over the deal. ''This is an agreement that will lead to a sovereign default, and we don't want that to happen.''
 Whether or not she is right about default, the war analogy is apt. Iceland has lost billions, and others are now dictating the terms of its recovery.
 The resentment felt here is rooted in a belief that Iceland's core virtue of flinty self-reliance has been defiled by its bankers and foreign creditors. It is a sentiment that stretches far into the country's history and culture -- from the Nordic sagas to the quest for autonomy of Bjartur of Summerhouses, the impoverished sheep farmer in Halldor Laxness's ''Independent People,'' the country's best-known modern literary work.
 As the rhetoric escalates, Iceland's finance minister, Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, a lifelong leftist, finds himself in the awkward position of defending the Icesave plan as well as the severe economic restrictions that the country has been forced to endure to qualify for more money from the I.M.F. and other Nordic lenders. Such measures include sharp cuts in health spending and higher gas prices. Higher interest rates have pushed unemployment to about 8 percent, from 1 percent, in little more than a year. 
 Mr. Sigfusson scoffs at any notion of default and argues that the deal to repay creditors was the best that could have been achieved. With a term of 15 years, a low interest rate and a seven-year grace period, the deal is flexible enough to allow Iceland to repay it, he says, especially if the economy recovers and the government is successful in selling Landsbanki's foreign assets.
 ''This is the greatest tragedy of all, but it has to be done,'' he said, looking gaunt from the hours of parliamentary arm-twisting that now consume his days.
 As to the widely held belief that it is the I.M.F. and not the government that is dictating policy, Mr. Sigfusson acknowledges that he is in close contact with the I.M.F.'s representative here.
 He points to frequent disagreements, especially over the fund's recommendation that the government maintain high interest rates as well as capital controls -- a prescription he describes as similar to wearing a belt and suspenders at the same time. But he emphasizes that it is Iceland, not the I.M.F., that has the final word.
 ''This is a trial not just for us, but the I.M.F., too,'' he said. ''They have a lot at stake here as they must show that they are flexible enough to adapt their program to a developed Nordic welfare state.''
 Known to many here as ''the governor of Iceland,'' Franek Rozwadowski, the I.M.F. representative, argues that this designation is inaccurate. As part of its program, Iceland must turn a deficit that is now 13 percent of G.D.P. to a surplus by 2013.
 ''It would be more accurate to call the relationship a collaboration in which Iceland has engaged the fund to help design its recovery program,'' he said.
 On Aug. 3, the I.M.F. is expected to discuss whether to disburse a second tranche of its $2.1 billion loan to Iceland (about a quarter has been disbursed so far). Mr. Rozwadowski says Iceland is on target with steps to balance its budget, and he hails Mr. Sigfusson for political courage.
 Such niceties are thin gruel for many Icelanders whose personal debts have skyrocketed in the wake of the precipitous fall in Iceland's currency, the krona.
 Gunnar Sigurdsson, a theater director, says his car loan -- which was tied to a basket of Swiss francs and Japanese yen -- has doubled since the crisis began; his mortgage payments have jumped over 35 percent.
 Personal bankruptcy is inevitable, he says, and he is now trying to make a ''Roger and Me''-type documentary -- training his camera on Iceland's top politicians, bankers and, if he is lucky, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the I.M.F. ''I have had enough of this stupidity,'' he said. ''I just want answers.''

HEADLINE: New York Fed Appoints a Director

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, was appointed today to the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 Ms. Wylde, 63, fills the Class C seat vacated by Stephen Friedman, chairman of Stone Point Capital. The post is one of three seats chosen by the Fed's board of governors in Washington to represent the public. Ms. Wylde's term expires Dec. 31, 2010.
 ''As head of the partnership, I work closely with corporate leaders and government officials,'' Ms. Wylde said in a statement released by the partnership, a group of executives seeking to promote the city's economic growth. ''I look forward to applying the insight gained from those experiences to my role with the Fed, especially during a period when the role and responsibilities of financial regulators are evolving.''
 A retired chairman of the Goldman Sachs Group, Mr. Friedman, 71, resigned in May after his purchase of stock in Goldman Sachs raised concerns about conflicts of interest. Fed rules bar bank executives or stockholders from serving as Class C directors.
 The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Fed banks which, along with the board of governors, make up the Federal Reserve system.
 The New York Fed board still has two Class B vacancies.
 Ms. Wylde joined the Partnership for New York City in 1982 as head of its affordable housing initiatives, and later ran its economic development arm, the New York City Investment Fund.

HEADLINE: A Weary Britain Seeks Political Ways to Defeat Taliban

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The British government sought to bolster fragile domestic support for the Afghan war on Monday, issuing a comprehensive policy statement emphasizing that military power alone would not be enough to guarantee the defeat of Taliban militants. 
 The statement, which came near the end of a month in which heavy fighting has left 22 British soldiers dead and caused a political uproar here, was delivered in a speech by Foreign Secretary David Miliband at NATO's Brussels headquarters. It was essentially a restatement of a counterinsurgency concept already emphasized by President Obama: the idea that success in Afghanistan depends on political strategies that weaken the Taliban, including luring insurgents to quit or switch sides.
 But while Mr. Miliband quoted Mr. Obama, as if to underline a united front on the war, it was also seen by some commentators as a muted signal that Britain may be reluctant to answer any new American request for an increased troop commitment in Afghanistan to match the rapid buildup of American forces there. 
 Earlier this year, American emissaries, including Gen. David H. Petraeus, who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, pressed Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government for a 2,000-troop increase in Afghanistan. At the time, the United States had embarked on a near doubling of its own troop commitment in Afghanistan, to a target of 68,000 later this year.
 But the Brown government has sent only 800 additional troops, for a total of 9,100, and has wavered on whether it will agree to keep those troop levels after the Afghan presidential election scheduled for next month. 
 The increasing war toll has complicated the political calculus in Britain, as has the reluctance of other European NATO members, including France and Germany, to make comparable increases in their troop commitments or to accept more of the combat risks in Afghanistan, an issue Mr. Miliband also addressed, if obliquely, in Brussels.
 ''People in Britain know why we all committed to this mission,'' he said. ''They want to know that all the members of our alliance are ready to give it the priority and the commitment it deserves. Burden-sharing is a founding principle of the alliance, the solidarity on which it is built. It needs to be honored in practice, as well as in theory.''
 Underscoring the Brown government's concern to quell public alarm at the recent deaths among soldiers, Mr. Miliband's speech, which is available on the Foreign Ministry's Web site, was accompanied by a Defense Ministry announcement of an end to the militarily costly ''first phase'' of the British offensive in Helmand Province that has led to most of the British casualties. The ministry said the emphasis was shifting to holding the cleared area, and ensuring the Taliban did not return.
 The British operational commander, Brig. Tim Radford, said in a video link to London that the operation had been a success, killing, capturing or driving away most of the 500 Taliban fighters who had held an area about the size of Britain's Isle of Wight along the banks of the Helmand River. ''We had a significant impact on the Taliban in this area,'' Brigadier Radford said.
 In a separate statement, Mr. Brown said the Helmand offensive had started to break the ''chain of terror'' linking Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan to Britain. That rationale for Britain's military role in Afghanistan was restated forcefully in Brussels by Mr. Miliband, who said that Britain, aiming to deny Afghanistan as a haven for terrorists, planned on completing its mission.
 ''Our enemies should never doubt our determination to accomplish this mission, because we know the very high cost of failure,'' he said.
 But the timing of the speech appeared, more than anything, to be aimed at shoring up support for the war in the face of rising public concern about the spike in British deaths, part of a wider toll in Afghanistan in July in which at least 69 allied soldiers, including 32 Americans, have been killed. That number includes the deaths of two British soldiers on Monday, bringing Britain's monthly toll to its highest point since the war's start in 2001. 
 Commentators in Britain, which has the second-largest military contingent in Afghanistan, have questioned whether the war can be won, and how long it can be sustained in the face of popular alarm. Mr. Miliband's answer, in part, was that success will depend on a new political sensibility that treats the Taliban not as a militarily and ideologically coherent force but as ''a wide but shallow coalition of convenience'' that relies on cooperation between groups that is ''opportunistic rather than strategic.''
 Calling for ''an effective grass-roots initiative to offer an alternative to fight or flight'' for Taliban militants, Mr. Miliband described them as a motley alliance of ''foot soldiers whom the Taliban pay $10 a day,'' poppy farmers, narco-traffickers, warlords and ''ordinary Afghans.'' He said they dreaded the Taliban's return but worried about the state's ability to protect them. ''They may not give active support,'' he said. ''But they acquiesce or turn a blind eye.''
 Mr. Miliband offered few specific suggestions as to how allied forces could encourage defections. Instead, he concentrated on initiatives by Afghanistan to strip away corrupt local governments, create more economic opportunity and persuade citizens that they will be protected from a Taliban revival once coalition forces withdraw. ''It is only when the cooperation, passive and active, of ordinary Afghans is removed that the insurgency will be fatally undermined,'' he said. ''The squeeze on the Taliban must come from within as well as without.''

HEADLINE: Health Policy Is Carved Out At Table for 6

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the agenda is the revamping of the American health care system, possibly the most complex legislation in modern history. But on the table, in a conference room where the bill is being hashed out by six senators, the snacks are anything but healthy. 
 Last week, there were chippers -- chocolate-covered potato chips -- described on a sign as ''North Dakota Diet Food.'' More often, there are Doritos, pretzels, Oreo cookies and beef jerky: fuel to get through hours of talks on topics like the actuarial values of private insurance plans or the cost-sharing provisions of Medicare. 
 The fate of the health care overhaul largely rests on the shoulders of six senators who since June 17 have gathered -- often twice a day, and for many hours at a stretch -- in a conference room with burnt sienna walls, in the office of the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana. 
 President Obama and Congressional leaders agree that if a bipartisan deal can be forged on health care, it will emerge from this conference room, with a huge map of Montana on one wall and photos of Mike Mansfield, the Montanan who was the longest-serving Senate majority leader, on the other. 
 The battle over health care is all but paralyzed as everyone awaits the outcome of their talks. 
 Mr. Baucus says his group will produce the bill that best meets Mr. Obama's top priorities, broadly expanding coverage to the uninsured and curtailing the steep rise in health care spending over the long term, what policy makers call ''bending the cost curve.''
 Still, if the three Democrats and three Republicans can pull off a grand bargain, it will have to be more conservative than the measures proposed by the House or the left-leaning Senate health committee. And that could force Mr. Obama to choose between backing the bipartisan deal or rank-and-file Democrats who want a bill that more closely reflects their liberal ideals. 
 Already, the group of six has tossed aside the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers, which the president supports but Republicans said was a deal-breaker. 
 Instead, they are proposing a network of private, nonprofit cooperatives.
 They have also dismissed the House Democratic plan to pay for the bill's roughly $1 trillion, 10-year cost partly with an income surtax on high earners. 
 The three Republicans have insisted that any new taxes come from within the health care arena. As one option, Democrats have proposed taxing high-end insurance plans with values exceeding $25,000. 
 The Senate group also seems prepared to drop a requirement, included in other versions of the legislation, that employers offer coverage to their workers. ''We don't mandate employer coverage,'' Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine and one of the six, said Monday. Employers that do not offer coverage may instead have to pay the cost of any government subsidies for which their workers qualify. In the House, centrist Democrats have temporarily stalled the health care bill, many lawmakers want to see what Mr. Baucus's group produces before voting on tax increases in the House bill. 
 Mr. Obama, in his news conference last week, praised the three Republicans in the Senate group -- Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Ms. Snowe. Mr. Grassley, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, and Mr. Baucus share a history of deal-making, and group members said they share a sense of trust despite the partisan acrimony that pervades the Capitol. 
 Mr. Enzi, who sits on both the Finance Committee and the health committee, has a long record on health issues but found Democrats on the health panel unwilling to compromise. 
 And Ms. Snowe, one of two centrist Republicans, often teams with Democrats as she did on the economic stimulus plan this year. 
 After the group insisted it needed more time, the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, conceded that a floor vote would have to wait until after the summer recess. ''If this is the only bill with bipartisan support,'' Ms. Snowe said, ''that will really resonate. It could be the linchpin for broad bipartisan agreement.'' 
 In addition to Mr. Baucus, the Democrats are Senators Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. 
 ''I think there's a heavy sense of responsibility among this group,'' Mr. Conrad said in an interview. ''Our country needs us to get this right.'' 
 As they near a deal, however, Mr. Baucus is getting resistance from Democrats who think he is giving too much ground. 
 Mr. Grassley said the group agreed on how to achieve most of the larger policy goals, including barring insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and better managing treatment of costly chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma. But there have been sharp disagreements, particularly over how to pay for the legislation. 
 Often a single topic can consume an entire day or more. On Wednesday of last week, it was Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income people that was likely to be expanded but was also a major factor in the legislation's high cost. 
 Another recent topic has been how to create payment incentives for doctors and other providers to work in collaborative teams, as part of so-called accountable care organizations.
 ''The talks are free-flowing,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''Max is very inclusive,'' she said of Mr. Baucus. 
 Members of the group methodically work through issues. When they reach a tentative agreement, Mr. Baucus asks, ''Can I put down a 'T'?'' 
 ''It's very businesslike,'' Mr. Conrad said. ''Everybody participates. One senator might carry a discussion. Others chime in. Senator Baucus, the chairman, is the leader, but he rides with a very light rein.'' 
 Typically, they gather at 10 a.m., break around noon for meetings, lunches and votes, and then resume at 2:30. Each senator now claims the same seat -- ''just like kids in school,'' Ms. Snowe said in an interview. 
 Then, there are the refreshments. The coffee, brewed in the office, is roasted in Montana, usually the Grizzly or Buffalo blends. 
 For all the discussions about preventive medicine, and the need to encourage Americans to lead healthier lives, carrots and celery sticks are not typical. 
 ''The food leaves something to be desired,'' Ms. Snowe said. But she also noted that no one was in the room to eat. 
 ''There are not many occasions when we have the opportunity to sit down and immerse ourselves in an issue like this, an issue that has profound implications for the country, with historic overtones, to say the least,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''I feel privileged to participate.''

HEADLINE: As Special Interests Aid Dodd, He Distances Himself From Them

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
As Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut assumes a central role in the debate over health care, the pharmaceutical industry has helped finance efforts to bolster his image back home as he braces for a potentially bruising re-election contest.
 The industry's campaign-style push for Mr. Dodd, part of a larger effort to highlight the work of certain lawmakers around the country, portray him as a defender of ordinary citizens in brochures sent to more than 100,000 homes in Connecticut and in a 30-second television spot that ran for three weeks. 
 For Mr. Dodd, the support provided by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the industry's lobbying arm, comes at a politically sensitive, if not awkward, time. He is trying to combat a perception that he has become too close to powerful interest groups in Washington after 28 years in the Senate.
 As part of that effort, Mr. Dodd's own campaign has produced two videos, ''Lobbyists Cry'' and ''The Blues,'' presenting him as a politician who has caused grief for Washington lobbyists. He also sent a fund-raising solicitation asserting that lobbyists do not have access to him.
 ''The lobbyists can't get meetings with Chris,'' the solicitation says. ''He won't return their phone calls. He even yells at them during hearings.''
 But even as Mr. Dodd attempts to distance himself from these special interests, he is clearly relying on their help as he prepares for his re-election, a reality seized upon by his Republican critics.
 He has not only benefited from the hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertisement courtesy of the pharmaceutical industry and Families U.S.A., a health-care advocacy group the industry teamed up with. But a few weeks ago, Mr. Dodd attended a $1,500-a-plate campaign fund-raiser sponsored by lobbyists representing U.S. Oncology, a provider of cancer drugs and services.
 Mr. Dodd's aides say he has often opposed legislation sought by the pharmaceutical industry and other groups that have contributed to him. Jay Howser, Mr. Dodd's campaign manager, also said the senator had nothing to do with the decision to run the ads and described PhRMA's partner in the ad campaign, Families U.S.A., as a liberal group.
 ''We have no control over what these groups do,'' he said.
 The efforts drug companies have undertaken to promote -- and, presumably, to curry favor with -- Mr. Dodd underscore the major stake they have in the debate in Congress over how to pay for coverage of the uninsured.
 PhRMA has pledged to provide $80 billion over 10 years to help cover the costs of the health-care overhaul. But powerful House members do not think the drug makers have given enough.
 Other lawmakers also benefited from the ad campaign. The drug industry, along with Families U.S.A., also ran commercials praising a few dozen other members of Congress, largely from states where drug companies have a large presence, according to PhRMA.
 But Mr. Dodd, a senior Health Committee member, is no ordinary lawmaker. He has assumed the leading role on the committee that his friend, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, had until he was stricken by a brain tumor.
 ''Obviously, Senator Dodd is a player in the health-care reform debate,'' acknowledged Ken Johnson, a PhRMA spokesman. ''He also represents a state where our companies have a large economic footprint.''
 The organization would not say how much was spent on the television spot and brochures promoting Mr. Dodd. But according to the research firm TNS Media Intelligence, which tracks advertising spending, it cost about $187,000 to run the television spots from May 30 to June 22. The brochure mailings, in turn, cost at least $40,000, according to political consultants who are not involved in the race. 
 The support Mr. Dodd has received from PhRMA comes at a crucial time politically for him, with polls showing voters in his home state disapproving of his performance. The group's campaign coincided with an advertising blitz Mr. Dodd undertook from May 28 to July 2 at a cost of nearly $500,000, according to his campaign. Rob Simmons, a former Republican congressman, is expected to challenge Mr. Dodd in the November 2010 election.
 Mr. Dodd's problems stem in part from the view among some voters that he has developed cozy ties with the corporations he is supposed to oversee in his capacity as a senior member of several committees with jurisdiction over the financial, health care and other industries.
 In some ways, he is to blame for this perception.
 In March he faced a firestorm over his support for a measure that would serve to exempt American International Group, a big campaign contributor of his, from Congressional efforts to limit some executive compensation packages to Wall Street firms that received federal bailout money. After initially denying that he was behind the measure, he acknowledged that his staff introduced it at the urging of the Obama administration.
 That came only months after he was accused of receiving preferential treatment from Countrywide Financial Corporation, which assigned him to a V.I.P. program in 2003 when he refinanced mortgages on his homes in Connecticut and Washington. Mr. Dodd said that he did not believe that he received preferential rates, however.
 Mr. Dodd recently went to Martha's Vineyard for a retreat organized by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, where 30 senators mingled with party donors, including lobbyists.
 Over his decades in Congress Mr. Dodd has raised more than $550,000 from drug company representatives, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
 In addition, Mr. Dodd's wife, Jackie Clegg, was paid nearly $80,000 as a member of the board of Cardiome Pharma Corporation, according to the documents most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ms. Clegg also holds more than 200,000 shares in Javelin Pharmaceuticals, where she is also a board member.
 Colleen Flanagan, a Dodd spokeswoman, said Ms. Clegg consulted an ethics lawyer to see if the board positions posed a conflict of interest given her husband's Senate role. ''Her career is entirely her own,'' she added.

HEADLINE: Silverman Quits NBC Universal; Cable Executive Succeeds Him

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER and BRIAN STELTER; Edward Wyatt and Steve Lohr contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The deal maker is gone. Now it's the cable guy's turn.
 Ben Silverman, who called himself a ''rock-star television executive'' and tried to turn around NBC's struggling prime-time schedule with reality shows and advertising-driven programs like ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' and ''Knight Rider,'' announced on Monday that he would leave as co-chairman of NBC Universal Entertainment to start a new venture with the media and Internet mogul Barry Diller.
At the same time, NBC said that it would promote Jeff Gaspin, a longtime executive who oversees NBC's lineup of cable channels, like USA, Bravo, CNBC and MSNBC; its syndication business; and the Spanish-language network Telemundo, to chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment. Mr. Gaspin will run the entertainment operation of the NBC network, including its prime-time schedule.
 By awarding Mr. Gaspin supervision of the flagship broadcast channel as well as the cable channels, NBC Universal is acknowledging a shift that viewers and advertisers already recognize: that the distinction between broadcast and cable is evaporating. 
 ''The distinction is definitely waning,'' said David Joyce, an analyst with Miller Tabak & Company. ''It makes NBC seem more like a cable network company.''
 NBC, with its long tradition as the ''Must See TV'' network, may now be considered just another part of Mr. Gaspin's large portfolio. The scripted shows on USA now rival those on NBC, especially in the summertime months, when NBC's only hit is the reality show ''America's Got Talent.'' Last Thursday, when NBC struggled to draw three million viewers to its sitcom repeats, a new episode of USA's most popular show, ''Burn Notice,'' attracted 6.8 million viewers.
 ''USA has been putting on better original dramas than most broadcast networks,'' said Steve Sternberg, a prominent TV analyst and a former executive vice president at the media agency MAGNA Global.
 Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Universal, has said that NBC is now primarily a cable company. But he tried to dismiss the notion that Mr. Gaspin's arrival was a takeover by the cable side. ''Jeff has a lot of experience on the broadcast side,'' he said. Many of the primary programming decisions will be made by Angela Bromstad, who is president of prime-time programming.
 In an interview, Mr. Gaspin acknowledged the change in television fortunes. ''You can't dismiss the fact that cable is just much more profitable than broadcast television. I don't see that changing. Cable is a much superior business model.'' Without tipping his hand about particular shows, he added that he would need to re-evaluate NBC's schedule if the network were to attract higher advertising rates. 
 ''Clearly we are going to have to re-message NBC's brand,'' he said. ''We have to make shows that are successful enough to charge a premium to advertisers. It's the only way to do well in network television.''
 The transition comes at a trying time for both NBC Universal and its parent company, General Electric, which has been hit hard by the recession and is paring back selectively in a strategy to rely more on its strong industrial businesses.
 NBC has often been mentioned by analysts as a business outside the company's core of expertise that could be a candidate for sale.
 The unit's financial performance has lagged recently. In the second quarter, NBC Universal's revenue fell 8 percent, to $3.57 billion, and profits fell 41 percent, to $539 million, weighed down by weakness in advertising and a disappointing performance by the movie unit.
 ''Silverman was brought in to add firepower to the creative side of NBC Universal, and clearly they've been disappointed,'' said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ''But I do not think this is a signal that G. E. is reducing its commitment to NBC.''
 Mr. Silverman ran Reveille, an independent production company behind hits like ''The Office,'' ''The Biggest Loser'' and ''Ugly Betty'' when he was hired by NBC two years ago, but with the network stuck in fourth place, his departure was not a surprise. 
 Even two months ago, Mr. Silverman insisted in an interview that he was ''a happy worker at NBC'' but the network didn't renew his contract, clearly signaling that he had no future there without formally firing him. Mr. Silverman said that two weeks ago he began serious talks about a new role with Mr. Diller, who had been his partner in two previous ventures. 
 From the start, Mr. Silverman was an awkward fit for NBC, which went after him aggressively to help turn around their prime-time lineup. Under an unusual arrangement, Mr. Silverman was allowed to keep his stake in Reveille, although not a hand in its day-to-day operations, even as the company was selling programs to NBC, an indication of just how prized Mr. Silverman had been. (The company was later sold to Shine, owned by Elisabeth Murdoch.)
 But the high hopes for his tenure were quickly tempered by programming misses and personal missteps. He saved the reality franchise ''The Apprentice,'' expanded ''The Biggest Loser'' and supported edgy comedy like ''Parks and Recreation,'' but many of his choices, like ''American Gladiators'' and ''Knight Rider'' were failures that seemed out of place on the network known for quality dramas like ''ER'' and ''The West Wing.'' 
 Mr. Silverman also alienated people in Hollywood by insulting other executives in an interview and became probably the first G.E. executive to throw a party featuring women in bikinis and white tigers in cages. (Even Mr. Silverman's departure was out of step with the G.E. corporate culture. Twelve minutes before NBC sent out the press release, the news appeared on the Twitter account of Mr. Silverman's close friend, the ''American Idol'' host Ryan Seacrest.)
 As his shows struggled, Mr. Silverman's duties were curtailed and he spent much of his time making deals with advertisers for sponsorships and product placements -- the part of the business he promoted as the future of the industry. ''Ben did terrific things for us'' in the areas of marketing and advertiser integration, Mr. Zucker said, adding that Mr. Silverman, ''really didn't have the time'' to turn around NBC's ratings. 
 Mr. Silverman said on Monday that he would remain at NBC through September to support the transition to Mr. Gaspin, and to back the start of the new fall TV series for the NBC network. 
 ''I am invested in what happens in the fall and they are invested in my helping with the transition,'' he said. 
 A senior executive at a large production studio who requested anonymity because his company has deals with NBC said that programming, not advertising, still ruled in the television business. 
 ''When you're the head of the network, you live and die by the shows you develop and schedule,'' he said. ''You can talk all you want about disintermediation and bringing in advertisers, but at the end of the day the measure of success is whether you create shows that people want to watch.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the promotion of Jeff Gaspin to chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment misidentified the cable channels he oversaw at NBC Universal. Mr. Gaspin oversaw the company's entertainment channels, including USA, Bravo and SyFy. He did not oversee the news and information channels MSNBC and CNBC.

HEADLINE: U.S. Turns Off News Billboard Atop Its Mission in Havana

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Damien Cave contributed reporting from Miami.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
The Obama administration has pulled the plug on an electronic billboard outside the American diplomatic mission in Havana that was used to tweak the Cuban government with pro-democracy messages and became a symbol of the bad blood between the two countries. 
 When the billboard went up in 2006, some saw it as an innovative diplomatic stick in the eye of the government of Fidel Castro. Others, though, considered the 25 electrical panels installed by the Bush administration in the fifth-floor windows of the American Interests Section to be fundamentally silly.
 Mr. Castro, who ceded the presidency to his brother Raul last year, was clearly not amused by the bright red messages, many of which criticized his government for human rights abuses.
 In response, he blocked the message board with huge black flags hanging on 100-foot-high flag poles and erected billboards nearby that denounced President George W. Bush. Cuban security guards were also stationed in strategic spots to shoo away any Cubans who might gaze upward at the five-foot-high news ticker, which overlooked the Malecon, Havana's coastal highway.
 President Obama, while keeping in place the economic embargo of Cuba, has taken a series of steps to improve relations with the government. The unplugging of the billboard, which was done quietly last month, follows a loosening of travel restrictions and the beginning of migration talks with the Cuban government.
 ''We believe that the billboard was really not effective as a means of delivering information to the Cuban people,'' the State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said Monday. He noted that the Cuban government had removed some of its negative billboards around the mission earlier this year, which he said the United States viewed as ''a positive gesture.''
 The billboard's messages ran the gamut. There were sports scores and news items that had nothing to do with Cuba. But there were also political messages, like the one tweaking the Cuban government's elite for navigating the island in fancy cars while the masses were forced to hitchhike.
 The United States and Cuba broke diplomatic relations in 1961, but still engage with each other in various ways.
 ''Taking down the billboard has permitted both sides to act like mature adults,'' said Robert A. Pastor, a professor of international relations at American University. ''That's the most hopeful thing we've seen.''
 But not everyone viewed it that way. ''The only people that are happy about having the news ticker turned off are the Castro brothers,'' said Mauricio Claver-Carone, director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC in Washington.

HEADLINE: Obama Lists Wide Agenda As Talks With China Open

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States and China inaugurated two days of high-level talks on Monday, exchanging promises of great-power cooperation on weighty issues like climate change while steering clear of potential conflicts over exchange rates and human rights.
 President Obama, saying that ties between the countries are as ''important as any bilateral relationship in the world,'' welcomed senior Chinese leaders to the meetings here, which were jointly led by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. 
 ''I have no illusions that the United States and China will agree on every issue, nor choose to see the world in the same way,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But that only makes dialogue more important.''
 Ticking off a long list of priorities, the president said the two countries would seek ways to work together on economic recovery, climate change, clean-energy technology, nuclear nonproliferation, counterterrorism and humanitarian disasters like the one in Darfur, Sudan.
 Analysts said the United States seemed eager to play down areas of friction like China's currency policy, in part because the Obama administration does not want to antagonize Beijing, its largest foreign creditor, when Washington is running a yawning deficit.
 ''This is not an issue that the administration is banging the table on,'' said Myron Brilliant, senior vice president for international affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
 The meetings, called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, are a successor to a wide-ranging consultation begun during the Bush administration by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. Mrs. Clinton pushed for the State Department to take an equal role in the talks, previously weighted toward economic issues.
 By broadening the scope, China and the United States were able to forge common cause on issues like North Korea. Mrs. Clinton praised the Chinese government last week for doing more to support American efforts to pressure Pyongyang.
 ''At this point, the relationship is basically in good shape,'' said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, who worked on China policy in the Clinton White House. ''But I don't think anyone can assume things will remain in good shape, given the difficulty of the issues.''
 Mr. Obama referred frankly to tensions over human rights, saying that the United States believes the ''that all peoples should be free to speak their minds -- and that includes ethnic and religious minorities in China.''
 But he expressed respect for what he called an ''ancient and dynamic'' society, and noted that he had named two Chinese-Americans to his cabinet: Steven Chu, the energy secretary, and Gary Locke, the commerce secretary. Mr. Chu later made a presentation on climate change.
 The Chinese delegation was led by Wang Qishan, a vice premier who oversees economic policy, and Dai Bingguo, a state councilor responsible for foreign policy. Mr. Dai said the upheaval of the recent economic crisis had united the two countries. ''We're actually in the same big boat that has been hit by fierce wind and huge waves,'' he said.
 While there are nascent signs of recovery in both countries, Mr. Obama stressed the need for Americans to save more and for Chinese consumers to spend more. The Americans told the Chinese they would have to adjust to higher household savings in the United States, said David Loevinger, the Treasury's senior coordinator for the meetings.
 Mr. Loevinger said American officials did broach the issue of China's exchange rate, which Beijing deliberately keeps depressed to bolster its exports. But he declined to characterize the exchange.
 Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, ''The currency issue is going to remain important because of the need to get to 'balanced growth.' ''
 Some of the more contentious issues may be taken up on Tuesday. For example, the United States had yet to register its dissatisfaction with government procurement rules in China that favor Chinese manufacturers.
 ''Let's be honest,'' Mr. Obama said, ''some in China think that America will try to contain China's ambitions; some in America that think there is something to fear in a rising China. I take a different view.''

HEADLINE: Trial of Myanmar Rights Leader Nears End

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
The prosecution in Myanmar concluded its final arguments on Monday in the trial of the jailed pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, her lawyer said.
 The lawyer, U Nyan Win, said the defense would respond to those arguments on Tuesday, concluding a case that has drawn international condemnation since it opened May 18. No date has been set for a verdict, Mr. Nyan Win said by telephone from Myanmar's main city, Yangon. 
 Further hearings are continuing in the case of John Yettaw, the American whose two-day intrusion in early May at the villa of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was the cause of her trial. She faces a possible five-year prison term on a charge of violating the terms of her house arrest, which has been in place for 14 of the last 19 years.
 Mr. Yettaw faces a similar term on immigration charges and on a charge of violating city ordinances for swimming across a lake to her house. Two women who live with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi are also on trial on charges similar to those brought against her.
 Adding its voice to international condemnation of the military junta in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, Amnesty Internationalawarded its highest honor on Monday to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, naming her this year's ''Ambassador of Conscience.''
 The recognition, on the 20th anniversary of her original arrest, adds to other awards Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has received, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
 ''In those long and often dark years, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has remained a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defense of human rights, not only to the people of Myanmar but to people around the world,'' Irene Khan, the secretary general of Amnesty International, said in announcing the award.
 Many analysts say the trial is a pretext for extending her house arrest, at least through what is expected to be a tightly controlled parliamentary election next year.
 Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won the last parliamentary election, in 1990, but was prevented from taking office as the country's military rulers clung to power. Many of the party's winning candidates have since been imprisoned.
 The defense has not contested the facts of the case, but argues that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi did not break any relevant laws. Her lawyers say she allowed Mr. Yettaw to spend two nights at her house because he pleaded that he was hungry and tired after his swim. He was arrested after swimming back across the lake.
 On the day after her latest arrest, President Obama ordered a one-year extension of a package of economic sanctions against the military junta, initially imposed in response to its human rights violations. The United States had said it was reviewing its policy of sanctions before the announcement. 
 Despite condemnation from abroad, there has been very little public protest within Myanmar. Reporters on the scene said security had been tightened outside Insein Prison, where the trial was being held and where Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was being detained.
 The trial has been mostly closed to the public. But on four occasions, a few diplomats have been allowed inside the courtroom, including part of Monday, according to reports from Myanmar.

What Citigroup
 Should Say to Us
 The United States government will become the largest shareholder of Citigroup when it exchanges its preferred shares for common stock in coming weeks. 
 That means America's 148 million taxpayers effectively become the bank's owners, at 54 shares apiece. 
 To help Americans come to grips with the complex beast that is Citigroup, Breakingviews.com has drafted a welcoming primer that Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of the company, might consider sending to the bank's new owners: 
 Dear new shareholders, 
 It is my privilege to welcome you to the fast-growing ranks of Citigroup's investors. 
 The 34 percent stake is actually held by the Treasury. But we at Citi know that it's the American public stumping up the cash. And between you, me and the A.T.M., we probably wouldn't have made it without your help. 
 Please allow me to give you an introductory tour of our bank -- a primer, if you will. Some of you may have tried get a handle on Citi's sprawl after the government started pumping your money into our preferred stock last year. But it's a monster, and even our chief executives don't always understand what's going on, let alone us directors. Each of you has an average of $150 invested in Citi, so we owe it to you to try to explain. 
 First off, you just swapped your preferred shares for common stock. Right now it looks as if the exchange offer will wipe about 11 percent off the $25 billion the government invested for you in the preferreds that are being swapped, out of a total of $45 billion invested in Citi since the credit crisis began. And you're losing the 5 percent dividend you were getting on that money. Common shares may be riskier investments than preferred stock. But hey, what's life without a little excitement? And one of the big lessons of this crisis is to take the long-term view. 
 After all, look at what you're getting for your money. Citi is now the first truly national bank. Well, perhaps that's a bit of a stretch. But it will be if we manage to persuade you to add checking and credit card accounts to your holdings as taxpayers. 
 Naturally, we'd love to offer you low fees and interest rates as an incentive. But unfortunately we need the cash. Rest assured though, that the more of your money you give us, the less likely we are to go under and leave your shares worth nothing. 
 What's really neat about being a Citi shareholder, though, is that you own not one, but two institutions. 
 First, there's Citicorp. This is a great firm. Our investment bank's in there. Our traders made a bundle last quarter -- double what Morgan Stanley's did. It also has most of the retail bank, as well as what we call transaction services. That one's a bit dull, to be honest, but, like selling shovels to prospectors in the gold rush, it's a great little earner. 
 Then there's Citi Holdings. True, it has some toxic securities. But it also owns some good stuff including the brokerage firm Smith Barney, which is a great money generator that doesn't need much capital. We had to hawk just over half of it to Morgan Stanley to raise some cash, but that means you also sort of get a vicarious stake in that firm, too. It's almost three for the price of one. 
 Despite being, collectively, our largest shareholder, you don't actually get a say in how we run the place. But not to worry; we have long since got rid of the renegades that got us into this mess. 
 You might not always agree with what we do -- like ratcheting up interest rates on credit cards or paying traders like Andrew Hall in our Phibro unit around $100 million. But these practices can be good for your investment. And if it turns out they're not, well, you can always blame the government. 
 Naturally, you are all invited to attend our shareholder meetings. But we'd be much obliged if you could help us cut costs by supplying your own coffee and bagels. That's only once a year, though. 
 In the meantime, rest assured we're working like mad on your behalf. After all, Citi never sleeps! 
 Warmest regards, 
 Dick Parsons 
 Chairman, Citigroup

HEADLINE: Newly Empowered, Kurdish Leader Presses an Agenda

BYLINE: By SAM DAGHER

DATELINE: ERBIL, Iraq 

 BODY:
The president of the semiautonomous Kurdistan region, Massoud Barzani, on Tuesday rejected proposals by the United Nations to resolve Iraq's explosive internal border disputes, and reiterated his determination to proceed with a contentious local constitution.
 Mr. Barzani, newly empowered after winning an estimated 70 percent of the vote in the region's presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, made the remarks in his first interview with the news media since the vote.
 ''Regrettably, the recommendations of the United Nations are unrealistic,'' Mr. Barzani said, referring to a report by the United Nations in April outlining options for the settlement of territorial disputes that threaten Iraq's fragile stability. They included making Kirkuk Province -- including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk that is claimed by Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Turkmens -- into an autonomous region. 
 American officials have repeatedly stated their support for a United Nations-brokered solution.
 ''We will not accept that the United Nations or anyone else present us with alternatives to Article 140,'' he added, referring to the clause in Iraq's national Constitution that calls for a census followed by a referendum to settle the fate of areas including Kirkuk. 
 Tensions have been aggravated by the presence of Kurdish troops in parts of the contested areas. The situation worsened in June when the region's Parliament, overwhelmingly controlled by the two governing parties, including Mr. Barzani's party, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, approved a draft constitution that enshrined Kurdish rights to the disputed territories.
 Although the document states that the final demarcation of the region's boundaries is subject to Article 140, it is unequivocal in its assertion that the disputed territories are inseparable from the ''geographic and historic entity'' called Iraq's Kurdistan region.
 Mr. Barzani said one reason he agreed to put off a referendum on the regional Constitution that was to have been held during Saturday's elections was a request this month from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other American officials.
 ''They asked if it was possible to postpone it because the timing was inappropriate,'' he said.
 Mr. Barzani said he was determined to put the constitution to a referendum this fall. Such a move would place him on a collision course not only with the central government, which opposes the document in its current form, but also with a new Kurdish political coalition that did surprisingly well on Saturday.
 Shaho Saeed, a top official in the coalition, Gorran, said his movement filed a complaint this month with Iraq's federal court in Baghdad that questioned the legitimacy of the process that the previous regional Parliament adopted to approve the constitution.
 Mr. Saeed said Gorran opposed the document because it gave powers to Mr. Barzani ''that exceed the powers of Parliament and the judiciary.'' Gorran wants the proposed constitution redrafted, he said.
 Although the region's two governing parties, including the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, retain a comfortable majority to form the next government, Gorran appeared to have clinched at least 25 of the new Parliament's 111 seats, according to preliminary results.
 With the two parties expected to remain firmly in control of Parliament, Mr. Barzani said that no one has the two-thirds majority needed to redraft the document.
 ''The new Parliament has no right to redraft the constitution,'' he said. ''It is over.''
 Mr. Barzani said he welcomed the emergence of an opposition movement like Gorran, but issued a warning to those who might interpret it as a loosening of the grip of the two parties that control the region's security forces, economy and patronage network.
 ''If any regional country or even Baghdad interferes in an internal matter, or any individual inside the region conspires against the region's security and well-being,'' he said, ''actions will be taken in accordance with the law against those who want to undermine the unity of the Kurdish house.''

HEADLINE: Sprint Nextel in $420 Million Deal for Virgin Mobile USA

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Sprint Nextelsaid on Tuesday that it had agreed to buy out Virgin Mobile USA for $420 million, as it tries to recover from losses and customer defections.
 The mobile phone company agreed to pay $5.50 a share to public shareholders of Virgin Mobile, whose biggest investor is the billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Sprint gains 5.25 million users, expanding a prepaid unit that has added customers while its contract unit has lost them. 
 Sprint had 4.3 million prepaid subscribers, most of which were on the network obtained from Nextel, at the end of the first quarter. Its average monthly bill for contract customers was almost double the $31 the company got from prepaid subscribers. The company is set to report second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
 Sprint is taking a risk by increasing its exposure to the low prices and higher customer turnover of the prepaid market, said Chris King, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Company. The company is still recovering from the Nextel acquisition, which led to almost $30 billion in losses from write-downs.
 Sprint, which already owns 13 percent of the company, will retire Virgin Mobile's outstanding debt, which it expects to be no more than $205 million net of cash by the end of September. Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kan., plans to complete the acquisition as soon as the fourth quarter.
 Sprint lost 4.6 million customers last year after the $36 billion Nextel purchase led to complaints about call quality as the company struggled to integrate the Nextel network into its operations. The company wrote down most of the acquisition in 2007. The purchase also increased Sprint's debt, which stood at $20 billion at the end of the first quarter.
 Virgin Mobile, which sells Sprint service under its own brand, gives Sprint more customers that buy mobile phone service without a contract, a business that is growing amid the worst economic slump in a half-century.
 In May, Virgin Mobile it raised its forecast for 2009 earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation and some other items to $127 million to $142 million, from a March projection of $117 million to $132 million.

HEADLINE: New York City Is Hoping to Clean the Industrial Grit Off Long Island City

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Long Island City is about to get a face-lift. The city and federal governments plan to pour more than $75 million into sprucing up this section of Queens, which sits directly across the East River from Midtown Manhattan.
 City Hall has been trying for years to transform the aging industrial district into a mixed-use community with office, residential and retail development. 
 The neighborhood is served by eight subway lines, which certainly makes it convenient. But the transportation infrastructure can also be overwhelming. Elevated subway tracks crisscross Long Island City, while Manhattan-bound traffic clogs the roadways that converge onto the Queensboro Bridge.
 The mayor's office and the New York City Economic Development Corporation say they have a plan to tame the snarling traffic and render the neighborhood more pedestrian-friendly.
 ''We're going from gritty to green,'' said Tracy Sayegh, an assistant vice president at the Economic Development Corporation, who is in charge of the streetscape project, which will break ground next month. 
 The improvements will include planting more than 500 trees and creating open space, constructing landscaped traffic medians, installing crosswalks at dangerous intersections, increasing street lighting and adding park benches. The city expects to complete this work in 2011, using a combination of $22.5 million in city funding and $56 million in federal funding, including a recent infusion of federal stimulus funds.
 Developers have long dreamed of turning the core of Long Island City -- where Jackson Avenue connects Court Square and Queens Plaza -- into a modern business district. Citigroup constructed the first major office building there in the 1980s. For many years, this 48-story glass tower seemed marooned amid a sea of low-lying warehouses and auto repair shops. Then, the city rezoned the district in 2001 to encourage more development.
 Two new office buildings have sprouted since then. Citigroup did a sale-leaseback deal for its original tower, which is now owned by SL Green, a real estate investment trust. But the bank opened a second building on a former parking lot opposite its original tower in 2007. Citi owns the new 15-story 526,000-square-foot building, called Two Court Square . The bank occupies the whole building except for the ground floor, which sits vacant now and is being marketed as retail space.
 Also in 2007, the United Nations Federal Credit Union opened a 16-story, 275,000-square-foot building, called Court Square Place, across 44th Road from the new Citigroup building. The credit union has offices from the second to seventh floor, and conference rooms and other amenities on the top two floors. The United Nations has leased four floors in the building, while three other tenants have taken one floor each.
 This is the first new multitenant Class A building,'' said Greg Smith, a broker at JRT Realty, who is the leasing agent for the building.
 Besides these new buildings, the Long Island City office market consists mainly of converted warehouses or factories. New leasing activity has been very slow since the recession began in December 2007. Only a handful of new office tenants that have signed leases here since the beginning of last year.
 In the past, companies have been attracted to Long Island City because the rents are a fraction of Manhattan prices. But office space -- especially sublet space -- has been flooding the Midtown office market recently, causing rents there to fall. Brokers say that this is making Long Island City a tougher sell.
 ''We are an overflow community, and there's not much overflow from Manhattan now,'' said John Reinertsen, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis.
 It has also been difficult to attract top executives to this neighborhood. The workers who have been relocated there tend to work in departments like accounting and information technology.
 Earlier this decade, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tried a different tack. It moved into a 12-story, 700,000-square-foot renovated former airplane factory at 27-01 Queens Plaza North, right off the Queensboro Bridge. The management team -- from the chief executive on down -- commuted to Long Island City. MetLife reconsidered this decision, however, and moved many employees, including the chief executive, back into Manhattan in 2008.
 The insurance company, which signed a 20-year lease for this entire building in 2001, still occupies about half of it. It has sublet 200,000 square feet to several companies, and is offering another 180,000 square feet for sublet on the entire sixth and seventh floors.
 Despite the sparse leasing activity, the vacancy rate remains quite low. Of roughly seven million square feet, some 2.4 million is considered Class A space, or space in modern office buildings. 
 The Long Island City market as a whole has a 3.3 percent vacancy rate, although the Class A rate is only 1.3 percent, the according to Cushman & Wakefield. Annual asking rents for Class A space here are around $31 a square foot. But asking rents in Midtown Manhattan have fallen by more than 20 percent in the last year, to around $67 a square foot, down from $84 in the summer of 2008.
 One new office building is under construction at Jackson Avenue and Queens Plaza Boulevard. Tishman Speyer Properties, a large New York developer, initially planned to build up to 3.5 million square feet of commercial space in a giant new development called Gotham Center. For the moment, though, it is building one 21-story, 660,000-square-foot building for the New York City Health Department.
 Several other development projects that were planned during the economic boom appear to be on hold.
 Rockrose Development, which has built residential buildings along the Long Island City waterfront, has assembled a parcel opposite the Citigroup buildings, where it could build up to 850,000 square feet of commercial space. But the developer has not said when it might begin construction. The three brothers who founded Rockrose are dividing up their company, which might further delay this project.
 Silvercup Studios, a film and television production center in Long Island City, received approval in 2006 to build a large mixed-use project, with 650,000 square feet of commercial space, residences and sound stages. Three years later, the work has not yet begun. Alan Suna, Silvercup's chief, said through a spokeswoman that he was committed to moving forward ''in concert with the New York City marketplace.''

HEADLINE: In Venezuela, Plantations Of Cacao Stir Bitterness

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HENRI PITTIER NATIONAL PARK, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Kai Rosenberg acknowledges that he might be a little insane. He owns a cacao plantation in this swath of untamed cloud forest in northern Venezuela, where ocelots dart under towering saman trees and howler monkeys shriek at visitors. 
 So far this decade, squatters have tried to wrest control of his land, a fungus nearly wiped out his entire crop, government inspectors have solicited bribes and export officials have given him countless headaches with demands for a barrage of permits.
 Even worse, intruders armed with machine guns broke into his house one night. In the struggle that ensued, he said, one shot him in the throat. Evacuated by helicopter, he recovered after six operations. But he went back to growing the Venezuelan cacao bean, the raw ingredient for chocolate coveted in Europe and the United States. 
 ''Maybe I'm actually more than a little insane, but that's a job requirement for working in cacao,'' said Mr. Rosenberg, a German Jew who was born in Hamburg in 1940 and moved to Venezuela at age 18. 
 Venezuela produces about the same amount of cacao as it did three centuries ago: 15,000 tons a year, less than 1 percent of global cacao output. But that amount stirs the passions of critics and devotees, turning a luxury crop destined for foreigners into a contentious, and sometimes violent, political issue.
 Cacao from here is so desirable that European chocolate makers sometimes engage in cut-throat competition to gain access to it. Chocolatiers talk of the unique factors here on the Caribbean's edge in a way that resembles the gout de terroir, or taste of the earth, crucial to fine wines. 
 ''Venezuela is in a league of its own,'' said Gary Guittard, a California chocolate maker who buys Venezuelan cacao. ''It takes years to develop the uniqueness of the best cacao, maybe 20 or 30 years, maybe 100, so other nations need to catch up.'' 
 Viewed as a treasure abroad, cacao is seen differently by many Venezuelans, from the president to the poor. A loophole for this nature reserve allows cacao haciendas to dot the forest, near villages populated by descendants of African slaves and near poor migrants who live in squatter villages in the park. 
 In a visit here last year, President Hugo Chavez asked why chocolate made from Venezuelan cacao could fetch high sums in Europe, singling out a Briton who owns a plantation in this jungle, William Harcourt-Cooze, for particularly harsh treatment. 
 ''This gentleman is getting rich while the workers are living in poverty,'' Mr. Chavez said after listening to residents' complaints about Mr. Harcourt-Cooze's farm.
 Then came the nightmare feared by every cacao grower: government inspections into labor or land violations. ''There was an official investigation, I've been vindicated, it was totally unfounded the remarks that were made,'' Mr. Harcourt-Cooze said from Britain. 
 Others are not so lucky. Despite partnering with the government in a cacao venture in Barinas, Mr. Chavez's home state, Chocolates El Rey, a leading company in Venezuela's gourmet chocolate industry, was powerless to stop squatters who invaded the farm earlier this decade and still occupy it. 
 ''We could be a world leader with cacao, what beef is for Argentina or rice for Thailand,'' said Jorge Redmond, Chocolates El Rey's chief executive, reflecting on the industry's upheaval. ''Instead we're faced with 52 different permits to export a container of our product, compared with four steps to export when Chavez came to power.'' 
 Still, growers go on with their business. Mr. Redmond works from a headquarters resembling a bunker in an industrial part of Caracas. Mr. Rosenberg, the immigrant from Hamburg, enjoys unusually warm relations with the government, with which he manages a venture in another cacao region, and travels with an escort of soldiers to visit his operations.
 With its reliance on cheap labor, the industry seems hard-wired for conflict, though chaos afflicts some cacao areas are more than others. Barlovento, near here, is plagued by thievery of cacao pods, score-settling murders and the torching of storage facilities. 
 Built with slave labor, the industry here became the mainstay of Venezuela's colonial economy. For centuries, the nation was the world's top producer. European monarchs sipped concoctions made from Venezuelan cacao. 
 Then, in the 20th century, there was oil. Dictators came and went. Venezuela, despite its vast fertile lands, became a net food importer. The legendary strongman Juan Vicente Gomez seized cacao plantations in this forest and made them part of his personal empire. 
 Bureaucrats later assembled a monopoly over the industry, eroding incentives to produce high-quality cacao. Yields plunged. Still, cacao cultivation survived, attracting growers obsessive enough to weather policies bedeviling exports of anything but petroleum. 
 Venezuela is widely known as a difficult place to do business. But the peculiar resilience of the conflict-ridden cacao trade is evident from a ride on a fisherman's skiff to Chuao, an isolated forest village founded in the 16th century that knows a thing or two about the cycles of Venezuelan history. 
 Chuao's cacao hacienda was first expropriated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 1820s by Simon Bolivar, the region's liberation hero, and given to a university. Then one dictator seized it, then another and so on, until a civilian government handed control to a worker cooperative a few decades ago. 
 Since then, its yields have languished, even though the cooperative employs perhaps triple the number it would if it were owned by a private company. The members of the cooperative are poorly paid, earning about $3 a day. One sun-drenched day in July, some members sprawled in the shade near the church patio where cacao has been dried for centuries, taking a nap. 
 But those same workers produce what some consider the world's best cacao. The key, agronomists contend, lies in their adherence to methods used for generations. 
 One cooperative member, Clemencia Bacalao, 49, smiled into the sun when asked what Chuao would be like decades from now when the oil age finally dims in Venezuela. ''We'll be doing what we've always done,'' she said. ''We'll be relying on cacao for our survival.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Steel Posts Loss of $392 Million

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The United States Steel Corporation reported its second consecutive quarterly loss on Tuesday and said it expected all three of its business sectors to lose money in the third quarter. 
 The company, which has been operating at less than half of capacity since the economic downturn last year stunted demand for steel, said customer orders had increased, but the outlook for overall demand and economic recovery was uncertain.
 ''Prices are heading in the right direction but will take time to work through the system,'' the chief executive, John P. Surma Jr. told Wall Street analysts.
 The company said it lost $392 million, or $2.92 a share, in the second quarter compared with a profit of $668 million, or $5.65 a share a year ago. Revenue fell nearly 75 percent, to $2.13 billion from $6.74 billion.
 Stock in U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, fell 92 cents, to $40.35 a share.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Ends a Cautious Day Mixed

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Faced with new figures showing a decline in consumer confidence, investors struggled to find some of their own on Tuesday.
 Stock markets closed mostly lower, but came back above the lows of the day. Investors balanced the implications of a modest rise in home prices against a report showing that consumer confidence had declined for a second month, to its lowest levels since April. 
 Investors are concerned that a recovery could be sluggish and halting if consumers do not start spending again. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 11.79 points, or 0.13 percent, at 9,096.72. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.56 points, or 0.26 percent, to 979.62, after falling as much as 1 percent earlier in the day. 
 The Nasdaq composite index was up 7.62 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,975.51, buoyed by rising shares of the biotechnology giant Amgen, which rose 2.7 percent after reporting a 40 percent increase in profits. 
 The day's listless moves sapped some of the momentum of a two-week sprint that lifted major market indexes by more than 10 percent and sent the Dow cruising back above 9,000 points. Analysts said investors were pausing to assess new economic numbers and see whether recent gains would stick.
 ''It's just so much, so quickly,'' said John F. Merrill, chief financial officer at Tanglewood Wealth Management. ''I think this muted period of growth people are looking for is real. There are still going to be a lot of headwinds from an anemic consumer and anemic business investment.''
 On Friday, investors will get a clearer picture when the government reports the gross domestic product for the second quarter of the year. Forecasters say they believe the economy shrank at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, a milder contraction after six months of wrenching declines.
 On Tuesday, energy companies like Exxon Mobil led the markets lower as oil prices stumbled, falling $1.15 to $67.23 a barrel. 
 Retailers including Office Depot and the handbag maker Coach fell on reports of falling profits, and on broader concerns about consumer spending.
 The private Conference Board's index of consumer confidence fell to 46.6 in July, from 49.3 a month earlier, as Americans reported that jobs were becoming harder to get. Consumers said their current conditions were worse than a month ago, and they lowered their expectations.
 Although consumer confidence is still nearly twice as high as it was in February, fewer people are expecting the labor market to improve within six months, and fewer believe their incomes will be higher six months from now. Unemployment is at 9.5 percent now, and most economists expect it to reach at least 10 percent by next year, and stay high even after the economy begins to grow again.
 ''Confidence is still at very weak levels,'' said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. ''That doesn't bode very well for spending over all.''
 Still, the housing market offered another glimmer of good news as home prices rose in May from a month earlier. A closely watched gauge of housing values, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, found that prices in eight of 20 major metropolitan areas rebounded in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, and that the overall declines in price from a year ago had moderated.
 ''While much of the impact of the subprime disaster on prices at the bottom end of the market may well be behind us, there is likely plenty of pain yet to come further up the price spectrum,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, wrote in a note to clients.
 Treasury prices were mixed after an auction of $42 billion of two-year notes. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 100 13/32 and the yield slipped to 3.69 percent, from 3.72 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four- and 52-week bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: The Financial Truth Commission

 BODY:
Congress has pledged to reform the banking system, but too often over the past year lawmakers have chosen instead to shield the financial industry, a big campaign contributor, from accountability. 
 So the public has every right to ask whether the newly formed Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission -- created by Congress to investigate the meltdown -- can be counted on to put the public interest ahead of political loyalties, professional ties and ideological biases. 
 The men and women on the panel are accomplished in their fields -- business, law, economics and academia -- and many have past government experience. They have been chosen to perform a service that is crucial to restoring trust in the markets and in the government; their findings will also inform regulatory reform efforts. 
 The 10 members -- six chosen by the Democratic leadership, four by the Republican leadership -- also have long partisan histories and at least one has strong ties to the financial industry. 
 The Democratic chairman, Phil Angelides, a former California state treasurer, has given, together with his wife, nearly $327,000 to Democratic candidates over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The vice chairman, former Representative Bill Thomas, a Republican, received $1.6 million in campaign contributions from financial, insurance and real estate interests during his nearly two decades on Capitol Hill. He is now an adviser to a law firm that represents banking and financial-services clients. 
 All of this suggests that the commission's efforts bear close monitoring. Here are some early indicators to watch to see whether they are rising to the occasion. 
 CHOOSING A LEAD INVESTIGATOR It is imperative that Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas agree on a strong investigator -- with a proven record of exposing deceptive or fraudulent activities -- to serve as the commission's director. The director must also be given the resources to assemble a strong team of experts and have the commission's full support to press the investigation. 
 The law allows the commission to issue subpoenas if the chairman and vice chairman agree or if a majority of the panel agrees, as long as the majority includes at least one Republican. If subpoenas are inhibited by partisan votes, the commission will be hamstrung. 
 STANDING UP TO THE BANKS The law requires the commission to investigate each failure of a major financial institution during the crisis, such as Lehman Brothers, and each major failure that was averted by assistance from the Treasury. Some banks may try to argue that although they received assistance, they were never in danger of failure, and thus are off limits to commission investigators. But all of the major banks are implicated in the crisis, and none should be outside the commission's purview. 
 STANDING UP TO THE GOVERNMENT The law requires government agencies and departments to furnish information to the commission upon request. Even though much of what the panel will investigate happened under President Bush, the executive branch tends to guard its secrets. President Obama has already reserved the right to assert executive privilege. The commission must be willing, if necessary, to fight for access to documents.
 The commission is expected to hold its first meeting around Labor Day. As its work unfolds, there will be more benchmarks of success, or lack thereof. For now, it is important that it gets started with the right staff and a commitment to use its powers to the fullest.

No Breaks Needed
 For GE Capital
 GE Capital is taking on the doubters. On Tuesday, General Electric's finance arm addressed investors skeptical of its fit within the sprawling industrial conglomerate. Chief among its messages: The business is adequately funded, it has enough capital to handle potential loan losses and it is above average in what it does relative to big American banks. But if that is all true, why does GE Capital need the special treatment it is fighting for on Capitol Hill?
 The Obama administration's regulatory reform plans would place more constraints on financial firms that are big enough to represent a systemic risk. GE Capital is lobbying to exempt its $650 billion balance sheet from such stringent oversight. But if it is so good at what it does, it is hard to see why it needs that kind of help. 
 The full-court press the company is unleashing in Washington is also at odds with what GE Capital, led by Michael A. Neal, itself conveyed to shareholders. It said its loan portfolios were ''performing as expected or slightly better'' and exhibiting loss rates mostly ''below the Federal Reserve base case.'' It said it did not need more capital ''even under adverse scenarios.''
 GE Capital offered numbers to demonstrate its banking prowess. The company said it had $25 billion of receivables due from American consumers, with reserves equal to 6.6 percent of these loans -- above the 6.1 percent average held by the top three American banks. Similarly, it has reserves equal to 1.5 percent of the $93 billion of loans extended to American businesses, higher than the 1.1 percent held by rival banks. 
 But here is the problem. If GE Capital's claims that it is adequately capitalized to handle rising defaults, and that it manages to extract more than rivals from customers who cannot pay their bills and that it has enough funding to weather ructions in the capital markets are correct, it makes special treatment as a nonbank financial institution seem unnecessary.
 The company also considers itself to be an ''important source of liquidity to American businesses and consumers.'' GE Capital's balance sheet would make it the country's fifth-largest commercial bank by a wide margin. So GE Capital is right that it is a critical player in the financial system. And that is how it should be regulated. 
 Remember Bubbles?
 Money is too cheap, and stocks are too expensive. Shares in Sichuan Expressway, a Chinese toll-road operator, tripled on Monday, their first day of trading, despite reforms intended to curb rampant speculation. The next day they fell 10 percent, the most allowed in one trading session. China's market for initial public offerings is not working.
 The revitalized market is rewarding those who are allocated shares at the I.P.O. price -- they pocket huge gains when the stocks pop. But the investors they sell to at exorbitant prices face big losses. Since retail investors are big players in this market, today's bad bets can become tomorrow's political issue.
 Ultimately, the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate the economy are to blame. Banks have so far this year lent three times what they did in the same period last year. The flood of money has kept economic growth going, but some of the cash has found its way into financial assets. Investing in I.P.O.'s is one of the few choices punters have in China's closed financial system.
 The speculative interest in I.P.O.'s has led new issues into a valuation universe all their own. After rising 77 percent this year, the Shanghai stock market over all is selling at 26 times expected earnings. Even that is not cheap by global standards. But Sichuan Expressway was selling at an earnings multiple four times higher than its peers after its first day rally.
 Bankers and watchdogs alike do not like one-day bubbles. But they cannot really price issues high enough to eliminate it. If they tried, there would be accusations that the I.P.O. participants were being duped to buy at unsustainably high prices. Thin underwriting fees of less than 2 percent also mean that banks want to make money from brokerage -- so the more the stocks churn, the higher their profits.
 It might help if underwriters could issue extra shares or if short-sellers were allowed to ply their trade, but the problem is likely to persist until the government squeezes the supply of funds or investors learn -- through a series of popped I.P.O. bubbles -- that stocks go down as well as up.

HEADLINE: Nigerian Troops Surround Militant's House

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: DAKAR, Senegal 

 BODY:
Nigerian security forces have surrounded the house of a leader of an Islamic sect in a town in northeastern Nigeria, in an effort to halt an uprising by the sect that has led to hundreds of deaths in the region, local news reports said Tuesday. 
 A local reporter, Idris Abdullahi of the News Agency of Nigeria, said the town, Maiduguri, was essentially shut down Tuesday after clashes between the police and Islamists over the past two days. In a telephone interview, he said that the streets were deserted and that he had seen ''100 bodies'' of militants at the police headquarters; other reports spoke of as many as 260 dead there. 
 ''The economy is paralyzed,'' Mr. Abdullahi said. ''Everything is closed down. There is no movement -- only the military and police.'' He said several churches had been burned by ''hoodlums.'' 
 Other Nigerian news reports said that numerous houses had been burned, and that there were bodies in the streets. Phone communication with the town appeared to have been severely disrupted Tuesday.
 Nigeria's president, Umaru Yar'Adua, said Tuesday that the situation was ''under control'' and that the military would ''contain'' the militants ''once and for all.'' 
 The violence, which the authorities said began with an attack on a police station in the town of Bauchi on Sunday that left at least 39 people dead, quickly spread across four states in a heavily Muslim region long troubled by religious unrest. In this instance it appeared to have been led by an obscure fundamentalist group opposed to what the authorities call ''Western education.''
 Paul Lubeck, a political sociologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who specializes in Nigeria and Islam, said the violence had its roots in Nigeria's severe economic difficulties. 
 Despite Nigeria's immense oil wealth, about 54 percent of its population lives on less than $1 a day, according to the World Bank. Widespread poverty and unemployment make parts of Nigeria a fertile breeding ground for the antiestablishment message of the sect's leaders, Mr. Lubeck said.
 ''This particular movement is a movement of the dispossessed, the lumpen,'' he said. ''It's not the major Islamic movement in the country. This is an attack on establishment Islam.'' 
 A more mainstream Islamic group in Nigeria, the Jamaat Nasr al-Islam, or J.N.I., on Tuesday condemned the militants, known as Boko Haram, a Hausa expression meaning ''Western education is prohibited.'' 
 J.N.I. said through its acting secretary general, Abdulkarim Muazu, that the attacks on the police were ''criminal.'' Mr. Muazu added that ''nobody is against Western education.''
 ''The first injunction is to read so that you improve on your life,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Wooing a Federal Agency With Billions to Invest

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As a New York money manager and investment banker at four Wall Street firms, Charles E. F. Millard never reached superstar status. But he was treated like one when he arrived in Washington in May 2007, to run the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that oversees $50 billion in retirement funds.
 BlackRock, one of the world's largest money-management firms, assigned a high school classmate of Mr. Millard's to stay in close contact with him, and it made sure to place him next to its legendary founder, Laurence D. Fink, at a charity dinner at Chelsea Piers. A top executive at Goldman Sachs frequently called and sent e-mail messages, inviting Mr. Millard out to the Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, even helping him hunt for his next Wall Street job.
 Both firms were hoping to win contracts to manage a chunk of that $50 billion. The extensive wooing paid off when a selection committee of three, including Mr. Millard, picked BlackRock and Goldman from among 16 bidders to manage nearly $1.6 billion and to advise the agency, which Mr. Millard ran until January. 
 But on July 20, the agency permanently revoked the contracts with BlackRock, Goldman and JPMorgan Chase, the third winner, nullifying the process. The decision was based on questions surrounding Mr. Millard's actions during the formal bidding process. His actions have also drawn the scrutiny of Congressional investigators and the agency's inspector general. 
 An examination of thousands of pages of e-mail messages and other internal documents obtained by The New York Times shows the other side of the story: the two firms aggressively courted Mr. Millard, so extensively that they may have compromised federal contracting rules or at least violated the spirit of the law, contracting experts said. The records also illustrate the clash between Washington's by-the-letter rules on contracting and the culture of Wall Street, where deals are often struck over expensive meals.
 ''Both sides should have known better,'' said Steven L. Schooner, co-director of the Government Procurement Law Program at the George Washington University, who reviewed some of the material for The Times. ''What happened here is wrong, stupid and probably illegal.''
 BlackRock and Goldman, as well as Mr. Millard, all said that nothing improper happened either before the formal competition for the contract started last July, or while the competition, which concluded in October, was under way.
 ''Among the reasons that Mr. Millard was selected to head the P.B.G.C. is his understanding of the industry, his extensive background and the quality of his professional relationships,'' said Stanley M. Brand, a lawyer for Mr. Millard. ''He correctly separated his personal relationships from his official actions.''
 A review of the documents shows that the third winner, JPMorgan Chase, had contacts with Mr. Millard before and during the competition, but did not display the same intensity as the other two.
 Goldman and BlackRock saw Mr. Millard's selection as a major business opportunity, the records show.
 ''This is a very big fish on the line,'' one BlackRock executive wrote to another, discussing the government official.
 Mr. Millard had at least seven meetings with Goldman executives in the year before the bidding started, and 163 phone contacts, the documents show. BlackRock had less frequent contact -- 39 phone calls in that 12-month period. But one BlackRock executive told another that Mr. Millard had assured him in April, four months before the bidding, that he wanted to hire the company to help manage some of the money, company documents show. 
 ''It sounds like we may have a tiger by the tail here,'' one BlackRock executive wrote in an e-mail message. 
 The agency takes over pension programs when private companies go bankrupt. For years there was talk it might have to be bailed out by the government, and Mr. Millard, like many others, saw shifting from low-yield conservative investments like Treasury bonds to those with higher risks and higher potential returns as a way to solve the problem.
 Before coming to Washington Mr. Millard had been a money manager for Prudential Securities and Lehman Brothers, a senior economic development official in New York City while Rudolph W. Giuliani was mayor, a member of the New York City Council and a Republican nominee for Congress. 
 Within weeks of his arrival at the agency, he told Goldman Sachs about his plans to shake up the agency's portfolio.
 ''I just became head of the pension benefit guaranty corp in dc appointed by pres bush,'' he wrote in a June 2007 e-mail message to John S. Weinberg, a vice chairman and a member of the family that has helped run Goldman since the 1930s. Mr. Millard told Mr. Weinberg, a longtime acquaintance, that he wanted to revamp the agency's investment strategy. 
 ''Is there a team at goldman that does this and that would be interested in pursuing this business?''
 ''Yes, absolutely!'' Mr. Weinberg wrote back.
 Almost immediately, Goldman started to work informally for Mr. Millard by providing one of its top pension analysts at no charge to prepare at least six reports over the coming year, based on internal agency data, detailing possible investment strategies.
 Goldman also coached Mr. Millard as he sought to sway skeptics in the Bush administration.
 ''Here is the sound bite we discussed in this morning's meeting,'' wrote Mark Evans, a Goldman managing director, in a January 2008 e-mail message to Mr. Millard, seven months before the formal competition would begin. 
 Mr. Millard consulted with other industry experts during this period, but none so much as Goldman. George Koklanaris, Mr. Millard's chief of staff, said in retrospect that the detailed analytical work Goldman did for Mr. Millard, and the repeated contacts, might have created an appearance that Goldman had a competitive advantage. Even so, he says he believes Mr. Millard did nothing improper. 
 Mr. Millard's lawyer and a Goldman spokeswoman disputed that the firm gained any advantage from this work. The spokeswoman, Andrea Raphael, said the firm had no way of knowing that Mr. Millard was giving them more attention than other prospective bidders and that it was the agency's job to identify potential conflicts.
 The most important player in BlackRock's attempt to win the business was David Mullane, who had known Mr. Millard since the two attended the same high school. The friendship continues; they both live in Rye, N.Y., and attend the same church.
 In his conversations and e-mail messages with the agency head, Mr. Mullane often mixed family and business, talking about his golf game, his vacations, their children, their church (''Great job at Mass again this week,'' he wrote in one), invariably shifting into a discussion of his interest in the government work.
 ''Hope to see you at the Beefsteak Dinner tomorrow,'' he wrote to Mr. Millard, referring to a Friday night gathering at Church of the Resurrection in Rye. ''If you're going perhaps we can catch up business for a few minutes before I thrash you in ping pong again.''
 After a February meeting, months before the contract competition began, Mr. Mullane wrote his bosses: ''Money in motion by February.'' 
 There were more meetings through the winter and spring of 2008, as Mr. Millard prepared his plans. That April, there was a charity dinner at Chelsea Piers, along the Hudson River. One BlackRock executive wrote to another, ''Try to get Larry seated next to Charles Millard,'' referring to Mr. Fink, the company's chairman and chief. 
 After the dinner, Mr. Millard wrote to Mr. Fink, ''A pleasure meeting you. No need to respond. I will follow up with you briefly in future re our investment policy and with your team re other specifics.''
 The e-mail messages show that Mr. Mullane, a managing director at BlackRock, understood that the firm needed to move quickly, before the presidential election.
 ''He is a lame duck political appointee as soon as the November election occurs,'' he wrote to one BlackRock colleague last June, as the bidding was about to start. ''When the new man comes in at P.B.G.C., all bets are off for us.''
 As he prepared to open the competition, Mr. Millard, working with Mr. Mullane, sought to restrict the bidders to the biggest players by stipulating that the winner must have thousands of employees and a global operation, e-mail messages show. That decision cut out many boutique firms hoping to compete and gave BlackRock, Goldman and other large firms an advantage. ''Neither the company nor any of its employees did anything improper or illegal,'' Bobbie Collins, a BlackRock spokeswoman, said.
 Mr. Millard, through his lawyer, denied telling BlackRock that he wanted to select the company even before the competition started. Mr. Millard's lawyer also said he told the agency about his friendship with Mr. Mullane. But Jeffrey Speicher, an agency spokesman, said in a written statement that Mr. Millard ''did not disclose his relationship with the BlackRock executive.'' 
 While the competition was getting started, Mr. Millard began his job hunt. 
 He started by contacting Mr. Weinberg of Goldman Sachs, sending him his resume after meeting with him in New York last June. 
 Mr. Millard's e-mail messages show that, while the bidding was under way last fall, he also spoke with Rick Lazio, a former House Republican who is now a senior executive at JPMorgan Chase, to discuss career options. 
 In both cases, spokesmen for the executives said that while Mr. Millard was at the agency, they did not take actions to help him find a new job. 
 The e-mail messages show that within two weeks of the selection of the winners, Mr. Millard sought help from Karen Seitz, a Goldman executive involved throughout the process, in getting interviews with prominent industry players.
 ''I spoke with Dennis Kass after our meeting,'' Ms. Seitz wrote last November, referring to the chief executive of a $60 billion asset management firm, one of half a dozen interviews she arranged. ''He would love to meet with you in N.Y.''
 To date, Mr. Millard remains unemployed. His lawyer noted that Mr. Millard had honored the one-year prohibition in federal law against negotiating a job with a firm that he helped select as a contractor. While still at the agency, his lawyer said, Mr. Millard also paid his own bill whenever he dined out with industry officials, including Ms. Seitz. 
 But Mr. Schooner, the government contracting expert from George Washington University, said even asking for career help from a company he had just picked as a contractor raised serious questions.
 ''As a federal official you are not supposed to be discussing, bartering or leveraging a new job while you are involved with parties in a procurement,'' he said. ''It is a clear black-and-white rule.''
 Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, plans to seek legislation to require more intense oversight of the agency by an expanded board.
 ''The whole process was flawed,'' said Mr. Kohl, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which oversees the agency.

HEADLINE: Mind Over Muscle

 BODY:
America's automakers have long claimed that it will take major technological breakthroughs to meet the stringent fuel efficiency standards needed to slash carbon emissions and cope with rising energy prices. But Detroit's new display of muscle cars suggests fuel efficiency is, at this stage, more of a problem of taste and will. 
 More efficient vehicles are within Detroit's technological reach. Carmakers must decide to make them and consumers must be convinced to buy them.
 The latest hot rod to hit showrooms is the new Chevy Camaro. Chrysler recently introduced a new Dodge Challenger. Ford had a hit with the new Mustang. The three cars might help carmakers' bottom lines, but they are unlikely to reduce the United States' carbon footprint. A car that could have -- Chevy's hybrid Malibu sedan -- was killed in June because of lackluster sales.
 Even Honda, a paragon of technological efficiency, is less carbon-conscious than it could be. In the United States, the Accord engines come in two sizes: 2.4 and 3.5 liters. In Britain, where heavy taxes on gas keep drivers thrifty, they are smaller: 2.0 to 2.4 liters. The British versions achieve much better mileage. 
 The challenge for public policy is to steer the choices of industry, and consumers, away from the preference for size and power. And now is the time to do it. 
 Chrysler and General Motors just emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. Chrysler is managed by Fiat. G.M. is majority-owned by the government. All are still reeling from falling sales and face a temptation to forget the environment and focus on making money. But a lesson from the past quarter-century is: They can achieve enormous improvements in fuel economy if they want to. 
 Between 1980 and 2006, the average fuel economy of the American fleet of cars and light trucks gained only 15 percent, according to calculations by Professor Christopher Knittel of the University of California, Davis. From 1980 to 2004, passenger cars' horsepower increased 80 percent, on average. Their weight increased 13 percent. And the share of the sport-utility vehicle market grew from 20 percent to 51 percent. Mr. Knittel concluded that if the fleet hadn't become heavier and more powerful, it could have achieved a 50 percent gain in fuel economy on the same amount of technical progress. 
 He estimated that the average economywide fuel efficiency of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 that automakers agreed to with the Obama administration is eminently feasible assuming technological change continues at the same pace. Automakers would only have to cut the weight and power of the fleet back to where they were in 1980. Or they could change the car/truck mix back to where it was in 1980 and trim weight and power a little. This trick doesn't require new gizmos.

HEADLINE: Where Anxiety Is All That's Flowing

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
THE California wine industry encompasses many with little in common. It includes small grape growers and brokers, family producers, negociants, big corporations, major distributors and many different types of retail outlets. 
 Still, as diverse as this group is, one word seems to sum up the effect of the recession on their businesses: brutal.
The reason is simple. Wine is a cash-flow business, and all along the pipeline, from farm to production to sales, cash is not flowing. Growers are behind on sales of grapes, which are fetching much lower prices than last year. Sales are sluggish for wines retailing at $15 a bottle and higher. Meanwhile, distributors, restaurants and retail shops are reluctant to buy more wine, preferring to sell through what they already have. 
 Cash may be trickling, but anxiety is gushing forth.
 ''People are drinking out of their cellars, the big distributors are throwing their weight around, and you add these things up, and from the winery perspective, the cash flow is brutal,'' said Steve Matthiason, a vineyard consultant who also grows grapes and makes small quantities of wine. ''Everybody figures this is kind of a temporary thing, that when restaurants burn through their inventory they're going to have to start buying again, and distributors, too. But everybody is wondering when the levee is going to break, and you have harvest coming up.''
 The harvest is what makes selling wine so different from, say, selling computer chips. When production of chips outpaces sales, executives adjust production. But nature is relentless in its annual rhythm. The grapes must be harvested each fall, whatever the need. If grapes are scarce, it may take 10 years from the time a new vineyard is planted to when wines from its grapes can be enjoyed. In a glut, the spigot can't be switched off immediately.
 Consumer preference, though, can turn on a whim. Even in the recession, people continue to buy wine. Consumption and sales are actually up, industry analysts agree. But people have turned away from expensive wines, buying two $8 bottles instead of one $20 bottle. As a result, growers in high-status areas who don't already have contracts for their grapes are having trouble selling them, and prices are way down. 
 Russian River pinot noir grapes, for example, which sold in 2008 for $2,800 to $4,500 a ton, are now going for $1,800 to $2,800 a ton, said Bill Turrentine, president of Turrentine Brokerage, a leading California broker of wine grapes. Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon is selling for $2,000 to $3,000 a ton, he said, down from $3,500 to $5,500 in 2008.
 Times are barely easier for wineries that rely on purchased grapes. At Siduri, which specializes in making pinot noirs from top vineyards up and down the West Coast, sales are down 11 percent from last year, ''not great, but I don't think it's awful, either,'' said Adam Lee, the proprietor with his wife, Dianna. 
 ''We are certainly seeing a real slowdown in single-vineyard pinots,'' Mr. Lee said, ''but our appellation series, at $30 or less on the shelf, are flying.''
 Such a diversity of offerings is crucial as even those consumers who continue to want top wines have nonetheless traded down. When times were good a few years ago, Brewer-Clifton, which makes small amounts of pinot noir and chardonnay in the Santa Rita Hills of Santa Barbara County, began planting vineyards so it could farm its own grapes. 
 As it waited for these vineyards to become productive, Brewer-Clifton shifted its own sales focus. Instead of selling only wines from single vineyards for $60 to $80 a bottle, it started to offer wines with a regional appellation, for about $40 a bottle. These wines now make up half its production, which Greg Brewer, the proprietor with Steve Clifton, says is a lucky thing.
 ''Brewer-Clifton may have lost some people at $60 to $80, but we'll catch them at $40,'' Mr. Brewer said. 
 Some top wineries, while acknowledging a wholesale slump through distributors to retail shops and restaurants, say their direct sales, either at the winery or through the Internet, are still strong. At Cain Vineyard and Winery in Napa Valley, retail sales of Cain Five, for $125 a bottle, is down the most, while Cain Cuvee, for $34 a bottle, is selling well. But sales at the winery are up, even for Cain Five, said Christopher Howell, the general manager and winemaker. Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma County reports similar strength in direct sales. 
 ''It is a Catch-22 in some ways,'' said Jean Arnold Sessions, president of Hanzell. ''Distributors say the high end is not selling well, so they don't present the wines.''
 So what's the good news? 
 The wine industry can take some comfort, no matter how small, in knowing that the situation could be a lot worse. Ten years or so ago, California was making too much wine, and so began paring production and trimming back on new vineyards. 
 ''If this had hit a few years ago, when there was a basic structural excess, this would have been catastrophic,'' Mr. Turrentine said.
 The industry is also seeing some small acts of preemptive kindness. Peter Cargasacchi, a grower in the Santa Rita Hills who sells pinot noir grapes to Brewer-Clifton and Siduri, among others, recently cut his price by 10 percent, even though he already had contracts with producers.
 ''It just seemed like the right thing to do given the economy and the sluggish premium wine market,'' he said. ''Part of the concession also is motivated by the recognition that this symbiosis between vineyard and winery really is a team effort.''
 Consumers still interested in high-end wines may find great discounts now as everyone is trying to move inventory. Those who don't want to spend a lot on wine may also be drinking better in the near future. Premium producers who need to make room for the new vintage may sell their wines on the bulk market, even at a loss. These premium wines in turn will be repackaged and sold inexpensively, though it will be difficult for consumers to identify which bottles benefit from a premium wine infusion.
 Meanwhile, people in the industry wait, and hope, especially those who expanded or invested in new vineyards before the downturn. 
 ''People who made smart, conscientious decisions three years ago I think will be glad they did when the market stabilizes in 2012 or 2013,'' Mr. Brewer said. ''I think we have to be positive. God help us if it's still like this in 2012.''

HEADLINE: Tournaments for Girls Pack More Economic Punch

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

DATELINE: CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. 

 BODY:
Ten members of Kirsten Grant's family converged here last week to watch her play in a major youth softball tournament. Her mother, father, sister and brother had driven 13 hours with her from their home in suburban Toronto. Other relatives had traveled from as far as Salt Lake City. During lulls in play, they all went shopping and visited local attractions. 
 But last year, when Kirsten's older brother, Erik, played on a traveling baseball team, the experience could not have been more different. Parents rarely accompanied the team, he said, and the coach frowned on anything that distracted from the game. ''No leisure activity,'' said Erik, 19. ''It was eat, sleep and drink baseball.''
 As the popularity of youth tournaments has intensified over the past decade, a peculiar trend has emerged: girls' sporting events tend to attract more relatives and generate more revenue for tourism than similar events for boys. And that is drawing increased attention from economic development officials. 
 ''There are far more people who will travel with 12-year-old girls than even 12-year-old boys,'' said Don Schumacher, executive director of the National Association of Sports Commissions, a trade group that advises communities on attracting sporting events. ''And vastly more people will travel with 12-year-old girls than 18-year-old boys.''
 Although Schumacher said he and others did not keep statistics on the economic impact of girls' sporting events, many of his 500 members nationwide have reported anecdotally that such events are often more lucrative than those for boys. He and others mentioned several possible reasons, including a tendency among parents to be more protective of daughters; a heightened interest in girls' sports; and the increased attendance of mothers at games.
 Mika Ryan, president of the Mercer County Sports and Entertainment Commission in New Jersey, said the potential for increased revenue from girls' sporting events was one factor her group evaluated when deciding which events to go after. 
 ''We consider that because one of our priorities is to bring people to our county and put people in our hotels,'' she said. ''It's not like parents love their sons any less, but it is a phenomenon that you see happening.''
 Mercer County hosted 24 youth sports tournaments last year. 
 One city poised to capitalize on the situation is Chattanooga, where the mayor, Ron Littlefield, recently unveiled an $11.8 million softball complex aimed at returning the city to national prominence in the sport. Kirsten Grant, a 17-year-old catcher, was here to compete in the National Softball Association Class A Eastern World Series, a fast-pitch event for girls' teams in four age brackets, from under-10 to under-16. The event drew 232 teams and roughly 7,500 people, and city officials estimated that visitors would spend $3.6 million for the week.
 Chattanooga once had a reputation for its quality softball facilities, but years of neglect left the fields in poor condition and the city without major tournaments. Littlefield, who was elected in 2005, wanted to revive the sport.
 He worked with the city to build a softball complex on 85 acres next to a former landfill. The Summit of Softball complex has eight fields, with lighting, Webcams and awnings to shelter the bleachers from the sun. The Summit complex, along with a separate 2,500-seat softball stadium, has made the city increasingly attractive to groups like the National Softball Association, which operates tournaments nationwide, said Greta Hayes, the city's assistant director of parks. Already, she said, about 20 youth softball tournaments were scheduled for the city this season. The city held 72 youth sports tournaments last year.
 City officials acknowledged that they did not set out to capitalize on the girls' sports market, yet they are grateful for the added revenue that it brings. Three new hotels have opened near the softball complex, and Littlefield said the income from sales and hotel taxes was ''a real payback.'' 
 At the softball tournament, several parents said that they spent more money, and brought more family, to girls' sporting events. 
 ''I would let my son go off on a team for 20 days, but I don't think I would let my daughter do that,'' Kirsten's mother, Rosalind Grant, said.
 Others said that watching their daughters play was still more of a novelty and more exciting than watching a son. As a result, more relatives tended to travel with girls. 
 ''I think probably with boys, it's expected,'' said Jay Davis, who traveled from Laurel, Del., to watch his daughters, Hannah and Rachel, as part of a group of 200 players and parents. With girls' games, he said, ''you get the dads coaching, you've got the moms in the bleachers.''
 When both parents accompany a daughter, the other children often go, too. Before long, it is a summer vacation. Several families said they planned to spend $1,500 to $3,000 during the tournament.
 ''When you're here, you tend to do the tourist attractions, you're going to look for entertainment,'' said Melissa Dowd, who along with her husband traveled from Baton Rouge, La., to cheer on their daughter Abbie. When Abbie wasn't playing, the family visited the local aquarium, checked out the mall and ate in restaurants near Chattanooga's riverfront.
 Of course, boys' events can also help local economies. The opening of several youth baseball camps near Cooperstown, N.Y., for example, has transformed the surrounding communities over the past two decades. Parents rent hotel rooms and eat in local restaurants while their sons attend camp, said Deborah Taylor, director of tourism for Otsego County, which includes Cooperstown. ''It's a huge economic impact,'' she said.
 But Bobby Dodd, the president and chief executive of the Amateur Athletic Union, a national youth sports organization, is skeptical of financial comparisons. 
 ''I have three granddaughters,'' Dodd said. ''They love to shop. But I can tell you my boys darn near love to shop as much as the girls.''
 Dodd said that the youth sports events for boys and girls were faring well in the recession, perhaps because parents were reluctant to deny children their soccer or softball tournaments. 
 Several parents in Chattanooga agreed. Sue Wagner of Plymouth, Mich., traveled with her husband and younger daughter to watch Sarah, 14, compete. She said that her husband had been laid off from his job as a manager in a medical equipment firm in the fall, but that supporting their daughter was never in question. She persuaded her employer, a construction company, to sponsor Sarah.
 If things are worse next year, she said, she and her husband will make it work again. ''This is our family vacation,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Health Care and the T-Word

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The many-headed Hydra, with breath poisonous enough to kill, is one of the more gruesome beasts in Greek mythology. In Hercules's great clash with it, he would cut off one of its heads, only to have two more appear. No matter what he did, he couldn't keep up. 
 You can think of Congress's efforts to pay for health reform as being a little bit like a battle to slay a many-headed Hydra.
 Members of Congress have come up with one idea after another to pay for covering the uninsured. But they still haven't put together legislation that could pass. And that's in large part because most of those ideas have a basic flaw. 
 They do not raise revenue as quickly as health costs rise. The plan to impose a surtax on top earners, for instance, pays a decent chunk of the bill over the next few years. But the revenue from the tax rises only as fast (roughly) as the United States economy grows. The same is true of most taxes.
 Health costs, on the other hand, are growing much more quickly than the economy. Over the last decade, the economy has expanded by about 20 percent, and health spending has ballooned 50 percent. The gap isn't about to start closing, either. 
 So no matter what Congress has done to pay for its plans, it can't keep up.
 The numbers show there is only one sure way out of the problem, and, after months of roundabout discussion, that solution has re-emerged: It's a tax on health care.
 If Congress taxes health care, the revenue has a chance of rising with health spending. A health tax will also create an incentive for workers and businesses to slow the growth of health spending -- thus reducing the amount of taxes needed to pay the nation's health bill. 
 The health care debate is now in one of those calm-before-the-storm moments. After a flurry of activity last week, everybody is waiting for the Senate Finance Committee to release its bill.
 That bill will immediately become the reference point for all the other big players. Republican leaders will take shots at it, hoping to keep moderate Senate Republicans from supporting it. Conservative Blue Dog Democrats will argue that the bill makes their case for a less expensive plan than the current House version, with less generous subsidies for the uninsured. Liberals will take their own shots at the bill. Most intriguing, President Obama will have to decide whether to make the bill his own. 
 The rest of us will want to focus on two questions. How serious is Washington about slowing the soaring the growth in health costs? And will Washington figure out a way to cover most of the uninsured? 
 As it happens, there is one policy that can help with both issues. It's the same policy that will allow Congress to solve its herculean budget problem: Taxing health care.
 In recent days, the Finance Committee has been considering precisely such a tax, on the health benefits that Americans receive from their employers.
 The fact that these benefits are not taxed, as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber notes, stems from ''nothing more than an arbitrary administrative decision made 60 years ago.'' Unfortunately, that decision created all kinds of economic damage. Because health care -- unlike food, clothing and most other things -- isn't taxed, it's effectively on sale. And when something is on sale, people often buy more of it than they need.
 In the case of health care, they buy -- or their employer buys for them -- insurance plans that don't make much of an effort to control costs. Rather than putting pressure on hospitals to root out administrative waste, the plans cover the cost of that waste. They also cover the costs of brand-name drugs that are no more effective than generic alternatives and other kinds of expensive care that do little to improve health. 
 As a result, the tax exclusion ultimately raises your tax bill, via wasteful Medicare spending. Indeed, if there is a single health care idea on which liberal and conservatives agree -- including Douglas Elmendorf, director of the influential Congressional Budget Office -- it's scrapping the exclusion. 
 Yet many politicians are loath to come out against the exclusion, for the obvious reason that it makes them sound pro-tax. The Blue Dogs may be the best example. They have rightly pushed House leaders to be tougher about holding down cost growth. But most Blue Dogs have not been willing to get specific, on the tax exclusion or most everything else.
 To deal with this political reality, the Senate Finance Committee has become intrigued by a version of a health care tax, being pushed by the Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry, that comes dressed up with a whole lot of lipstick. The tax doesn't fall directly on workers. It doesn't even fall on employers. It falls on everyone's favorite villain: health insurance companies.
 Insurers that offered policies that cost more than a certain amount -- perhaps $25,000 a year -- would face a tax. The resulting tax revenue would help pay for covering the uninsured. Presumably, insurers would pass the cost of the tax onto companies, which would then become less willing to offer expensive plans. They would instead shift some of the money they are now spending on health insurance into cash compensation, which would, of course, be taxed, raising more revenue.
 But packaging the plan as a tax on insurers still may not be enough to make it palatable. So Congress would also probably have it apply only to the most expensive sliver of plans. David Axelrod, the Obama adviser, recently mentioned the $40,000 plans at Goldman Sachs (a firm that is now apparently about as popular as health insurers). 
 With this narrow approach, the tax would raise only a small share of the revenue needed to cover the uninsured, and Congress would still need to rely on a hodgepodge of other tax increases and spending cuts. But starting to lift the exclusion would still help -- especially if Congress set the threshold for the tax to rise more slowly than health costs have been rising. That way, more and more of the most expensive, least efficient plans would eventually be bumping up against the tax. 
 For all the budgetary elegance of the tax, though, its real importance is much larger. It would begin to chip away at the perverse incentives in our medical system.
 That's what matters. The idea isn't to punish Goldman traders or, for that matter, unionized workers who have their own generous plans. The idea is to give companies and workers more incentive to choose medical plans that try to reduce unnecessary costs. Without that incentive, is there any wonder our health care system is so troubled?
 This brings us back -- and you knew this was coming, didn't you? -- to the many-headed Hydra. Eventually, Hercules realized his strategy wasn't working. So he brought in his nephew, Iolaus, who torched the open wounds that Hercules inflicted on the Hydra, preventing any new heads from growing. And that worked. Hercules and Iolaus slew the beast. 
 How did they do it? By getting at the root of the problem.

HEADLINE: 3-YEAR DESCENT IN HOME PRICES APPEARS AT END

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
After a plunge lasting three years, houses have finally become cheap enough to lure buyers. That, in turn, is stabilizing prices, generating hope that the real estate market is beginning to recover.
 Eight cities, including Chicago, Cleveland, Denver and San Francisco, showed price increases in May, up from four in April and one in March, according to data released Tuesday. Two other cities, Charlotte, N.C., and New York, were flat.
 For the first time since early 2007, a composite index of 20 major cities was virtually flat, instead of down. 
 ''We've found the bottom,'' said Mark Fleming, chief economist for First American CoreLogic, a data firm. 
 The release of the surprisingly strong Case-Shiller Price Index, compiled by Standard & Poor's, followed earlier reports that sales of existing homes rose last month for the third consecutive time, while sales of new homes rose in June by the largest percentage in eight years. 
 All of these improvements are tentative, and come after a relentless decline that knocked more than half the value off houses in the worst-hit cities.
 Some skeptics say they believe the market is merely pausing before it resumes falling and that much of the life in the market is coming from speculators. Even the most enthusiastic analysts acknowledge that rising unemployment, another leap in foreclosures or a significant jump in interest rates could snuff out progress.
 Still, hope is growing in some quarters that the worst has passed.
 ''Recession is over, economy is recovering -- let's look forward and stop the backward-looking focus,'' John E. Silvia, the Wells Fargo chief economist, wrote Tuesday in a research note.
 Kirit Shah decided to look forward a few weeks ago. A retired forensic chemist for the New York Police Department, he closed on a house in Royal Palm Beach, Fla. 
 Mr. Shah was not dissuaded when the salesman at K. Hovnanian Homes told him the five-bedroom place had been empty since it was finished three years ago. ''It was waiting for me,'' said Mr. Shah, 64. ''I'm on a lakefront. I never dreamed I would be on a lakefront. I'm within walking distance of a swimming pool.''
 But the thing he likes best is this: he paid $260,000 for the five-bedroom house, half of what that model was fetching during the boom. ''An excellent deal,'' he said. ''Plus I got a good rate on my mortgage, under 5 percent.''
 Turning markets are full of uncertainty. If Mr. Shah was one reason new home sales were up 11 percent in June from May, it is unclear just how many others like him are out there.
 Brad Hunter, chief economist for Metrostudy, a research firm, said the new home numbers appeared to illustrate less a return of buyers like Mr. Shah and more a resurgence of investors and speculators. Metrostudy's own data showed that the number of buyers during the second quarter who actually moved into their new house declined 2.6 percent.
 ''Investors are turning right around and putting the houses on the market for sale or for rent,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''What appears to have been an absorption of excess inventory can be just a changing of ownership of that inventory.''
 The good news in the Case-Shiller index, the most widely watched source of price information about the housing market, is equally provisionary. Tracking only large urban areas, the monthly index does not represent the country as a whole. 
 The Case-Shiller figures released Tuesday showed May prices were down 17.1 compared with May 2008. As bad as that may sound, it was the fourth consecutive month that price declines slowed -- a step in the right direction, but perhaps not cause for widespread celebration.
 More attention was focused on the news that, when May was compared with April, the price index for 20 major cities showed a half-percent gain. It was the first month-over-month increase in the index in 34 months.
 ''It is very possible that years from now we will say that April 2009 was the trough in home prices,'' said Maureen Maitland, vice president for index services at Standard & Poor's.
 When the numbers were adjusted for seasonal factors, however -- the usual way housing figures are presented -- the slight gain disappeared and the index was essentially flat. Half of the cities showed continued declines.
 One reason the market is perking up in some places, real estate agents say, is the encouragement offered by such measures as the first time buyer's tax credit of $8,000. 
 All the more reason, said the National Association of Realtors, to not only extend the credit but expand it. The association is lobbying for the current credit, which expires in December, to be replaced with a $15,000 credit for all buyers.
 ''This is a relatively low-cost way to keep the housing market moving forward,'' said Paul Bishop, the association's managing director of research. 
 Another reason for the market's resurgence is the prevalence of foreclosures, which make up about a third of all existing home sales. In some troubled regions, agents say they cannot remember the last transaction that did not involve a bank disposing of a property.
 These communities are not yet showing any improvement in prices. Las Vegas was the worst-performing city in the May Case-Shiller index, falling 2.6 percent. Prices have fallen there by a third in the last year.
 ''The mom and pop that work at the Hilton can now afford a home here again,'' said Justin Pechonis, a Las Vegas real estate agent. ''Las Vegas is a great place to buy now.'' But not from him. Sickened by seeing so many clients foreclosed on, he is getting out of the business. He now drives a taxi.
 All this uncertainty breeds a hesitancy that seems to show up in nearly every sale, especially at the higher end of the market. When Margot and Pascal Lalonde decided in April to sell their two-bedroom condominium in the North End of Boston, they methodically quizzed six experienced agents about a good price.
 List it for under $500,000 unless you want to be here for months, said one agent. Two others said they should demand $675,000. The other three were in between.
 ''In a market with so few sales, no one knows what to do,'' said Ms. Lalonde, a consultant.
 After 80 days on the market and two small price reductions, the condo is now under contract for $550,000. The buyers examined the apartment six times. The Lalondes, who are moving to Short Hills, N.J., expect to be no less careful when they buy.
