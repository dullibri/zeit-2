HIGHLIGHT: In Montpelier, Vt., volunteers to help the elderly and earn hours of help for themselves. 

 BODY:
Joan Black took a serious tumble two years ago, climbing up on a stepladder to reach into a punchbowl. She was about to host one of her frequent patio parties for a regional theater company in Montpelier, Vt.
Ms. Black had been doing quite well in her ground-floor apartment downtown. But the fall broke a vertebra, and since then she's had trouble walking and standing for any extended period.
Once she worked as an interior designer. "I take a great deal of pride in my home," she told me in an interview. "But I couldn't keep up with the vacuuming and dusting. I couldn't garden. I used to start dreading winter in mid-July." (She couldn't shovel snow.) Living on Social Security payments since the recession plundered her savings, she couldn't afford to hire helpers. "Seeing things in my life go downhill became very depressing," said Ms. Black, now 80.
Happily, a city program called the Reach Service Exchange Network began operation in the fall of 2010, launched with a grant of $1 million from the federal Administration on Aging.
The network functions as a time bank. Montpelier residents of all ages join for $25 and get access to a site listing requests and offers: driving, pet care, reading aloud, help with grocery shopping, computer tutoring sessions and more. "We ask all members to provide services to the network," explained director Daniel Hecht. "We think people of any age or level of ability can contribute."
We've talked here about various alternatives to assisted living and nursing homes that allow people to age in place, or at least age in place longer. Co-housing, shared housing, villages, N.O.R.C.'s -- the approaches and the economics vary, but the goals of independence and interdependence, which aren't contradictory in old age, are much the same. People want community, but they also want privacy; most try to maintain their own households for as long as they can. "I told my son and daughter-in-law that I want to be carried out of my apartment," Ms. Black said, voicing a common sentiment.
Can an organization like Reach make that happen? "Volunteering and increased social interaction are known preventions that mean better health," Mr. Hecht pointed out, accurately.
So far, 200 locals have joined Reach, half of them over age 58. Staffers run criminal background and sex-offense checks on each member and review the motor vehicle records of anyone who has volunteered to drive. "This sort of vetting means nobody's going to come to your home and steal your jewelry," Mr. Hecht said.
Reach members currently contribute 300 hours of services each month. Ms. Black, for instance, has arranged to have a member vacuum and dust her apartment each week, which takes about two hours.
Cara Barbero, who lives a block or so away, shows up to shovel snow, often before dawn. "I get up in the morning, and the path is already cleared and salted and the car is cleaned off, and I can get out and go," Ms. Black said.
In exchange, she mans the Reach Network's information table at the farmers' market most summer weekends and staffs the guided tour desk at the restored state capitol building. She still hosts soirees to benefit the Lost Nation Theater, though someone else handles the punchbowl, and she arranges a high tea each March that supports a college art gallery. By helping Ms. Black, Ms. Barbero has earned hours that she uses to get child care.
Friendships develop. Ms. Barbero's daughters came over to sing "Jingle Bells" and deliver Christmas cookies to Ms. Black last month; she invited them and their mother to her 80th birthday celebration. She has signed up for classes that Reach is offering in the Alexander technique, which she thinks may ease her back pain.
As one downside of aging in place can be isolation and depression, "I've made it a point to get out and meet people," Ms. Black said. "It keeps the juices going."
But when the federal grant ends after three years, can Montpelier keep Reach going? It faces the same challenges as many elder care alternatives, including the much-touted village movement: It needs to raise money, if only for office space, Web site maintenance and at least a skeleton staff. And it needs to keep bringing in new members, including those younger and able-bodied. Its goal, in this small city of 7,500, is to attract 600 members who provide 1,000 hours of service each month. That's a far-off target.
Many of these experiments can keep older members in their homes when they need driving and dog-walking. As they age, a high proportion will eventually need help with the more basic activities of daily living -- bathing, dressing, using a toilet. Few of these housing or community-building efforts are equipped to offer long-term care. "We can't guarantee services to anyone," Mr. Hecht acknowledged.
So Reach represents a model with limitations but also great benefits. "It reminds me of when I was growing up on Long Island and people just naturally helped and took care of each other," Ms. Black said. "It's tightened our community. I just hope it goes on forever."

HEADLINE: Under the Radar: 5 Questions About 'Alexis: A Greek Tragedy'

BYLINE: ERIK PIEPENBURG


HIGHLIGHT: The Italian company Motus brings its latest show, an interdisciplinary look at financial and social turmoil in Greece, to the Under the Radar festival. 

 BODY:
In December 2008, weeks of rioting erupted in Athens after a police officer shot and killed a 15-year-old boy named Alexandros Grigoropoulos. Two years later the officer was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
For Greece, the shooting sparked a new wave of activism. For the Italian theater company Motus, it inspired a new show, "Alexis: A Greek Tragedy," one of several offerings at this year's Under the Radar festival. A co-presentation of the Public Theater and La Mama, the show is a follow-up to "Too Late! antigone (contest #2)," the company's modern retelling of Antigone that played at the festival last year. This time the story of Antigone shares the stage with overlapping narratives about the shooting of Mr. Grigoropoulos, the Alexis of the title, and the Greek financial crisis.
Enrico Casagrande and Daniela Nicolo, who created and co-directed "Alexis," recently spoke with ArtsBeat about the show and Motus's brand of documentary theatermaking. Following are excerpts from the conversation, parts of which were translated by Jonathan Raviv, a festival volunteer. 
Q.
A.
 Enrico Casagrande: This is the latest show of our project about an Antigone figure. But this is more connected with the contemporary world. It is based on a real story about a young guy who was killed in Greece. We started from this real story and mixed in the myth of Antigone with the history of Greece and what Greece is like today.
 Daniela Nicolo: We went to Athens last summer to meet people, and to meet friends of Alexis. We visited the center of the revolt. We went to Thebes, Argos, all kinds of towns to see the difference the crisis made between then and now. 
Q.
A.
 Casagrande: Greece was in crisis before other countries in Europe were. Popular revolts in Greece involved all of the country, not just activists and young people, but all of the society. All levels were involved with this kind of revolution. It's ongoing. It's not finished. 
Nicolo: It's very meaningful for us to be here to show this production. We look at the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York, and it's something very strong.
Q.
Nicolo: The Occupy movement is a wave that's arrived everywhere. In small towns in Italy a lot of students go to the center of town with tents. It's an awakening of the people. They try to have their own voice to be heard, like Antigone. These young people want a means of behind heard. For us we say don't be scared of the power of the system.
Occupy Wall Street is not in the show but it does relate to what's happening on stage. There is a connection. The problems of Alexis are similar to the themes of Occupy Wall Street.
Casagrande: We see that all around the world there are young people involved in revolts. This mass of young people going outside on the streets is for me something real new. It has been 40 years that it hasn't happened like this.
Q.
A.
 Casagrande: We use video in this show. Part of it is from a documentary we did in Greece last year. A laptop and the video projector is on stage. The actors just move it around. It's really simple. 
Q.
A.
 Casagrande: We think theater is still alive. Some people say it's dead, that theater is more concentrated on doing the same plays. But for us theater is about reflecting. It's not easy, but it's fast. It's a fast artistic way to speak with an audience. We don't want to lose time. We want to share this moment. 
Nicolo: For us it's important to use this time we have on stage to share with the audience our idea of change. We believe in the possibility of change. We really believe it.

HEADLINE: What's a Protester to Do?

BYLINE: MICHAEL POWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Anti-Wall Street demonstrators, though often peaceful, find themselves hemmed in by the police at many turns. 

 BODY:
These are strange days to walk the streets of New York in the company of protesters.
 Police officers, often in phalanxes, are constant companions, shadowing loud, obstreperous but most often peaceful demonstrators. The officers follow on foot and in vans and cruisers with flashing lights and on ubiquitous motor scooters.
On occasion, as I wrote Tuesday, there are intimidating displays of force. In the last few weeks, the police have gone after reporters working for large newspapers and the vibrant online press; the cops have pushed, punched and threatened reporters with suspension of police press cards.
In late November, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly tried to check such behavior. But his orders - to treat the press with respect - often appear honored in the breach.
None of these tensions are new. Several prominent historians note New Yorkers often have reacted angrily to Wall Street speculative binges and collapses. 
Mike Wallace, the Pulitzer Prize-winning co-author of "Gotham: a History of New York City to 1898" and a history professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, notes in an essay that when the credit system went into cardiac arrest in 1837, crowds rolled roiling into the streets around the banks. Another bursting credit bubble, Mr. Wallace writes, "galvanized a march on Wall Street in 1857, and the hunger and hopelessness provoked a Tompkins Square demonstration in 1874, suppressed with violence by the police."
The Great Depression led to massive rent strikes and pitched battles between the unemployed and the police. There are, Mr. Wallace notes, "no 'lessons' to be learned here. History never does repeat itself."
But, he writes, those who support the Occupy Wall Street movement should know that their anger and actions "are not novel but rather the latest in a long line of opposition to the inequitable workings of our economic system."
(Mr. Wallace notes that for all of Occupy Wall Street's anger, its historical distinction just might be a playful sense of humor: In the past, "one would not have seen signs like the placard toted on Oct. 5, by a woman, no doubt a Jewish mother, that read: 'DEAR WALL STREET, WE SENT CASH TO SAVE YOUR TUSH . . . YOU NEVER WRITE.' ")
To this, Lisa Keller, a historian at Purchase College of the State University of New York, adds her thoughts about the precarious balance among the police, demonstrators and the press. She explored these themes in her book, "Triumph of Order: Democracy and Public Space in New York and London."
"Clearly, there has been a shift to the dominance of order," she notes, "but the relationship between the police and public has never been a simple one."
The police mission in the 19th century was not to catch crooks, but to prevent crime and keep order. So they developed portfolios of known troublemakers and deployed police spies, aiming less to interfere with political thought than to prevent violence.
More broadly, Ms. Keller writes, the New York police rarely interfered with media coverage, which for about a century offered the best way to learn about protests. Unfortunately, she notes, there are far fewer newspapers now and reporters cover far fewer demonstrations. 
The Police Department, too, has wrestled with how to hand out press passes to Internet journalists. See, for example, the lengthy account of the department's resistance to giving such passes to reporters for Gothamist, one of the city's more vigorous news Web sites.
Finally, it's worth noting that the current official insistence on order almost certainly falls harder on protesters than on the press.
Beginning with the Giuliani administration, and with great momentum after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, city officials have cracked down on street dissent. The police treated even quite pacific demonstrations against the Iraq War and the Republican National Convention of 2004 as potential threats to public order. Police penned and diverted demonstrators, and the parks commissioner prevented protesters from entering century-old rally points like Central Park. During the convention, the police arrested many hundreds who appeared to break no law.
Many sued the city, and the city's lawyers have defended these cases at great cost to the city purse. As the New York Law Journal reported last month, the Law Department alone has spent $8 million, with another $6.9 million for lawyers from outside firms, fighting such lawsuits.
A recent, Kafkaesque example of such arrests came early on Sunday morning, as demonstrators marched on sidewalks through the East Village toward Tompkins Square Park. See this video:
Shortly before 3 a.m., the protesters turned down the sidewalk on Second Avenue. A large police presence blocked the pavement ahead. Behind, police scooters blocked any retreat.
"You are blocking the sidewalk," an officer is heard telling the demonstrators. "Disperse or you will be arrested."
Protesters noted, not unreasonably, that the police had them boxed. The police allowed the videographer to escape through their lines, although they warned him to stop taking pictures.
Police handcuffed the remaining protesters, about 50 in all, for "obstructing" the sidewalk.
Franz Kafka might have smiled.

HEADLINE: Signs of Hope on Jobs, and Some Caveats

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: The monthly jobs report from the Labor Department on Friday may offer a decided upturn, but there are reasons to be cautious about the harbingers of that result and the actual jobs created. 

 BODY:
With as dismal a run as we've had in the economy over the last few years, it's tempting to start looking for the glass to be half full.
 After a traumatic late summer and fall, the economy showed some signs it was sputtering back with holiday sales strength and three months of steady - if uninspiring - job growth.
 Hopes are rising for signs of accelerating job creation in Friday's Labor Department report, following a decline in the four-week average of new unemployment claims and a strikingly robust report of job growth from ADP, the payroll service. ADP said on Thursday that the private sector added 325,000 jobs in December, the strongest increase in a year.
 Without trying to knock the glass over, we have to point out that many economists consider the ADP numbers less than predictive.
 "Its track record is spotty (and that characterization is being polite)," Tom Porcelli, senior United States economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a research note." ADP often revises its numbers, and historically, December's numbers have been subject to fairly wide swings.
 Government forecasts, of course, can change as well, so perhaps Friday's number will come with a dollop of salt, too.
That said, there's another reason to be less than ecstatic about the jobs that are being created. 
As my colleague Floyd Norris has pointed out, manufacturing has actually been a standout, generating a net gain of 302,000 jobs - or about 13 percent of the total -- since American employment hit its recent low in February 2010. But about a third of all jobs created in that period have been in relatively low-paying sectors like retail, leisure and hospitality, and home health care. 
And temporary help services account for 356,900 jobs - about 15 percent of all new jobs added since the trough.
Another number that has some economists dispirited is the number of people who are working part time because they cannot secure a full-time position. That number has remained stubbornly high. In November, it was 8.5 million, more than double what it was before the recession.
 "A lot of firms have learned to hire and find people who are willing to work part time," said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. And he said that this is "not simply a short-term temporary thing, but it's become much more permanent."

HEADLINE: Judge Cites Bias in Halting Brooklyn Development Plan

BYLINE: LIZ ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: A judge rules that the Bloomberg administration is siding with Hasidic Jews in a development plan that would discriminate against blacks and Latinos. 

 BODY:
The blighted border of Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick has been more like the Bermuda Triangle than the Broadway Triangle for developers over the last two decades.
The 31-acre site spanning the three Brooklyn neighborhoods has sat largely vacant while a lawsuit that has exposed religious and racial divisions over low-cost housing has brewed for two years.
And a recent court ruling assures that nothing will get built anytime soon.
In the latest chapter of the city's contentious Broadway Triangle plan to build affordable housing, a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan issued a temporary order last month blocking the project, while delivering a blistering critique of the Bloomberg administration, saying it had discriminated against blacks and Latinos by favoring Hasidic Jews.
Justice Emily Jane Goodman sided with opponents of the project who had said that the city's no-bid process was flawed and that the plan to build three low-rise buildings unjustly favored the Hasidic population over blacks and Latinos.
Many of the proposed buildings would have large apartments, providing the kind of space that large Hasidic families would typically desire.
"It is well known that there is a shortage of housing of all sizes throughout New York City," Justice Goodman wrote in her decision. "The need for large apartments (and a great need for small apartments) cannot justify construction of very commodious spaces, when such apartments are proposed only where the white/Yiddish speakers are the sole demographic group for whom the need for large apartments is greater."
She concluded that the "three proposed developments will not only not foster integration of the neighborhood, but it will perpetuate segregation."
The bidding process began in 2006, and two nonprofit groups were picked to develop the sites: the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, representing the Hasidic community, and the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, founded by Vito J. Lopez, a state assemblyman who is Brooklyn's Democratic Party chairman.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, including community groups and the New York Civil Liberties Union, claimed that the city had worked exclusively with those two groups, deliberately shutting out their clients from Hispanic and church organizations.
"Our clients have been saying for years the way that these housing plans were developed would lead to discriminatory practices," said Taylor Pendergrass, a lawyer for the civil liberties union and one of five lawyers representing the opponents of the project.
"It's been a long journey, and in the end the community feels that finally we have a voice," said Juan Ramos, the chairman of the Broadway Triangle Community Coalition, which represents more than 40 organizations that oppose the project. "If housing is going to be built, we need to get the maximum amount of affordable housing that can be done on the Broadway Triangle."
Mr. Pendergrass said, "A fantastic result of the preliminary injunction would be for us all to come back to the table and get a plan that could do this."
In the immediate future, however, there will be more court dates; the city has said it will appeal the temporary injunction.
"The court mistakenly discounted evidence submitted by the city," said Gabriel Taussig, the chief of the administrative law division of the city's Law Department.
Mr. Taussig said the city planned "to refute these outlandish claims before an appellate court."
Mr. Lopez took a more conciliatory approach. "I am willing, my office is willing to have a dialogue with any and all interested individuals that would like to work on a plan to build affordable housing," he said.
Justice Goodman said that opponents of the project offered compelling evidence from Lance Freeman, an expert in demographic statistical analysis from Columbia University. According to the decision, 43 percent of the 181 units from the three projects were scheduled to have three or four bedrooms.
(The city's larger plan for developing the Broadway Triangle called for a total of 1,800 units, with 905 set aside for affordable housing.)
Dr. Freeman determined, using 2000 census figures, that in the districts qualifying for the affordable housing project, 90,000 blacks and Hispanics needed small apartments, and that only 9,000 whites/Yiddish speakers needed large apartments.
Justice Goodman was frank in her disdain for the city's arguments, calling them "tortured" and "unpersuasive."
Justice Goodman will be retiring on Feb. 28. Justice Shlomo S. Hagler will be taking over her caseload, including the continuing battle over the Broadway Triangle.

HEADLINE: European Banks Prepare More Job Cuts

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Societe Generale of France has announced an agreement to achieve about 880 "voluntary departures" in its domestic investment banking business, joining other banks that are planning job reductions in response to Europe's debt crisis. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- Less than a week into the new year, European banks are already planning new job cuts.
Societe Generale, the second-largest French bank, has just announced an agreement with its trade unions for about 880 "voluntary departures" in its domestic investment banking business, starting in April. An additional 700 layoffs are expected in the bank's international investment banking operations, including in New York and London, according to a company spokeswoman, Nathalie Boschat.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has hired the advisory investment bank Lazard to find a new owner for its struggling equities business, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
That news comes as R.B.S., in which the British government holds an 83 percent stake after providing the bank a 20 billion ($31 billion) bailout in 2008, is attempting to reduce its investment banking unit, which currently employs about 19,000 people. 
R.B.S. plans to eliminate 2,000 jobs from its global banking and markets unit in the next 12 to 18 months in response to the volatile financial markets and Europe's debt crisis. The bank has already eliminated more than 30,000 jobs since 2008.
European banks have been cutting jobs aggressively. 
In France, Credit Agricole said late last year that it planned to eliminate 2,350 jobs as part of an effort to adapt to continued instability in world financial markets, and BNP Paribas has also announced plans for 1,400 layoffs.
The Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS each plan to eliminate 3,500 jobs as they shift their focus away from investment banking to their profitable wealth management operations.
The layoffs in Europe's banking sector come as financial firms look to rein in costs and increase capital buffers to meet tough new regulatory requirements by June.
Banks have also been buffeted by the European sovereign debt crisis, which has wiped out billions of euros' worth of shareholder value. The Euro STOXX banks index, made up of the largest banks in the euro zone region, has fallen 42 percent in the last year. 
Shares in the Italian bank UniCredit, which fell on Wednesday after the bank offered newly issued stock to existing shareholders at a 43 percent discount in an effort to raise capital, continued to slide on Thursday. In afternoon trading in Milan, the share price had fallen 14 percent, to the lowest level since the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Santorum Insists West Bank Is 'Part of Israel'

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY


HIGHLIGHT: Following Rick Santorum's sudden rise to prominence in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, new attention has been paid to his views on foreign policy issues, which apparently include a firm conviction that the West Bank is "part of Israel." 

 BODY:
Following Rick Santorum's sudden rise to prominence in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, new attention has been paid to his views on foreign policy issues, which apparently include a firm conviction that the West Bank is "part of Israel."
Writing in The Jewish Week on Monday, Douglas Bloomfield reminded readers that Mr. Santorum told a man in Iowa six weeks ago that "all the people that live in the West Bank are Israelis. They're not Palestinians -- there is no Palestinian -- this is Israeli land." 
A video of the exchange, which was recorded by CNN, shows that Mr. Santorum responded to a question about whether or not Israel "should dismantle its settlements" by suggesting that the West Bank was as much a part of Israel as Texas and New Mexico are part of the United States. The entire territory, Mr. Santorum added, "is legitimately Israeli country," so Israelis "have a right to build things based upon their ownership of that land." 
The candidate said much the same thing in June, when he attended a Republican Jewish Coalition event in Iowa. Weighing in on the debate over Israel's 1967 borders, Mr. Santorum said then: "I think this is really important to understand: that Israel's neighbors attacked Israel. Israel responded to those attacks and in so responding was able to take ground that gave them more of a defensible posture vis-àa-vis future attacks -- the Golan Heights and the West Bank in particular." 
Since 1967, Mr. Santorum said, Israelis have been "occupying that ground, and having that ground be part of Israel."
As Glenn Kessler, campaign fact checker for The Washington Post, explained on Thursday, even Israel's government calls the West Bank a "disputed territory," whose future status "is subject to negotiation."
Mr. Santorum's account of the 1967 war is also contradicted by the Jewish Agency's an official history, which explains that Israel's leaders decided "to take pre-emptive military action" with "a surprise air attack on June 5," rather than "wait for the first blow of an Arab attack."
Although Mr. Santorum's argument was clearly offered in strong support of the rights of Israeli settlers, it is interesting that his extreme stance, if it ever became official United States policy,
could actually undermine Israel's stated goal of remaining "a Jewish and democratic state." 
As Grace Kiser of Reuters observed after Mr. Santorum's November remarks were first reported, he "did not clarify whether he believes everyone who lives in the West Bank should be accorded all the rights and responsibilities of Israeli citizenship."
Israeli and Palestinian activists who support what is known as the "one-state solution" to the conflict have argued for years that Israel and the Palestinian territories it occupies are effectively one country, in which West Bank Palestinians are denied full legal rights, and votes.
In an essay for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz this week, the writer A. B. Yehoshua suggested that the continued growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and the corresponding difficulty in imagining a future Palestinian state on the same land, made it seem as if Israel is moving, inexorably, "as though out of necessity, toward the establishment of a binational state."
Calling this one-state solution "a dangerous and unfavorable possibility," Mr. Yehoshua argued:
For most of the religious, fanatics or half-moderates, the binational vision is not so threatening. Anyone who knew how to preserve his identity via religious rites and circumscribed community life around the world for centuries certainly could guard their identity in an isolated district surrounded by Arab villages, with an Israel Defense Forces company protecting their welfare.
Right-wing extremists, who regard Israel as a huge American aircraft carrier (as Minister Uzi Landau put it), believe that this confused superpower will allow them to solve the demographic problem by carrying out a series of small-scale transfers at some point in the future.
Also, the humanists, veterans weaned on ideas of brotherhood between nations inculcated by movements such as Hashomer Hatzair and Brit Shalom, will not find anything illegitimate about Hamas offices being located in the future in the Azrieli complex in Tel Aviv, so long as these offices do not disturb their humanist sensitivities.
But for those who believed in and dreamed of an independent Jewish Israeli identity which, for better or for worse, stands up to the test of dealing with a national territorial reality entirely its own, a binational state represents a broken dream, a surefire source of demoralizing conflicts in the future, as was proven by the failure of binational experiments around the world that involved peoples who were closer to one another than are Jews and Palestinians in terms of religion, economics, values and history.

HEADLINE: Private Equity Firm Sees a Future in Flatware

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: Oneida's new owner, Monomoy Capital Partners, is helping the company rise from the aftermath of bankruptcy, and expansion is now the goal. 

 BODY:
ONEIDA, N.Y. - Some local residents, when eating out, instinctively turn their utensils upside-down to look for a telltale sign: the word "Oneida," stamped into the back of the handle.
The "Oneida flip," as it's called, is a ritual carried over from an era when Oneida Ltd., the company headquartered here, dominated the global market in flatware, setting tables all over the world with its stainless steel forks, spoons and knives. In recent years, the ritual became a painful reminder of the company's troubles.
Once an economic engine of upstate New York and one of the region's largest employers, Oneida no longer makes flatware in the area. Like so many industrial players across the country, the company has struggled to compete with a flood of low-cost foreign manufacturers. As sales evaporated, factories were shut down. Retail stores were closed. And jobs were shipped overseas.
But a funny thing happened on the way to Oneida's demise. Wall Street - an industry that has been accused of destroying jobs and stripping businesses for parts - decided the company had long-term potential.
In November, Monomoy Capital Partners, a private equity firm, bought Oneida from a group of hedge funds. The new owner wants to expand, rather than decimate its operations. It is a simple but lofty goal for a company that has been slowly recovering since its bankruptcy in 2006.
"This is a meaningful investment for us," said Daniel Collin, the Monomoy partner who led the deal to acquire Oneida. "After years of being undercapitalized, Oneida finally has a partner willing to invest in its future."
How a 132-year-old flatware company ended up in the hands of a Manhattan private equity firm illustrates the woes of American manufacturing - and possibly, a way to improve its fortunes.
Last year, buyout shops bought 361 industrial companies, with many deals under $150 million, like the Oneida deal, according to Preqin, a research firm.
Monomoy, which has just 20 employees and manages a relatively small $700 million in assets, has specialized in acquiring small- to medium-size businesses that might seem antiquated to other buyout firms. Among the companies in its portfolio are Steel Parts Manufacturing, which produces clutch plates used in automatic transmission cars, and Awrey Bakeries, a 102-year-old company that makes frozen brownies, cakes and other desserts.
"A lot of times, these boring, stodgy businesses can generate consistent cash flow, and that's important to a private equity buyer," said Eric Hollowaty, an equity research analyst with Stephens Inc. "I don't think many private equity firms are going to be motivated by saving an age-old brand if they don't think they can make a handsome return."
While Oneida's flatware business may be traditional, its history is anything but. The company traces its roots to the Oneida Community, a utopian commune started in 1848 by an eclectic religious leader named John Humphrey Noyes. In a sprawling mansion on Kenwood Avenue, Mr. Noyes and his followers, known as Perfectionists, practiced a radical lifestyle that involved communal child-rearing, a free-love arrangement known as "complex marriage" and a rule, called "coitus reservatus," that prohibited men from ejaculating during sex.
 While the group disbanded in 1880, its entrepreneurial spirit lived on in Oneida Ltd., which grew from a manufacturing corporation formed by ex-Community members into a global behemoth. Its former ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange, OCQ, stood for "Oneida Community Quality."
A third of Oneida's roughly 450 employees still work at the company's headquarters, a four-story granite building that stands across the street from the original Oneida Community house and doubles as a kind of living museum. Oneida advertisements from Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s, some featuring then-spokesman Bob Hope, dot the walls of the office. A row of unused Kodak Carousels sits on a shelf outside the company's in-house darkroom, long ago abandoned for a digital photography studio. Down the hall, a small group of model-makers hammers out prototypes by hand.
"We still do it the old-fashioned way," said Paul E. Gebhardt, Oneida's senior vice president of design, who is also the great-great-grandson of John Humphrey Noyes, the founder of the Oneida Community.
 Oneida's financial problems were decidedly modern, and echoed the issues faced by companies in cities like Detroit and Pittsburgh. Starting in the 1990s, the company began to feel the heat of foreign competitors, who could produce utensils for a fraction of the price of American manufacturers. The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, further hurt business, after the metal forks and knives Oneida supplied to airlines were banned on flights.
As its sales fell, Oneida hemorrhaged money - more than $157 million between January 2003 and October 2005 - and was forced to stop making flatware and close several facilities in Oneida and the surrounding cities, where the company had employed about 2,500 people at its peak. By 2006, the situation at the company, which in better times had been well-off enough to sponsor Little League teams, the golf course and other local activities, had become so dire that filing for Chapter 11 was the only option.
 "Oneida tried to hang onto its manufacturing facilities as long as it could," said James E. Joseph, Oneida's outgoing chief executive, who is stepping down this year as part of the Monomoy transition. "From a pure business standpoint, you could argue we hung on too long."
A few months later, Oneida exited from bankruptcy, under the control of a group of hedge funds. Led by Monarch Alternative Capital, the firms moved swiftly - if painfully - to make the company profitable. They moved a distribution center to Savannah, Ga., to save on freight costs, closed stores and struck an agreement that allowed Robinson Home Products to distribute flatware and dinnerware under Oneida's name. The hedge funds even debated moving Oneida's headquarters closer to New York City to give it a better shot at attracting top talent, but eventually decided against it, according to several people involved in the discussions.
 Those decisions stabilized Oneida. In five years, the firms reduced the company's debt load to around $60 million from approximately $150 million. The company now turns a small annual profit of around $15 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to several people with knowledge of the company's finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the numbers are private. Its North American flatware business gained 3 percentage points of market share last year, according to Mr. Joseph, and still has a valuable brand name.
With the finances on the upswing, Monomoy saw an opportunity in Oneida. The private equity firm owns Anchor Hocking, a glassware maker, and Monomoy figured it could use its foothold in the food service industry to bolster Oneida's sales to restaurants and hotels. In November, Monomoy paid around $100 million for Oneida, according to several people with knowledge of the deal terms, which were not disclosed.
Several weeks after the deal with Monomoy was announced, Mr. Joseph took to the auditorium stage in Oneida's headquarters to reassure his employees that they were in good hands. Flanked by Mr. Collin and his Monomoy team, Mr. Joseph announced that he was stepping down and taking a job at nearby Le Moyne College, although he would keep a seat on the company's board and remain involved in certain company projects. According to Mr. Joseph, Monomoy is not a "strip and flip" firm that will shrink Oneida down to its smallest possible size for a quick, profitable sale.
 "They're not Gordon Gekko," he said of the firm. "It's almost like they got together and said, 'There's a different way to do this.' "
 Monomoy has already started its efforts to bolster Oneida's bottom line. It recently sent two Oneida executives to its management boot camp, a two-week intensive course that was inspired by Toyota's "lean manufacturing" approach. It plans to name a new chief executive shortly and has plans to campaign for business in South Korea and Brazil.
Mr. Collin, a fast-talking Wall Street deal-maker who uses "leverage" as a verb, is both optimistic and reasonable about Oneida's expectations. While reopening the local plant in nearby Sherrill is a long shot, he hopes to strengthen Oneida so that it can be sold or taken public again within five years.
"Are they going to be creating 5,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S.? Probably not," he said. "But can they grow and generate profits? Sure."
 It may be too late to bring industrial revival to the Oneida region, where the largest employer is now an American Indian casino several miles down the road. And some of the psychological damage of Oneida Ltd.'s decline has already been done.
 "Oneida silver used to pay for the electricity, the library, everything," said Leo Matzke, who was Oneida's mayor until this month. "We just don't talk about it like we used to."
But even if an Oneida recovery would be mostly symbolic in the region, the residents still dream. At the Marble Hill Inn, a watering hole near Oneida's headquarters, Pamela Gilmore, who has lived in Sherrill, nicknamed "Silver City," for 36 years, reminisced about the days when the company's factory hummed with life.
"We're all proud of Oneida," she said. "We'd love for it to come back."

HEADLINE: New Charges Possible in Insider Case Against Gupta

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal prosecutors say they are likely to file a new indictment against Rajat K. Gupta, possibly adding new criminal charges in the insider trading case against the former head of McKinsey &#038; Company. 

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors said Thursday that they were likely to file a new indictment against Rajat K. Gupta, possibly adding new criminal charges in the insider trading case against the former head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
It was "more likely than not there will be a superseding indictment" filed in the case by the end of January, Richard C. Tarlowe, an assistant United States attorney, said during a pretrial hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Gupta, who sat on the boards of Procter & Gamble and Goldman Sachs, is accused of divulging confidential information about those companies to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, the convicted former hedge fund manager now serving an 11-year prison term.
The 63-year-old Mr. Gupta is fighting charges of securities fraud and conspiracy and preparing for an April 9 trial. On Thursday, he appeared in court, flanked by a team of five lawyers.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff listened Thursday as the two sides sparred over a range of issues. Earlier this week, Mr. Gupta's lawyers filed legal papers seeking to dismiss certain counts against their client, suppress the use of wiretap evidence and force the government to clarify its indictment.
During the two-hour hearing, Mr. Gupta's primary lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, pressed the government to clarify language in its indictment that suggested his client had leaked information about companies other than Procter and Goldman to Mr. Rajaratnam, the former head of the Galleon Group.
Mr. Tarlowe said the other company was J.M. Smucker, which is known for its jellies and jams.
In June 2008, Smucker said it was acquiring Folgers Coffee from Procter & Gamble for about $3 billion. The government said previously in its indictment that the day before this announcement, Mr. Rajaratnam told a colleague that he had learned from a director of Procter & Gamble that Smucker was buying Folgers.
On the wiretap issue, Judge Rakoff indicated that chances were slim that he would bar the government from playing secretly recorded phone conversations at Mr. Gupta's trial. His lawyers are arguing that the law does not permit federal authorities to use wiretaps in insider trading cases.
Judge Rakoff cited the Rajaratnam trial, in which Judge Richard J. Holwell allowed the government to use wiretap evidence.
"Looking at it realistically, if I were the defense, I would not be optimistic on this particular motion," Judge Rakoff said.
Though Procter was a focus of Thursday's hearing, the trial is also expected to center on Goldman, where Mr. Gupta served as a director for four years.
The government has accused Mr. Gupta of leaking the bank's earnings and other information to Mr. Rajaratnam, including Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman during the financial crisis.
Goldman executives could be called to testify, including the firm's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who testified in the Rajaratnam case.
The government has its own Goldman connection in the Gupta trial. Mr. Tarlowe, one of the two prosecutors, is a former investment banker at Goldman.

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Push for Casinos Not Good News for All Gamblers

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In expressing support for full-fledged casinos in New York, Mr. Cuomo is perhaps facing reality, but also pushing a notion that typically makes money off gamblers who don't have much to begin with. 

 BODY:
At about the same time that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo began his "State of the State" speech on Wednesday, a middle-aged woman walked away from a slot machine called Great Wall in the new gambling hall adjoining Aqueduct racetrack. That machine had taken enough of her money for one day, said the woman, who preferred to keep her name to herself.
The last thing on her mind was the governor, until it was mentioned to her that he was about to call for a change in the state constitution that would allow full-fledged casinos operated by groups other than Indian tribes to be built across New York State.
"Aren't they already here?" she asked, sweeping her hand across the thousands of blinking and whirring gizmos that form Resorts World Casino New York City.
Technically, no, they are not. The Aqueduct complex in Queens, where Mr. Cuomo also wants to build a convention center, is considered a "racino." That unappealing portmanteau means it is filled with souped-up slot machines but doesn't have a single flesh-and-blood blackjack dealer or croupier. Casinos have at least a few humans who deal the cards and spin the roulette wheels (though there, too, machines are dominant these days, with most gamblers required to display no more skill than that possessed by the average rock).
This woman did not like the governor's idea.
"I'd rather keep it all in Atlantic City," she said. "It's too tempting to have it close to home, especially for younger people who don't have much money."
Naturally, not everyone on the Resorts World floor agreed with her. One man also had Atlantic City in mind but, unlike her, he warmed to the idea of having a new casino within easy commuting distance. He was tired of the long drive to southern New Jersey, he said.
A debate along these lines, with other arguments no doubt entering the conversation, will ultimately decide if Mr. Cuomo gets his way. The process of amending the state constitution is sufficiently complicated that nothing will happen for years.
The governor's position was rooted in practicality: New York has tribe-run casinos. It already has, by his count, 29,000 gaming machines like the ones at Aqueduct. It is surrounded by casinos in neighboring states. "It's time we confronted reality," he said, and thus plunge fully into the casino business.
A similar pragmatism has come to overtake leading politicians who used to describe state-sponsored gambling as wrong-headed. The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has muted what had been a longtime opposition to casinos. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, too, has shifted. Over the years, the mayor has described revenue from casinos as "regressive," and he has questioned whether any benefits accrue to nearby towns. But lately, with a note of resignation, Mr. Bloomberg has said that if expanded gambling is to be, he wants to make sure that New York City gets its share. 
It would be interesting to know if Mr. Cuomo discussed this subject with his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In his day, Mario Cuomo vigorously opposed what his son now endorses. "It doesn't generate wealth, it just redistributes it," he said of casino gambling in 1994. He added, "Casinos are a whole different breed. It changes communities."
It can also be unbearably fickle. Just ask Atlantic City. A report last month from PricewaterhouseCoopers said that Atlantic City's gambling revenue, which totaled $5.2 billion in 2006, had shriveled to $3.3 billion in 2011, and would shrink further, to $2.8 billion, by 2015. 
The image that casinos try to project is one of glamour, as if they were filled with James Bonds and Carrie Bradshaws. The reality is more like that of the state-run numbers game known as the lottery. Customers tend to be the working poor, praying that God has nothing else on his plate but to smile on them.
"Gambling is, and always has been, all about finding ways to get suckers to part with their money," said E. J. McMahon, a senior fellowat the Manhattan Institute. "And the poor suckers are usually poorer or, at best, subsistence."
In his speech on Wednesday, Governor Cuomo emphasized that "this is about the jobs that the casino industry generates." He did not explain why it's the state's duty to make it easier for people to throw away their hard-earned dollars on games designed to make losers of them.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Takes On Romney

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich, in a new ad, calls out Mitt Romney by name. 

 BODY:
As promised, Newt Gingrich released a new television ad Thursday calling out Mitt Romney by name - a first - and painting the former Massachusetts governor's economic plans as timid compared with his own.
The ad is not a slashing attack similar to the anti-Gingrich ads run by a "super PAC" financed by Mr. Romney's supporters. But it goes further than any previous effort by Mr. Gingrich, who has been struggling to win over New Hampshire voters, to undercut an opponent.
As quotes critical of Mr. Romney from The Wall Street Journal and Forbes appear on screen, a narrator says: "Romney's economic plan? Timid. Parts of it virtually identical to Obama's failed policy. Timid won't create jobs and timid certainly won't defeat Barack Obama.
"Newt Gingrich's bold leadership balanced the budget, reformed welfare, helped create millions of new jobs. The Gingrich jobs plan: a powerful plan for growing our economy and creating new jobs.''
The Gingrich campaign said the ad would begin running Thursday on TV stations in New Hampshire and South Carolina, but would not disclose how much was being spent. Mr. Gingrich needs to replenish his war chest after his debilitating, disappointing battle in Iowa.
Speaking in Plymouth, N.H., on Thursday morning, Mr. Gingrich echoed the ad almost verbatim: "So you've got to decide.'' he told about 100 people at an old train depot transformed into a senior center. "I will defend free enterprise. I won't be timid about it. I will be bold, just as Reagan was bold.''

HEADLINE: A Recap of the Pentagon Briefing on Defense Cuts

BYLINE: JAMES DAO


HIGHLIGHT: In an address at the Pentagon this morning, President Obama laid out his administration's new strategic vision for the nation's defense. 

 BODY:
In an address at the Pentagon this morning, President Obama laid out his administration's new strategic vision for the nation's defense, calling for a leaner military that maintains a strong presence in the Pacific, vigilance against the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, smaller conventional ground forces and higher-tech air power.
The president's strategic guidance, as it is known, will guide deep cuts in military spending, as much as $1 trillion over the next ten years. Without tipping his hand about details of impending cuts, Mr. Obama pledged that his administration would cut spending strategically and not "repeat the mistakes of the past after World War II and Vietnam, when the military was left ill-prepared for the future."
But he also asserted that cuts were necessary to allow the administration to redirect tax dollars toward domestic programs and rebuilding the economy, "which is the foundation of our strength around the world."
"Over the past ten years, since 9-11, our defense budget grew at an extraordinary pace," the president said. "Over the next 10 years, growth will slow, but the fact of the matter is, it will still grow." Mr. Obama added that even after a decade of reductions, the Pentagon budget will still be larger than it was at end of the Bush administration and larger than the combined defense spending of the next 10 largest militaries.
Without providing details, Mr. Obama made clear what many analysts had expected: that his new guidance will call for cutting the size of the Army and Marine Corps, while providing a significant military presence in the Pacific to counter China's emerging military might. He talked of eliminating "outdated air systems," suggesting delays or cuts to manned fighter jets and continuing growth of unmanned aircraft programs.
Mr. Obama also indicated that his administration would not make deep reductions to programs for veterans and military families, though he did not address whether the Pentagon would look for savings in health care and retirement programs.
At the end of the 10-minute address, the president looked about the Pentagon briefing room and noted that he was the first president to have addressed reporters from that podium, familiar to regular viewers of CSPAN. "It's a pretty nice room," he said, before turning the microphone over to the secretary of defense, Leon Panetta.

HEADLINE: Richard Cordray's Appointment: Was It Justified?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: It's difficult to treat recess appointments and Senate filibusters objectively. 

 BODY:
President Obama's recess appointment of Richard Cordray, as the head of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has resulted in a lot of partisan bickering.
The validity of recess appointments, like Senate filibusters, depend on the eye of the beholder. When your side resorts to these tactics, they seem brave; if it's the other guys, they seem dastardly.
Southern segregationists used the filibuster to try to block advances on civil rights. More recently, Democrats used it to block President George W. Bush's appointment of right-wing judges. (In my opinion, those judges were far out of the judicial mainstream. If those judges had been liberals, Republicans would have derided them as "activist.") Under President Obama, Republicans have used the filibuster to change the definition of a majority from 51 to 60 votes.

And that brings us to Mr. Cordray. In December,45 Republicans voted against ending debate on his nomination.This was not because they had substantive objections to Mr. Cordray's qualifications (I know, what's new about that?) but because they hated the very idea of the agency Mr. Obama wanted him to lead: An agency that protects consumers from the kind of financial recklessness that gave us the last recession.
So on Wednesday, the president bypassed the legislature, taking advantage of his constitutional power to make appointments without Senate approval when that body is in recess. Such executive maneuvers always upset the president's political opponents, but this time there's an added complication: It's unclear whether the Senate was truly in recess. It wasn't doing any work (again, I know, what's new about that?) but was holding pro-forma sessions.
We supported the Democrats under Mr. Bush when they held pro-forma sessions to block his recess appointments, because we believed his choices were egregiously bad. I know this looks hypocritical, but I can't bring myself to support the Republicans for doing the same, or get outraged about the president's refusal to accept the pro-forma loophole.
Here's the difference: Democrats under Mr. Bush were not trying to cripple a government agency they did not like, or pursuing an overall strategy of complete obstruction. The Senate gave Mr. Bush much of what he wanted, including some pretty bad things, like the Patriot Act, steep tax cuts (mostly for the rich) and an official whitewash of his illegal wiretapping program.
I did feel a little guilty, initially, about this contradiction. But this was pretty well wiped away by the Republicans' response.
House Speaker John Boehner called it an "extraordinary and entirely unprecedented power grab." Was he out of the country when the Bush administration spied on Americans and tortured prisoners, in significant measure to further Vice President Dick Cheney's grandiose vision of a unitary executive?
And Mr. McConnell said, "Congress has a constitutional duty to examine presidential nominees, a responsibility that serves as a check on executive power." Yes, it does. He should takethat responsibility more seriously.
As I see it, Republicans have taken political (as opposed to policy-based) opposition to a new extreme, and all Mr. Obama did was respond in kind. That's not a great way for national leaders to behave, but after three years of G.O.P. antics, he was left with no choice.

HEADLINE: Concert Revenue Was Up in 2011, Led by U2

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: The Top 100 tours in North America last year sold $2.34 billion in tickets, an increase of 6.3 percent. U2 led the way with $156 million in gross ticket sales, followed by Taylor Swift and Kenny Chesney. 

 BODY:
After one of its worst years in recent history, the concert industry rebounded slightly in 2011. But with consumers buying fewer tickets, the industry was still down from its peak in 2009.
According to Pollstar, a trade magazine that collects sales data from promoters and ticket vendors, the Top 100 tours in North America last year sold $2.34 billion in tickets. That was a 6.3 percent increase from 2010, when the lagging economy and a number of weak summer lineups caused sales to drop by as much as 15 percent, the concert industry's first decline in 15 years.
The top attractions in North America last year were U2, with $156 million in gross ticket sales; Taylor Swift, with $97.7 million; Kenny Chesney, with $84.6 million; and Lady Gaga, with $63.7 million.
The sales trend was much the same abroad. The Top 50 tours around the world made $3.07 billion in gross ticket sales, up 3.7 percent from 2010 but off 8 percent from 2009.
U2 also dominated the global chart, with a total of $231.9 million in ticket sales. But the second-biggest tour was by Take That, a reunited British boy band - whose members are now in their late 30s and early 40s. They sold $224 million in tickets though it was one of the few major tours that did not reach North America.
The growth in overall grosses in North America was largely due to increased prices. For the Top 100 tours, a total of 34.7 million tickets were sold, down 2.6 percent from the year before. After lowering prices in 2009 and 2010, promoters began to raise them again last year. For the top tours, the average ticket cost $67.22, an 8.9 percent jump over 2010 and only slightly less than the industry's historic peak of $67.33 in 2008. 
In compiling its data, Pollstar, based in Fresno, Calif., counts only the "face value" of tickets, not any of the surcharges from theaters and vendors, which can add as much as 40 percent to the customer's final cost. In most major touring deals, an artist will receive the majority of a ticket's face value, while theaters, promoters and other parties derive most of their profits from ticket surcharges, parking fees and the sale of food and drinks.

HEADLINE: Obama Makes His Presence Felt in Iowa With Online Ad

BYLINE: TANZINA VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: The ad, on the home page of The Des Moines Register, was a strategic counterpunch to the Republican candidates on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
As if competing against all the other Republican presidential candidates wasn't hard enough.
While the Republican candidates urged Iowans to support them in the caucuses on Tuesday, the Democratic president paid a very splashy visit to the state online. An advertisement for the Obama/Biden campaign took over the home page for The Des Moines Register, dwarfing the strip of images of the Republican contenders. The strip at the top of the home page read: 'See how Barack Obama kept his promises," while the left hand side of the page showcased a (literal) checklist of items Mr. Obama has completed during his tenure as president, including making health care affordable, cutting taxes and ending the Iraq War.
On the right hand side of the page, an image of the president, almost as large as many of the photographs on the news Web site sat below the campaign's logo.
A representative from the Obama campaign did not return requests for comment on the ad, but Mr. Obama did hold webcasts with supporters in Iowa on Tuesday night.
The ABC News blog, Political Punch, reportedthat Ben LaBolt, an Obama spokesman, issued this statement in an e-mail when asked about the ad:
"While the Republican candidates didn't build a lasting ground organization in Iowa to boost them in November, they did leave a legacy of proposals that Americans will overwhelmingly reject, like returning to the policies that led to the economic crisis and leaving our troops in Iraq indefinitely,"

HEADLINE: Californians Asked for $6.9 Billion in New Taxes

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown called on California voters Thursday to approve $6.9 billion in temporary new taxes, including a surcharge on big earners, as part of yet another bad-news budget proposal, this one for 2012. He warned that without those tax increases, California would be forced to impose severe cuts in public schools that could reduce the school year by three weeks.
Mr. Brown said that California was in significantly better shape than it was a year ago when he took office, pointing both to very gradual improvements in the economy and to cuts put in place in the current budget. The state still faces a shortfall of $9.2 billion next year, compared with a $26.6 billion shortfall last year. 
But his latest budget proposal made clear that California has not emerged from what has proved to be the most difficult and destructive fiscal storm in its history. Even if voters approve the taxes Mr. Brown proposed as part of the $92 billion budget for 2012 -- which is far from certain -- this budget still contains a new round of $4.2 billion in cuts, mainly to welfare and home health care. Last year, the state imposed over $5 billion in spending cuts.
''We're doing the best we can,'' Mr. Brown said at a news conference that served as a reminder of the extent to which budget problems have dominated his first year in office. ''What I've laid out is going to be very hard to digest.''
Mr. Brown said he would ask voters in November for a total of $6.9 billion in taxes, in the form of a temporary income tax surcharge on those making over $250,000 a year and a half-percent increase in the sales tax, to 7.75 percent. The taxes would expire at the end of 2016. Polls suggest that after five years of often brutal spending cuts, including $5 billion in this year's budget, voters are inclined to pass those taxes.
If not, Mr. Brown's budget includes cuts that would automatically go into effect. They would include $4.8 billion for public schools and community colleges. Higher education, already blistered by cuts over the past five years, would face another $400 million decrease. California courts would be reduced by $125 million, potentially forcing them to close three days a month, and spending would be trimmed for firefighting in public forests.
Democratic lawmakers have supported an increase in taxes but signaled that Mr. Brown would face resistance to more cuts. Darrell Steinberg, the Democratic president pro tem of the Senate, noted that some projections have noted an increase in revenues over the past month.
''If that trend continues even slightly, we may avoid the need to make the kinds of cuts the governor now suggests,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''While in the end we may have to cut more, doing it now should be a last resort.''
Mr. Brown's budget was supposed to be released next Tuesday. But the state's Department of Finance inadvertently posted the budget on its Web site on Thursday afternoon, sending Mr. Brown's office scrambling to get his budget out. ''Six days of leaked good budget news lost, lost,'' Steve Glazer, Mr. Brown's senior political adviser, posted on his Twitter account. ''Wait there is no good budget news. O.K., no biggie.''

HEADLINE: Migrants' New Paths Reshaping Latin America

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
SANTA MARIA ATZOMPA, Mexico -- When the old-timers here look around their town, all they see are new arrivals: young Mexican men working construction and driving down wages; the children of laborers flooding crowded schools; even new businesses -- stores, restaurants and strip clubs -- springing up on roads that used to be dark and quiet.
The shock might seem familiar enough in countless American towns wrestling with immigration, but this is a precolonial Mexican village outside Oaxaca City, filling up with fellow Mexicans. Still, grimaces about the influx are as common as smiles.
''Before all these people came, everything was tranquil,'' said Marcelino Juarez, 61, an artisan at the local ceramics market. ''They bring complications. They don't bring benefits.'' 
Throughout Mexico and much of Latin America, the old migratory patterns are changing. The mobile and restless are now casting themselves across a wider range of cities and countries in the region, pitting old residents against new, increasing pressure to create jobs and prompting nations to rewrite their immigration laws, sometimes to encourage the trend.
The United States is simply not the magnet it once was. Arrests at the United States' southwest border in 2011 fell to their lowest level since 1972, confirming that illegal immigration, especially from Mexico, has reached what experts now describe as either a significant pause or the end of an era.
But this is not a shift in volume as much as direction. Nearly two million more Mexicans lived away from their hometowns in 2010 than was the case a decade earlier, according to the Mexican census. Experts say departures have also held steady or increased over the past few years in Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru and other Latin American countries that have traditionally been hubs of emigration.
The migrants are just not always going where they used to.
Mexicans, for example, are increasingly avoiding the United States and the border region, as well as their own capital, and are moving toward smaller, safer cities like Merida, Oaxaca City and Queretaro. Experts say more Guatemalans are also settling in Mexico after years of passing through on the journey north.
To the south, the pull of Chile, Argentina and Brazil is also strengthening. The International Organization for Migration reports that the Bolivian population in Argentina has increased by 48 percent since 2001 (to 345,000), and that the country's Paraguayan and Peruvian populations have grown even faster.
All of this movement is reshaping the region, making it less like a compass pointing north and more like a hub with many spokes. From the papayas grown by Bolivian farmers in Argentina to the recent discovery of exploited illegal workers in Chile and conflicts over local government in southern Mexico, this intraregional migration in Latin America has become both a challenge and a promising surprise for a part of the world that has generally framed the issue in terms of how many people leave for the United States.
''It's like a river changing course,'' said Gabino Cue Monteagudo, the governor of Oaxaca. ''It's the process of development -- it's inevitable.''
For the United States, the collective shift means fewer migrants crossing the border illegally and possibly more debate over whether the expanded budgets for immigration enforcement still make sense.
But the greatest impacts are being felt in fast-growing towns like Santa Maria Atzompa, where thousands of mostly poor, rural families have chosen to seek their fortunes. In the case of this town and the surrounding area, the growth has been ''fast, barbaric and anarchic,'' said Jorge Hernandez-Diaz, a sociologist at the Autonomous University of Benito Juarez de Oaxaca.
A generation ago, he said, the road from Oaxaca City to the main plaza of Atzompa passed by fields and farmers, little more. The total population for the municipality in 1990 was 5,781. Now, this small piece of land has filled in with a labyrinth of dirt roads with dead ends, new businesses and thousands of homes in varying levels of construction and quality.
Residents say the population boom accelerated around 2006, as opportunities in the United States fell away and the dangers and cost of crossing the border became prohibitive amid drug cartel violence and stepped-up border security. Now, more than 27,000 people live in Atzompa, according to the 2010 census, and more keep coming.
Other regional poles are experiencing similar growth. Indeed, while the population of Mexico City has stabilized and immigration to the United States has declined, Mexico's coastal and exurban areas have expanded.
This is partly because of the Mexican government's efforts to decentralize development, often with incentives for international businesses. Just last month, Nissan said that it would build a factory in the central city of Aguascalientes. Here in Oaxaca State, experts say, the migration out of rural areas is also a product of land reforms in 1992 that, along with the North American Free Trade Agreement, made it harder for farmers to eke out a living and easier for them to sell land.
In South America, too, free trade agreements have contributed to more regional movement, as have steadily growing economies and new laws encouraging migration or protecting migrants' rights in Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico and Ecuador, among others.
Improvements in technology (especially access to cellphones) and infrastructure (especially better roads) have also made it easier to discover and reach jobs in new places, fueling the classic urge to improve one's lot without the obstacles and increasing the perils of the trek north.
''It's the economics, but also the culture and more information,'' said Juan Artola, South America director for the International Organization for Migration. ''Intraregional migration has grown a lot in the last decade and it's very important because of the changes it implies.''
Continuing and expanding the move toward urbanization, migrants are now making Latin America more integrated, and more metropolitan, say demographers and experts throughout the region. About 77 percent of all Mexicans now live in urban areas, up from 66 percent in 1980.
That makes it easier and cheaper to provide services, including health care, water and electricity, say government officials. For migrants, education seems to be the main draw. Schools that go beyond secondary education are rare in the mountain towns of this poor state, and many young people say they came here to study or because a relative came to study.
Gabriel Hernandez, 21, said that four of his brothers moved here to study, starting a decade ago. Some graduated, others did not, but the family opened a bodega about a year ago, selling produce from their hometown in the northern mountains.
Mr. Hernandez and many other new residents in Atzompa, who come not only from Oaxaca, but also Veracruz, Mexico City and elsewhere, say they are happy with how things have gone.
Javier Espiritu 36, Buddha-round and covered in paint at the carpentry shop he opened last month, said he had no plans to move again. Business is decent, but his reasons go beyond economics. He came here with his wife and two children, a rarity for migrants who cross into the United States illegally, separated from their families. And unlike his older brothers who made that journey a decade ago, he said he traveled home to his village six hours south of here twice a year.
''When my mom needs anything, she calls me,'' he said. ''Going to other states, or the U.S. -- it's too complicated. Can you imagine me trying to take my whole family up there?''
And yet, as many Americans in communities with immigration growth have learned, new residents mean new challenges. Poverty in Atzompa remains high. A drug rehabilitation center sits down the block from Mr. Espiritu's workshop; strip clubs promising ''bellas chicas'' are nearby, and longtime residents now complain about having too many young men with different values in their midst.
''They're not from here,'' said Mr. Juarez, the artisan, explaining the enduring divide.
Atzompa seems to have reached its breaking point. Governor Cue said that urbanization was one of his administration's main priorities, but the government is clearly struggling to keep up with population growth. Only a handful of Atzompa's roads are paved, and the main secondary school, built for about 120 students, now has nearly 700. Gym classes and sports practices take place on the dirt roads outside.
The strains have led to a deep conflict here over government and culture. Atzompa used to be simply a rural village run according to the communal ''usos y costumbres'' system of government, in which full civic rights accrue only to people who participate in government or community service and are born in the community. But as new residents began to outnumber old ones over the past few years, the recent arrivals complained that they were paying taxes and getting few or no services in return.
Last year, the community hit an impasse. When the municipal president's term ended, a state administrator took over. Now the state legislature must decide whether to keep ''usos y costumbres'' or establish the kind of party system found in most of Mexico.
Meanwhile, the economics of Atzompa have been changing, not all for the good. Construction workers say that increased competition has decreased their daily rate to $11, from $14 five years ago, while prices for empty lots have doubled to about $7,200.
Inside Mr. Espiritu's shop, these are the kinds of new developments that fill conversations and hint at problems to come. ''With all this urbanization, there is a lot of work, but what happens when it's over?'' said Sergio Morales, who had come to order a door for his house.
One optimistic possibility, he said, was that the current decline in migration to the United States would lead Mexicans to study, work and slowly build businesses here instead of fleeing for higher wages in the United States. ''Look at this guy,'' Mr. Morales said, pointing to Mr. Espiritu. ''He has been doing it for years.''
New survey research from the University of California, San Diego, suggests that more internal migrants are now moving to areas closer to home, rather than going to states closer to the border or to the capital. One in five people who left the northern village of San Miguel Tlacotepec between 2001 and 2011 stayed within Oaxaca State, according to the university survey of every town resident, up from a little over one in 10 from 1997 to 2007.
But as the new migration patterns show, movements of people -- like capital -- are fluid and can change. Many of Mexico's young people are betting that more education will land them better jobs at home over the coming years. But right now, said David Fitzgerald, a demographer at the University of California, San Diego, ''their aspirations are higher than their opportunities.''
Whether Mexico closes that gap may determine whether the Mexican economy holds onto its new graduates, or whether once again they decide to head north in droves.
''That's our great challenge,'' Governor Cue said. ''We have to find jobs for all these young people who are studying.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Shares Rally and Recover, but the Euro Falls Again

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The stock indexes in the United States ended mixed on Thursday, but banks and technology companies rallied and employment data bolstered optimism in the economy. Treasuries fell, and the euro and commodities dropped. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.3 percent to 1,281.06 after losing as much as 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.72 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,415.7. The Nasdaq finished up 21.50 to 2,669.86.
The Treasury's 10-year fell 4/32, to 100 1/32. The yield rose to 2 percent, from 1.98 percent late Wednesday.
Stocks recovered from losses after reduced earnings forecasts at Target, J. C. Penney and other companies. Banks led European stocks lower as the euro weakened to a 15-month low versus the dollar.
ADP Employer Services said companies added 325,000 workers last month, the highest in records going back to 2001.
''We're starting to see better data in the U.S. as opposed to the obsession with Europe that we've seen all of last year,'' said Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ''Now you can see that there's a separation'' he said, between the data in the United States and that in Europe, ''which is still projected to go into recession.''
Banks climbed on speculation that the Obama administration may introduce a nationwide mortgage-refinancing program.
''The recent economic data has been a kick in the face to the bears,'' Tom Mangan, at James Investment Research Inc. in Xenia, Ohio, said in a telephone interview. ''Too much bad news is already in the market in a lot of different sectors,'' he said.
Technology companies in the S.& P. 500 increased 0.5 percent. LSI, a chip maker, rallied 7.7 percent, after its rating was raised to outperform from neutral at Wedbush Securities.
Shares of Gap, Target and Kohl's slid as each reported December same-store sales that trailed analysts' estimates after mistiming promotions or running out of inventory during the holiday shopping season.
An index of commodities slumped. Natural gas led losses, sliding to a two-year low, after a government report showed a widening surplus in the United States. Oil fell for the first time in three days, slipping 1.4 percent to $101.81 a barrel, as inventories in the United States increased. Sugar tumbled 5.3 percent as weather conditions improved for Brazil's cane crop, the world's largest.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.9 percent, extending Wednesday's 0.6 percent drop. UniCredit slid 17 percent to the lowest level since 1992, plunging for a second day after announcing plans to sell shares in a rights offer at a 43 percent discount.
The dollar strengthened most major currencies, but weakened against the Taiwanese dollar.

HEADLINE: After Brief Calm, Europe Again Worries Over Debt

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Five months after the United States lost its AAA credit rating, buyers are still flocking to bonds issued by Washington. But in Europe, where the euro zone crisis and chronic economic problems may soon erode the credit scores of big countries like France, Italy and Spain, investors are far more wary.
The euro currency fell to its lowest level in more than 15 months on Thursday, below $1.28. And France had to pay slightly more than in recent auctions to find buyers for its government bonds that mature in 10 years. Those were among fresh signs that the late-December market calm that fell over Europe might not last much longer.
Next week, investors will probably force the Italian and Spanish governments to pay higher borrowing costs in exchange for billions of euros in new loans that the countries must obtain to pay down a mountain of other bonds whose payments will come due shortly. 
In trading Thursday, Italy's existing 10-year bonds crept back up above the 7 percent mark -- to 7.09 percent -- which is considered an unsustainably high borrowing rate for the Italian government. Spain's 10-year bonds were also higher Thursday, at 5.64 percent, compared with just over 5 percent at the end of December.
Stocks in Europe were also down broadly Thursday, led by bank shares.
''It's indicative of the sense that things aren't great in Europe,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''The panic that the euro was bound to collapse in the next six months has subsided, but that doesn't mean that Europe is in any way out of the line of fire.''
After nearly three years of halting political response to Europe's crisis, financial markets appear to be paying far closer attention these days to the vigorous efforts by the European Central Bank to prevent the debt problems of most euro zone governments from damaging Europe's weakened banking system. A new program of low-interest loans to commercial banks that the central bank started in December had contributed to that sense of year-end calm.
But the calm has already been shattered. Trading in shares of Italy's biggest bank, UniCredit, was suspended Thursday in Milan after the stock lost nearly one-quarter of its value. The stock plunged on concerns that UniCredit might have trouble raising the billions of euros in new capital that regulators are demanding to insulate the bank from any worsening of the European crisis.
Spanish bank stocks were also sharply lower after Luis de Guindos, the new Spanish finance minister, was quoted in a Financial Times interview Thursday saying that Spain's banks might need to set aside an additional 50 billion euros ($64 billion) to clean up their balance sheets.
And with much of Europe seen as heading into regional recession this year, it is not clear whether the European Central Bank can continue to put out all the fires that keep breaking out across the Continent.
What is more, a new crisis is emerging outside the euro zone, where the European Central Bank does not operate.
Hungary, a member of the European Union but not one of the 17 countries in the euro currency union, was teetering on the brink of collapse Wednesday amid fears that its center-right government was alienating the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission in Brussels at a time when Budapest was hoping for their help.
Beset by deteriorating finances and a confrontation between the government and the Hungarian central bank, Budapest's credit rating was recently cut to junk by two ratings companies. The prime minister, Viktor Orban, recently risked having a monetary fund rescue line cut off when he introduced laws to strip the Hungarian central bank of its political independence.
The developments have unnerved investors, who shied away from buying some of the bonds the Hungarian government offered in a sale Thursday, and forced the nation to pay a higher interest rate to compensate for the risk. Hungary sold only 35 billion forints ($140 million) of the 45 billion forints in one-year Treasury bills it offered Thursday, with the average yield rising sharply to 9.96 percent.
But the main focus of attention remains the immediate problems of the euro zone -- especially the ability of Italy, Spain and even France to continue shouldering their rising borrowing costs. When the European Central Bank last month began providing commercial banks with cheap loans for up to three years, one expected the consequence of that action to be that some of the money made available would end up being used to buy government bonds.
That bond buying is expected to help reduce the governments' borrowing costs, at least for terms shorter than three years. But investors are wary of how Europe's big economies might fare more than three years from now -- which is one reason they are forcing France, Italy, Spain and others to pay higher borrowing costs on 10-year government bonds.
With their finances squeezed, euro zone governments and banks need to raise an estimated 1.9 trillion euros ($2.43 trillion) in new financing in 2012 alone -- most of it before April. Many governments need to auction off new bonds, as France did Thursday, to make good on older bonds whose payments are soon due.
Deutsche Bank estimates that euro zone governments have redemptions and coupon payments totaling 486 billion euros in the first quarter of the year, while banks must redeem about 214 billion euros.
It could result in a costly struggle.
''You will have competition for very scarce resources between banks and states,'' said Joao Soares, a senior consultant at Bain & Company, which recently published a report on the situation. ''States have more muscle than the banks,'' he said. ''So the question is, How is this fight going to play out?''
Among the governments bracing for a tsunami of debt rollovers, Spain and Italy are the most vulnerable. In February, the Italian government needs to raise 50 billion euros to pay off expiring bonds, and an additional 80 billion euros between March and April. Spain also has a huge bill coming due.
Mario Monti, Italy's new prime minister, and Mariano Rajoy, the new prime minister in Spain, have both unleashed new austerity programs in hopes of restoring investor confidence and encouraging the European Central Bank to provide support, at least indirectly, for their bond offerings.
But Mr. Rajoy recently acknowledged that Spain's deficit was much worse than thought, while Mr. Monti faces public unrest over new measures that many fear will tip Italy into a prolonged recession.
Also competing for huge amounts of financing is the European Financial Stability Facility, the lifeline fund intended to help keep the interest rates of countries like Italy and Spain from rising to the levels that forced Greece to take a bailout.
The fund on Wednesday sold 4.5 billion euros worth of bonds that mature in three years, at a significantly higher interest rate -- about 1.77 percent -- than it had to pay in its first auction a year ago. The sale was aimed at raising new money to finance the bailouts of Ireland, Portugal and Greece.
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France is scheduled to meet Monday with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to confer on strategy for coping with the euro crisis.

HEADLINE: Marathon Is Set to Be Shown Live Nationally

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The New York City Marathon will be broadcast live and across the nation for the first time in nearly two decades, the most significant feature of a new television deal that is expected to be announced by New York Road Runners as soon as Friday. 
As part of a five-year deal, the race will be carried for three and a half hours on ESPN2, which reaches nearly every household with cable or satellite television, and for five hours on WABC, ABC's affiliate in the New York area. WABC will also broadcast the marathon's opening ceremony and a half-hour preview show the night before the race, which will be held Nov. 4, and ABC will televise a highlight show a few hours after the race.
The NYC Half Marathon in March and the Fifth Avenue Mile may also be televised.
The Road Runners will receive guaranteed payments from the networks and share any revenue generated by the broadcasts.
The race was last broadcast live and nationally in 1993, the last year ABC televised the event. Since then, the race has been broadcast live in the New York metropolitan area by WPIX and, more recently, by WNBC, an affiliate of NBC, which also produced a highlight show that was shown on tape delay. Universal Sports also showed the race to some cable households.
The Road Runners hope that showing the event live across the country on ESPN will attract more runners and sponsors to the club and the marathon, which is already the largest in the country. The race, which had more than 47,000 entrants last year, is expected to expand to about 55,000 runners in coming years.
The NYC Half is expected to accept 15,000 runners this year, 50 percent more than last year.
''The drama of the marathon plays out best live, and it's seen around the world and in the city, so there was a gap because it wasn't seen nationally,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of the Road Runners. ''It's not just the world's race, but America's race.''
The marathon is by far the Road Runners' biggest moneymaker and an economic engine for the city. About half the entrants come from overseas; many bring their families and friends, who spend tens of thousands of dollars in hotels, restaurants and shops.
As the race has grown in size, it has also become more expensive to run. This year, entrance fees have increased about $60, largely because the New York Police Department has started to charge athletic event organizers to recoup its costs for providing traffic control and security.
In addition to an $11 application fee, members of the Road Runners must pay $216 to enter the race, up from $156 last year. International applicants will pay $347 compared with $281 last year.

HEADLINE: New Charges Are Possible In an Insider Trading Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors said Thursday that they were likely to file a new indictment against Rajat K. Gupta, possibly adding new criminal charges in the insider trading case against the former head of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. 
It was ''more likely than not there will be a superseding indictment'' filed in the case by the end of January, Richard C. Tarlowe, an assistant United States attorney, said during a pretrial hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Gupta, who sat on the boards of Procter & Gamble and Goldman Sachs, is accused of divulging confidential information about those companies to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, the convicted former hedge fund manager now serving an 11-year prison term.
The 63-year-old Mr. Gupta is fighting charges of securities fraud and conspiracy and preparing for an April 9 trial. On Thursday, he appeared in court, flanked by a team of five lawyers.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff listened Thursday as the two sides sparred over a range of issues. Earlier this week, Mr. Gupta's lawyers filed legal papers seeking to dismiss certain counts against their client, suppress the use of wiretap evidence and force the government to clarify its indictment.
During the two-hour hearing, Mr. Gupta's primary lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, pressed the government to clarify language in its indictment that suggested his client had leaked information about companies other than Procter and Goldman to Mr. Rajaratnam, the former head of the Galleon Group.
Mr. Tarlowe said the other company was J.M. Smucker, which is known for its jellies and jams.
In June 2008, Smucker said it was acquiring Folgers Coffee from Procter & Gamble for about $3 billion. The government said previously in its indictment that the day before this announcement, Mr. Rajaratnam told a colleague that he had learned from a director of Procter & Gamble that Smucker was buying Folgers.
On the wiretap issue, Judge Rakoff indicated that chances were slim that he would bar the government from playing secretly recorded phone conversations at Mr. Gupta's trial. His lawyers are arguing that the law does not permit federal authorities to use wiretaps in insider trading cases.
Judge Rakoff cited the Rajaratnam trial, in which Judge Richard J. Holwell allowed the government to use wiretap evidence.
''Looking at it realistically, if I were the defense, I would not be optimistic on this particular motion,'' Judge Rakoff said.
Though Procter was a focus of Thursday's hearing, the trial is also expected to center on Goldman, where Mr. Gupta served as a director for four years.
The government has accused Mr. Gupta of leaking the bank's earnings and other information to Mr. Rajaratnam, including Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman during the financial crisis.
Goldman executives could be called to testify, including the firm's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who testified in the Rajaratnam case.
The government has its own Goldman connection in the Gupta trial. Mr. Tarlowe, one of the two prosecutors, is a former investment banker at Goldman.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Consumer Chief Promises Strong Agenda

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The new director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlined a vigorous oversight and enforcement agenda on Thursday, saying that financial companies that take unfair advantage of consumers would face ''real consequences.''
The director, Richard Cordray, who was appointed to the post on Wednesday by President Obama, encouraged consumers to contact the agency through its Web site with complaints about banks, payday lenders and other financial institutions that they think have sold deceptive products or engaged in abusive behavior.
''The consumer bureau will make clear that there are real consequences to breaking the law,'' Mr. Cordray, who had been in charge of enforcement at the agency, said in remarks prepared for a speech at the Brookings Institution. 
''We have given informants and whistle-blowers direct access to us,'' he said. ''We took over a number of investigations from other agencies in July, and we are pursuing some investigations jointly with them. We have also started our own investigations. Some may be resolved through cooperative efforts to correct problems. Others may require enforcement actions to stop illegal behavior.''
Asked whether he would hesitate to use any of the bureau's new rule making or enforcement powers given that his appointment, which was made while lawmakers were in recess, could draw a legal challenge, Mr. Cordray said no.
''The appointment is valid,'' he said. ''I'm now director of the bureau.'' Mr. Cordray was nominated by the president last year, but Senate Republicans blocked a floor vote on his nomination. Opponents in Congress and in banking and business have said that the agency has too much power and autonomy and lacks adequate oversight.
Mr. Cordray said he did not take the Congressional opposition personally. ''They, after all, represent the same people that we are serving,'' Mr. Cordray said. ''We really have the same interests, I believe, at heart.'' Nor, he said, did he question the motives of critics. He said he intended to work with lawmakers of both parties.
The agency's most immediate focus will be on so-called nonbank financial companies -- money transfer agencies, credit bureaus and private mortgage lenders, for example -- which have fallen outside the authority of most regulators, Mr. Cordray said.
Although the agency was given authority over those types of companies in the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul legislation passed after the financial crisis, those powers by law could not take effect without a director.
''Today, we are launching the bureau's program for supervising nonbanks,'' Mr. Cordray said. ''Many provide valuable services to customers who lack access to other forms of credit. And they are big markets. Nearly 20 million American households use payday lenders and pay roughly $7.4 billion in fees every year.
''Many subprime loans during the housing bubble were made by nonbank mortgage brokers,'' he added. ''Since most of these businesses are not used to any federal oversight, our new supervision program may be a challenge for them. But we must establish clear standards of conduct so that all financial providers play by the rules.''
Mr. Cordray asked consumers to contact the agency directly through its Web site, www.consumerfinance.gov.
''Our team is taking complaints about credit cards and mortgages, with other products to be added as we move forward,'' he said.
The public appearance by Mr. Cordray, who has kept a low profile since being nominated to the post, was arranged quickly after the announcement on Wednesday of his appointment, which was made without Senate approval under the constitutional provision for making appointments when lawmakers are in recess.
Mr. Cordray's remarks seemed intended to show that the agency would move promptly and aggressively in the hope that getting public support could quell some criticism from Congress.
Several members of Congress vowed on Wednesday to try to overturn the appointment. One House subcommittee summoned Mr. Cordray to a hearing on Capitol Hill to discuss his agency and how he intended to manage it.

HEADLINE: Is It a Conflict of Interest? Yes, But It's Legal

BYLINE: By FREDRIC N. TULSKY and JOHN SULLIVAN; Kristen McQueary contributed reporting.. 
Fredric N. Tulsky and John Sullivan direct Medill Watchdog, an initiative at the journalism school of Northwestern University to hold public officials accountable through in-depth student and faculty reporting.

 BODY:
In most states and municipalities, government officials who vote to spend taxpayer dollars on proposals that also put money in their own pockets as lobbyists could be accused of illegal conflicts of interest. Not in Illinois.
Thanks to state and local ethics laws riddled with loopholes, it was legal for Jack Dorgan, a village trustee in Rosemont, to vote last year to award a lucrative contract to a client of his Springfield lobbying firm.
Mr. Dorgan is not alone in his dual roles. Elected officials at every level in Illinois -- from the village board to the state legislature -- can use their positions to benefit paying clients or even family members, according to an examination of thousands of documents by Medill Watchdog, a journalism program at Northwestern University.
Medill reviewed statements of economic interest filed by officials in Cook County, registrations by lobbyists, legislation, ordinances and public actions. According to the records, 14 elected officials in Cook County over the past three years were registered as lobbyists for an array of private clients who did business at the state, county or local levels. 
When elected officials double as lobbyists it can create confusion for lawmakers, said State Representative Fred Crespo, Democrat of Hoffman Estates. ''When I see them at a hearing in the Capitol, I often can't tell if they're here for their constituents or for their paying clients,'' he said.
No laws are being broken; officials are permitted to work as lobbyists, and also to vote and otherwise act on matters that directly benefit their lobbying clients.
Most other states prohibit such conflicts. While laws vary widely, some states, like Indiana, forbid lawmakers from lobbying at all, a Medill survey of 50 states found. Many others, like New York and California, bar officials from voting or acting on any matter that would help their clients.
Illinois lawmakers do not work full time, which some critics say creates an incentive to find additional sources of income. Most other states with large populations established full-time legislatures years ago.
''Permitting officials to hold outside jobs is a really bad idea,'' said Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor and former White House ethics counsel. ''People think it's cheaper to have part-time officials, but it costs people a lot of money in other ways.''
Illinois law bans state legislators from lobbying their colleagues and other state officials. But the same laws do not prevent them from acting as lobbyists at the local level, where each community or local government body sets its own rules.
''We let officials do things that other cities and towns wouldn't,'' said David Orr, the Cook County clerk. The current law, he said, ''just doesn't cut it.''
In Rosemont in the past year, Mr. Dorgan, a prominent Republican, played a key role as village trustee in awarding a $2.4 million contract to his lobbying client, Christopher B. Burke Engineering.
Records show that Burke Engineering paid Mr. Dorgan at least $1,200 while he was lobbying the Illinois Toll Highway Authority as the authority was working with the village to jointly build a $25 million off-ramp. Burke Engineering had hired Dorgan-McPike & Associates, Mr. Dorgan's Springfield lobbying firm, to represent it before the tollway and other state agencies, gaining an advocate with both state influence and a vote on the village board.
In November 2010, Mr. Dorgan's multiple roles overlapped. He accompanied his lobbying client, Christopher B. Burke, to a meeting with the Tollway Authority -- the target of his lobbying activities -- while also representing the village, records show. The Rosemont mayor and attorney were also at the meeting.
When the Tollway Authority completed its draft agreement with Rosemont six months later, Burke Engineering was designated as the construction engineer, at the village's request, tollway officials said.
The agreement refers to Burke Engineering as ''Village Engineer of the Village.'' But Peter Coblentz, Rosemont's village attorney, said that the village's relationship with Mr. Burke's firm is informal. ''Burke is just who the village hires whenever it has work,'' Mr. Coblentz said. ''We have used them for many, many years.''
At the Rosemont village board meeting five days later, Mr. Dorgan made a motion to award the no-bid contract to Mr. Burke. The $2.4 million motion passed unanimously.
Mr. Dorgan said he sees no problem with his dual roles. ''Obviously, if there was a conflict, I wouldn't do it,'' he said. He said he disclosed his clients as required under state law and had discussed it with Mr. Coblentz.
A spokesman for Mr. Burke said the lobbying relationship with Mr. Dorgan is ''completely transparent.''
Mr. Dorgan has long been a prominent elected official in Illinois. He lobbies on behalf of the Illinois Asphalt Pavement Association, headed by William F. Cellini, who was recently convicted of conspiracy to commit extortion.
Mr. Dorgan is also a member of the Republican Party State Central Committee.
''I'm held to a much higher standard,'' he said. ''If you get into trouble with the I.R.S., you get a fine. If I make the same mistake, I'd go to prison. It's a whole different ballgame.''
Many ethics experts say public officials should not be allowed to work as lobbyists. ''It ought to be prohibited,'' said Patricia E. Salkin, director of the Government Law Center at Albany Law School in New York. ''The roles are too intertwined.''
Representative Crespo introduced legislation a year ago to prohibit Illinois officials from lobbying, but it died in the rules committee.
Illinois statutes give state officials wide latitude to lobby. The state ethics law, passed in 1967, directs lawmakers who confront potential conflicts to ''consider the possibility of eliminating the conflict.'' If a conflict is unavoidable, the lawmaker should ''consider the possibility of abstaining.''
If a lawmaker chooses not to abstain, there is no penalty.
The legislative inspector general, Thomas J. Homer, said he has little recourse. ''It looks bad, but there isn't anything I can do because the law allows it,'' he said.
Lawmakers like State Representative Dan Burke, Democrat of Chicago, have shown themselves adept at working within the rules that govern lobbying by public officials. Mr. Burke is the brother of Ed Burke, a powerful Chicago alderman (he is not related to Christopher B. Burke, the engineer).
A lobby report filed with the city shows Dan Burke was paid $5,000 to lobby City Hall for the Chicago Roofing Contractors Association, the local wing of the industry group that represents roofing contractors throughout the state.
In February 2005, Mr. Burke co-sponsored a bill backed by the association of state roofing contractors that sought to protect its member companies from competition. Mr. Burke said his sponsorship was not a conflict of interest, even though the measure, which passed, benefited his client.
Speaking of the line separating his city lobbying activities and his state legislative actions, Mr. Burke said: ''It's murky, of course, but I was careful not to blend the roles.''

HEADLINE: Seeing a Future in Flatware

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
ONEIDA, N.Y. - Some local residents, when eating out, instinctively turn their utensils upside-down to look for a telltale sign: the word ''Oneida,'' stamped into the back of the handle.
The ''Oneida flip,'' as it's called, is a ritual carried over from an era when Oneida Ltd., the company headquartered here, dominated the global market in flatware, setting tables all over the world with its stainless steel forks, spoons and knives. In recent years, the ritual became a painful reminder of the company's troubles.
Once an economic engine of upstate New York and one of the region's largest employers, Oneida no longer makes flatware in the area. Like so many industrial players across the country, the company has struggled to compete with a flood of low-cost foreign manufacturers. As sales evaporated, factories were shut down. Retail stores were closed. And jobs were shipped overseas.
But a funny thing happened on the way to Oneida's demise. Wall Street - an industry that has been accused of destroying jobs and stripping businesses for parts - decided the company had long-term potential. 
In November, Monomoy Capital Partners, a private equity firm, bought Oneida from a group of hedge funds. The new owner wants to expand, rather than decimate its operations. It is a simple but lofty goal for a company that has been slowly recovering since its bankruptcy in 2006.
''This is a meaningful investment for us,'' said Daniel Collin, the Monomoy partner who led the deal to acquire Oneida. ''After years of being undercapitalized, Oneida finally has a partner willing to invest in its future.''
How a 132-year-old flatware company ended up in the hands of a Manhattan private equity firm illustrates the woes of American manufacturing - and possibly, a way to improve its fortunes.
Last year, buyout shops bought 361 industrial companies, with many deals under $150 million, like the Oneida deal, according to Preqin, a research firm.
Monomoy, which has just 20 employees and manages a relatively small $700 million in assets, has specialized in acquiring small- to medium-size businesses that might seem antiquated to other buyout firms. Among the companies in its portfolio are Steel Parts Manufacturing, which produces clutch plates used in automatic transmission cars, and Awrey Bakeries, a 102-year-old company that makes frozen brownies, cakes and other desserts.
''A lot of times, these boring, stodgy businesses can generate consistent cash flow, and that's important to a private equity buyer,'' said Eric Hollowaty, an equity research analyst with Stephens Inc. ''I don't think many private equity firms are going to be motivated by saving an age-old brand if they don't think they can make a handsome return.''
While Oneida's flatware business may be traditional, its history is anything but. The company traces its roots to the Oneida Community, a utopian commune started in 1848 by an eclectic religious leader named John Humphrey Noyes. In a sprawling mansion on Kenwood Avenue, Mr. Noyes and his followers, known as Perfectionists, practiced a radical lifestyle that involved communal child-rearing, a free-love arrangement known as ''complex marriage'' and a rule, called ''coitus reservatus,'' that prohibited men from ejaculating during sex.
While the group disbanded in 1880, its entrepreneurial spirit lived on in Oneida Ltd., which grew from a manufacturing corporation formed by ex-Community members into a global behemoth. Its former ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange, OCQ, stood for ''Oneida Community Quality.''
A third of Oneida's roughly 450 employees still work at the company's headquarters, a four-story granite building that stands across the street from the original Oneida Community house and doubles as a kind of living museum. Oneida advertisements from Life magazine and the Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s, some featuring then-spokesman Bob Hope, dot the walls of the office. A row of unused Kodak Carousels sits on a shelf outside the company's in-house darkroom, long ago abandoned for a digital photography studio. Down the hall, a small group of model-makers hammers out prototypes by hand.
''We still do it the old-fashioned way,'' said Paul E. Gebhardt, Oneida's senior vice president of design, who is also the great-great-grandson of John Humphrey Noyes, the founder of the Oneida Community.
Oneida's financial problems were decidedly modern, and echoed the issues faced by companies in cities like Detroit and Pittsburgh. Starting in the 1990s, the company began to feel the heat of foreign competitors, who could produce utensils for a fraction of the price of American manufacturers. The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, further hurt business, after the metal forks and knives Oneida supplied to airlines were banned on flights.
As its sales fell, Oneida hemorrhaged money - more than $157 million between January 2003 and October 2005 - and was forced to stop making flatware and close several facilities in Oneida and the surrounding cities, where the company had employed about 2,500 people at its peak. By 2006, the situation at the company, which in better times had been well-off enough to sponsor Little League teams, the golf course and other local activities, had become so dire that filing for Chapter 11 was the only option.
''Oneida tried to hang onto its manufacturing facilities as long as it could,'' said James E. Joseph, Oneida's outgoing chief executive, who is stepping down this year as part of the Monomoy transition. ''From a pure business standpoint, you could argue we hung on too long.''
A few months later, Oneida exited from bankruptcy, under the control of a group of hedge funds. Led by Monarch Alternative Capital, the firms moved swiftly - if painfully - to make the company profitable. They moved a distribution center to Savannah, Ga., to save on freight costs, closed stores and struck an agreement that allowed Robinson Home Products to distribute flatware and dinnerware under Oneida's name. The hedge funds even debated moving Oneida's headquarters closer to New York City to give it a better shot at attracting top talent, but eventually decided against it, according to several people involved in the discussions.
Those decisions stabilized Oneida. In five years, the firms reduced the company's debt load to around $60 million from approximately $150 million. The company now turns a small annual profit of around $15 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to several people with knowledge of the company's finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the numbers are private. Its North American flatware business gained 3 percentage points of market share last year, according to Mr. Joseph, and still has a valuable brand name.
With the finances on the upswing, Monomoy saw an opportunity in Oneida. The private equity firm owns Anchor Hocking, a glassware maker, and Monomoy figured it could use its foothold in the food service industry to bolster Oneida's sales to restaurants and hotels. In November, Monomoy paid around $100 million for Oneida, according to several people with knowledge of the deal terms, which were not disclosed.
Several weeks after the deal with Monomoy was announced, Mr. Joseph took to the auditorium stage in Oneida's headquarters to reassure his employees that they were in good hands. Flanked by Mr. Collin and his Monomoy team, Mr. Joseph announced that he was stepping down and taking a job at nearby Le Moyne College, although he would keep a seat on the company's board and remain involved in certain company projects. According to Mr. Joseph, Monomoy is not a ''strip and flip'' firm that will shrink Oneida down to its smallest possible size for a quick, profitable sale.
''They're not Gordon Gekko,'' he said of the firm. ''It's almost like they got together and said, 'There's a different way to do this.' ''
Monomoy has already started its efforts to bolster Oneida's bottom line. It recently sent two Oneida executives to its management boot camp, a two-week intensive course that was inspired by Toyota's ''lean manufacturing'' approach. It plans to name a new chief executive shortly and has plans to campaign for business in South Korea and Brazil.
Mr. Collin, a fast-talking Wall Street deal-maker who uses ''leverage'' as a verb, is both optimistic and reasonable about Oneida's expectations. While reopening the local plant in nearby Sherrill is a long shot, he hopes to strengthen Oneida so that it can be sold or taken public again within five years.
''Are they going to be creating 5,000 manufacturing jobs in the U.S.? Probably not,'' he said. ''But can they grow and generate profits? Sure.''
It may be too late to bring industrial revival to the Oneida region, where the largest employer is now an American Indian casino several miles down the road. And some of the psychological damage of Oneida Ltd.'s decline has already been done.
''Oneida silver used to pay for the electricity, the library, everything,'' said Leo Matzke, who was Oneida's mayor until this month. ''We just don't talk about it like we used to.''
But even if an Oneida recovery would be mostly symbolic in the region, the residents still dream. At the Marble Hill Inn, a watering hole near Oneida's headquarters, Pamela Gilmore, who has lived in Sherrill, nicknamed ''Silver City,'' for 36 years, reminisced about the days when the company's factory hummed with life.
''We're all proud of Oneida,'' she said. ''We'd love for it to come back.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Previews and Openings
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Controversy swirled around this revival of the 1935 American folk opera when Stephen Sondheim very publicly took issue with comments made by the director, Diane Paulus, and the adapter, Suzan-Lori Parks, concerning their views on the original book by DuBose Heyward. Whether or not that scolding was the decisive factor, the creative team reportedly has now opted for a less radical overhaul than originally planned. Either way, with Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and David Alan Grier in the lead roles, this is one of the most eagerly anticipated musical events of the Broadway season. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney) 
'How the World Began' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Heidi Schreck (''Circle Mirror Transformation'') stars in Catherine Trieschmann's play about a high school biology teacher who leaves New York for rural Kansas, where an offhand remark about the origins of the universe whips up a firestorm. Don't they always? Daniella Topol directs this production from the Women's Project, in association with South Coast Rep. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'It's Always Right Now, Until It's Later' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Following his success at St. Ann's Warehouse last January with ''The Interminable Suicide of Gregory Church,'' the gifted British monologuist Daniel Kitson brings another example of his distinctive storytelling. ''This is a show about every single one of us,'' Mr. Kitson said, describing the ambitious piece. ''The past in our pockets, the future in our hearts, and us, ourselves, very much stuck, trapped forever in the tiny eternal moment between the two.'' St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'Leo' (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 15) Mixing acrobatics, physical theater, dance, stage design and technology, this genre-defying show places its title character in an unexpected environment in which he is forced to defy the laws of gravity. Created by the Berlin-based company Circle of Eleven, the production comes to New York bolstered by several awards from the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe festival. Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Mission Drift' (opens on Sunday) One of the highlights of COIL, the seventh annual contemporary performance festival running through Jan. 29 at various locations, is this unconventional musical exploring economic collapse and hope. Developed by the New York theater troupe the TEAM, the show makes its American premiere following an acclaimed European tour. Set to original music by Heather Christian, this epic journey combines atomic blasts, Elvis gyrations and lizard ballet, interweaving the story of two immortal Dutch teenagers who travel to modern-day Las Vegas from 1624 Amsterdam with the plight of a cocktail waitress laid off because of the financial crisis. Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org. (Rooney)
'Outside People' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Naked Angels and the Vineyard join forces on Zayd Dohrn's dark comedy, which explores culture-clash terrain similar to that in ''Chinglish,'' playing uptown. Directed by Evan Cabnet, the new play is set in contemporary Beijing, where a young American man falls for a Chinese woman, forcing him to consider his complex role in a foreign environment and the social, political and economic forces that shape their relationship. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Philanderer' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 22) Directing his sixth production for the Pearl Theater Company, Gus Kaikkonen stages George Bernard Shaw's rarely produced social satire, which riffs playfully on intellectual freedom and sexual politics while taking shots at the Ibsenite dramatic model. Written in 1893, it ran afoul of British censorship laws and was not presented publicly until 12 years later. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Rooney)
'Richard III' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Jan. 18) The three-year trans-Atlantic classical theater initiative, the Bridge Project, concludes on a note of juicy villainy, with Kevin Spacey tackling the role of the ''rudely stamped'' monarch in this staging by Sam Mendes of Shakespeare's final chapter in the Wars of the Roses. Also among the ensemble are Maureen Anderman, Haydn Gwynne and Gemma Jones. Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Rooney)
'The Road to Mecca' (in previews; opens on Jan. 17) Before Signature Theater Company's Athol Fugard season, beginning in February, Roundabout kicks off the South African dramatist's 80th birthday celebration with this Broadway premiere. The 1984 play about artistic freedom centers on a reclusive elderly widow whose ability to continue living independently and creating her iconoclastic sculptures is called into question by a pastor but defended by an admiring young schoolteacher. Gordon Edelstein's production stars Rosemary Harris, Carla Gugino and, in a role once played by Mr. Fugard, Jim Dale. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Rooney)
'Wit' (in previews; opens on Jan. 26) Cynthia Nixon returns to Manhattan Theater Club, where her performance in ''Rabbit Hole'' earned her a Tony Award in 2006. She stars in the Broadway premiere of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1995 drama about a poetry professor undergoing experimental treatment for ovarian cancer as she contemplates the irony of a life devoted to scholarship ultimately becoming fodder for someone else's research. Lynne Meadow directs. Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
Broadway
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Chinglish' David Henry Hwang's sporadically funny comedy about a bewildered American businessman seeking his fortune in capitalist China is laid out with the frame-by-frame exactness of a comic strip. That means this bilingual production is easy to follow but hard to embrace with enthusiasm. Leigh Silverman directs (2:00). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'An Evening With Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin' The stars of the original Broadway production of ''Evita'' are reunited on the concert stage for an eclectic evening of (mostly) love songs from the musical theater. Both are in fine vocal form, and the show is a must-have ticket for ardent fans, but the repertory is sometimes a fine fit (Stephen Sondheim) and sometimes ill-chosen (Rodgers and Hammerstein) (2:00). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
- 'Follies' The Kennedy Center's revival of James Goldman and Stephen Sondheim's musical about a reunion of Ziegfeld-style performers looks back as much in anger as in fondness, and that's what makes it so vibrant. Eric Schaeffer directs an electric cast led by Bernadette Peters, Jan Maxwell, Danny Burstein and Ron Raines (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Darren Criss is now playing the amoral hero of Frank Loesser's 1961 musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Mountaintop' Katori Hall's surprisingly thin drama, which won the 2010 Olivier Award, depicts the last night in the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Samuel L. Jackson) and his encounter with a feisty motel maid (Angela Bassett). Perhaps best regarded as a comfort play, a nursery-room fable for grownups (1:40). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'On a Clear Day You Can See Forever' This grim, extensively reworked revival of the Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner musical from 1965 appears to be suffering from a severe case of clinical depression. Harry Connick Jr. plays a psychiatrist in mourning. Michael Mayer directs Peter Parnell's revamped book (2:30). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties: Stockard Channing, Rachel Griffiths, Stacy Keach, Judith Light and, through Sunday, Thomas Sadoski; Justin Kirk takes the role on Tuesday (2:15). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Relatively Speaking' This slight but mostly enjoyable trio of short plays by Ethan Coen, Elaine May and Woody Allen won't do much to burnish their established reputations, but the show is chock full of nifty shtick. Marlo Thomas delights as a pampered princess with a dead husband in Ms. May's contribution (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Brantley)
'Stick Fly' Lydia R. Diamond's overstuffed but lively comedy-drama feels like a Tyler Perry melodrama (sans Madea) as revised by an academic specializing in issues of class in African-American culture. Condola Rashad gives the standout performance in the director Kenny Leon's uneven production, playing a young woman who embodies the problems of racial and class divisions that the other characters theorize about (2:15). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
- 'The Canterbury Tales Remixed' In his delightful one-man show, Baba Brinkman, a medieval literature scholar, has adapted Chaucer's 14th-century masterpiece into a hip-hop show. The conceit may sound cheesy, but Mr. Brinkman makes a surprisingly persuasive case that the two art forms are thematically (and in some cases, rhetorically) similar. Both feature thugs, dangerously beautiful women, death-defying daredevils and Creflo Dollar-esque men selling salvation. Drawing on analogies to pop anthems and celebrities like Scarlett Johansson and Herman Cain, Mr. Brinkman demonstrates just how relevant these stories are (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'Close Up Space' David Hyde Pierce plays a book editor estranged from his daughter in Molly Smith Metzler's listless, contrived comedy, which also features Michael Chernus as a quirky slacker and Rosie Perez as a preening novelist (1:20). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
- 'Cymbeline' The Fiasco Theater's charming production brings lucidity, credibility and gentle magic to Shakespeare's bulky, convoluted tale of star-crossed lovers and schemers in old Britannia, with a multifarious cast of six on a naked stage. Directed by Noah Brody and Ben Steinfeld (2:40). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Dancing at Lughnasa' Charlotte Moore's production falls a little short on atmosphere but works where it counts most, in the spirited performances of the five women playing the poor, unmarriageable Mundy sisters in the fictional Donegal town of Ballybeg in late summer 1936. Two decades after it was first seen, this transporting Tony-winning memory play by the Irish dramatist Brian Friel has lost none of its humanity or delicacy (2:05). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Once' This gently appealing, imaginatively staged new musical about funky young composers in love doesn't always sustain the understated charm of the 2006 cult movie that inspired it. But it often finds depth in its songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova). John Tiffany directs a cast led by Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org. (Brantley)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home.

'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs.

'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish.

Last Chance
'Accidentally, Like a Martyr' (closes on Saturday) Bars can be comforting refuges. They can also be lonely as hell.

Paradise Factory, 64 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, theatermania.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Big Apple Circus: Dream Big' (closes on Friday) This one-ring circus may not offer big cats, but it does have large rodents -- a capybara and an African crested porcupine, no less -- in its new show. Fortunately, the circus has lost none of its intimacy this season, whose highlights include terrific trapeze and acrobatics, bravura magic and the farewell antics of Barry Lubin, doing his final turn as the clown known as Grandma (2:15).

'Billy Elliot the Musical' (closes on Sunday) Based on the 2000 film directed by Stephen Daldry, this dance-friendly musical -- directed by Mr. Daldry, with music by Elton John and lyrics and book by Lee Hall -- opened on Broadway in 2008, with the title English lad finding his balletic talents amid hard times in the coal industry (2:50). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David DeWitt)
- 'Blood and Gifts' (closes on Sunday) J. T. Rogers's drama gives a remarkably lucid and compelling account of how the American and British view of Afghanistan as a vital front in the cold war shaped the calamitous recent history of the country.

Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
- 'The Cherry Orchard' (closes on Sunday) Andrei Belgrader's heartbreakingly funny production of Chekhov's play, which features an excellent Dianne Wiest and John Turturro, finds the tragicomic rhythms in misfired words and gestures. A delicate slapstick ballet that illuminates Chekhov's singular vision of why people fail to connect (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
'Him' (closes this Friday) The merits of this bonbon (written and directed by the onetime glittering New York talent manager and social operator Clifford Streit) about a gay couple almost undone by the Hollywood closet are so abundant that it's painful when you realize the malicious disdain the play has for women (1:10). Cherry Lane Studio Theater, 38 Commerce Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, cherrylanetheatre.org. (Andy Webster)
- 'Lysistrata Jones' (closes on Sunday) Douglas Carter Beane and Lewis Flinn's endearingly escapist show -- about sex, apathy and basketball on a college campus -- brings a touch of summer sun and silliness to what has been a wintry season for musicals.

(Brantley)
'Voca People' (closes on Sunday) This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, despite some overamplification. But most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential. The show is set to open anew at another stage in February (1:30). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)

HEADLINE: Making More Things In the U.S.A.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
For the first time in many years, manufacturing stands out as an area of strength in the American economy.
When the Labor Department reports December employment numbers on Friday, it is expected that manufacturing companies will have added jobs in two consecutive years. Until last year, there had not been a single year when manufacturing employment rose since 1997.
And this week the Institute for Supply Management, which has been surveying American manufacturers since 1948, reported that its employment index for December was 55.1, the highest reading since June. Any number above 50 indicates that more companies say they are hiring than say they are reducing employment. 
There were new signs Thursday that the overall jobs climate was improving, as the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week and a payroll company's report showed strong growth in private-sector jobs in December.
As stores have filled with inexpensive imports from China and other Asian countries, the perception has risen that the United States no longer makes much of anything. Certainly there has been a long decline in manufacturing employment, which peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million workers. Now even with hiring over the last two years, the figure is 11.8 million, a decline of 40 percent from the high.
But those numbers obscure the fact that the United States remains a manufacturing power, albeit one that has been forced to specialize in higher-value items because its labor costs are far above those in Asia. The value of American manufactured exports over a 12-month period peaked at $1.095 trillion in the summer of 2008, just before the credit crisis caused world trade volumes to plunge. At the low, the 12-month figure fell below $800 billion, but it has since climbed back to $1.074 trillion. Those figures are not adjusted for inflation.
In total exports, including manufactured goods as well as other commodities like agricultural products, the United States ranked second in the world in 2010, behind China but just ahead of Germany. For the first 10 months of 2011, Germany is slightly ahead of the United States.
The United States is particularly strong in machinery, chemicals and transportation equipment, which together make up nearly half of the exports. Exports of computers and electronic products are growing, but are well below their precrisis levels. Production of cheaper computers and parts shifted to Asia long ago.
Just how long the rise in manufactured exports can last depends, in part, on the health of other economies. The euro zone no longer takes as large a share of American exports as it once did, but it is still a major customer. A recession there this year, as has been widely forecast, would hurt all major exporters, including the United States.
Similarly, the strong exports provide a stark reminder of how vulnerable this country could be to protectionist trade wars. The Doha round of world trade talks, which was supposed to result in the lowering of more trade barriers, has stalled. And last month China imposed punitive duties on imports of American large cars and sport utility vehicles, which total about $4 billion a year.
That move was seen as retaliation for United States requests that the World Trade Organization rule that Chinese subsidies for its solar and poultry industries violated international law. The Chinese denounced those requests as protectionist.
The American government denies that, of course. ''Part of a foundation of a rules-based system is dispute settlement,'' said Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, in an interview with Reuters after the Chinese announced the new tariffs. ''That's what we think is so important about the W.T.O. How China reacts to that is up to China. But I just cannot buy into the argument that our standing and protecting the rights of our exporters and workers is somehow igniting a trade war or being protectionist.''
Since employment in the United States hit its recent low, in February 2010, the economy has added 2.4 million jobs through November, of which 302,000 were in manufacturing. With government payrolls shrinking, and financial services jobs also fewer, manufacturing employment has played an important role in keeping the economy growing. It also is helping that construction employment appears to have hit bottom. In the first 11 months of 2011, it is up a small amount.
To be sure, the gains in manufacturing employment and exports have come after sharp declines during the recession and credit crisis. There are still 6 percent fewer manufacturing jobs than there were when President Obama took office at the beginning of 2009, and it seems very unlikely that he will be the first president since Bill Clinton, in his first term, to preside over growing manufacturing employment during a four-year term.
During George W. Bush's two terms, the number of manufacturing jobs fell by 17 percent in the first four years and by 12 percent in the following four years. The number declined by 1 percent in Mr. Clinton's second term.
The Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturers has shown more companies planning to hire than to fire in every month since October 2009. That string of 27 months is the longest such string since 1972, but remains well behind the longest one, 36 months, which ended in December 1966.
Over all, that survey has indicated that a plurality of companies has believed business is getting better for 29 consecutive months, and December's reading of 53.9 was the strongest since June.
This summer, one widely watched part of the Institute for Supply Management survey showed that a small plurality of companies reported new orders were falling, a fact that helped to stimulate talk of a double-dip recession. But the latest reading, of 57.6, indicates widespread strength in new orders.
In an economy where there is widespread concern over consumer spending, and in which government spending and payrolls are under heavy pressure, manufacturing has become a bright spot. It is not enough to produce a strong rebound, and it remains vulnerable to weakness overseas. But it has helped to keep a weak economic recovery from turning into a new recession.

HEADLINE: Still Hung Over From the '90s

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Everybody hates the rich.
And not just hedge-fund managers and Wall Street traders. All big spenders look suspect these days. A California advocacy group is agitating for a state tax on millionaires by painting Kim Kardashian as a reality-show Marie Antoinette. ''Being on TV has changed my life,'' Ms. Kardashian says on a rabble-rousing video at taxkimk.com. ''Because you get lots of free stuff.''
Even nonreality shows feed class warfare. ''Two Broke Girls,'' a CBS sitcom about two down-on-their luck waitresses, is a hit. Socialites and plutocrats in the Hamptons are the object of scorn and worse in the post-credit-collapse nighttime soap ''Revenge.'' 
So it's hard to see how two heedless, Champagne-slurping hedonists who rode the greed-fueled excesses of Thatcher-Blair prosperity can find an audience 20 years later, in the middle of a worldwide economic slump, unemployment and towering government debt.
It's a relief to report that Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, a k a Edina and Patsy, the middle-aged, spendthrift heroines of ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' are back in the first of three 20th-anniversary specials on BBC America beginning on Sunday -- unchanged and still quite funny. It turns out that the duo's particular brand of substance abuse, self-absorption and high-end shopping is recessionproof.
Eddy and Pats, as they call each other, were deliciously bad in good times; in times of trouble they are still a tonic -- with gin and a twist. And older.
''I grieve for the menopause,'' Eddy (Ms. Saunders) says. ''I don't have any hormones, darling. I'm just held together with gels, pills and suppositories.''
The show, which was created by Ms. Saunders in 1992, showcased Eddy as a hard-partying London public-relations diva with a reproving, bookish teenage daughter, Saffron (Julia Sawalha). Eddy routinely mocked and neglected Saffy and instead went clubbing with Pats, a tall, thin and lugubrious fashion-magazine editor whose capacity for no food and lots of drugs and drink made Keith Richards look abstemious.
Jokes about menopause, drinking, drugs, sex, cosmetic surgery and fat are all over television nowadays, so it's hard to remember that when ''Absolutely Fabulous'' first surfaced on American television in 1994, it was an era when only Roseanne Barr dared be quite so crass, and she played a more sympathetic role of working-class wife and mother.
''Absolutely Fabulous'' was in its way groundbreaking, yet it also harked back to an earlier era of television comedy. Some of the most memorable sitcoms of all time revolve around a pair of daffy dames.
Lucy and Ethel rise above all others, but Mary and Rhoda found their niche in the 1970s, replacing housework and marital scheming with the single woman's preoccupation with feminism, careers and dating. In the 1980s ''Kate and Allie'' tapped into another stage of the women's movement, finding humor in the lives of divorced working moms.
Eddy and Pats came next, and they introduced the world of earned, but undeserved wealth, satirizing the materialism and cult of celebrity ushered in by the Reagan-Thatcher revolution. That was a me decade that lasted almost three, and ''Absolutely Fabulous'' spanned most of it: the series had only three seasons, but the duo kept coming back in mini-series and specials.
They were often imitated, but especially on American television writers were not as daring. British comedy is notoriously callous, with an unyielding ban on sentimentality or political correctness.
Ms. Lumley in particular created an archetype that has often been copied, without going quite as far. Christine Baranski was very funny -- but not nearly as outrageous -- as a martini-swilling best friend to Cybill Shepherd on ''Cybill.'' It's hard to imagine that Karen Walker, the ditsy, dipsy best friend played by Megan Mullally on ''Will & Grace,'' could have found so welcoming an audience without Patsy as a model.
Most of all, the show's setting, a prescient send-up of Cool Britannia fashion, publicity and celebrity promotions, opened the way for ''Sex and the City.''
The world has changed, but Eddy and Pats are still living in a soggy Champagne-and-pills hangover, aging has-beens struggling to stay on top, even though they were never really that close to it in their heyday. They still live decadently, and Eddy has held on to her posh town house but seems as needy and desperate as ever, instructing her assistant to update her Web site: ''Blog and flog,'' she trills.
Weight is still a preoccupation.
''I'm at a time in my life, darling, when every fat cell I ever lost or gained has come back for the fat-cell reunion of the year,'' Eddy moans.
The show mentions the ''credit crunch'' as an acknowledgment of a changed economy, but in the same old spirit of political incorrectness. Saffy, who is now an adult but still censorious, bemoans the London riots of 2011, which brought on arson and looting. Patsy isn't convinced.
''Oh, I don't know,'' she says with her trademark sneer. ''Nothing wrong with a bit of extreme shopping.''
Twenty years ago the heroines of ''Absolutely Fabulous'' were wacky heralds of a new age of extravagance. Now they are the last blinkered women in the bunker, hoarding designer shoes and awaiting an Evite back to the glamorous life. They don't belong there, and that's what makes them so welcome.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A television review on Friday about the ''Absolutely Fabulous'' 20th-anniversary specials, on BBC America, misidentified the area of London where Eddy has a town house. It is Holland Park, not the nearby Notting Hill.

HEADLINE: Big Study Links Good Teachers To Lasting Gain

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Elementary- and middle-school teachers who help raise their students' standardized-test scores seem to have a wide-ranging, lasting positive effect on those students' lives beyond academics, including lower teenage-pregnancy rates and greater college matriculation and adult earnings, according to a new study that tracked 2.5 million students over 20 years.
The paper, by Raj Chetty and John N. Friedman of Harvard and Jonah E. Rockoff of Columbia, all economists, examines a larger number of students over a longer period of time with more in-depth data than many earlier studies, allowing for a deeper look at how much the quality of individual teachers matters over the long term.
''That test scores help you get more education, and that more education has an earnings effect -- that makes sense to a lot of people,'' said Robert H. Meyer, director of the Value-Added Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which studies teacher measurement but was not involved in this study. ''This study skips the stages, and shows differences in teachers mean differences in earnings.'' 
The study, which the economics professors have presented to colleagues in more than a dozen seminars over the past year and plan to submit to a journal, is the largest look yet at the controversial ''value-added ratings,'' which measure the impact individual teachers have on student test scores. It is likely to influence the roiling national debates about the importance of quality teachers and how best to measure that quality.
Many school districts, including those in Washington and Houston, have begun to use value-added metrics to influence decisions on hiring, pay and even firing.
Supporters argue that such metrics hold teachers accountable and can help improve the educational outcomes of millions of children. Detractors, most notably a number of teachers unions, say that isolating the effect of a given teacher is harder than it seems, and might unfairly penalize some instructors.
Critics particularly point to the high margin of error with many value-added ratings, noting that they tend to bounce around for a given teacher from year to year and class to class. But looking at an individual's value-added score for three or four classes, the researchers found that some consistently outperformed their peers.
''Everybody believes that teacher quality is very, very important,'' says Eric A. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford and longtime researcher of education policy. ''What this paper and other work has shown is that it's probably more important than people think. That the variations or differences between really good and really bad teachers have lifelong impacts on children.''
The average effect of one teacher on a single student is modest. All else equal, a student with one excellent teacher for one year between fourth and eighth grade would gain $4,600 in lifetime income, compared to a student of similar demographics who has an average teacher. The student with the excellent teacher would also be 0.5 percent more likely to attend college.
Perhaps just as important, given the difficulty of finding, training and retaining outstanding teachers, is that the difference in long-term outcome between students who have average teachers and those with poor-performing ones is as significant as the difference between those who have excellent teachers and those with average ones, the study found.
In the aggregate, these differences are potentially enormous.
Replacing a poor teacher with an average one would raise a single classroom's lifetime earnings by about $266,000, the economists estimate. Multiply that by a career's worth of classrooms.
''If you leave a low value-added teacher in your school for 10 years, rather than replacing him with an average teacher, you are hypothetically talking about $2.5 million in lost income,'' said Professor Friedman, one of the coauthors.
To do the study, the researchers first tackled the question that has swirled controversy in so many school districts, including New York City's: whether value-added scores are in fact a good measure of teacher quality. Mr. Jones might regularly help raise test scores more than Ms. Smith, but maybe that is because his students are from wealthier families, or because he has a harder-working class -- factors that can be difficult for researchers to discern.
While Professor Rockoff, at Columbia, has previously written favorably about value-added ratings, the Harvard pair were skeptics of the metrics. ''We said, 'We're going to show that these measures don't work, that this has to do with student motivation or principal selection or something else,' '' Professor Chetty recalled.
But controlling for numerous factors, including students' backgrounds, the researchers found that the value-added scores consistently identified some teachers as better than others, even if individual teachers' value-added scores varied from year to year.
After identifying excellent, average and poor teachers, the economists then set out to look at their students over the long term, analyzing information on earnings, college matriculation rates, the age they had children, and where they ended up living.
The results were striking. Looking only at test scores, previous studies had shown, the effect of a good teacher mostly fades after three or four years. But the broader view showed that the students still benefit for years to come.
Students with top teachers are less likely to become pregnant as teenagers, more likely to enroll in college, and more likely to earn more money as adults, the study found.
The authors argue that school districts should use value-added measures in evaluations, and to remove the lowest performers, despite the disruption and uncertainty involved.
''The message is to fire people sooner rather than later,'' Professor Friedman said.
Professor Chetty acknowledged, ''Of course there are going to be mistakes -- teachers who get fired who do not deserve to get fired.'' But he said that using value-added scores would lead to fewer mistakes, not more.
Still, translating value-added scores into policy is fraught with problems. Judging teachers by their students' test scores might encourage cheating, teaching to the test or lobbying to have certain students in class, for instance.
''We are performing these studies in settings where nobody cares about their ranking -- it does not change their pay or job security,'' said Jesse Rothstein, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, whose work criticizing other value-added assessments unions frequently cite. ''But if you start to change that, there is going to be a range of responses.''
Many other researchers and school administrators say that even if imperfect, well-calculated value-added scores are an important part of evaluating teachers.
''Very few people suggest that you should use value-added scores alone to make personnel decisions,'' Dr. Hanushek, of Stanford, said. ''What the whole value-added debate has done is push forward the issue of how to evaluate teachers, and how to use that information.''
The new study found no evidence for one piece of conventional wisdom: that having a good teacher in an early grade has a bigger effect than having a good teacher in later grades.

HEADLINE: Fillmore District Audit Shows Little Oversight

BYLINE: By MATT SMITH and ZUSHA ELINSON. 
msmith@baycitizen.org; zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Emmit Powell hesitated when he was asked to talk about the City of San Francisco 's efforts to promote his popular barbecue restaurant as the anchor of a showcase redevelopment project in the Fillmore district. The venture led to his financial ruin.
''I went through a lot there, and I don't really want to go back into that situation,'' said Mr. Powell, a onetime gospel singer, real estate investor and restaurateur. ''It was devastating for me. I lost my business. I lost my home. I lost my property. I don't want to blame them, because I don't think it would do any good.''
For 30 years, Mr. Powell ran the popular barbecue joint Powell's Place in Hayes Valley. The Fillmore neighborhood redevelopment project was closed in 2009, and today Mr. Powell's former restaurant -- and $360,000 in San Francisco Redevelopment Agency loans that he could not repay -- exist only as line items in a new city controller's audit.
The agency is being criticized for handing out millions of dollars without proper controls or even standards for evaluating whether grants and loans did any good, and then making inadequate efforts to collect loan payments. 
The State Supreme Court this week gave Gov. Jerry Brown approval to shut down the state's approximately 400 redevelopment agencies, a move that Mr. Brown said would free $1.7 billion to help reduce the state's budget deficit. Civic leaders including Mayors Ed Lee of San Francisco and Jean Quan of Oakland said the decision would destroy a program that revitalized some of the most blighted parts of their cities.
''Time and time again, San Francisco has demonstrated that when redevelopment is used to its fullest potential, it can deliver results,'' Mr. Lee said on Dec. 29, citing the South of Market redevelopment projects Yerba Buena Gardens and Mission Bay as examples of successes.
But critics of the redevelopment agencies said they were little more than slush funds for city officials to spend on other projects or to dole out to political allies and friends. And the recent audit of the Fillmore redevelopment area by the city's controller's office concluded that there was virtually no oversight of the money.
Tiffany Bohee, the redevelopment agency's executive director since October, said new systems have been created to monitor spending and contract performance. ''You're talking about righting historic wrongs,'' she said of the Fillmore project. ''Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. But that was before my time.''
Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of San Francisco Planning and Urban Development, a nonprofit research firm, said redevelopment agencies had used many strategies. ''Some of them worked, and some of them didn't,'' he said. ''The same agency that made Mission Bay happen also gave out money to community groups in other areas without as much to show for that.''
The San Francisco Redevelopment Agency was created in 1948 to modernize parts of the city. The first and most famous of those efforts involved razing, and in some cases moving, hundreds of Fillmore-area Victorian row houses occupied by black families, and eliminating dozens of black-owned businesses just west of downtown San Francisco. The Fillmore Street jazz scene, which thrived in the 1940s, faded away.
Critics said the redevelopment agency's Fillmore jazz district plan, established in 1995, was an attempt to make amends for those urban renewal efforts. They said that by the time the redevelopment program was closed in 2009, the agency had squandered millions of dollars in grants, loans, contracts and subcontracts, leaving behind a few high-rise condominium buildings, a neighborhood of empty storefronts and lingering resentments.
''This was the agency's attempt to do penance for its past sins,'' said Barbara Meskunas, who from 2005 to 2009 served on the Western Addition redevelopment area's project area committee.
London Breed, who served on the Redevelopment Agency Commission from 2005 to 2011, said the agency's Fillmore project was hampered by unrealistic expectations. ''The goal was to try to reinvent a district that was long gone, to try to artificially create something,'' she said. ''In the case of the Fillmore, we've not succeeded.''
Fred Blackwell, executive director of the redevelopment agency from 2007 to 2011, said that some very good things had come out of the redevelopment. ''But none of them atones for degradation of community that happened in the late '60s or early '70s,'' he said. ''And frankly, I don't think there was any way for the redevelopment agency to atone for that decades later.''
In all, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency listed 30 contracts and programs totaling $57.4 million that were aimed at reviving the jazz entertainment district. The agency handed out $5.8 million to finance the Fillmore Jazz District revolving loan program and $22.5 million for an apartment building.
Yoshi's, a jazz club in Oakland, received a $4.4 million loan in 2007 to open a branch on Fillmore Street. In 2008 the club received $2.8 million more. The Fillmore Street business has struggled, in part because of a lack of demand for jazz in that location, said Kaz Kajimura, the club's founder. To stay afloat, the club has branched out to R&B and rap.
''Jazz was getting harder and harder to make the business out of,'' Mr. Kajimura said, adding that the Fillmore club did not become profitable during a ''normal month'' until November 2011. (He said that a previous December had been profitable because of holiday parties and banquets.)
In 2005, the redevelopment agency lent $1.7 million to the restaurant 1300 on Fillmore Street. In 2007, the agency lent the restaurant $350,000 more, and in May 2008, $852,000 more. In October 2008 the restaurant's owners said they needed another $1 million to stay in business, according to city records. The agency lent them $100,000, and 1300 is still in business.
Ross Mirkarimi, a former city supervisor who asked for the controller's audit, said many of the agency's grants had not been large enough to be effective. ''It was sort of pocket money'' instead, said Mr. Mirkarimi, whose district included the Fillmore neighborhood.
Of all the projects in the Fillmore redevelopment area, the relocation of Powell's Place seemed to generate the most initial enthusiasm. In 2005, after three decades in business, Mr. Powell said, the redevelopment commission approached him.
''They came and said, 'We can introduce you to the manager of the Fillmore Center; they have some buildings, property up there,'' he said. ''We would like to see you go there because of the history of the restaurant. We want to make it a Jazz Heritage Center and return Afro-American businesses into the area. And I was the anchor to go in there and get other businesses in.''
In addition to a $360,000 loan, he mortgaged his house and a property in Oakland to pay for improvements to the Fillmore property. But the restaurant remained closed for six months while Mr. Powell waited for various permits, although he continued to owe lease payments. By the time he opened he was $60,000 in arrears on loan payments.
In November 2007 the restaurant closed. The controller's audit said the redevelopment agency never tried to collect the outstanding $360,000 loan.

HEADLINE: Iran Responds With Anger To Proposals by Europe

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN; Steven Erlanger contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
Iranian officials struck a defiant posture on Thursday in response to a proposed oil embargo by the European Union, calling the intensified efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program, including new sanctions by United States, tantamount to ''an economic war.''
The strong words were the latest in a series of escalating military and diplomatic responses by Iran in recent weeks amid growing pressure from Western powers. On Tuesday, Iran warned the United States that it would take action if an American aircraft carrier that left the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz were to return. The United States has said that the threats would not cause it to alter military deployments. 
Britain added its voice to the chorus on Thursday, with Defense Secretary Philip Hammond cautioning that any attempt by Iran to close the strait would be ''illegal and unsuccessful.'' His comments, delivered during his first visit to the Pentagon since he became the top defense minister last fall, appeared to indicate strong resolve by the West to keep the strategically important strait open for trade. ''It is in all our interests that the arteries of global trade are kept free, opening and running,'' he said, according to news reports.
The official news agency IRNA quoted one senior member of the Iranian Parliament as saying that pressure from ''bullying nations'' made the country ''more resilient.'' Press TV, an official Iranian news site, headlined its report with a warning against ''saber rattling'' by Britain.
Relations between Iran and Britain deteriorated after protesters stormed the British Embassy in Tehran in November. Britain responded by downgrading relations to their lowest level in 20 years, expelling Iranian diplomats from Britain and ordering the Iranian Embassy in London to shut down.
Mixed in the with bluster on Thursday was tacit acknowledgment of the potential economic hardships that stronger sanctions could cause in Iran, where the economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, including through the Strait of Hormuz.
Iran will ''weather the storm,'' Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said on Thursday, adding that he was ''not concerned at all'' about the imminent ban on its oil by the European Union. The economic minister, Shamseddin Hosseini, likened the ban to ''an economic war.''
''Iran, with divine assistance, has always been ready to counter such hostile actions, and we are not concerned at all about the sanctions,'' Mr. Salehi said at a news conference in Tehran. ''Just as we have weathered the storm in the last 32 years with the hold of God and efforts that we make, we will be able to survive this as well.''
But he also said that Iran would like to reopen talks with the West on its nuclear program, suggesting that renewed talks be held in Turkey. Mr. Salehi appeared at the news conference with the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that Iran had responded favorably to the notion of resuming negotiations. That was interpreted by some in Europe as an effort by Iran to buy time to continue its program.
The European Union foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, has been waiting for Iran to respond formally to an October 2011 letter suggesting new rounds of negotiations, which broke off a year ago when Iran presented its own set of preconditions, including a lifting of sanctions, that the West considered unacceptable.
President Obama signed legislation last weekend imposing sanctions against Iran's central bank intended to make it more difficult for the country to sell its oil. Europe took steps on Wednesday toward an oil embargo on Iran. In 2010, oil from Iran accounted for about 5.8 percent of total European imports of crude.

HEADLINE: An Automaker Promotes Its Tagline to Its Slogan

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
BMW of North America will introduce its new brand advertising on Saturday, reinforcing its image as ''the ultimate driving machine'' as it introduces 14 new models in the United States this year.
Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, appointed in August by BMW as its lead agency in the United States for national brand creative work and ads for BMW dealers, has produced a new 30-second television spot that will have its premiere on NBC's broadcast of the N.F.L.'s wild-card games.
Unlike BMW's previous global brand campaign by GSD&M of Austin, Tex. -- which focused on the joy of driving a BMW -- the new advertising depicts the BMW as the ''ultimate driving machine,'' whatever the model. The tagline has been used continuously by BMW since it was created by Martin Puris, then the chief executive of Ammirati & Puris, in 1975. 
The new spot features, in quick succession, a BMW M3 Coupe on a track, followed by a BMW X5 in sand, then a BMWi8 on a bridge, then a BMW 7 Series in a tunnel, before finishing with a montage of the BMW family of cars. The voice-over says, ''We don't make sports cars. We don't make S.U.V.'s. We don't make hybrids, and we don't make luxury sedans. We only make one thing, the ultimate driving machine.''
Dan Creed, vice president of marketing for BMW of North America, said, ''We're in the middle of an extremely significant product offensive.''
The introduction of 14 models in 2012 will be the most by BMW in the United States in one year in at least a decade. With the new campaign, Mr. Creed said, the company is trying to ''take the ultimate driving machine and define what it will be in the future.''
Ed Brojerdi, co-chief creative officer of Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal, a New York-based part of MDC Partners, said the agency was dealing ''with one of the most iconic taglines in marketing. We needed to make sure the marketing is as encompassing as the portfolio. Big brands have a focused point of view, they stand for something. BMW evokes the joy and passion for driving, sheer driving pleasure.''
After Saturday's football games, the new spot will run during prime-time programs like ''House,'' ''The Big Bang Theory,'' ''Modern Family'' and ''Law and Order: SVU'' on the Fox, CBS, ABC and NBC networks. It also will run nationally on cable channels throughout the year.
According to Trudy Hardy, manager of marketing for BMW North America, the ad is aimed at the company's ''normal buying demographic,'' men and women age 35 to 54.
Mr. Creed said BMW's 2012 advertising budget would be ''slightly more'' than its budget in 2011. According to Kantar Media, the company spent $133 million on all advertising in the United States in 2009, $166 million in 2010, and $109 million in the first nine months of 2011, slightly up from $108 million spent in the same period in 2010.
Mr. Creed said that for the luxury segment of automobiles, 2011 was a ''two-horse race between BMW and Mercedes-Benz from a volume standpoint'' in the American market. The BMW Group announced Thursday that sales of BMW brand vehicles in the United States were up 12.6 percent in 2011, to 247,907 vehicles, while Mercedes-Benz USA said on Thursday that sales of that brand rose 13.3 percent in 2011, to 245,231 vehicles.
Noting he would ''rather go into any downturn with the newest products rather than the oldest'' and with more efficient and dynamic products than their predecessors, Mr. Creed said, ''regardless of which way the economy goes in 2012, we feel BMW is in the strongest position of our competitive set.''
Christopher Cedergren, managing director of Iceology, a Los Angeles consulting and research company that has worked with BMW in the past, called the new TV spot an effort by the automaker to ''go back to its performance roots as the ultimate driving machine. The previous campaign was too nebulous. It blurred the image of the BMW brand, made it too much like its competitors. It kind of walked away from its positioning about its driving performance.''
''They're trying to pull on the heartstrings of consumers again. The joy campaign really didn't pull on the heartstrings that effectively,''' he said, adding, ''The luxury business is an emotional business. If you want to sell a product that commands a premium price, you need to tug on the heartstrings, the passion points of consumers.''
Christie L. Nordhielm, an associate professor of business administration at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said that although the ad's depiction of multiple car models was ''not particularly unique, the message in the campaign is very unique. I don't recall another automotive company emphasizing the overall corporate benefit, while expressly de-emphasizing the specific types of cars, in the last 30 years.''
BMW, she added, ''in a sense is the Apple of the automotive industry. Apple delivers great user experience across products, and BMW delivers an exceptional experience across all types of automobiles.''
Renee Richardson Gosline, an assistant professor of marketing at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management, said ''a campaign that emphasizes a consistent brand essence is powerful, but BMW has to keep in mind that luxury consumers seek distinction, even within the brand. So, along with the egalitarian message that all BMWs are 'ultimate driving machines,' BMW has to make owners of different models each feel special as well, by building relationships with the owners of each model.''
She said that could be done with customized direct mail campaigns or online or offline community groups.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Advertising column on Friday, about BMW's new marketing campaign in the United States, misstated, in some editions, the day last week that Mercedes-Benz USA, a rival, reported its 2011 sales. It was Thursday, not last Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Romney Facing Risks Left and Right

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney casts himself as the guardian of American opportunity, who would stop President Obama's attempt ''to replace our merit-based society with an entitlement society.''
Mr. Romney draws inspiration from the country's founders, he argues, while Mr. Obama seeks a ''European-style welfare state'' to redistribute wealth and create ''equal outcomes'' regardless of individual effort and success. 
That formulation has obvious political advantages. It fits Mr. Romney's strategy of trying to unite Republicans through shared hostility to Mr. Obama, and to channel the resentment of middle-class voters against increasing economic stress in recent years.
But it carries risks to Mr. Romney from left and right. To Democrats, it is a straw-man formulation that twists the facts of Mr. Obama's record and implies that the president is somehow less than American. The largest entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- were all enacted before Mr. Obama entered grade school.
David Axelrod, the president's chief campaign strategist, calls it ''Orwellian'' that Mr. Romney, the son of a wealthy business executive and prominent politician, would style himself the champion of ''merit'' against a man who reached the White House after being raised by a single mother.
''Barack Obama doesn't need any lectures from Mitt Romney on merit and making your own way in life,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
To some conservatives, the Romney argument only highlights what they see as a lack of commitment from him to translate his words into specific actions to reverse the growth of government and expand markets and individual liberties.
''His proposals tend to be fairly incremental,'' said William Kristol, the former Republican White House aide who is now editor of The Weekly Standard. ''But how does that fit with such a grand statement of the differences between the two parties?''
''You hear him say things that make you think: They must have focus-grouped this and decided the phrases sound good,'' he added.
Citing the attack former Vice President Walter F. Mondale once leveled against a Democratic presidential rival, Gary Hart, Mr. Kristol concluded, ''In a weird way, when you look at the Romney campaign you ask, 'Where's the beef?' ''
Mr. Romney's advisers say he has pondered the larger issues about the direction of American society since he served as a Mormon missionary in France amid student riots in the '60s. And they insist there is more beef than he receives credit for in his proposals to rein in spending, reduce regulations and convert Medicare from an open-ended program with defined benefits to one that defines and limits the federal government's contribution.
''He has put together the boldest, most credible plan of anyone out there,'' said Stuart Stevens, a top Romney campaign strategist.
Critics on the right see something different: a tinkerer more committed to avoiding political risk than to fundamental changes in the role of government. Mr. Romney opposes moving Social Security, the landmark entitlement program, toward a system of private accounts. He does not support repeal of Medicare's prescription drug benefit, the substantial new entitlement enacted under President George W. Bush.
Nor has Mr. Romney joined flat-tax advocates in proposing to scrap the longstanding American principle of progressive income taxation, which levies higher rates on those with higher incomes and thus redistributes wealth from the rich to the middle class and the poor.
As governor of Massachusetts, he embraced the state's obligation to increase minority hiring.
''If you go program by program, the differences between Obama and Romney are more ones of degree,'' said Michael D. Tanner, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. ''He's a manager. He wants to manage the status quo, not blow it up. The status quo is redistributionist.''
Here in New Hampshire and elsewhere on the 2012 primary trail, Mr. Romney's rivals offer similar arguments. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich scorns Mr. Romney as a ''timid Massachusetts moderate,'' criticizing his plan to eliminate capital gains taxes only for Americans making under $200,000 a year.
Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who surged from behind to a virtual tie with Mr. Romney in the Iowa caucuses, highlights his role in helping end the federal welfare entitlement in 1996. Opposing him, he says, were the sorts of Republicans who behave like ''cheap Democrats'' rather than conservative reformers.
Mr. Santorum proposes to extend that achievement by converting all means-tested federal entitlement programs, including food stamps and housing subsidies, into block grants to states. Mr. Romney would convert the federal role in Medicaid, the health program for the poor and the disabled, into block grants, but has no comparable plan for all other federal entitlements.
Advisers to Mr. Obama, gearing up for a general election battle, criticize Mr. Romney's formulation from different directions. The largest entitlement expansion the president has engineered, a national health care plan requiring Americans to obtain health coverage and offering subsidies who those who cannot afford it, closely resembles the expansion of coverage Mr. Romney ushered in for Massachusetts.
Mr. Romney's criticism of Mr. Obama taps a vein of conservative anger over the administration's efforts to raise taxes on the rich, in part to help finance government assistance to middle- and lower-income Americans through tax cuts and education aid. Instead of seeking ''equal outcomes,'' as Mr. Romney asserts, administration aides call their goal expanding opportunities so more people can succeed.
''Obama's view is that people should have a fair shot,'' Mr. Axelrod said.
Partisan arguments aside, the American economy, government and society have moved broadly in the direction Mr. Romney advocates for decades by relying on market forces.
Nicholas Lemann, whose book on SAT testing was subtitled ''The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,'' praised Mr. Romney's advocacy of needed curbs on entitlement spending. But he dismissed the suggestion of a conflict between rewarding merit and cushioning market outcomes, calling both hallmarks of modern societies.
Mr. Lemann, dean of Columbia Journalism School, said: ''Historically, they go together.''

HEADLINE: Text: Obama's Remarks on Military Spending

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Obama's remarks on proposed cuts to military spending, as released by the White House on Thursday:
Good morning, everybody. The United States of America is the greatest force for freedom and security that the world has ever known. And in no small measure, that's because we've built the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military in history -- and as Commander-in-Chief, I'm going to keep it that way.
Indeed, all of us on this stage -- every single one of us -- have a profound responsibility to every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman who puts their life on the line for America. We owe them a strategy with well-defined goals; to only send them into harm's way when it's absolutely necessary; to give them the equipment and the support that they need to get the job done; and to care for them and their families when they come home. That is our solemn obligation. 
And over the past three years, that's what we've done. We've continued to make historic investments in our military -- our troops and their capabilities, our military families and our veterans. And thanks to their extraordinary service, we've ended our war in Iraq. We've decimated al Qaeda's leadership. We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, and we've put that terrorist network on the path to defeat. We've made important progress in Afghanistan, and we've begun to transition so Afghans can assume more responsibility for their own security. We joined allies and partners to protect the Libyan people as they ended the regime of Muammar Qaddafi.
Now we're turning the page on a decade of war. Three years ago, we had some 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, we've cut that number in half. And as the transition in Afghanistan continues, more of our troops will continue to come home. More broadly, around the globe we've strengthened alliances, forged new partnerships, and served as a force for universal rights and human dignity.
In short, we've succeeded in defending our nation, taking the fight to our enemies, reducing the number of Americans in harm's way, and we've restored America's global leadership. That makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that's an achievement that every American -- especially those Americans who are proud to wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces -- should take great pride in.
This success has brought our nation, once more, to a moment of transition. Even as our troops continue to fight in Afghanistan, the tide of war is receding. Even as our forces prevail in today's missions, we have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to look ahead to the force that we are going to need in the future.
At the same time, we have to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength around the world. And that includes putting our fiscal house in order. To that end, the Budget Control Act passed by Congress last year -- with the support of Republicans and Democrats alike -- mandates reductions in federal spending, including defense spending. I've insisted that we do that responsibly. The security of our nation and the lives of our men and women in uniform depend on it.
That's why I called for this comprehensive defense review -- to clarify our strategic interests in a fast-changing world, and to guide our defense priorities and spending over the coming decade -- because the size and the structure of our military and defense budgets have to be driven by a strategy, not the other way around. Moreover, we have to remember the lessons of history. We can't afford to repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past -- after World War II, after Vietnam -- when our military was left ill prepared for the future. As Commander in Chief, I will not let that happen again. Not on my watch.
We need a start -- we need a smart, strategic set of priorities. The new guidance that the Defense Department is releasing today does just that. I want to thank Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey for their extraordinary leadership during this process. I want to thank the service secretaries and chiefs, the combatant commanders and so many defense leaders -- military and civilian, active, Guard and reserve -- for their contributions. Many of us met repeatedly -- asking tough questions, challenging our own assumptions and making hard choices. And we've come together today around an approach that will keep our nation safe and our military the finest that the world have ever known.
This review also benefits from the contributions of leaders from across my national security team -- from the departments of State, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, as well as the intelligence community. And this is critical, because meeting the challenges of our time cannot be the work of our military alone -- or the United States alone. It requires all elements of our national power, working together in concert with our allies and our partners.
So I'm going to let Leon and Marty go into the details. But I just want to say that this effort reflects the guidance that I personally gave throughout this process. Yes, the tide of war is receding. But the question that this strategy answers is what kind of military will we need long after the wars of the last decade are over. And today, we're fortunate to be moving forward from a position of strength.
As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region. We're going to continue investing in our critical partnerships and alliances, including NATO, which has demonstrated time and again -- most recently in Libya -- that it's a force multiplier. We will stay vigilant, especially in the Middle East.
As we look beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and the end of long-term nation-building with large military footprints -- we'll be able to ensure our security with smaller conventional ground forces. We'll continue to get rid of outdated Cold War-era systems so that we can invest in the capabilities that we need for the future, including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, counterterrorism, countering weapons of mass destruction and the ability to operate in environments where adversaries try to deny us access.
So, yes, our military will be leaner, but the world must know the United States is going to maintain our military superiority with armed forces that are agile, flexible and ready for the full range of contingencies and threats.
We're also going to keep faith with those who serve, by making sure our troops have the equipment and capabilities they need to succeed, and by prioritizing efforts that focus on wounded warriors, mental health and the well-being of our military families. And as our newest veterans rejoin civilian life, we'll keep working to give our veterans the care, the benefits and job opportunities that they deserve and that they have earned.
Finally, although today is about our defense strategy, I want to close with a word about the defense budget that will flow from this strategy. The details will be announced in the coming weeks. Some will no doubt say that the spending reductions are too big; others will say that they're too small. It will be easy to take issue with a particular change in a particular program. But I'd encourage all of us to remember what President Eisenhower once said -- that ''each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.'' After a decade of war, and as we rebuild the source of our strength -- at home and abroad -- it's time to restore that balance.
I think it's important for all Americans to remember, over the past 10 years, since 9/11, our defense budget grew at an extraordinary pace. Over the next 10 years, the growth in the defense budget will slow, but the fact of the matter is this: It will still grow, because we have global responsibilities that demand our leadership. In fact, the defense budget will still be larger than it was toward the end of the Bush administration. And I firmly believe, and I think the American people understand, that we can keep our military strong and our nation secure with a defense budget that continues to be larger than roughly the next 10 countries combined.
So again, I want to thank Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey, all the defense leaders who are on this stage, and some who are absent, for their leadership and their partnership throughout this process. Our men and women in uniform give their very best to America every single day, and in return they deserve the very best from America. And I thank all of you for the commitment to the goal that we all share: keeping America strong and secure in the 21st century, and keeping our Armed Forces the very best in the world.
And with that, I will turn this discussion over to Leon and to Marty, who can explain more and take your questions.
So thank you very much. I understand this is the first time a President has done this. It's a pretty nice room. (Laughter.)
Thank you guys.

HEADLINE: Romney, in South Carolina, Sets His Sights on Obama

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY and JEFF ZELENY; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Salem, N.H., and Michael Shear from Manchester, N.H.

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Enjoying a strong lead in New Hampshire polls, Mitt Romney flew here Thursday to get a jump-start with voters in the first Southern primary and begin what might be his biggest challenge yet: convincing Republicans in this socially conservative state that he is the candidate who best represents their values.
Fresh from a victory lap through New Hampshire after narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday, Mr. Romney spoke at a rally with Gov. Nikki R. Haley, who was elected with the help of the Tea Party movement, and Senator John McCain, who won this state in 2008. 
Mr. Romney did not once mention his main rival now for the nomination, Rick Santorum, who finished a close second in Iowa.
Instead, he went straight for President Obama, calling him a ''job killer'' who is ''in over his head'' and accusing him of ''crony capitalism'' for making three appointments to the National Labor Relations Board without Congressional approval, suggesting the move was a reward to organized labor for its support.
South Carolina is a critical piece in the strategy of the Romney campaign, and perhaps its toughest challenge yet in an unpredictable nominating contest. The outcome of the primary could play a crucial role in determining how long the Republican contest remains a competitive fight.
While Mr. Romney won the endorsement of Ms. Haley and other leading Republicans in the state, the political landscape remains difficult for him. He struggled to win over the influential segment of Christian conservative voters four years ago, when he finished fourth. His advisers believe the challenge may not be as difficult this time, if Republicans consider electability over ideology, but his rivals believe the state presents one of the last chances to slow his march to the nomination.
Mr. Romney kept his focus on Mr. Obama during his speech.
''I think this president believes in something that some call crony capitalism,'' Mr. Romney said. ''Instead of free enterprise choosing the winners and losers, instead the government, and particularly the people of power, will pick the people they want to give special favors to. And you've seen that in this presidency.''
He called the appointments ''political payback'' and tailored the message to be particularly resonant for South Carolina, which has relatively relaxed union rules, by bringing up a labor board decision involving a Boeing airline plant here that has stirred widespread anger.
''The same thing they did to Boeing here, they want to do across the country,'' Mr. Romney said.
Ms. Haley, a rising political star in Republican circles, praised Mr. Romney in her introduction. ''We are looking at someone who they said could not win Iowa, just won Iowa,'' she said. ''This man is going to make sure we're a strong right-to-work state.''
Ms. Haley's endorsement had been coveted by all the candidates for the Republican nomination, particularly because of her Tea Party support. Mr. Romney is hoping it will send a broader message of acceptance among more conservative voters suspicious of Washington politicians.
''What I care about is jobs, spending and the economy,'' Ms. Haley said. ''We need someone who can fix it.''
Several of the 300 or so people at the rally said they were still undecided. ''I think the way things are going, he'll get a good shot here,'' said Tom Grewenig, a retired cement contractor from Beaufort. ''But if we were decided, we wouldn't be here.''
Asked what would put Mr. Romney in first place, Mr. Grewenig's wife, Kathleen, said, ''A little pizazz, I guess.''
Mr. Romney is working to follow the tradition of Republicans whose victories in South Carolina helped them clinched their nominations, including George Bush over Pat Robertson in 1988, Bob Dole over Pat Buchanan in 1996, George W. Bush over John McCain in 2000 and Mr. McCain over Mike Huckabee in 2008.
But other Republicans are hardly ceding the state to Mr. Romney.
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is planning to make a final push to revive his candidacy in South Carolina, and Mr. Santorum is seeking to give yet another jolt to his candidacy here before the nominating contest moves to the far more expensive primary state of Florida.
Mr. Santorum is riding high after losing to Mr. Romney in the Iowa caucuses by only eight votes. ''I'll be there on Sunday,'' he said Thursday as he campaigned in New Hampshire. ''I think we'll do well in both places.''
His campaign is working to step up its organization in South Carolina, hoping to replicate its Iowa strategy. The campaign has had three offices and organizers in the state since September.
''We've already got the ground game going,'' said Sandy McGarry, chairwoman of the Lancaster County Republican Party and a supporter of Mr. Santorum's. ''Rick has been to South Carolina many, many times. We know Rick just as well as Iowa does.''
Mr. Santorum's name came up only once at the Romney rally in Charleston. Mr. McCain said he had a ''strong disagreement'' with him over earmarks and ''pork-barrel spending.''
Of Mr. Romney, he said, ''He has the agenda and the ideals and the experience, both in the public and private sector, that is so badly needed now.''

HEADLINE: A New Social Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
I'm to Rick Santorum's left on most social issues, like same-sex marriage and abortion. I'm also put off by his Manichaean political rhetoric. He seems to imagine America's problems can best be described as the result of a culture war between the God-fearing conservatives and the narcissistic liberals.
Like most Americans, including most evangelicals under 40, I find this culture war language absurd. If conservative ideas were that much more virtuous than liberal ideas, then the conservative parts of the country would have fewer social pathologies than the liberal parts of the country. They don't. 
But having said all that, I'm delighted that Santorum is making a splash in this presidential campaign. He is far closer to developing a new 21st-century philosophy of government than most leaders out there.
One of Santorum's strengths is that he understands that a nation isn't just an agglomeration of individuals; it's a fabric of social relationships. In his 2005 book, ''It Takes a Family,'' he had chapters on economic capital as well as social capital, moral capital, cultural capital and intellectual capital. He presents an extended argument against radical individualism. ''Just as original sin is man's inclination to try to walk alone without God, individualism is man's inclination to try to walk alone among his fellows,'' he writes.
Communities breed character. Santorum argues that government cannot be agnostic about the character of its citizens because the less disciplined the people are, the more government must step in to provide order.
His political philosophy is built around the Catholic concept of subsidiarity -- that everything should be done at the lowest possible level. That produces a limited role for Washington, but still an important one.
Over the years, Santorum has sought to use the federal government to nurture healthy communities. Welfare reform, which he helped lead, was a paternalistic way to use state power to encourage hard work.
He seeks to triple the size of the child tax credit, to make families more financially secure. He has supported flex time and transportation policies to make life easier for working parents. After initial opposition, he came to support AmeriCorps, the federal community service program.
Santorum believes Head Start should teach manners to children. He has supported efforts to police the airwaves and corporate marketing campaigns. He believes that felons should recover the right to vote if they stay out of trouble for five years after their release from prison.
Santorum's policies on tax reform, entitlement reform and the other big issues are similar to Mitt Romney's and most of the other Republican candidates. But he seems to understand that simply cutting is not enough to build a healthy society. To avert decline, America has to restore its values.
Santorum understands that we have to fuse economics talk and values talk. But he hasn't appreciated that the biggest challenge to stable families, healthy communities and the other seedbeds of virtue is not coastal elites. It's technological change; it's globalization; it's personal mobility and expanded opportunity; it's an information-age economy built on self-transformation and perpetual rebranding instead of fixed inner character. It is the very forces that give us the dynamism and opportunities in the first place.
Santorum doesn't yet see that once you start thinking about how to foster an economic system that would nurture our virtues, you wind up with an agenda far more drastic and transformational.
If you believe in the dignity of labor, it makes sense to support an infrastructure program that allows more people to practice the habits of industry. If you believe in personal responsibility, you have to force Americans to receive only as much government as they are willing to pay for. If you believe in the centrality of family, you have to have a government that both encourages marriage and also supplies wage subsidies to men to make them marriageable.
If you believe social trust is the precondition for a healthy society, you have to have a simplified tax code that inspires trust instead of degrading it. If you believe that firm attachments and stable relationships build human capital, you had better offer early education for children in disorganized neighborhoods. If you want capitalists thinking for the long term and getting the most out of their workers, you have to encourage companies to be more deeply rooted in local communities rather than just free-floating instruments of capital markets.
I doubt Santorum is going to win the nomination. Main Street Republicans like Romney usually beat social conservatives like Santorum because there are just so many more of them in the Republican electorate. But social conservatives and libertarians often provide the ideas that Main Street leaders co-opt.
America is creative because of its moral materialism -- when social values and economic ambitions get down in the mosh pit and dance. Santorum is in the fray.

HEADLINE: Obama Tactic: Jab Congress To Hurt Rivals

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just three hours after President Obama announced that he was defying Congressional Republicans to fill a high-level regulatory position while lawmakers were out of town, Mitt Romney sent out the obligatory news release ripping the president. ''Chicago-style politics at its worst,'' Mr. Romney fumed, accusing the president of ''circumventing Congress.''
The statement was just what the White House wanted. It put the Republican presidential front-runner squarely on the side of the Republicans in Congress, a group with toxic poll numbers that the president's campaign hopes will hurt his rivals for the White House. 
''Our presidential election campaign is not a campaign against Congress,'' a senior administration official said on Thursday. ''We know we'll run against a person.'' But insofar as Mr. Obama has decided to target Republicans in Congress -- a body with historically low approval ratings after a year of jousting with the president -- he will also be seeking to twin his opponent, to any extent he can, with the 112th Congress.
Upon the president's return from Hawaii, the Obama campaign this week unleashed a carefully scripted and deliberately aggressive strategy that showed a White House in combative re-election mode as the president and his advisers sought to ensure that the Republicans did not get all the political limelight. Mr. Obama inserted himself into the media blitz of what was supposed to be an all-Republican show, the Iowa caucuses, when his campaign took out a huge advertisement on the home page of The Des Moines Register on caucus day and he spoke by video conference to Democrats gathered in the state.
''The Republican candidates are leaving Iowa. But their terrible plans are here to stay,'' was the declaration that greeted readers who went to the newspaper's Web site to get caucus updates.
On Wednesday, after waiting until the dust in Iowa had settled, clearing out space in newspapers and on television, Mr. Obama delivered another jab, announcing four recess appointments, including that of Richard Cordray as head of a new consumer protection agency, despite Republican opposition. On Thursday, the president went to the Pentagon and outlined a new military strategy that embraces hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to what is a Republican sacred cow, and made it clear that American ground forces would no longer be large enough to conduct prolonged, large-scale counterinsurgency campaigns like those in Iraq and Afghanistan. On Friday, he will take a victory lap with Mr. Cordray in a visit with the staff of the new Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.
White House and administration officials insist that all of Mr. Obama's actions this week -- with the exception of the advertisement -- are policy decisions made for the good of the country. But from Marine One -- the helicopter where Mr. Obama and Mr. Cordray revved up on Wednesday for the forthcoming fight -- to the West Wing corridors to his campaign offices in Chicago, the president's battle for re-election is quickly escalating as he sets out to use the advantages of his office to full effect.
The president's move last fall to take his jobs plan on the road to try to sell it to the American public, an effort that culminated in the payroll tax extension battle that is now widely perceived as a win for Mr. Obama and a debacle for Congressional Republicans, was just the beginning, administration officials and Mr. Obama's advisers say.
David Plouffe, one of Mr. Obama's senior political advisers, has argued in meetings at the White House that Republicans will overreach in their efforts to oppose the president's initiatives. And administration officials believe that is what House conservatives did in the case of the payroll tax cut, with the Tea Party wing of House Republicans initially balking at a compromise deal that Senate Republicans had signed on to and sparking a backlash in the public. The refusal of Senate Republicans to allow many of Mr. Obama's nominees to be confirmed, White House officials believe, could also end up hurting the Republicans, if it feeds the notion that they are standing in the way of the business of government.
''It is a matter of fact that the contenders for the Republican nomination have all endorsed and adopted the position espoused by the House Republicans'' in the recess appointment battle, a senior administration official said on Thursday. And that, administration officials have concluded, puts Mr. Obama at an advantage as he seeks to establish a narrative this year of him as the defender of middle-class Americans and the Republicans in Congress of the rich.
So in the next few weeks, there will be more executive initiatives that will portray the president as refusing to wait on a hostile Congress to take action to help Americans, officials say.
And there could be more recess appointments, if not in the coming days, then next month, when Congress is expected to recess over the Washington's Birthday Day holiday. Some Senate Republicans, furious over the recess appointments, said they would retaliate by not approving any more Obama nominees. But since so many of Mr. Obama's nominees have been held up anyway, the president may simply continue the precedent he established Wednesday, and use the break in February to appoint another batch of people, administration officials said.
There will also be announcements of more ''We Can't Wait'' projects -- the term the White House has adopted for executive action initiatives, like a plan to provide summer jobs to young people, which the White House announced on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Asks China to Pressure North Korea To Avoid Provocations During Transition

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- A senior American diplomat on Thursday called on China to help restrain the new leadership in North Korea from military provocations during the transition of power there.
The diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt M. Campbell, is the highest American official to visit Northeast Asia since the death of Kim Jong-il, the longtime North Korean leader, in December. He spoke to reporters in Seoul on Thursday after meeting with the South Korean foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan.
Mr. Campbell said that when he met with China's vice foreign minister, Cui Tiankai, and other senior officials in Beijing on Wednesday, he asked them to ''consult closely'' with Washington concerning developments in North Korea. 
''We also urge China to make clear the importance of restraint by the new North Korean leadership,'' Mr. Campbell said Thursday.
Although the extent of Beijing's ability to influence North Korea is unclear, China is the North's last major ally and trading partner. International sanctions over the North's nuclear program and long-range missile tests have deepened North Korea's economic dependence on China in recent years, magnifying the role China might be able to play in stabilizing the Korean Peninsula if the power transition in the North goes awry. China was the first country to endorse the new North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, the third son of Kim Jong-il.
One of the biggest concerns in the region is that Kim Jong-un -- or whoever is engineering his rapid rise to top leadership of the North's military and other important agencies of power -- might initiate military provocations against South Korea to help consolidate internal unity.
Mr. Kim is believed to be in his late 20s. Whether he will be able to achieve the kind of grip on power that his father had -- or how the power elites might behave if he fails to do so -- remain topics of intense speculation with potentially grave implications for the stability of the region.
''We underscore the strongest possible commitment of the United States to the enduring partnership between the United States and the Republic of Korea and the determination to be tightly aligned as we together face the new leadership transition in North Korea,'' Mr. Campbell said, using the formal name for South Korea.
He is scheduled to meet Japanese officials in Tokyo on Friday.
North Korea has stepped up its harsh words against South Korea in the past week, vowing to punish the government of President Lee Myung-bak for not expressing condolences over Kim Jong-il's death and threatening to turn South Korea's presidential offices into a ''sea of fire.'' Mr. Lee and the South Korean military both warned of a strong response to any military provocation from the North.
Analysts say that the North's military is considerably larger than the South's and could do heavy damage if full-scale fighting broke out, but that it is hobbled by the country's economic straits, making do with outdated equipment and short supplies of fuel. The South and the United States together would probably be able to defeat the North in a full-scale war, many experts say. The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in the South, which are seen as crucial to its defense.
Even so, conservatives in the South call for strengthening the country's forces. They say that the North's longstanding intention to reunify the peninsula by force remains unchanged, and that Seoul must make it clear to the North that a military provocation would be met with a strong counterattack -- a turn of events that would worry both Washington and Beijing.
State-run media in the North have been depicting Kim Jong-un as faithful to his father's policy of giving the military priority in all aspects of society, including first claim on the country's limited resources. In his first public action as the country's top leader, Mr. Kim inspected the Ryu Kyong-su tank division on New Year's Day. The unit was the first to enter Seoul after North Korea invaded the South in 1950, and Mr. Kim's father often watched war games in which the unit's tanks practiced ''liberating'' Seoul and other cities.
Both in Beijing on Wednesday and in Seoul on Thursday, Mr. Campbell said the United States was committed to the preservation of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.

HEADLINE: Voters Without a Party Splinter New Hampshire

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- For Emily Renfer, a 21-year-old college student from Nashua, voting is like a triple bank shot.
''I think Mitt Romney will win, but I can stomach Jon Huntsman because he is moderate and liberal-ish, so if he can get a little boost in New Hampshire, he can become a larger player, and then you wouldn't have Newt as second to Mitt,'' she said. ''Which is what I don't want.''
Ms. Renfer is registered as undeclared -- that is, not a member of either party, just like 41 percent of New Hampshire voters. They make up the largest voting bloc in the state, compared with 30 percent who are registered Republicans and 29 percent who are registered Democrats. 
Undeclared voters can vote in the primaries for either party, and between 35 and 40 percent of them are expected to turn out for the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, according to separate analyses by Andy Smith at the University of New Hampshire and David Paleologos at Suffolk University in Boston, both of them longtime students of New Hampshire voting patterns.
For that reason alone, independents often get a lot of attention. In the Republican primary in 2000, they flocked to Senator John McCain, who beat George W. Bush, the establishment candidate, by 18 percentage points.
But even then, Mr. McCain's strength came from registered Republicans. He could have won without the undeclared voters, but he could not have won without the Republican base.
This year, about 62 percent of registered Republicans are expected to turn out, giving them even more weight in the primary. And that is the trick again this year for Republican presidential candidates: Any appeal that does not go to the base could be the kiss of death. Even in New Hampshire, where the party is more moderate than Republicans nationally, candidates are trying to walk this fine line, appealing to independents without alienating the base. ''You can't come to New Hampshire and say, 'I'm the independent,' '' said Steve Duprey, a former state party chairman who backed Mr. McCain and now, as a Republican National Committeeman, must stay neutral. ''You need to have your base within the party and then attract independents, not the other way around.''
Mr. Huntsman began his campaign here months ago with overt appeals to independents. The theory was that Mr. Huntsman, whose positions on global warming and gay rights, for example, are more moderate than those of his rivals, would be electable in November because he would have crossover appeal. But ads now airing on his behalf call him a conservative.
''Huntsman made a strategic error, thinking the independents were his for the picking,'' said Mr. Smith at the University of New Hampshire. ''But most of them won't vote,'' he said.
Perhaps no candidate is walking the tightrope more than Mr. Romney. He is way ahead among Republicans and less so among independents. The Suffolk poll shows him winning about 37 percent of independents, compared with Ron Paul at 24 percent and Mr. Huntsman at 10 percent.
''All Romney needs to do is break even among independents and he'll win comfortably because he is so far ahead among registered Republicans,'' Mr. Paleologos said.
But his record as governor of neighboring Massachusetts is providing a treasure trove for his rivals. His moderate positions on abortion rights, gun restrictions and government-sponsored health care have prompted Newt Gingrich's epithet for him, ''Massachusetts moderate.''
While Mr. Romney has disavowed those positions, analysts say that voters here regard this maneuvering with a wink and a nod.
''Most Republicans say he has to take those positions, against abortion, that kind of thing, in order to be the nominee, but they think he won't make them priorities when he gets into office,'' said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire.
Marcie Mullaney, an undeclared voter and a retiree from New Boston, said she was not impressed with Mr. Romney because he was not a visionary. She and her husband, Henry, voted for Barack Obama in 2008 but said he now seems to be in over his head.
''Obama has proven that we should pick someone with experience, '' Mr. Mullaney, 68, a physicist and businessman, said as he and his wife attended a Gingrich event here. The former House speaker impressed them with his intellect. Mrs. Mullaney, 61, a former management consultant, said they also considered Mr. Paul but decided he was ''not a manager.''
''We need someone who is going to do more than rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic,'' she said.
The candidates' job is made easier by a simple truth: The undeclared are often perceived as independent or moderate, but most, analysts say, are either Republicans or Democrats at heart.
Stephen Paley, 53, an undeclared voter who is an unemployed account executive from Atkinson, said he usually voted Republican because he believed in smaller government. This year, he is debating between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney.
''Newt is more conservative, but I like Romney's business experience,'' said Mr. Paley, who attended a Gingrich event on Wednesday and a Romney event on Thursday.
John Hopwood, 52, an unemployed editor from Manchester who also attended the Gingrich event, said he was an independent so that he could vote for the best person of either party.
He said he usually voted Democratic -- he voted for Bill Richardson in the 2008 Democratic primary and then for Mr. Obama in November -- but was disappointed in the administration. He said he was considering Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Gingrich but was unsure which way he would go.
In the end, he said, ''I'll probably vote Democratic and write in Hillary.''

HEADLINE: Recent Fights in Congress Could Be Just Warm-Ups

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Remember the first session of the 112th Congress, how things were rancorous, partisan and at times somewhat apocalyptic?
That may be just an appetizer compared with the second session, which begins this month. President Obama on Wednesday made four appointments to two regulatory agencies loathed by many Republicans, all while Congress was out of town.
The last session began with a series of fiscal fights -- which more than once nearly led to government shutdowns -- and ended with a nasty battle over whether or not to extend a payroll tax holiday. The second session is likely to include a lawsuit over the legality of Mr. Obama's Wednesday appointments, as well as Senate Republicans turning minor procedures into major headaches and blocking all of the president's nominees. 
''It's going to be very difficult for him to get anybody confirmed by the United States Senate,'' said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, who is part of the Senate Republican leadership team. Mr. Barrasso said Republicans would ''pursue every option we can'' to prevent Mr. Obama from using Congressional Republicans as punching bags. ''We'll get together and visit about those options,'' he said.
But while Republicans can make life more difficult for Mr. Obama and their Democratic Congressional colleagues this year, they are somewhat hamstrung, both by their own election agenda, which almost certainly has to include some legislative accomplishments, and by the fact that both parties have for years exercised procedural methods to torture one another, thereby somewhat limiting Republican obstruction options.
For instance, while years ago the filibuster was a rarely used weapon against the majority, these days nearly every major piece of legislation is subject to such a challenge. Similarly, a pro forma session -- gaveling in and out for seconds to prevent recess appointments as Republicans tried this holiday season -- is nothing new.
''Senator Byrd invented it, Harry Reid implemented it and Republicans have embraced it,'' said Martin Paone, a former Senate Democratic secretary and now the executive vice president of Prime Policy Group, a lobbying firm. The idea of partisan nuclear options as rare is simply over, he added. ''The difference now is change. People don't use land lines anymore, Pan Am and TWA don't fly anymore and the world is a different place.''
The area in which Republicans could have the most impact on Mr. Obama -- derailing his efforts to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for the rest of the year -- would leave their party vulnerable in an election year, as did an end-of-first-session embarrassment for House Republicans in which they were forced to accept Democratic legislation that extended the cut for two months. And Republicans may find themselves having to choose between voting for bipartisan legislation that has the support of some in their party, like a bill to protect Hollywood from foreign piracy, and opposing such legislation to jam Democrats.
Administration officials say they understand that their nominees will face an even steeper battle in the Senate now but accept it as a consequence of using Congress as their bete noire, part of Mr. Obama's re-election strategy.
But Mr. Obama's strategy of demonizing Congress may well have blowback for his own party, if, as expected, even deeper partisan intransigence marks the second term of Congress.
''The irony is in adopting that approach, he is throwing his fellow Congressional Democrats under the bus,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. ''If you look at the Senate, there are far more Democrats up for re-election, and if he is going to run against the do-nothing Congress, that is a difficult point for him to be making when his own party controls the Senate.''
Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska also suggested that fights over recess appointment procedures could prevent Mr. Obama from attracting good candidates for jobs. ''Having served in a cabinet,'' Mr. Johanns, a former secretary of agriculture, said, ''I can't imagine I would leave the governor's office for a recess appointment. I think he is placing his appointments in jeopardy. I think he is hurting himself in the end.''
Ms. Collins and some other Congressional Republicans said that their best strategy now was to focus on job-creating legislation and tax reform -- issues that resonate with voters -- and try to brush off Mr. Obama's affronts.
''The White House has said it wants to stop governing and start campaigning full-time,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, who has his own set of problems with an unruly, fractured Republican caucus. ''But Republicans are going to stay relentlessly focused on jobs, starting with the payroll bill, which we hope can be completed in a timely fashion.''
For example, this week's Republican radio address will be delivered by Representative Nan Hayworth of New York, one of Mr. Boehner's appointees to a conference committee to hammer out a payroll tax deal. House Republicans say it will make the case for the Republican jobs agenda and never mention Mr. Obama's appointments. Further, the House will soon offer an energy and infrastructure bill, for which they will seek support of some Democrats, and will offer their own budget, most likely a modified version of the one put together last year by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
Still, many Republicans, frosty over the appointments, are steeling for battle. ''I think it poisons the well further,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas. ''But it is clear that the president has given up talking to Congress and has decided to politic full time.''

HEADLINE: Bain, Barack And Jobs

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
America's recovery from recession has been so slow that it mostly doesn't seem like a recovery at all, especially on the jobs front. So, in a better world, President Obama would face a challenger offering a serious critique of his job-creation policies, and proposing a serious alternative.
Instead, he'll almost surely face Mitt Romney. 
Mr. Romney claims that Mr. Obama has been a job destroyer, while he was a job-creating businessman. For example, he told Fox News: ''This is a president who lost more jobs during his tenure than any president since Hoover. This is two million jobs that he lost as president.'' He went on to declare, of his time at the private equity firm Bain Capital, ''I'm very happy in my former life; we helped create over 100,000 new jobs.''
But his claims about the Obama record border on dishonesty, and his claims about his own record are well across that border.
Start with the Obama record. It's true that 1.9 million fewer Americans have jobs now than when Mr. Obama took office. But the president inherited an economy in free fall, and can't be held responsible for job losses during his first few months, before any of his own policies had time to take effect. So how much of that Obama job loss took place in, say, the first half of 2009?
The answer is: more than all of it. The economy lost 3.1 million jobs between January 2009 and June 2009 and has since gained 1.2 million jobs. That's not enough, but it's nothing like Mr. Romney's portrait of job destruction.
Incidentally, the previous administration's claims of job growth always started not from Inauguration Day but from August 2003, when Bush-era employment hit its low point. By that standard, Mr. Obama could say that he has created 2.5 million jobs since February 2010.
So Mr. Romney's claims about the Obama job record aren't literally false, but they are deeply misleading. Still, the real fun comes when we look at what Mr. Romney says about himself. Where does that claim of creating 100,000 jobs come from?
Well, Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post got an answer from the Romney campaign. It's the sum of job gains at three companies that Mr. Romney ''helped to start or grow'': Staples, The Sports Authority and Domino's.
Mr. Kessler immediately pointed out two problems with this tally. It's ''based on current employment figures, not the period when Romney worked at Bain,'' and it ''does not include job losses from other companies with which Bain Capital was involved.'' Either problem, by itself, makes nonsense of the whole claim.
On the point about using current employment, consider Staples, which has more than twice as many stores now as it did back in 1999, when Mr. Romney left Bain. Can he claim credit for everything good that has happened to the company in the past 12 years? In particular, can he claim credit for the company's successful shift from focusing on price to focusing on customer service (''That was easy''), which took place long after he had left the business world?
Then there's the bit about looking only at Bain-connected companies that added jobs, ignoring those that reduced their work forces or went out of business. Hey, if pluses count but minuses don't, everyone who spends a day playing the slot machines comes out way ahead!
In any case, it makes no sense to look at changes in one company's work force and say that this measures job creation for America as a whole.
Suppose, for example, that your chain of office-supply stores gains market share at the expense of rivals. You employ more people; your rivals employ fewer. What's the overall effect on U.S. employment? One thing's for sure: it's a lot less than the number of workers your company added.
Better yet, suppose that you expand in part not by beating your competitors, but by buying them. Now their employees are your employees. Have you created jobs?
The point is that Mr. Romney's claims about being a job creator would be nonsense even if he were being honest about the numbers, which he isn't.
At this point, some readers may ask whether it isn't equally wrong to say that Mr. Romney destroyed jobs. Yes, it is. The real complaint about Mr. Romney and his colleagues isn't that they destroyed jobs, but that they destroyed good jobs.
When the dust settled after the companies that Bain restructured were downsized -- or, as happened all too often, went bankrupt -- total U.S. employment was probably about the same as it would have been in any case. But the jobs that were lost paid more and had better benefits than the jobs that replaced them. Mr. Romney and those like him didn't destroy jobs, but they did enrich themselves while helping to destroy the American middle class.
And that reality is, of course, what all the blather and misdirection about job-creating businessmen and job-destroying Democrats is meant to obscure.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Insurgents Take Up Politics, Raising Tensions

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT; Yasir Ghazi and Omar al-Jawoshy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- It was one of the deadliest insurgent groups in Iraq in recent years, an Iranian-backed militia that bombed American military convoys and bases, assassinated dozens of Iraqi officials and tried to kidnap Americans even as the last soldiers withdrew.
But now the Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki is welcoming the militant group into Iraq's political system, a move that could tilt the nation's center of gravity closer to Iran. The government's support for the militia, which only just swore off violence, has opened new sectarian fault lines in Iraq's political crisis while potentially empowering Iran at a moment of rising military and economic tensions between Tehran and Washington.
The militant group, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, broke away from the fierce Shiite militia commanded by the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has strong ties to Tehran. The American military has long maintained that the group, led by a former spokesman for Mr. Sadr, Qais al-Khazali, was trained and financed by Iran's elite Quds Force -- something that Iran denies. 
Since the American military withdrawal last month, Iraq has been convulsed with waves of attacks that have raised concerns about its political stability. On Thursday, bombings killed at least 68 people, including 44 Shiite pilgrims in a single attack in the southern deserts near Nasiriya. With that backdrop of violence, the Iraqi government can plausibly claim that its overtures to the group are an earnest attempt to make peace with a powerful armed foe while nudging the country closer to a much-needed national reconciliation.
Thousands of other militants, both Sunni and Shiite, have cut deals with the government to stop fighting, and few officials see a meaningful peace in Iraq that does not include reconciling with armed groups. On Thursday, Asaib Ahl al-Haq made another conciliatory gesture, saying it would release the body of a British bodyguard, Alan McMenemy, who was kidnapped in 2007 with four others, only one of whom was released alive.
Yet, critics worry that Mr. Maliki, facing fierce new challenges to his leadership from Sunnis and even his fellow Shiites, may now be making a cynical and shortsighted play for Asaib's support. They say Mr. Maliki may use the group's credentials as Shiite resistance fighters to divide challengers in his own Shiite coalition and weaken Mr. Sadr's powerful bloc, which draws its political lifeblood from the Shiite underclass.
By doing so, Iraq's government could embolden a militia with an almost nonexistent track record of peace while potentially handing Tehran greater influence in a country where the United States spent billions of dollars and lost nearly 4,500 American soldiers in nearly nine years of war.
''I think it is a dangerous step, this move by the government, to join with groups that do not believe in the peaceful political process,'' said Osama al-Nujaifi, the speaker of Iraq's Parliament and a Sunni Arab. ''They use the political with one hand and military forces with the other hand.''
Moreover, some American and Iraqi officials are leery about whether Asaib Ahl al-Haq -- the name translates as League of the Righteous -- is truly ready to forswear violence, especially with thousands of American diplomats and security contractors still in the country. Mr. Maliki's recent attempts to marginalize the country's Sunni minority and consolidate power have amplified their fears and, not coincidentally, precipitated a political crisis.
''They have blood on their hands, and it's not just American blood,'' a senior United States military official said of Asaib Ahl al-Haq. ''I am all for forgiveness and reconciliation, but they are -- and I think always will be -- beholden to their masters in Iran.''
In June, Asaib Ahl al-Haq and other militias said to be backed by Iran conducted rocket attacks on American bases that resulted in the deaths of 13 soldiers, making the month the worst for combat-related deaths for United States forces in Iraq since 2008. Military officials also said the group was responsible for the last American combat death in Iraq, a November roadside bomb attack in Baghdad.
''It's not a good sign that Maliki is so keen to work with a group that has been responsible for the deaths of many Americans,'' said Marisa Cochrane Sullivan, deputy director at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington and an expert on Asaib Ahl al-Haq. ''A.A.H. having a prominent role in the government is not in the interest of the United States.''
Asaib Ahl al-Haq's public shift comes at a delicate time for United States interests in the region. A political crisis is consuming Baghdad's government in the wake of the American military withdrawal. Iran, wounded by punishing economic sanctions, recently threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping channel for oil in the Persian Gulf, including about 80 percent of Iraq's oil exports.
With American forces gone and new opportunities emerging from Iraq's splintering political landscape, Iraqi officials and political commentators say the leaders of Asaib Ahl al-Haq have caught a whiff of the patronage, money and influence that lie in Iraqi politics. They appear eager to follow the path to power blazed by Mr. Sadr's political compatriots, who control 40 seats in Parliament and seven ministries.
''Maliki has kept at this thing and under the context of the withdrawal has been able to draw them out of the armed conflict,'' said a Western diplomat familiar with the discussions between Mr. Maliki and the group.
It remains to be seen whether Asaib Ahl al-Haq will be able to make any mark on the political scene now that its main antagonists have left Iraq. Sunni Muslims are wary of the group's history, and Mr. Sadr and his Shiite followers despise it for what they consider to be the group's treasonous public split with Mr. Sadr.
Mr. Maliki's government has avoided any overt pledges to support the group in Iraq's next elections. ''We welcome those who want to join the political process and give up their weapons, no matter whether they are Sunni or Shiite,'' said Hassan al-Suneid, a lawmaker from Mr. Maliki's State of Law coalition.
American officials made efforts to bring a disarmed Asaib Ahl al-Haq into Iraq's government as early as 2009, even releasing Mr. Khazali, and his brother, Laith, from prison.
''Khazali was telling us when he was being interrogated that they were ready to lay down their arms,'' said a Western diplomat, referring to the group's founder. ''We released those guys, and they went back to Iran and didn't exactly lay down their arms.''
At an officially sanctioned rally last week in central Baghdad, hundreds of the group's members and supporters gathered in a public square that was previously the stage for pro-democracy demonstrations. For hours, they celebrated the insurgents who fought American troops in Iraq, waving banners and screening triumphal videos of their deadly attacks on American Humvees, tanks and convoys.
Standing in front of Asaib's emblem -- a hand making a two-fingered peace sign flanked by silhouetted insurgents -- Mr. Khazali praised the Iraqis who had spilled blood fighting American forces, and said that the insurgents had forced the American withdrawal.
Later, in an interview with the group's television station, Mr. Khazali struck a populist tone as he discussed the role it might one day play in Iraqi politics.
''We want the people to concentrate on their power, to correct the errors of the politicians,'' he said. ''We know our strength and how much influence we can have.''

HEADLINE: Holding a Spot for Stigma In the City's Food Stamp Lines

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
Angela Sesma sped down a flight of stairs two steps at a time, then made a quick left out the front door of a city office building, onto Jerome Avenue in the Bronx. It was nearly 12:30 Thursday afternoon, and Ms. Sesma had been shifting from line to seat since 9 in the morning to straighten out a problem with her food stamps. She had to get to work. She also had her child to attend to. So she was in a hurry.
''I'm here all morning already,'' Ms. Sesma, 37, said. 
Others drifted out, blinking into the midday sun. ''The line goes down the block an hour before the office opens,'' said a woman who emerged from the office and would give her name only as Pat.
And The Wall Street Journal reported this week that so many people showed up on Nov. 14 at a similar city welfare office on DeKalb Avenue in Brooklyn that fire marshals were called to clear the building.
As the city's main relief agency groans under the loads of people who are looking for help, the mayor and his administration want to cling to a time-consuming custom from another era: the finger-imaging of everyone who applies for food stamps. Every other state, except for Arizona, has either dropped finger-imaging -- the digital descendant of fingerprinting -- for food stamp applicants, or never had it.
This week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that he would end the practice in New York, saying it was an unnecessary stigma for working people who needed a hand during hard times.
Other technology has made it unnecessary: when fingerprinting was started in New York nearly 20 years ago, food stamps were pieces of paper easily traded, and digital networks were in embryonic states. Now the food aid is distributed on ATM-type cards that are electronically refilled. And it is a simple matter to check multiple databases to see if duplicate applications have been filed by a person using the same Social Security numbers.
But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Thursday that finger-imaging was no big deal, and he appeared to betray some contempt for food stamp recipients in terms that seemed to contradict the realities of the modern food stamp program.
Food stamps are now geared largely to the working poor -- not to people getting cash welfare benefits, a point repeatedly made by Mr. Bloomberg's own commissioners.
Nevertheless, in his comments on Thursday, the mayor characterized food stamps as a handout being sought by people who were not working to improve the city, and compared them with city workers.
Almost every city employee has to go through the finger-imaging procedure, Mr. Bloomberg said, so to ask that of ''people who are receiving things, rather than dedicating their lives to make it better, is hardly something that's a great imposition or that anybody should feel stigmatized about.''
This is not a fight that is going to last long. Mr. Cuomo can change the rules without going to the Legislature. When Eliot Spitzer was governor, he banned finger-imaging for food stamps but granted an exemption to New York City and a few other counties upstate. Mr. Cuomo intends to withdraw that waiver, his aides say.
The city reports that more than twice as many people are getting food stamps as when Mr. Bloomberg came into office, and that the procedures are much simpler. So there is no proof that the finger-imaging process is a barrier to people who legitimately need the assistance, said Robert Doar, the commissioner of the city's Human Resources Administration. However, a study by the Urban Institute suggested that tens of thousands of eligible people were discouraged by the procedure.
The finger-imaging discovered 1,900 duplicate applications last year, Mr. Bloomberg said, down from about 35,000 in the early 1990s. The city does not claim that all or even most of those were examples of fraud; Mr. Doar said that administrative errors were responsible for some.
Maggie Dickinson, who works at the Greenpoint Reformed Church Pantry in Brooklyn, said she had no doubt that the finger-imaging was stopping eligible people from trying to obtain food stamps.
One woman, a middle-class person who had lost her job and was living on unemployment benefits, had refused for nearly two years to apply for food stamps because of the finger-imaging, Ms. Dickinson said in testimony before the City Council. ''She started crying, and telling me she didn't want to do it, because it made her feel like a criminal,'' Ms. Dickinson said. ''But she was in a desperate situation. It took this woman literally getting to the end of her 99 weeks and having no income to overcome the psychological barrier.''

HEADLINE: Playoff Matchups: A Lot of Offense, a Little Defense

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: While some of the N.F.L.'s most explosive offenses will be on display this weekend, so will its top defense. 

 BODY:
Lions (10-6) at Saints (13-3)
From the birth of the N.F.L. until 1960, no quarterback ever threw for more than 3,000 yards. As recently as 1997, it was still possible for Jeff George to lead the league with less than 4,000 yards passing: 3,917, to be exact. For most of football's history, a 3,000-yard season was an accomplishment, 4,000 yards were a feat and 5,000 yards marked the distance from home to the nearest hardware store, not an attainable passing goal.
Saturday will mark the first time that two quarterbacks who threw for over 5,000 yards in a season will face each other. While Drew Brees - who broke Dan Marino's single-season record by throwing for 5,476 yards - is getting his due as one of the league's best passers, Matthew Stafford (5,038) could not even muster a Pro Bowl selection. Stafford's numbers are partially a reflection of passing inflation, but he has also been unfairly overshadowed this season, not just by Brees and Aaron Rodgers, the favorite to be the N.F.L.'s most valuable player, but by his own team's tortuous climb out of a decade-long funk, the acrobatic excellence of his best receiver and his defense's attempt to jump-start the economy by increasing the demand for yellow penalty flags.
When the Lions have the ball The Lions use shotgun formations on 68 percent of all offensive plays, the highest percentage in the N.F.L. (the league average is 40.1 percent). Stafford's primary weapon, Calvin Johnson, was the third-most targeted receiver in the league with 158 passes. (Atlanta's Roddy White and New England's Wes Welker finished first and second.) Johnson compensates for the Lions' poor running game by doubling as the team's top threat in the red zone: he has caught nine touchdowns passes on plays that start inside the 20-yard line. Tight ends Brandon Pettigrew and Tony Scheffler also make great short-yardage options (10 combined red-zone targets), and they work underneath so the rookie receiver Titus Young can supplement Johnson as a deep threat. The Lions have running backs, but they ignore them, and you can, too. 
Gregg Williams's blitz-heavy defense yielded just 33 sacks and 16 takeaways this season. Only the Patriots and the Packers allowed more passing yards than the Saints, and they compensated by producing 31 and 23 interceptions to the Saints' nine. Many of those passing yards were the result of opponents trying to keep pace with the Saints' offense, but Williams does not have the same manpower he had when the Saints reached the Super Bowl two years ago.
When the Saints have the ball Whole articles can be filled with impressive Brees statistics, but we will settle for one: his completion percentage over the last three seasons is 69.9, better than all but three quarterbacks have ever mustered in a single season. Sean Payton's offense makes the most of Brees's accuracy and ability to distribute the ball to legions of potential targets. Nine different players have caught at least 10 passes for the Saints this season, led by Jimmy Graham, a college basketball forward turned mismatch nightmare at tight end. Despite their reputation as a pass-happy team, the Saints often line up in the I-formation and pound the ball. Saints running backs combined for 2,127 yards, and Brees's long touchdown throws are often set up by play-fakes.
The Lions' notorious defensive line recorded just 36 sacks this season, though they committed 43 penalties in the process. The Lions rarely blitz, so while their sack totals are low, Cliff Avril, Ndamukong Suh, Kyle Vanden Bosch and their linemates provide enough pressure for Jim Schwartz to keep seven defenders back in coverage, minimizing the risk of breakdowns.
Pick In what will probably be a shootout, the Lions' inability to run the football and their tendency to spot opponents 100 penalty yards will matter much more than their lack of postseason experience. Saints
Bengals (9-7) at Texans (10-6)
Two rookie quarterbacks will face off in the playoffs for the first time, and you will be able to tell. Before the pyrotechnics of the Saints and the Lions, the boom-or-bust bombing of the Giants and the Falcons, and the Broncos' homage to Depression-era strategies, T.J.Yates and Andy Dalton will demonstrate just how fast they can pedal bicycles with training wheels. Both are gutsy, resilient and all of those other things we say quarterbacks are when they reel off a few close wins, but both are also propped up by simplified passing schemes that allow them to throw a long pass here, a screen there and hand off anywhere and everywhere. The Texans came back to beat the Bengals, 20-19, in the regular season, and this game promises to be just as close, if only because neither team is a safe bet to score that 21st point.
When the Texans have the ball Gary Kubiak's zone-blocking, run-oriented offense was easy to scale back when injuries to Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart forced Yates into the lineup. Zone blocking requires linemen to move laterally, double-team defenders and slip out to block any linebacker who attempts to attack a particular gap. An adjunct to zone blocking is cut blocking, which is legal but frowned upon, and the Texans linemen Duane Brown and Chris Myers are among the most feared cut blockers in the league. Watch the line, and you will see defenders fall down in pursuit as if the Texans strung the field with piano wire. Watching the line carnage will be far more interesting than watching the passing game: Yates averages 8.2 yards per pass on first down, when opponents fear the run, but just 5.9 yards per pass on third down, when Kubiak does not want his young passer to take risks.
When the Bengals have the ball The rookie A.J. Green does not have to get open to catch a long pass. If the ball is in his vicinity, and if his defenders do not have rocket packs, he will likely outjump them. Green has caught 15 of the 29 bombs thrown to him this season (a "bomb" being defined as any pass that goes 20 or more yards in the air), gaining 562 yards, scoring 4 touchdowns and drawing 4 pass interference penalties as a bonus. Bombs to Green and Jerome Simpson - the guy who did the flip in the end-zone that you will see in every highlight reel ever made for eternity - provide the Bengals with the bulk of their offense: running backs Cedric Benson and Bernard Scott are plow horses, and tight end Jermaine Gresham is the only viable short-passing option. The Bengals even use six offensive linemen in some of their formations, a tactic which demonstrates their commitment to running and bombing. Because Green and Simpson need room to maneuver, the Bengals often stall at the red zone: they were 11 of 26 on touchdown conversions inside the 20 in the second half of the season.
The defensive coordinator Wade Phillips will call plays from the coach's box after missing two late-season games while recovering from surgery, and the Texans appeared to miss his leadership in losses to the Panthers and the Colts. His game plan on Saturday should not be too complex, however: assign his top cornerback, Johnathan Joseph, to Green in man coverage, keep a safety deep and let the rest take care of itself.
Pick The Bengals settled for field goals in their last meeting with the Texans, and it cost them. It will cost them again. Texans
Falcons (10-6) at Giants (9-7)
It is possible to arrive at the same place by multiple paths. After getting crushed by the Packers in last year's playoffs, the Falcons decided they were just a playmaker or two short of the Super Bowl. General Manager Thomas Dimitroff engineered a daring draft-day trade to acquire the rookie receiver Julio Jones, then signed defensive end Ron Edwards to upgrade the pass rush. The moves worked - Jones caught 54 passes, Edwards added three and a half sacks and solid run defense - but holes opened up on the offensive line and the secondary, and the Falcons are no further along than they were in 2010: good, but an obvious notch below the elite teams in the conference.
The Giants, meanwhile, treated the lockout as a duck-and-cover drill, hoping that continuity and player development would compensate for free-agent losses. Thanks to the emergences of Jason Pierre-Paul and Victor Cruz, typically excellent play on the defensive line and a businesslike approach to battling through injuries and losing streaks, the Giants are not only hosting a playoff game against one of the league's favorite Next Big Things, but they are favored to win it.
When the Giants have the ball Most of the Giants' big plays come when Cruz is in the slot, matched up against a nickel defender or safety while the opponent's top cornerbacks take on Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham. This strategy was particularly effective against the Jets and the Cowboys, though defensive coordinators who do not spend the work week polishing their news conference bon mots may have caught on to Kevin Gilbride's (extremely simple) tactic. Falcons cornerback Brent Grimes (knee) missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play. The Falcons typically keep Grimes on the left side of the formation, but his return may allow cornerback Dunta Robinson to move inside to cover Cruz.
Falcons linebackers Stephen Nicholas (toe) and Sean Witherspoon (head) may not play. Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw has caught just 10 passes in five games since returning from a foot injury, but look for him to be more involved in the passing game if he is matched up against any Falcons linebacker but their leading tackler, Curtis Lofton.
When the Falcons have the ball Everyone has a well-established role in the Falcons' offense. Roddy White is the go-to receiver, Jones the deep threat, Tony Gonzalez the short-yardage receiver, Michael Turner the battering ram running back and Jason Snelling the third-down back who blocks and catches dump-off passes. Jones (17.8 yards per catch) and White (the league's most targeted receiver with 180 passes) stretch defenses enough to make this by-the-numbers offense viable, and quarterback Matt Ryan overcame an early-season slump by learning to rely on Gonzalez and Snelling more often.
The Falcons had to shuffle their offensive line early in the season when the play of the once-promising left tackle Sam Baker rapidly deteriorated. Will Svitek replaced Baker, who briefly moved inside to replace the penalty-prone Joe Hawley at right guard before flunking out at that position. Svitek and Hawley are adequate-at-best starters, and the Falcons will use play-fakes to Turner and maximum protection to keep the Giants' front four away from Ryan.
Pick The Falcons are no longer a receiver and a pass rusher from a deep playoff run. They are now a linebacker and a left tackle away. Giants
Steelers (12-4) at Broncos (8-8)
We all know what happens when an immovable force meets an irresistible object: an explosion of cliches results. But what happens when a team that lets weak opponents hang around until the final minutes faces a weak opponent that reached the playoffs by hanging around until the final minutes? The answer is simple: a low-scoring game that hinges on one or two big plays.
The Broncos are one of the weakest playoff participants in years. Opponents outscored them by 81 points over the course of the season; by contrast, the 5-11 Redskins were outscored by just 79 points. Denver's passing game is a throwback to the Studebaker era, and while its defense can smother weak opponents, it cracked late in the year under the strain of trying to pitch a shutout every week. Then again, the Seahawks were pretty weak last year, and they beat the Saints. With Ben Roethlisberger hobbling on a re-injured ankle and running back Rashard Mendenhall out, the Steelers lack the firepower to score the 24 points needed to put the game out of reach of Tim Tebow's fading magic. The Steelers will try to grind out one of their 13-9 wins, but the Broncos have a knack for turning those into 16-13 overtime upsets.
When the Broncos have the ball Tebow runs a scaled-back version of the spread-option offense used by many college teams. Most plays begin with a fake (or real) handoff to Willis McGahee and the threat of a Tebow keeper; passing plays are designed to exploit the defensive indecision caused by the run action. The passing game takes a long time to warm up, and Tebow completes just 41 percent of his first-half passes, averaging just 4.4 yards per attempt. The rushing game compensates to a degree, and John Fox often uses the threat of a Tebow keeper as a surrogate for a pass: the Broncos lead the N.F.L in running plays on 3rd-and-medium (4 to 8 yards), and Fox will punt and give his defense a chance rather than risk a turnover. In late-and-close situations, Tebow becomes Randall Cunningham from the 1980s, capable of running around until the defense is out of position, then delivering a game-changing play.
The Steelers' defense is one of the league's great constants: their ability to apply pressure from all angles, disguise their coverage and (critically) pursue and corral fast quarterbacks will keep the Broncos' offense in low gear. Safety Ryan Clark (altitude-affected anemia) cannot play, taking away the Steelers' best deep defender, but the Broncos will be without guard Chris Kuper (broken leg), which will make it easier for the Steelers to crash the middle on option fakes.
When the Steelers have the ball Like their defense, the Steelers' offense is familiar to most fans. They line up in a single-back formation, with receivers and tight ends bunched to one side of the field, and mix power runs with a hefty dose of wide-receiver screens. Steelers receivers have caught 62 of 79 screen passes thrown to them, for 421 yards, and once defenders start crowding the line to stop short passes, Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown start going deep. Roethlisberger's injuries are the inevitable result of his willingness to take hits instead of dumping the ball to a running back. Roethlisberger has taken 40 sacks, while the Steelers' top two running backs have combined for just 36 receptions. With Mendenhall out, Isaac Redman will get the bulk of carries. Redman accomplished the rare feat of gaining more yards per rush (4.4) than reception (4.3) this season.
The Broncos pass rushers Elvis Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 21 sacks, 42 quarterback hits and countless disrupted plays. With the pass rush causing havoc and the future Hall of Famer Champ Bailey still capable of shutting down most top receivers, opponents frequently get lulled into punt battles with the Broncos. Denver excels in that kind of game: Britton Colquitt finished second in the league in punts inside the 20-yard line, and two return men (Eddie Royal and Eric Decker) brought back punts for touchdowns this year.
Pick The Broncos are the surrogate Ravens: the team that throws a postseason scare into the Steelers with sacks and one or two offensive lightning strikes, but ultimately falls short. Steelers

HEADLINE: Mother in Custody After Death of Girl, 2, in Brooklyn

BYLINE: AL BAKER and TIM STELLOH


HIGHLIGHT: The blood-covered girl, with puncture wounds to her neck and face, was found cradled in her babbling mother's arms in an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant before dawn on Friday. The girl's mother is in custody. 

 BODY:
10:21 p.m. | Updated Officers responding early Friday to a call of a jumper on the roof of a four-story building in Brooklyn found a blood trail leading down to Apartment 4A. The door was ajar, and when they walked in, the police said, the picture got even worse: A young mother was sitting on a couch in the living room, babbling and cradling her fatally wounded 2-year-old girl.
The girl, identified by officials as Cathryn Nwegbo, was in cardiac arrest with puncture and strangulation wounds to her neck and face, one city official said, adding that she also had "major bleeding to the back of her head."
One officer took the girl - who was wearing only a diaper - into his arms and raced for the stairs, yelling, "She is not breathing," the official said. Emergency Medical Service workers took her to Woodhull Medical Center, where she was declared dead. 
Other responders, meanwhile, attended to the mother, identified as Brandis Nwegbo, 29, but she resisted. She had a cut on the right side of her face, but when paramedics tried to treat her, she withdrew and warned them not to touch her, the city official said.
She told the medical responders, "I only just trust the white blanket," the official said. It was not clear what she meant.
She was taken into custody and driven to Woodhull for psychiatric evaluation, officials said. Investigators said they believed that Ms. Nwegbo killed her child in their apartment at 1078 Putnam Avenue, on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick. No charges had been placed as of Friday evening. A large fish tank that was in the home was found smashed when the police arrived about 4 a.m., and investigators were trying to determine if shards were used as a weapon, one official said.
The city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services, did not have an open file on the child, who was 2 years old, according to an official with knowledge of the case. The agency did, however, receive a report in April 2010 that Ms. Nwegbo, while living with her daughter in a homeless shelter in the city, was involved in an altercation with another shelter resident, the official said. But Cathryn was not hurt in that incident, and "there were no allegations that the mother was abusive of the child," one official said.
Ms. Nwegbo's father, Lawrence Nwegbo, 58, originally from Nigeria, said he was stunned by the news about his daughter and granddaughter.
"I don't think she has any problems," said Mr. Nwegbo, a loan officer in Dallas who said he had not spoken to his daughter in six months. "She is very happy with the baby."
Neighbors and friends of Ms. Nwegbo's said she appeared to be a loving mother, but was struggling financially and had little support. She was growing increasingly distraught, one said. Another, Jessica, 28, who would only provide her first name, said Ms. Nwegbo had previously lived in the Rose F. Kennedy homeless shelter, in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
A spokeswoman for the city's homeless services department confirmed that Ms. Nwegbo lived at the shelter from June 2009 to April 2010 - and that her daughter was born in that period. A workman at the Putnam Avenue building, who declined to give his name, said the family had lived there for a year and a half. He said a city worker came about twice a month to check on the woman and her daughter.
In 2009, police officers responded to a domestic incident at the home of Ms. Nwegbo's mother, Emma Kent Traore, on Rutland Road in Brooklyn, an official said. Ms. Traore told officers "her daughter was not respecting her," the official said, but no charges were filed. Reached by phone, Ibrahim Traore, who said he was once married to Ms. Nwegbo's mother, said there came a time when Ms. Nwegbo moved away from home. She went to school, "but decided to jump out and look for a job," he said. She worked in a Manhattan restaurant, was let go, and then pursued other things like making hand jewelry, he said.
Though officials said Ms. Nwegbo was employed when she left the shelter, Cyril Joseph, the director of the Linden-Bushwick Community Garden, where he met Ms. Nwegbo a couple of years ago and where she planted herbs and volunteered, said she was now unemployed and facing eviction from her apartment.
To stay here, Mr. Joseph said, Ms. Nwegbo needed a letter showing her daughter was in day care, which he said she could not afford. "She's going through stress," Mr. Joseph said. He said she did not know "which way to turn or where to go."
Last August, knowing that Ms. Nwegbo had financial problems and no job prospects, Mr. Joseph, 67, said he offered to adopt Cathryn, but Ms. Nwegbo turned him down; she was a loving, protective mother who would never harm her daughter, he said.
"Cathryn is the heart of Brandis," Mr. Joseph said.
"This is the very, very last thing I thought Brandis would do," he said, adding, "It's not the Brandis I know. The Brandis I know would take a bullet for that child."

HEADLINE: A Children's Story

BYLINE: CATHY HORYN


HIGHLIGHT: Two months ago Hayley Parker-Barker and her husband introduced their boys' clothing line, Culdesac, on the Web, which allowed them to combine their skills and, as well, to significantly lower their learning curve. 

 BODY:
When I first met Hayley Parker-Barker, in 2007, she was just Hayley Parker, a sweet, level-headed senior at F.I.T. and an intern at Narciso Rodriguez. She acquired Barker when she married her husband, Cameron, whom she has known since they were toddlers. And now they have a child of their own, Ender, and live near Salt Lake City, where Cameron is studying computer programming.
But I digress. Well, actually, careers these days are one big digression. "We just sort of boomeranged," Ms. Parker-Barker, 25, said brightly of the last few years. She thought, as many fashion graduates did, that she would be living in New York, working for a big-name designer and eating pizza at Roberta's. But the recession, as well as a rekindled romance with Cameron and a return to Utah, changed that. Ms. Parker-Barker isn't complaining, though.
Two months ago she and her husband introduced their boys' clothing line, Culdesac, on the Web, which allowed them to combine their skills and, as well, to significantly lower their learning curve. Ms. Parker-Barker isn't a novice entrepreneur. While in college she began doing hand-drawn designs on sneakers. "Basically anything under the sun - graffiti, album covers, robots," she said. Patricia Field took several pairs on consignment; they sold, and Ms. Parker-Barker decided to e-mail other retailers, including Sarah Lerfel of Colette in Paris. "One day Sarah came to my little apartment" on the Lower East Side, she said, still sounding excited. Colette sold the 15 pairs it ordered.
Ms. Parker-Barker also got her shoes into 10 Corso Como in Milan, and some magazines, but the problem was that she was unable to make the shoes in quantity. She briefly considered having them made in China. "I heard they have communities of artists in China that can replicate anything, even hand-drawn sneakers," she said.
Instead, Ms. Parker-Barker, newly married, decided to move back to Utah, to be closer to the couple's families. She taught art for awhile. And she continued to practice her pattern-making and draping. In hindsight her internships - at Kate Spade, Moschino, Narciso Rodriguez - were invaluable. "Working at Narciso gave me a great idea of how a true designer works," she said. "He does everything there."
Last year Ms. Parker-Barker and her husband decided to create a children's line, with Cameron building the site. "I just had a hard time finding non-graphic T-shirts for our son and things that didn't have trucks on them," she said. She also felt that boys' clothes looked too boxy. "It's that age-old feeling of 'there's nothing out there, let's make something,' " she said. Although girls can wear the Culdesac designs, she wanted to focus on boys. "I didn't think there were good options for boys, especially in suiting," she said.
She looked into making the clothes in New York or Los Angeles, but factories wanted large minimum orders. In the end, she made everything in Utah, using home seamstresses she found on Craigslist. "There's just a vast amount of local talent," she said.
I asked Ms. Parker-Barker what she has learned from her homegrown enterprise. She laughed and said: "It's been unimaginable, like how hard it is to find fabric that can be reordered. It's like a secret society, with suppliers who are very old school. That was the hardest thing." She and her husband also realized that since she is doing the patterns and fitting herself, it's wiser to have a few styles rather many.
The first season has nearly sold out and she is working on a new collection, which will be available in March.
"Women's wear is still my love," Ms. Parker-Barker said. But the initiative she has shown with Culdesac has demonstrated a point to her. As she said: "I design everything in a week. It's the fittings and the patternmaking that take the most time. That's where the real skill comes in that makes the company."

HEADLINE: U.S. Navy Rescues Iranians Held by Pirates

BYLINE: ROBERT MACKEY and J. DAVID GOODMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Thirteen Iranians whose fishing vessel had been seized by pirates in November were rescued by the United States Navy in the North Arabian Sea, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 

 BODY:
Updated | 6:33 p.m. In the middle of a tense standoff between Iran and the United States, the crew of an American destroyer patrolling the North Arabian Sea rescued 13 Iranian fishermen who had been taken hostage by Somali pirates more than a month ago, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 
In a conference call with reporters, Rear Adm. Craig S. Faller, the commander of an American carrier strike group that was threatened by Iran's navy on Tuesday, explained that the U.S.S. Kidd, an American destroyer, intercepted the Iranian-flagged Mulahi on Thursday after receiving a distress call. After a show of force from the destroyer, 15 pirates on board were convinced to lay down their weapons and surrender to a boarding party from the Kidd.
Our colleague C.J. Chivers, who is reporting on the carrier group's work, was taken on board the fishing boat after the pirates surrendered. His complete report on the rescue will be published soon, but he sent us a note saying that the Iranians "greeted the American sailors with wide-eyed relief."
"It is like you were sent by God," said one of the rescued fishermen, Fazel Ur Rehman, 28, huddled under a blanket in the vessel's stern as sailors from the Kidd's boarding team watched over the deflated pirates on the deck of the pitching bow. "Every night we prayed for God to rescue us. And now you are here." 
On Friday, after the pirates were transferred to a detention facility aboard the John C. Stennis, an aircraft carrier, the crew of the fishing vessel was provided with food and left for home, wearing U.S.S. Kidd baseball caps. 
According to the commanding officer of the Kidd, Cmdr. Jennifer L. Ellinger, the Iranian ship's master initially told the Americans by radio that there were no pirates on board, but he managed to indicate that he was speaking under duress. Then, in what Commander Ellinger interpreted as an attempt to speak to the Americans in a language that the pirates could not understand, the captain of the fishing boat said in Urdu -- a Pakistani language related to Persian -- that his crew had been physically abused by the pirates and pleaded for help.
Commander Ellinger said a helicopter sent from the Kidd to get a closer look at the Iranian-flagged ship spotted the pirates on board. Two brief video clips released by the Navy showed the pirates waiting to surrender, with their hands in the air, as an American craft approached the fishing vessel just after noon local time on Thursday.
Commander Ellinger said the Iranians "were extremely grateful" to the sailors who rescued them. The crew told the Americans that they had been taken hostage more than a month ago and their ship had been used in pirate operations from the North Arabian Sea to the coast of Somalia.
It was the second time in a week that the carrier, which left the Persian Gulf for the North Arabian Sea late last month, was in the news. On Tuesday, the Iranian military warned that it would take unspecified action if the aircraft carrier returned to the gulf.
The Pentagon said the Iranian fishing crew had been held for 40 to 45 days in harsh conditions by 15 pirates, with limited food and water, as the pirates used the Iranian-flagged Mulahi as a "mother ship" in further raids. "They were held hostage, with limited rations, and we believe were forced against their will to assist the pirates with other piracy operations," said Josh Schminky, a Navy Criminal Investigative Service agent. 
The freeing of the Iranians seemed to offer the United States an unexpected public relations coup, but Admiral Faller denied that the rescue was motivated by anything more than routine concern for the safety of fellow sailors. "One of our obligations as mariners out here is to save lives at sea," the admiral said. "We'd do that for any country in the world." He added that this was not the first time Iranians had been rescued at sea by American sailors.
The rescue of the Iranians appeared to put the Iranian government in an awkward position as it strikes a defiant posture in the face of new economic sanctions attacking its oil exports. On Thursday, Iranian officials called the intensified efforts to halt Iran's nuclear program tantamount to "an economic war," and vowed to conduct a new round of military drills near the Strait of Hormuz.
The Iranian military, fresh off 10 days of naval exercises near the strait that ended this week, said it would hold a new round of war games soon. The defense minister, Brig. Ahmad Vahidi, in comments reported by the semiofficial Fars news agency late Thursday, said the military's exercises would be its "greatest naval war games" and would occur "in the same region in the near future."

HIGHLIGHT: A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
 A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions
OPTIMISM FOR DEALS Deal volume tumbled in the second half of 2011, but Wall Street is growing confident that 2012 will be better for business, Evelyn M. Rusli reports. Stock and credit markets are steadier, financing is cheap, corporate balance sheets have large amounts of cash and companies "that have already cut costs may decide that they need to make acquisitions to drive growth in the face of a tepid economy."
DEALBOOK COLUMN Andrew Ross Sorkin hosted his annual toast and roast the world of finance - and looks ahead to the new year. The biggest loser: AT&T's attempted $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobil. The biggest winner: Richard Handler, the chief of Jefferies & Company.
Private Equity
A FUTURE IN FLATWARE Oneida's new owner, Monomoy Capital Partners, is helping the 132-year-old cutlery company rise from the aftermath of bankruptcy, and expansion is now the goal, Kevin Roose reports. 
"How a 132-year-old flatware company ended up in the hands of a Manhattan private equity firm illustrates the woes of American manufacturing - and possibly, a way to improve its fortunes.
"Last year, buyout shops bought 361 industrial companies, with many deals under $150 million, like the Oneida deal, according to Preqin, a research firm."
Hedge Funds
RAILWAY CLASHES WITH ACKMAN "The directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway have rebuked the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, rejecting his plan to replace the rail line's chief executive with a former rival," Ian Austen reports.
I.P.O./Offerings
MARKET FOR I.P.O.'S STAYS COOL "It will take more than Facebook to heat up the tepid market for initial public offerings," Ms. Rusli reports. "As conditions remain fragile, the backlog of public offerings has continued to grow. More than 200 American companies are now waiting to go public, the highest number in roughly a decade, according to Renaissance Capital, an advisory firm."
BARNES & NOBLE SPIN OFF The nation's largest book chain said that it was "considering spinning off its Nook e-reader division in an effort to help the nascent - and expensive - digital business grow," Julie Bosman and Michael J. de la Merced report.
Legal/Regulatory
FAIR GAME Gretchen Morgenson argues that 2011 was a year of me-firsts, and lessons relearned. "Like the fact that banks love the perks that come with being too big to fail."
U.S. SHAREHOLDERS SUE LLOYDS American shareholders say that they were misled over the bank's rescue of HBOS in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008.
FED TO PUBLISH FORECAST "The Federal Reserve will begin later this month to publish the predictions of its senior officials about their own decisions, hoping to increase its influence over economic activity by guiding investor expectations," Binyamin Appelbaum reports.
U.S. CHARGES 3 SWISS BANKERS The bankers were charged with conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide more than $1.2 billion in assets from tax authorities. 
DODD-FRANK STRUGGLE "Establishing the Office of Financial Research has become another example of the struggle to put the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul into effect," William Alden reports.
SETBACK FOR BANK OF AMERICA A New York state judge made it easier for the bond insurer MBIA to pursue its $1.4 billion lawsuit accusing Countrywide Financial, a unit of Bank of America, of fraudulently inducing it to insure risky mortgage-backed securities. 
E.C.B. PICKS TOP ECONOMIST The European Central Bank unexpectedly named Peter Praet, a Belgian, its de facto chief economist, "breaking a tradition in which German hard-liners occupied that crucial policy-making post," Jack Ewing reports.
OBAMA APPOINTS CONSUMER CHIEF President Obama touched off a fierce election-year confrontation with Congressional Republicans, "defying their deep opposition to appoint Richard Cordray as director of a new consumer protection agency and fill three labor board vacancies," Helene Cooper and Jenifer Steinhauer report. 
Mr. Cordray outlined a vigorous oversight and enforcement agenda, Edward Wyatt reports. The new director said that financial companies that take unfair advantage of consumers would face "real consequences."
GUPTA'S INSIDER TRADING CHARGES Lawyers for Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs charged with insider trading, filed a flurry of pleadings, "seeking to dismiss counts, suppress wiretaps and force the government to clarify its indictment," Peter Lattman reports. Federal prosecutors say they are likely to file a new indictment, "possibly adding new criminal charges."
NEW LIMITS ON COMMODITY TRADES "A divided Commodity Futures Trading Commission has rebuffed a request from Wall Street to delay new restrictions on speculative commodities trading," Ben Protess reports.
MF GLOBAL INQUIRY "Federal authorities investigating the collapse of MF Global have expanded their inquiry to include the actions of the CME Group, the operator of the main exchange where the commodities brokerage firm conducted business," Mr. Protess and Azam Ahmed report.
SWISS BANK CHIEF ACCUSATIONS Philipp M. Hildebrand, head of the Swiss central bank, said "that he regretted currency trades that have threatened his international reputation as an advocate for tougher bank regulation," Mr. Ewing reports.

HEADLINE: Some Tips for Unemployed Older Americans

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: This week's Your Money column looks at the various tricks that older unemployed Americans may use until they find a new job or manage to eke their way to retirement. 

 BODY:
Though the latest jobs report provided some reason for tempered optimism, older Americans who find themselves unemployed are typically out of work much longer than their younger peers. And that can make the road to retirement much more challenging.
So in this week's Your Money column, I took a look at some of the tricks that older Americans might use to tide them over financially until they find work or manage to eke their way to retirement.
Did you lose your job in your 50s or 60s? If so, what did you do to make up for that lost income? Please share your tips and stories in the comment section below.

HEADLINE: What Are You Paying More for in 2012?

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: City Room asks readers what they are willing to hand over more cash for in the new year. 

 BODY:
The new year is a time for rebirth and renewal. It's also a time for businesses to squeeze a few more pennies out of their customers. 
New Yorkers will have to pay about ten cents more for a tall latte at Starbucks. A slot in the New York City Marathon just got pricier (approximately $2.29 more per mile), as will Garden State Parkway tolls. 
The weekday price for a newsstand copy of The New York Times just got more expensive, too, by 50 cents.
Inflation, the economists tell us, is pretty modest these days, running about 3 percent. That's just an average, though. At the start of every year, there are always a few unpleasant shocks to the wallet. 
What price increases have you been chagrined to discover this week? Is your morning bagel more expensive? The cost of a six pack of your favorite beer?
Tell us what you're paying more for now, and how much. Are these increases enough to make you change your consumption habits?

HEADLINE: Land Leveled in Divorce Awaits Economy's Return

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: More than five years after a doctor blew up his East Side town house, the valuable and empty parcel shows no sign of new life. 

 BODY:
It seems that Dr. Nicholas Bartha got what he apparently wanted: If he could not live in the town house on East 62nd Street, no one could.
In the five years since he is presumed to have blown it up, nothing has been built there.
The city approved plans for a replacement town house in 2007. But the lot remains empty - 2,000 expensive square feet, hidden behind a plywood fence. A peek reveals nothing to excite would-be sidewalk superintendents: no bulldozers, no foundation being dug, no bricks waiting to become straight new walls.
So what is happening with this bit of unbuilt New York?
"Very little, I'm sad to say," said Preston T. Phillips, an architect, who designed the replacement with Abelow Sherman Architects. "We have geared up twice to get it started. We have just had to pull back."
He blamed the recession and the real estate slowdown. "The economic downturn coincided almost immediately with the plans to begin," he said. "I think that every time there's a glimmer of hope in the economy, it turns the other way, and it's just kept the project at bay."
The lot was sold in 2007 to Janna Bullock, a Russian-born real estate developer. Tabloid newspapers have described how she went from baby-sitting in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, to private jets and an art collection. But in the go-go years, she appeared to have a knack for breathing new life into town houses and marketing them at a profit.
She paid $8.3 million for the East 62nd Street lot and announced plans for what promised to be the ultimate green town house. It was to have a geothermal heating and cooling system that involved channeling 1,500 feet down into the earth. There would be a system to collect rainwater runoff, clean it and use it to irrigate a garden on the roof.
Then the recession hit. The doormen at the apartment building next door - which had been rocked by the explosion - watched and wondered when the work would begin. "It's weird, being next to an empty lot," William Montanez, a building worker, said.
Dr. Bartha, 66, a physician, is believed to have destroyed the house to prevent a forced sale that would have involved dividing the proceeds with his ex-wife, Cordula. A sheriff's deputy had served him with eviction papers a few days earlier; about an hour before the blast, he sent Mrs. Bartha a rambling e-mail that said, among other things, "I always told you I will leave the house only if I am dead."
A long plastic tube was connected to the gas line in front of the house. Investigators thought Dr. Bartha unwound the tube, playing it out as he crossed the threshold.
Dr. Bartha, who weighed about 350 pounds, was pulled from the wreckage after the blast, still alive. He died five days later. The explosion also injured 10 firefighters and 5 passers-by.
As for the town house that Ms. Bullock had in mind for the site, a person associated with the project said that she was simply waiting for the real estate market to stabilize - that is, to reach a point where a "top-tier luxury contemporary town house" could be completed and sold without a lag. "She does not want it to sit on the market for any length of time," the person said.
Mr. Phillips, who has images of the planned town house on his Web site, said he had "a number of communications" with Ms. Bullock last summer.
"We had a financial meeting last July where it looked as if things were going to happen," he said, "and then it just never materialized."
He said he still hoped for a green light for the project, adding, "Her enthusiasm had not waned a bit."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Braces for Dismal 4th Quarter

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: Investors are about to find out just how bad last year was for the country's biggest financial institutions. 

 BODY:
For most Wall Street bankers, 2011 was a year they would rather forget. Investors will soon find out just how bad that year was for the country's biggest financial institutions.
In recent days, analysts have been lowering their fourth-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America. Analysts are also bracing for lower earnings from JPMorgan Chase, which on Friday will be the first of the Wall Street banks to report results.
"It's likely 2011 will be the worst year for revenue growth for the banks since 1938, and so far 2012 isn't feeling much better," said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities and the author of the recently published book "Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst's Fight to Save the Big Banks from Themselves." "The industry simply grew too fast over the past two decades and now it's downshifting. This process will take time, but the hit to revenue is happening now."
Wall Street banks have been buffeted by a weak economy in the United States and by concerns that the European debt crisis will spread, sending shock waves through the financial system.
At the same time, most banks are expected to book an accounting loss in the fourth quarter from the performance of their own debt. In the previous quarter, this one-time item significantly bolstered the earnings of a number of banks.
With business sluggish, Wall Street banks have been chopping staff and expenses. A dismal 2011 will translate into smaller employee bonuses, which most banks will begin handing out in the coming weeks. Compensation experts are estimating compensation for Wall Street employees could fall as much as 30 percent from levels a year ago. While sharply lower bonuses may be politically popular, they will also eat into the revenue that New York State collects from Wall Street.
The challenges facing Wall Street are illustrated by the performance of Goldman Sachs - for years the envy of rivals for its ability to churn out rich profits even in rough times - in recent quarters. In the third quarter, Goldman reported a loss of $428 million, in contrast to a $1.74 billion profit a year ago. Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, told investors that Goldman was "disappointed" in the performance.
For the fourth quarter, the firm is projected to post a profit of $2.02 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. That consensus number is down from $2.81 a month ago. And it is likely to fall further in the coming days as more analysts weigh in with new estimates. Some analysts already have Goldman, which reports on Jan. 18, earning less than $1 a share in the fourth quarter.
New regulations combined with a drop in client trading revenue and the falling value of some of its core equity holdings, like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a strategic investment the firm made in 2006, hurt Goldman in the third quarter. Equity markets, however, improved in the fourth quarter, so Goldman should gain from some of the same investments that ate into profits just a few months ago.
An analyst with Credit Suisse, Howard Chen, does not have high hopes for Goldman's fourth-quarter results.
"We're expecting a quiet finish to a challenging year for Goldman Sachs and the brokerage industry - while 2011 may now be in the rearview mirror, we do believe the year ended on a difficult note with highly depressed levels of institutional and corporate client risk appetite and year-end seasonal weakness," he wrote in a report issued on Thursday. Mr. Chen is predicting the firm will earn 70 cents in the fourth quarter.
Analysts are also notching down estimates for Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley was hit harder than Goldman by the financial crisis. While it is a major player in many areas Goldman dominates, like sales and trading, it decided after the financial crisis to make a big investment in wealth management, a lower risk business that tends to post steadier results.
So far the strategy, led by Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James Gorman, appears to be taking hold. The company earned $2.15 billion in the third quarter, up from a loss of $91 million in the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, however, Morgan Stanley will be taking a substantial one-time pretax earnings hit of $1.8 billion related to a recent legal settlement. This will translate into a per-share hit of 64 cents and will most likely put Morgan Stanley into the red in the quarter. Analysts are predicting the bank will lose 54 cents a share in the fourth quarter. A month ago, the consensus was for a profit of 29 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. (Morgan Stanley has not yet announced when it will report.)
Investors will also keep a close eye on Bank of America, which has also struggled to recover from the financial crisis. The firm's shares are now trading above $6, a nice bump given it was trading at about $5 just a few weeks ago. Its legacy mortgage business, however, remains a burden. Bank of America, which reports on Jan. 19, is projected to post a fourth quarter per-share profit of 20 cents, up from 4 cents in the quarter a year ago.
JPMorgan Chase weathered the financial storm better than some, in part because it has a large retail bank that produces fairly steady earnings. Still, it owns a big investment bank and it is not immune to the same issues facing its rivals. JPMorgan's profit dipped 4 percent, or $1.02 a share, in the third quarter, in part because of lingering mortgage problems. Analysts are projecting the firm will post a profit of 93 cents a share in the fourth quarter. The bank posted a per-share profit of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Citigroup is scheduled to report its earnings on Jan. 17. Analysts are forecasting that it will earn 76 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up from 40 cents in the year-ago period.
In a recent research note, Jeff Harte, an analyst at the brokerage house Sandler O'Neill, said Citigroup earnings would be dragged down by a number of one-time items, like severance payments to employees and credit hedging losses. Still, not all the news is bad.
"While we are also reducing our capital markets-related revenue estimates, the bottom-line impact should be offset substantially by lower-than-previously-expected credit costs," he wrote. Mr. Harte is predicting Citigroup will earn 43 cents a share.

HEADLINE: John Paulson's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Year

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The pain of 2011 has finally ended for John A. Paulson, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Paulson &#038; Company. His Advantage Plus fund? Down 52.5 percent for the year. 

 BODY:
The pain of 2011 has finally ended for John A. Paulson, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Paulson & Company. 
The results are not pretty.
His Advantage Plus fund lost 52.5 percent, the unleveraged Advantage fund fell 36 percent and his so-called Recovery fund, which was betting on the resurgence of the United States economy, dropped 28 percent. Mr. Paulson's credit fund was down 18 percent, the Paulson Partners fund 10 percent and the gold fund 10.5 percent. 
Wall Street has been alight with schadenfreude, as one of its most prominent and wealthy managers took it on the chin, month after month. 
Mr. Paulson secured his fortune and fame in 2007, with a huge bet against the subprime mortgage market that earned him billions of dollars. In 2010, he personally made about $5 billion with his investments, an extraordinary sum in an industry known for lavish payouts. 
Investors clamored to gain access to the manager. By the start of 2011, his funds had a colossal $38 billion under management. 
And then it all started to go wrong. Bets on a recovery in the United States turned sour. A company in which he owned a major stake was accused of fraud, and the stock price was decimated. Even gold turned against him, after proving a saving grace earlier in the year.
Very few manager of such prominence have ended a year so poorly. Kenneth C. Griffin of Citadel, the Chicago hedge fund giant, lost nearly as much in 2008 and is only now coming close to climbing out of the hole.
To recoup the losses, Mr. Paulson will need to generate returns in the neighborhood of 120 percent in his Advantage Plus fund, a tall order in a marketplace plagued by uncertainty and low interest rates. The others funds, while not down by as much, will require similar feats of wonder to recover.
Still, there has not been the exodus from the hedge fund that is typically seen after such a troubled year. And investors have more or less stuck by Mr. Paulson. The last time they were able to reclaim their money from the fund, most chose not to. Some even added more money.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Campaign Defends Remarks on Food Stamps

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: The campaign of Newt Gingrich was pushed to defend remarks he made about food stamps that some bloggers and news Web sites interpreted as racially offensive. 

 BODY:
MEREDITH, N.H. -- Newt Gingrich's campaign was pushed to defend remarks he made about food stamps that some bloggers and news Web sites interpreted as racially offensive.
Appearing Thursday in Plymouth, Mr. Gingrich repeated a contrast he draws routinely on the stump, accusing President Obama of being "the best food stamp president in American history'' and countering with "I would like to be the best paycheck president in American history.''
He often pledges if nominated to visit minority communities to pitch his conservative economic policies.
"So I'm prepared," he said at a town hall-style appearance, "if the N.A.A.C.P. invites me, I'll go to their convention, talk about why the African American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps.''
That remark, forwarded in a Twitter message by a reporter, was interpreted by left-leaning Web sites as perpetuating a racial stereotype. 
Think Progress wrote that Mr. Gingrich was "prejudicial'' in singling out blacks as food stamp recipients. On The Daily Beast, the comment was reported under the headline "Gingrich to African-Americans: Get Off Food Stamps.''
A black news site, News One, accused Mr. Gingrich of pandering to the biases of conservative white voters. "It is blatantly clear that Republicans are trying to recruit the worst possible elements of the G.O.P. voting bloc,'' it wrote. 
Mr. Gingrich's remark came several days after Rick Santorum stirred controversy by apparently saying, in regard to government aid: "I don't want to make black people's lives better by giving them somebody else's money. I want to give them the opportunity to go out and earn the money.'' (Mr. Santorum later denied he uttered the word "black.'') 
As traditional news organizations like The Associated Press and CBSNews.com picked up Mr. Gingrich's remark - he had said something similar the day before, including an offer to visit Latino groups -- the Gingrich campaign recognized trouble.
R.C. Hammond, Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, was overheard at an evening event here chewing out a reporter over the coverage while kicking a door. 
Later Mr. Hammond put out a statement: "This theme of taking the conservative message to every American - including the N.A.A.C.P. -- has been a constant refrain during Newt's entire career.''
He said it was not patronizing but an act of outreach to an organization usually ignored by Republicans. In a 2007 book Mr. Gingrich criticized President Bush for failing to address the N.A.A.C.P. It was a sign "to the African American community,'' he wrote, "that Republicans did not see them as worthy of engagement in dialogue.'' 
Mr. Gingrich is correct that the number of Americans receiving food stamps, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, has soared under President Obama.
A recent analysis by the Economix blog of The New York Times showed that the program's cost has more than doubled since the recession began, a result of historically high poverty rates as well as more generous eligibility and benefits rules. 
According to the Department of Agriculture, which runs the program, most beneficiaries are children or the elderly, and 30 percent earn a paycheck.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote regarding Newt Gingrich's comments to theGrio.com. The quote was from News One, not theGrio.com.

MF Global Inquiry Turns to Its Primary Regulator | Federal authorities investigating the collapse of MF Global have expanded their inquiry to include the actions of the CME Group, the operator of the main exchange where the commodities brokerage firm conducted business, according to people briefed on the matter.
CME, which also served as MF Global's primary regulator, has come under heavy criticism after $1.2 billion in customer money disappeared from MF Global. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the government agency leading the case, is scrutinizing CME's conduct in the days before MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31.
In particular, the commission is reviewing whether CME's efforts to verify the safety of customer money were sufficient, the people said.
CME, for its part, has said that MF Global may have intentionally produced inaccurate documents related to customer accounts.

Private Equity Firm Sees a Future in Flatware | Oneida, a flatware maker that once was an economic engine of upstate New York and one of the region's largest employers, has struggled to compete with a flood of low-cost foreign manufacturers.
But a funny thing happened on the way to Oneida's demise. Wall Street - an industry that has been accused of destroying jobs and stripping businesses for parts - decided the company had long-term potential.
In November, Monomoy Capital Partners, a private equity firm, bought Oneida from a group of hedge funds. The new owner wants to expand, rather than decimate its operations. It is a simple but lofty goal for a company that has been slowly recovering since its bankruptcy in 2006.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
President Obama's recent agency appointments and his campaign's presence at the Iowa caucuses weretwo tactics in an aggressive re-election strategy aimed at tying his Republican rivals to the unpopular Congress, Helene Cooper reports.
After losing his bid for re-election for a Pennsylvania Senate seat in 2006, Rick Santorum went to work for some of the firms that benefited from his legislative efforts, a move that appears at odds with the Republican presidential candidate's small government philosophy and his campaign's portrayal of the candidate as a champion of working people, Mike McIntire and Michael Luo report.
Mitt Romney's formulation of what distinguishes him from Mr. Obama fits his strategy of trying to unite Republicans against Mr. Obama, and to channel the resentment of middle-class voters against increasing economic stress in recent years,but it exposes him to political risks from Democrats and Republicans, John Harwood writes.
Undeclared voters outnumber registered Democrats and registered Republicans in New Hampshire, and they are poised to play a pivotal role on Tuesday in the state's primary, Katharine Q. Seelye writes.
Against the background of his re-election campaign, the presidentoutlined a new plan for a leaner, more technically proficient military, driven by spending cuts, that adds attention to threats in Asia but maintains a strong presence in the Middle East, Elisabeth Bumiller and Thom Shanker report.
The partisan battles that dominated the first session of the 112th Congress last yearwere just a warm-up for what's likely to come, including a possible lawsuit over Mr. Obama's recess appointments and Senate Republicans turning minor procedures into major headaches, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.
Around the Web:
The Washington Post talks to voters in New Hampshire about what the Republican presidential candidates are like in person.
Happening in Washington:
At 8:30 a.m., the Department of Labor released the December employment situation.
The House and Senate will meet in pro forma sessions at 10 a.m. and 11, respectively.
At 11:40, President Obama will visit and give brief remarks at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, before having lunch with the winners of a campaign contest.

HEADLINE: House Democrats Ask 'Where Are the Republicans?'

BYLINE: ROBERT PEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats mocked Republicans on the floor of the House for not returning to work on legislation aimed at creating jobs. Republicans dismissed the complaints as theater. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats took to the floor of an empty House chamber on Friday to mock Republicans who they said were taking a vacation rather than buckling down to work on legislation to create jobs, cut taxes and extend unemployment benefits for millions of Americans.
 The House convened for a brief meeting, billed as a pro forma session, and then quickly adjourned as Democrats sought recognition in vain.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and a half-dozen other Democrats aired their complaints on the House floor and then in a news conference outside the chamber.
 "Where are the Republicans?'' Ms. Pelosi asked. "Why are they not here?'' 
The American people, she said, "simply do not understand why, when they need jobs, we can't do ours.'' 
 Ms. Pelosi needled the Republicans, asking if they were "just too tired to come to work.''
 Congress, she said, should not wait to the last minute to address the nation's economic problems, adding that if Congress does not act by Feb. 29, 160 million people may see an increase in Social Security payroll taxes, millions of unemployed workers will begin to lose benefits, and older Americans could lose access to doctors because Medicare payments to physicians will be cut.
 Congress often defers business till after the president's State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 24 this year. But with more than 13 million Americans out of work, the Democrats said, this is no ordinary time.
 "Millions of Americans are not working, but it's not their choice,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. "Republicans who run the Congress are not working by choice, and they are getting paid.''
 Mr. Waxman is one of 20 members of a Congressional conference committee that will try to thrash out differences between the House and the Senate on a bill to extend the payroll tax cut, jobless benefits and Medicare payment policy through the remainder of 2012. 
 Even if the House and Senate are not in session, the Democrats said, the conference committee should be meeting.
 On the one hand, they said, Republicans maintain that both houses of Congress are in session, so the president should not fill vacant positions by making temporary "recess appointments." On the other hand, they said, the House and the Senate are doing no real work and meet for just a few minutes in pro form sessions every few days.
 "You can't have it both ways," Ms. Pelosi said.
 Republicans dismissed the Democrats' efforts on the House floor as theater. They said the House Republican conferees held a conference call on Friday to get ready for negotiations on the payroll tax bill. And, they said, Republican aides are working on the issues at the staff level.
 But Ms. Pelosi said: "The American people are crying out for jobs. They want us to work together. We can do that. I don't know what the Republicans are afraid of. Where are they? We have a job to do. We can't wait."
 Mr. Waxman, one of the Democratic conferees, said, "Let us summon the Republicans from the four corners of the Earth - - Hawaii, India or wherever they may be."
 Another Democratic conferee, Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, said, "You would think that about 20 conferees or 435 members of the House could get back to work on behalf of 160 million Americans."

HEADLINE: Gingrich Pushes Back Against Charges of Racism

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich charged that remarks he made about food stamps and African-Americans were taken out of context and twisted to sound racially insensitive. 

 BODY:
NEWPORT, N.H. -- Newt Gingrich charged that remarks he made about food stamps and African-Americans were taken out of context and twisted to sound racially insensitive.
"I went back and pulled up the exact language of the text," Mr. Gingrich told reporters on Friday. "I think you'd have to be nuts'' to interpret the words as critical of blacks.
He accused the Democratic National Committee of being behind the misinterpretation, which echoed through the left-leaning blogosphere on Thursday, and was then covered by the national news media. 
Asked if his linkage of blacks and food stamps was meant to evoke stereotypes with white conservatives, Mr. Gingrich attacked liberal policies that, he said, had failed the poor. 
"Just as happened with Moynihan," he said, referring to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic senator from New York whose writings on poverty stirred controversy in the 1960s, "if you in fact talk openly and honestly about the failure of liberal institutions and the way they hurt the poor, there comes a sudden frenzied herd of people running over screaming racism, racism." 
On Thursday, Mr. Gingrich, in a variation on a campaign theme, said that if he were the Republican nominee, he would run against President Obama in part by visiting minority communities to pitch his supply-side recipe for job creation. 
"So I'm prepared," he said in Plymouth, N.H. "If the N.A.A.C.P. invites me, I'll go to their convention, talk about why the African-American community should demand paychecks and not be satisfied with food stamps."
The comment was criticized by some bloggers as invoking racial stereotypes. On Friday the president of the N.A.A.C.P., Benjamin Todd Jealous, agreed.
"It is a shame that the former speaker feels that these types of inaccurate, divisive statements are in any way helpful to our country," Mr. Jealous said in a statement. "The majority of people using food stamps are not African-American, and most people using food stamps have a job."
According to the Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamp program, 41 percent of beneficiaries live in a household that has earings, with paychecks the primary source of the income. Thirty-four percent of beneficieares are white, 22 percent black and 16 percent Hispanic. (Twenty percent of recipients did not report their race.)
It was unclear whether Mr. Gingrich's remark would prove an ongoing distraction for his campaign going into the two debates in New Hampshire this weekend, where he hopes a strong performance will reverse his plummeting support. The fall was reinforced by new polls showing him trailing Mitt Romney not only in New Hampshire, but in South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich's one-time stronghold. 
The reaction to the remarks showed that race is ever a minefield in politics, especially for Republican candidates, whose supporters in the early voting states are almost entirely white. It also comes weeks after Mr. Gingrich criticized his rival, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, for claiming to be unaware of racist remarks in a political newsletter bearing his name. Mr. Gingrich has spoken of enlarging the Republican tent through economic appeals to blacks and Hispanics, who tend to vote for Democrats. In a 2007 book he criticized President George W. Bush for not speaking to the N.A.A.C.P.
But Mr. Jealous said Mr. Gingrich has not always practiced what he preached.
"We invited Speaker Gingrich to attend our annual convention several times when he was speaker of the House, but he declined to join us," Mr. Jealous said. "If he is invited again, I hope that he would come, with the intention to unite rather than divide."
Another issue that has shadowed Mr. Gingrich -- his role as a $1.6 million consultant to Freddie Mac -- also loomed anew when the government-owned mortgage giant said Thursday that he was released from a confidentiality clause and could disclose his contract.
On Friday Mr. Gingrich said he would welcome making the contract public. But his spokesman said the decision was not up to him; minority partners in a company controlled by Mr. Gingrich also had to agree.
Regularly questioned by voters at appearances about his Freddie Mac earnings, Mr. Gingrich says he personally earned $35,000 a year over a six-year period. The rest of the income went to corporate overhead.

HEADLINE: Obama Dines With Contest Winners - From Swing States

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: On Friday President Obama dined for the second time with four contest winners, and for a second time all four table-mates were from states that the Obama campaign considers battlegrounds. 

 BODY:
President Obama dined (lunched, actually) for the second time with four winners, and for a second time all four table-mates were from states that the Obama campaign considers battlegrounds that could help determine whether Mr. Obama is re-elected.
A campaign official identified the four diners, who met the president at a mid-priced restaurant not far from the White House, as Kathie Toigo, a teacher of special-needs students from Yerington, Nev.; Bill Blackwelder, an Afghanistan war veteran from Fayetteville, N.C.; Val Grossmann, a postal worker from Westminster, Colo., and Scott Zoebisch, a firefighter from Atlanta, Ga.
In October, Mr. Obama took the first four contest winners to dinner at a cafe in suburban Virginia. Then, too, one of his companions, a retired Latina teacher, was from Colorado. That state, with its growing Hispanic population, is a prime target for the campaign to win again in 2012, though advisers acknowledge it will be harder. The other three people in that first group were from Indiana, Minnesota and Arizona. 
While Mr. Obama did not win Arizona or Georgia in 2008, advisers say both are in play this year if he can mobilize enough of Arizona's growing Hispanic electorate, Georgia's African-American voters and each state's suburban independents and college students to vote in large numbers.
According to the Obama campaign Web site, which advertises the rules for the "Dinner with Barack" sweepstakes, entrants do not have to contribute to the campaign to enter. A "random drawing" picks 50 names and the campaign "in its sole discretion" selects four winners "to provide for an appropriate range of views, backgrounds, and interests." Winners' expenses for travel, overnight stay and, of course, their meal, are covered by the campaign. 
On Friday at the Scion, a restaurant described as having an eclectic menu of Asian-influenced fare, including crab cakes and lobster Rueben sandwiches, Mr. Obama and his foursome seemed to have the entire place to themselves - except for a film crew capturing the event for the campaign's Obama for America grassroots network.
Mr. Obama, coatless and his shirtsleeves rolled, made small talk with the guests about their families and their towns in the short time that reporters were allowed in.
With Mr. Obama facing a challenging re-election bid, given continued high unemployment and conservatives' zeal to defeat him, the potential mobilization benefits of gambits like "Dinner with Barack" were illustrated by Ms. Toigo, 64. She told the campaign she would volunteer again this year to get out the Obama vote in her conservative northwest Nevada county, and said the news of her date with the president "might be just the spark" to encourage others.

HEADLINE: What Price Pluralism in Health Insurance?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The lack of uniformity and the variety of options in American health-insurance plans adds significantly to costs, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
"Texas Consumer Health Assistance Program to Close After Losing Federal Funding" was the headline of an article by Sarah Kliff in the Jan. 1 issue of The Washington Post.
The Texas Consumer Health Assistance Program of the Texas Department of Insurance was federally funded in late 2010 as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of March 23, 2010, now widely known as the Affordable Care Act, or simply the A.C.A. - which set aside a total of $30 million for such programs nationwide. 
Texas received a $2.8 million grant in late 2010 to start and operate the program. It had nine employees to staff hot lines and traverse the state to make Texans without health insurance aware of their options. More than 6,000 callers were reportedly served by the program during the year. 
As it turned out, the A.C.A. authorized this program but left its financing to annual appropriations by Congress. When Congress failed last fall to agree on a budget for the 2012 fiscal year, federal financing of the program dried up, and Texas will terminate it.

If the Texas program actually cost $2.8 million last year alone - and we cannot be sure it did - that would amount to about $311,111 per employee and about $460 or so per client served. 
Why should it cost that much in consulting fees just to help Americans sort through the maze of private health-insurance offerings? To be sure, the program included start-up costs, and it assisted enrollees not only with information on insurance options but also with complaints about insurers. 
Furthermore, it may, in effect, have been aimed mainly at individuals and families with poor or no electronic connectivity and little understanding of health insurance. Some of the program's outreach literature even seems to have been aimed at small children, which seems odd.
One explanation of the costs, of course, may be that this was a government program and is ipso facto wasteful. For many Americans, that statement seems to be an axiom rather than a hypothesis.
But as I mentioned in an earlier post, the consulting services of private insurance brokers in the individual- and small-group market do not come cheaply, either. Depending on the commission rate as a percentage of the premium - which can range from 2 percent to 10 percent, and, on occasion, even more - and the size of the premium, these private consulting services can cost as much as those of the Texas program or more. 
So to anyone familiar with other nations that rely mainly or wholly on private health insurers - e.g., Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland - the question remains, why is it so much more difficult and expensive, in time and money, to choose among health-insurance options in America? 
All residents in Switzerland, for example, are mandated to procure health-insurance coverage for a federally specified benefit package. The system relies fully on 62 private health-insurance companies that compete for enrollees on a well-organized and government-regulated, federal, electronic health-insurance exchange for individually purchasedhealth insurance. The smallest company, the Krankenkasse of the village Zeneggen, has only 170 insured people; the largest, CSS Krankenversicherer, insures 858,000.
Premium shopping among insurers is easy, because the standard benefit package is common to all. Prospective enrollees, however, can choose from several annual deductibles ranging from a stipulated minimum of 300 Swiss francs (about $318) to a maximum of 2,500 Swiss francs (about $2,654). Furthermore, they can purchase supplemental insurance on top of the basic package, mainly for superior amenities.
It can be doubted that many people in Switzerland need to bear the high time and money costs Americans must bear in choosing health-insurance coverage in the market for individually purchased coverage. Public and private Web sites in Switzerland help prospective enrollees easily navigate the national insurance exchange with user-friendly information, including calculated premium differentials between one's current insurer and competitors. 
Readers may want to play around with a hypothetical choice on the English version of the private Web site Comparis.ch. Enter, for example, the postal code 3000 for the city of Bern and make yourself born in, say, 1965. (You will notice, however, premiums do not vary by age.)
The closest counterpart in the United States is probably the Web site of the Federal Employee Benefit Program operated by the Office of Personnel Management for federal employees and members of Congress. It is well constructed, but readers who play with it will realize how complicated choice is in the United States, even on one of the best-organized electronic exchanges. One has to examine the fine print of every offering.
Another good government Web site is offered by the Department of Health and Human Services for the general public. It is very helpful in guiding families toward potential solutions for problems they encounter in the health-insurance market, but again illustrates the complexity of choices Americans must make. 
There are numerous other such public or private Web sites of this sort. A fairly well-established one in the private sector is eHealthInsurance.com.
Finally, the personnel department of every large American employer operates for its employees an organized health-insurance exchange regulated by the company, typically an electronic one. Although these Web sites are user friendly, the choices they offer are usually not simple. 
Furthermore, how much employer-operated insurance exchanges cost per employee or as a percentage of the premium is not well known, because those costs would be part of the cost of administering all benefits, not only health insurance, which in turn is part of the overall cost of the personnel department.
Evidently there is a trade-off between the degree of uniformity in a health-insurance system and the time and money costs of operating such a system.
Choice among private health insurers in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland is straightforward and relatively inexpensive in terms of time and money, because price comparisons are based on a common benefit package. More customized coverage can be purchased, but only in the form of supplements to the common package.
Choice in the United States is expensive, because it requires prospective enrollees to do near-Talmudic studies of the fine print of each insurer's offerings - many times multiple distinct offerings per insurer. 
Although the A.C.A. originally sought to prescribe a national common benefits package, defining that package has now been delegated to the states. It is anyone's guess how much pluralism there will be in "basic benefit packages" under whatever segments of the A.C.A. actually survive to implementation.
One must assume that Americans view this pluralism as worth the extra transaction costs they bear. Apparently, Europeans think otherwise.

HEADLINE: Market Response Tepid To U.S. Labor Report

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed on Friday, showing little reaction to a generally positive report on the United States labor market for December.
The Labor Department said the economy added 200,000 new jobs last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, from a revised 8.7 percent in November. 
But the stock market remained subdued throughout the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.45 percent at 12,359.92, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 0.25 percent to 1,277.81. The Nasdaq composite index gained 4.36 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,674.22.
Still, increases over the last few days propelled the indexes to a gain for the week. The Dow rose 1.2 percent for the first week of the year, while the S.& P. 500 added 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq 2.7 percent.
The report on jobs exceeded forecasts and represented the sixth consecutive month that the economy added at least 100,000 jobs. But analysts said some of the details tempered the market's response.
Hiring was still below what was needed to restore employment to prerecession levels, for example, and some of the jobs added were thought to be seasonal, such as couriers and messengers, which suggested adjustments were in store for future reports.
''This report is still encouraging,'' said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist with IHS Global Insight. ''But we can't take it as proof that the economy has broken out to a much stronger rate of job creation,'' he wrote in a commentary.
Jonathan E. Lewis at Samson Capital Advisors said that some investors might be focusing on the revisions in the labor report amid a backdrop of the ''roller-coaster ride'' of the debt crisis in Europe.
''That steady drumbeat has drowned out the boring, but ploddingly consistent, gentle upward slope of U.S. economic data,'' Mr. Lewis said. The jobs report, he said, ''is not penetrating the noise.''
In the bond market, the yield on the United States benchmark 10-year note was down to 1.96 percent, compared with 2.0 percent on Thursday. The price rose 11/32, to 100 12/32.
''Worries over Europe as manifest in a weaker euro versus a stronger dollar began to show up, and you then started to see the 10-year yield come back down, which was confirmation that the struggle in the market was Europe-focused,'' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial.
Next week, earnings season will kick off, with Alcoa expected to report a fourth-quarter loss on Monday.
In Europe, the main indexes closed mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was down 0.7 percent, while the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.5 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.2 percent and the DAX in Germany was 0.6 percent lower. Some of the main Asian indexes closed about 1 percent lower.
Online Correction: January 6, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the closing value of the Nasdaq composite index.

HEADLINE: A Shrinking Military Budget May Take Neighbors With It

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Military spending has transformed the faded farmlands of northern Virginia into a land of glass-block office parks, oversize homes and sleek cars. Average household incomes there are among the highest in the United States.
The wellspring of this prosperity is not just the Defense Department's vast payroll, nor just the fat profit margins of its contractors. It is also the Pentagon's unmatched record in developing technologies with broad public benefits -- like the Internet, jet engines and satellite navigation -- and then encouraging private companies to reap the rewards.
And as the Pentagon confronts the prospect of cutting its budget by about 10 percent over the next decade, even some people who do not count themselves among its traditional allies warn that the potential impact on scientific innovation is being overlooked. Spending less on military research, they say, could reduce the economy's long-term growth.
''If catalyzing innovation is going to be an important part of our economic strategy, then we better be careful how we handle'' the military budget, said Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. ''I'd like to see a lot less weapons and a lot less focus on them, but it's not all about that.'' 
In the political debate over Pentagon cuts, the potential effect on innovation has been largely ignored. Pentagon officials and their allies have instead warned that a sharply smaller military budget would expose the nation to harm, and that such cuts would result in a large and immediate rise in unemployment.
Independent economists and analysts say that concern about the short-term economic impact is largely misplaced. While reducing the Pentagon's budget would cause considerable economic pain -- some workers would lose their jobs; some contractors would lose their most important customer -- research suggests it would be less painful than cutting other kinds of government spending, like education or transportation.
A significant portion of the military budget, including the wages of armed forces personnel, is spent abroad. And military spending in this country, like building a new runway at a domestic Air Force base, tends to bring fewer spillover benefits than many other forms of government spending, like a new runway at a commercial airport.
''As a source of job creation, military spending is not particularly good,'' said Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ''You can argue for the benefits in geopolitical terms, but if we're talking about jobs and the economy, it doesn't make sense.''
The one exception may be Pentagon spending on research and development.
The Pentagon spends about 12 percent of its budget in that area, about $81.4 billion during the most recent fiscal year. That is roughly 55 percent of all federal spending on research and development.
Administration officials, members of Congress and Pentagon planners could choose to spare the research budget when making cuts. Historically, however, significant reductions to the Pentagon's budget have led to reductions in research spending, too. Through both flush and lean times for the Pentagon, research spending has accounted for a roughly similar share -- between 9 and 13 percent -- of the overall budget.
It is a pot of money with a remarkable record of success. The Navy, which started budgeting for research in 1946, counts 59 eventual Nobel laureates among the recipients of its financing, including Charles H. Townes, whose pioneering work in the development of lasers laid the groundwork for compact discs and laser eye surgery. The other armed forces claim similar numbers of laureates, albeit with considerable overlap.
The results of this research played a key role in the blossoming of high technology as a driver of the nation's economic growth. In northern Virginia, many of the largest companies continued to work for the Pentagon while also pursuing private contracts.
Companies with names like the Science Applications International Corporation, Computer Sciences Corporation and CACI International built large campuses employing thousands of workers, mostly around the growing Tysons Corner crossroads. Other local technology companies with roots in military research focused on the broader market and became household names, including famous flameouts like AOL and MCI.
Other clusters of technology companies grew up around universities that have been large recipients of military research money, creating Silicon Valley in California, the Route 128 corridor around Boston and the Research Triangle in North Carolina, where the Army opened its Research Office in 1958.
Professor Sarewitz, who studies the government's role in promoting innovation, said that the Defense Department had been more successful than other federal agencies because it is the main user of the innovations that it finances. The Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, which also finance large volumes of research, are not major consumers of energy or healthcare. The Pentagon, which spends billions each year on weapons, equipment and technology, has an unusually direct stake in the outcome of its research and development projects. ''The central thing that distinguishes them from other agencies is that they are the customer,'' Professor Sarewitz said. ''You can't pull the wool over their eyes.''
Another factor is the Pentagon's relative insulation from politics, which has allowed it to sustain a long-term research agenda in controversial areas. No matter which party is in power, the Pentagon has continued to invest in clean-energy technology, for example, in an effort to find ways to reduce one of its largest budget items, energy costs.
The looming Defense Department cuts come from two sources. The Obama administration, as part of its deficit-reduction plan, has committed to cut military spending by $450 billion over the next decade. And the failure of Congress to agree on a plan for deficit reduction by a November deadline triggered a law requiring another $500 billion in Pentagon cuts over the next decade, starting in 2013. The combined effect would cut the Pentagon's planned 2013 budget by 17 percent.President Obama outlined his vision Thursday for the first round of cuts, saying that military needs to become leaner and more technologically sophisticated. And military leaders say that they have embraced the necessity of a smaller budget. But they continue to warn that the second round of cuts would go too far. The defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, in increasingly strident public remarks, has warned that the cuts would leave behind a ''hollow military.'' And he and others have warned of grave consequences for the economy.
Military spending does not compare well economically with many other forms of government spending, some experts say. Professor Pollin calculated in a recent analysis that $1 billion in spending on health care produced an economic benefit about 14 percent larger than spending on defense. The impact of spending on transportation, education and energy were even larger.
A recent study of federal spending since World War II by Alan Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko, both economists at the University of California, Berkeley, found that the economic benefits from nonmilitary spending were at least 50 percent larger than those from defense spending during periods of normal growth.
Some economists, however, argue that such studies fail to account for the economic value of security and stability. The crucial benefit is not what defense spending provides but what it prevents, Joshua Aizenman, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Reuven Glick, a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a 2006 paper.
Other analysts see reasons that Defense Department cuts might cause disproportionate pain. Military contractors may struggle to find new customers for highly specialized products and services. And rank-and-file military personnel may struggle to find jobs. The unemployment rate for recent veterans was 13.1 percent in December, while the overall rate dropped to 8.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
On the flip side, some scientists say the military's record of research success is unlikely to continue.
The government is no longer the dominant source of spending on research and development. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that private spending on research and development began to exceed government spending in 1990; other studies put the crossing point a few years earlier. By 2007, the private sector was spending about $2 on research for every federal dollar.
In response, the military has increasingly focused on cherry-picking promising ideas. A 2009 report by an advisory panel of independent scientists concluded that the shift was reducing the chances for the transformative discoveries that once emerged with remarkable regularity.
''In the present program, evolutionary advances are the norm, and revolutions are less likely to be fostered than they should be,'' the report said. The Pentagon ''is getting what it asks for in tightly managed and focused research programs, but is reducing the potential for true breakthroughs.''
Others are more optimistic. John Alic, a consultant who was a longtime staff member in the Office of Technology Assessment, a defunct arm of Congress that evaluated technological issues, said that he had come to believe that the Pentagon had an inherent advantage in funding research and development.
''War matters more,'' he said. ''People take it more seriously.''
The Next War: Articles in this series are examining the American military and the decisions confronting it in a new age of austerity.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Under growing pressure from the United States, some of Asia's largest economies are reluctantly looking for options to reduce the amount of oil they buy from Iran, a move that would further tighten the economic vise on an increasingly defiant nation that announced plans for a new round of naval drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
The decision by South Korea and Japan to try to accommodate Washington's demands follows reports that China has already reduced its purchase of Iranian crude in the past month in a pricing dispute with Tehran. Whatever the motives, the combined loss of sales threatens an economy already reeling, where the currency has plummeted in value, inflation has surged and the general public has expressed growing anxiety about the prospect of war.
China, Japan, India and South Korea together import more than 60 percent of Iranian oil exports, and they all depend on Iran and other Persian Gulf producers for the preponderance of their oil and natural gas needs. As tensions in the gulf have escalated and alarmed Asian governments and businesses, companies and traders from those countries have been putting out feelers to places like Russia, Vietnam, West Africa, Iraq and especially Saudi Arabia to export more oil to them, according to oil experts. 
For Tehran, which relies heavily on oil revenues to prop up an economy battered by years of sanctions, the potential cutbacks by its Asian customers follow a decision by the European Union to move toward a ban on the import of Iranian oil. Taken together, the Western efforts represent the most serious economic pressure yet on Iran after years of conflict over a nuclear program that the West charges is aimed at building weapons.
But if the goal is to force Iran to relent, the campaign has so far had an opposite effect: Iranian officials have equated targeting their oil market with economic war and threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, where about one-fifth of the world's oil passes to get to market.
The Iranian military, fresh off 10 days of naval exercises near the strait that ended this week, vowed to hold a new round of war games soon. The defense minister, Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi, in comments reported by the semiofficial Fars News Agency Thursday, said the military's exercises would be ''its greatest naval war games'' and would occur ''in the same region in the near future.''
The United States, however, is keeping the pressure on.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is scheduled to visit Beijing and Tokyo next week, and the tightening sanctions on Iran will be high on his agenda. United States officials said that Mr. Geithner will press China at least to resist importing more Iranian oil to replace exports that would otherwise go to Europe. The trip is part of a concerted effort by Western diplomats to persuade Asian countries to go along with new European sanctions, American and European officials say.
''It's a global chess game,'' said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. ''The major buyers are prudently beginning to make alternative plans to reduce their reliance on Iranian oil.''
The Asian efforts to wean themselves from Iranian crude are in response to legislation enacted by Congress at the end of last year requiring the administration to phase in sanctions in stages by late June that would make it very difficult for others to buy Iranian oil, by barring transactions with Iran's central bank.
The sanctions exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian trade and include a presidential waiver for any country or company in cases in which the impact would harm the national security interests of the United States.
More significantly, the legislation exempts from sanctions countries that ''significantly reduce'' imports from Iran. The legislation does not define this term, leaving it to the administration, according to officials. The debate over the definition, now under way, has given the administration some leverage to entice allies like Japan, South Korea and even China to make some reductions, thus intensifying pressure, without having to take the hit of cutting off imports all at once.
But Japan and South Korea have expressed some alarm at the demand that they reduce their reliance on Iranian oil, fearing that such a move could undermine their economies. Japan, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil, depends on Persian Gulf countries for four-fifths of its oil imports, which come through the Strait of Hormuz. Osamu Fujimura, the chief cabinet secretary, announced on Friday that Japan had expressed concern to the United States about the dangers to the Japanese and global economy from limits on Iran's oil exports.
Yasushi Kimura, the president of the JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corporation, Japan's largest refiner, announced on Thursday that his company had opened talks with Saudi Arabia and others, whom he did not name, about possible alternatives.
The South Korean government announced on Thursday that it was looking for ways to limit its imports of oil and oil products from Iran, but pointedly stopped short of suggesting that it could stop these imports altogether.
China, which imports about 11 percent of its oil from Iran, has actually reduced its daily purchases of Iranian crude, although estimates of the cutback range from as little as 15,000 barrels a day, or 3 percent of Chinese imports from Iran, to considerably more than that. It was hard to know if Beijing was making a political statement or merely trying to buy the oil on better terms.
''The Chinese have definitely cut back on long-term contracts, but we don't know exactly why,'' said Andy Lipow, a Houston refining and trading analyst. ''They may feel they will be able to buy cheaper on short-term markets if Iran were to lose its European customers.''
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly said it would increase production if needed to make up for any decline in exports from Iran, its longtime regional rival.
''Saudi Arabia and OPEC have always delivered what the market required,'' said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former head of exploration and production at Saudi Aramco, the Saudi state oil company. ''There is enough supply from other OPEC countries'' to compensate for losses of Iranian supplies, he added.
Mr. Husseini stressed that Middle Eastern oil markets were not yet in crisis mode, noting that insurance rates on tankers had not yet gone up in part because a tightening of European sanctions is at least a month away and a blockade of the strait is considered unlikely. ''The market is still comfortable Iran cannot pull off its threats,'' he said.
But oil analysts have warned that the international oil market remains tight, even with Libyan oil quickly coming back on line. Any disruption in the Middle East would probably bring a sharp increase in prices, which would put the shaky world economic recovery at risk, they say.
A senior government official in the Persian Gulf said Arab countries in the region were not panicking about the latest Iranian threats, while at the same time, encouraging the United States ''to take a firm stand.''
''The last thing we want is some kind of military intervention,'' said the official, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly for his government. ''But it should be left on the table.''
The Chinese Foreign Ministry took a cautious position this week on Iran, reiterating China's broad objection to all sanctions that have not been approved by the United Nations and expressing hope that no military action of any sort will take place.
''We hope to maintain peace and stability in the gulf region,'' said Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference on Wednesday.
But China is worried about the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, said Patrick Ho, the chief executive and secretary general of the China Energy Fund Committee, an influential group in Hong Kong and Beijing with links to the Chinese government. ''It is the lifeline as far as energy is concerned for China,'' Mr. Ho said.

HEADLINE: Laid Off, With Retirement Almost in Sight

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Achieving financial security in retirement is hard enough for most working Americans. But for those who lost their jobs just as the finish line was within sight, the whole notion may now seem out of reach.
Older unemployed people face the double whammy of declining home values and an investment portfolio that has been treading water, at best. But they have also lost the one stabilizing factor that was supposed to see them through: a paycheck.
That has forced many of these people -- and there are nearly two million of them over age 55 -- to make tough decisions about how to make up for the lost income, especially since it is taking them substantially longer than their younger peers to find work. In December, the average time someone 55 or older was unemployed was 52.2 weeks, according to the Labor Department; more than 210,000 others have simply quit looking.
Being unemployed for a year is enough to burn through even the richest of emergency savings funds. So if you have lost your job, the first step, as one financial planner put it, is to do financial triage. You need to look at your cash flow, figure out how much you have been spending and decide the minimum you absolutely need to get by. 
''You cut as much as you can, and if you still come up short $500 a month, then you have to figure out the best place to get that money,'' said Dan Danford, a financial planner in St. Joseph, Mo.
It may mean that you need to consider taking your pension a bit early, or finding a part-time job. But there are several other little-known tricks that will help you create a bridge of sorts until you either find work or manage to eke your way to retirement.
REASSESS CAREER POSSIBILITIES Though easier in theory than practice, you may consider a second career in an area that you enjoy, perhaps on a part-time basis, through much of your retirement. ''It is not very often that we are forced to evaluate our career and to determine if we really want our old job back,'' said Alan Moore, a financial planner in Racine, Wis.
He suggests thinking about it this way: Even if you earn only $500 a month working part time in retirement, it's equivalent to having another $150,000 in the bank, assuming that you pull out 4 percent of that money annually, an industry standard. ''Plus, it is much easier to earn $500 a month than save an additional $150,000,'' he said, adding that he advises his clients to work with a career coach.
Joshua Gottfried, a financial planner in Glastonbury, Conn., worked with a client who had lost his job as a plant manager. Without his income, Mr. Gottfried calculated, his savings would need to earn an unrealistic 8 or 9 percent return to meet his retirement goals. So he and his wife decided to take 15 percent of their savings to start a construction company. ''If he can make 15 to 20 percent on the money he put in the business, and he can make 5 or 6 percent on his passive investments, then it will net out,'' Mr. Gottfried said.
SOCIAL SECURITY For many healthy people, it is almost always worth waiting until your ''full retirement age,'' at the very least, to begin collecting Social Security. But for those with few or no resources, collecting sooner may be the only option. There are a couple of workarounds, however, that may allow you to collect benefits on a spouse's record, while your own benefits continue to accrue.
That is what Barbara Saltsman, 64, learned after she lost her job as a legal secretary in June. She had planned to work until she was 66, and while she has continued to scour the Web for new jobs, she hasn't been able to find anything that pays close to her old salary.
''I have 40-something years of experience, and companies don't want to pay for it,'' said Ms. Saltsman, who lives in Chittenango, in upstate New York.
Unemployment benefits were not enough to keep her finances afloat. So she thought she would have to take Social Security two years before her full retirement age, which would have substantially reduced her benefits. But when she visited her local Social Security office, the representative suggested collecting benefits on her deceased husband's record until she turned 70, when she could switch to her own benefits and collect more.
Some individuals may also benefit from the ''file and suspend'' strategy, which allows one spouse to file for benefits and then immediately suspend them. Then, the unemployed spouse can collect spousal benefits on the working spouse's record while his or her own benefits continue to accrue. But this works only if both spouses have reached full retirement age.
TAPPING RETIREMENT SAVINGS You typically cannot pull money out of a company plan like a 401(k), or a traditional I.R.A., until six months after your 59th birthday. Otherwise, you will face a 10 percent penalty on the amount withdrawn.
You obviously want to avoid withdrawing money prematurely. Several financial planners suggest pulling from emergency savings if you have it or other taxable accounts before resorting to retirement accounts. But if you absolutely must tap these funds, some of these methods will help reduce the damage.
DO NOT ROLL OVER YOUR 401(K) If you were laid off the year you turned 55 or older, you should think twice about rolling over your 401(k) or 403(b) into an I.R.A. You can withdraw money from the account penalty-free (though you will have to pay income taxes), whereas you would have to wait until you turned 59 1/2 to use those funds in an I.R.A. This rule does not apply to people who left their employer, say, at age 54, and who want to pull money out at 55.
TAP YOUR ROTH I.R.A. You can pull out all of your Roth contributions -- but not the earnings -- at any time and for any reason, free of tax and penalty. (If you converted a traditional I.R.A. to a Roth, that money could be pulled out, too, as long as it had been in the account for at least five years; each batch of money converted starts a new five-year period.)
PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE If you are out of work, you can also take an early, penalty-free distribution from your I.R.A., to pay your health insurance premiums. To qualify, you need to have received, or be receiving, state or federal unemployment benefits for 12 consecutive weeks, according to Ed Slott, an I.R.A. expert and the author of ''The Retirement Savings Time Bomb ... and How to Defuse It'' (Penguin, 2003), though self-employed people are also eligible. Another caveat: You need to pay for your insurance during the year you received unemployment benefits or the year after.
In fact, paying for health insurance before you are eligible for Medicare is probably one of the biggest challenges of joblessness. Mr. Gottfried suggested looking at high-deductible plans used in conjunction with a health savings account, which allows you to set aside money tax-free that can then be used for medical expenses and premiums.
''That might tide you over, especially when most of those H.S.A.'s will allow a transfer from a traditional I.R.A.,'' he added. ''Or, if you put money into an H.S.A., you receive a deduction.''
ANNUITIZE YOUR I.R.A. OR 401(K) A tax break known as the 72(t) rule will also allow you to withdraw money without penalty from a 401(k) or traditional I.R.A. Using this method, you must withdraw a ''series of substantially equal periodic payments'' over a five-year period or until you reach age 59 1/2, whichever is longer. The payout is determined by your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary. But you cannot change the payment schedule -- otherwise, you will have to pay the 10 percent penalty.
Do not, I repeat do not, rush into this decision without professional guidance. Not only do you run the risk of seriously depleting your I.R.A., but if you find a job and no longer need the money, there is no turning back.
''Once you take the payments, you can't roll them over back into your I.R.A.,'' Mr. Slott said. Nor can you convert that money to a Roth account. ''You are stuck with it.''
Financial planners offered many more ideas, from borrowing money from a spouse's 401(k) to refinancing a home and taking some cash out (if you have the equity), as well as bartering or taking over day care duties for the grandchildren. And several planners suggested that they expected to see more families moving in together.
Whatever you decide, think long and hard about the consequences and how the decision may affect your long-term savings.
''At 55, there are 15 to 20 more years left to get back into work,'' said Joseph R. Birkofer, a financial planner in Houston. ''It may take a while, but there really isn't another choice.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Jan. 7, about financial strategies for those laid off shortly before retirement, referred incompletely to the possibility of taking money out of a company plan, like a 401(k), to pay health insurance premiums. While such a transfer is technically possible, the rules governing it are more onerous than those that apply to withdrawals from an I.R.A.

HEADLINE: A Historical Cycle Bodes Ill For the Markets

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AT the turn of the last century, it was widely accepted that American stocks were virtually certain to be good long-term investments. Now, far fewer people are confident of that.
A major reason for the earlier confidence was that in the 15 years from the end of 1984 through the end of 1999, the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was more than 740 percent, even after adjusting for inflation. That amounted to a compound annual real return of more than 15 percent.
At the end of 2011, by contrast, the 15-year return -- from the end of 1996 -- was just 3 percent. And most of those gains came in the first three years of the period. Since the end of 1999, the stock market has not come close to keeping up with inflation. 
The first of the accompanying charts shows compound 15-year real returns on stock market investments from the period that ended in 1943 through the one that ended last month.
Broadly, it appears there is a cycle that is repeating itself, in which the 15-year return tops out at more than 15 percent and then falls precipitously.
In June 1964, the real return over the previous 15 years averaged 15.6 percent a year, the highest that figure had ever been. The stock market did not begin to fall then, but it could no longer maintain the torrid pace, and the 15-year return figures began to decline. On a real total return basis, stock prices hit their highs for the era in late 1968, and by the mid-1970s were in free fall as high inflation combined with a bear market.
By 1979, an investor who bought stocks in 1964, when the market seemed to be a sure moneymaker, had lost money after adjusting for inflation, even after including dividend income.
In the early 1980s, the stock market turned around, and by mid-1997 the 15-year return figure had reached a new high of 15.8 percent.
The second chart overlays the two cycles. The first line goes from the end of 1943 through the end of 1980, when the line was in negative territory. The second one, beginning at the end of 1980, continues through the end of last year.
The match between the lines is far from perfect, but there are significant similarities. If past is prologue, the 15-year return is likely to continue to decline and to turn negative in about four years. That does not necessarily imply that stocks will fall during that period, since that could happen with small gains over the period. And, of course, there is no assurance that history will repeat itself.
It is probably significant that opinion surveys show Americans are more pessimistic than they have been in many years. There is a fear that the American economy is in decline and that this country will be unable to compete with emerging Asian economies, principally China. There was a similar fear in the late 1970s, although then the fear was that the United States could not compete with Japan.
Perhaps overconfidence inspired in part by a strong stock market also played a role in American military history. Within a few years after the 1964 peak for 15-year returns, the United States escalated the Vietnam War. Within a few years after the 1999 peak, the United States decided to invade Iraq.
The other two charts indicate that the stock market may have done surprisingly well over the last 15 years, considering how little the economy grew over that period. Through the third quarter of last year -- the most recent data available -- real gross domestic product had risen at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent over the previous 15 years. That was the lowest return since the 15 years ending in 1960, a period that was distorted because it included the rapid decline in real gross domestic product in 1946 as the production of weapons halted after World War II.
Similarly, over the last 15 years the total real personal income earned by Americans has risen at an annual rate of just 2.6 percent. That is the lowest for any similar period for which G.D.P. data is available. Both the G.D.P. and personal income rates of growth are well below where they were when the cumulative stock returns bottomed out in 1982.
After the pessimism of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the economy and the stock market turned around as it became clear the American economy was resilient and could adapt to a changing world. The question now is whether that can happen again.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Similar Cycles for Stocks: The total return, after inflation, of stocks over 15-year periods seems to be repeating the pattern it mapped out decades ago. The compound annual total real return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index peaked at more than 15 percent in 1999, and has since fallen to just 3 percent. That peak was similar to the earlier peak, reached in 1964. After that 1964 peak, the stock market lost momentum and then entered a bear market. By 1979, the market had failed to keep up with inflation over the previous 15 years.

HEADLINE: Haitians Take Arduous Path to Brazil, and Jobs

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Lis Horta Moriconi and Erika O'Conor contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
BRASILEIA, Brazil -- Of the odyssey that delivered him to this town in the Brazilian Amazon, Wesley Saint-Fleur could muster only a look of exhaustion and bewilderment.
Months ago, he boarded a bus in Haiti, before getting on a plane in the Dominican Republic, landing first in Panama and then in Ecuador. That was where his wife gave birth to their son, Isaac, he said, bouncing the 4-month-old infant on his knee and brandishing the boy's Ecuadorean identification card. Then they continued by bus yet again, through Ecuador and Peru. Next, they trekked by foot in Bolivia, where, he said, the police robbed him and his wife of their clothing and their life savings: $320 in cash.
''Then we finally got to Brazil, which I'm told is building everything, stadiums, dams, roads,'' said Mr. Saint-Fleur, 27, a construction worker, one of hundreds of Haitians who gather each day around the gazebo in Brasileia's palm-fringed plaza. ''All I want is work, and Brazil, thank God, has jobs for us.'' 
Gambling everything, thousands of Haitians have made their way across the Americas to reach small towns in the Brazilian Amazon over the past year in a desperate search for work, including a surge of hundreds arriving in recent days amid fears that Brazil's government could slow the influx before it overwhelms the authorities here.
Their improbable journeys -- from the rubble of their island homes to remote outposts here in the Amazon -- say as much about the dire economic conditions that persist in Haiti two years after the earthquake as it does about the rising economic profile of Brazil, which is fast becoming a magnet not only for poor foreign laborers but also for growing numbers of educated professionals from Europe, the United States and Latin America.
Upon arriving here and in other border outposts, the Haitians are often given vaccinations, clean water and two meals a day by the authorities. Many stay for weeks in Brasileia and other towns before being granted humanitarian visas that allow them to work in Brazil.
But with such a crush of new arrivals, others have not been so lucky. After traveling thousands of miles and overcoming countless obstacles, some crowd eight to a small hotel room or wind up sleeping on the streets, almost reliving the misery they had hoped to leave behind.
''I cannot allow the sadness to take over, since opportunity will follow this hard phase,'' said Simonvil Cenel, 33, a tailor awaiting a visa who leads animated evangelical prayer services for those stuck in limbo after enduring so much to get here.
About 4,000 Haitians have immigrated to Brazil since the 2010 earthquake, often going first through Ecuador, a poorer country with lax visa policies. Brazil has made an exception for Haitians in contrast to job-seekers from nations like Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, who arrive via similar Amazonian routes but are usually expelled.
''Haiti is recovering from an extreme period of crisis, and Brazil is in a position to help these people,'' said Valdecir Nicacio, a human rights official in the state of Acre, encompassing Brasileia. ''Before getting here, they are at the mercy of human traffickers,'' he said. ''Brazil is big enough to absorb Haitians who just want jobs.''
With the number of Haitians sharply increasing in recent days, the authorities in Brasileia and Tabatinga, a border city in Amazonas State, have warned of the strains of trying to feed and house the Haitians while visa applications are reviewed. Federal officials have responded by sending tons of food for the Haitians, who currently number more than 1,000 in each border settlement.
Dealing with an immigration crisis on its border is a new dilemma for Brazil, which until recently was more concerned with the outflow of its own citizens seeking opportunities in rich industrialized countries than responding to the arrival of thousands of impoverished foreigners.
Though economic growth has recently slowed in Brazil, unemployment remains at a historic low of 5.2 percent, and many companies have trouble finding enough workers to fill vacancies. Wages have also climbed for those at the lowest rung of the job market, with the income of poor Brazilians growing seven times as much as the income of rich Brazilians from 2003 to 2009.
''We were experiencing a decline in our work force because so many Brazilians are going to work at the two hydroelectric projects,'' said Ana Terezinha Carvalho, the personnel management analyst at Marquise, a company in Porto Velho. The city lies in the upper Amazon River Basin, where Brazil is employing thousands to build two big dams, called Jirau and Santo Antonio.
Ms. Carvalho said her company quickly hired 37 Haitians who arrived last year, to collect trash in Porto Velho and take it to the city's landfill. Some make more than $800 a month, in a job that includes benefits like health insurance, overtime and paid holidays. ''There weren't enough Brazilians, so we were happy to hire the Haitians,'' she said.
The authorities estimate that about 500 Haitians now live in Porto Velho and that about 700 are in Manaus, the largest city in the Brazilian Amazon. Hundreds more have made it to Sao Paulo, Brazil's economic capital. Companies like Fibratec, a swimming pool manufacturer in southern Santa Catarina State, have even sent managers all the way here to hire dozens of Haitians.
In addition to meeting demand for cheap labor, the effort to let Haitians work in Brazil speaks to the country's ambitions of wielding greater regional influence, by attempting to find ways of alleviating problems in the hemisphere's poorest nation.
Since 2004, Brazil has sent troops to lead a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. But there are now more Haitians in Brazil than Brazilian soldiers in Haiti. In September, Brazil announced that it would start drawing down its 2,000 troops in the Caribbean nation.
Most of the Haitians hope to spend just a few weeks in Brasileia's immigration limbo, before moving on. Some, like Francisco Joseph, 25, make the most of the time here. He buys prepaid cellphone cards across the bridge in the Bolivian city of Cobija and sells them to fellow Haitians in Brasileia's plaza at a markup of about 30 cents a card. He makes as much as $10 a day.
''This little bit of money gives me a little bit of dignity,'' he said.
Others, like Jacksin Etienne, 31, nurture bigger dreams. A polyglot who glides with ease between English, Spanish, French and Creole, Mr. Etienne said he hoped to work as a translator or in a hotel.
''I want to go straight to Sao Paulo, the New York of South America,'' he said. ''Brazil's a rising kind of place, and it needs people like me.''

HEADLINE: Slight Rebound In Concert Revenues

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
After one of its worst years in recent history, the concert industry rebounded slightly in 2011. But with consumers buying fewer tickets, the industry was still down from its peak in 2009. 
According to Pollstar, a trade magazine that collects sales data from promoters and ticket vendors, the Top 100 tours in North America last year sold $2.34 billion in tickets. That was a 6.3 percent increase from 2010, when the lagging economy and a number of weak summer lineups caused sales to drop by as much as 15 percent, the concert industry's first decline in 15 years.
The top attractions in North America last year were U2, with $156 million in gross ticket sales; Taylor Swift, with $97.7 million; Kenny Chesney, with $84.6 million; and Lady Gaga, with $63.7 million.
The sales trend was much the same abroad. The Top 50 tours around the world made $3.07 billion in gross ticket sales, up 3.7 percent from 2010 but off 8 percent from 2009.
U2 also dominated the global chart, with a total of $231.9 million in ticket sales. But the second-biggest tour was by Take That, a reunited British boy band - whose members are now in their late 30s and early 40s. They sold $224 million in tickets though it was one of the few major tours that did not reach North America.
The growth in overall grosses in North America was largely due to increased prices. For the Top 100 tours, a total of 34.7 million tickets were sold, down 2.6 percent from the year before. After lowering prices in 2009 and 2010, promoters began to raise them again last year. For the top tours, the average ticket cost $67.22, an 8.9 percent jump over 2010 and only slightly less than the industry's historic peak of $67.33 in 2008.
In compiling its data, Pollstar, based in Fresno, Calif., counts only the ''face value'' of tickets, not any of the surcharges from theaters and vendors, which can add as much as 40 percent to the customer's final cost. In most major touring deals, an artist will receive the majority of a ticket's face value, while theaters, promoters and other parties derive most of their profits from ticket surcharges, parking fees and the sale of food and drinks.

HEADLINE: Years After Man Was Willing to Die Over Home, and Did, Land Remains Empty

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
It seems that Dr. Nicholas Bartha got what he apparently wanted: If he could not live in the town house on East 62nd Street, no one could.
In the five years since he is presumed to have blown it up, nothing has been built there.
The city approved plans for a replacement town house in 2007. But the lot remains empty - 2,000 expensive square feet, hidden behind a plywood fence. A peek reveals nothing to excite would-be sidewalk superintendents: no bulldozers, no foundation being dug, no bricks waiting to become straight new walls. 
So what is happening with this bit of unbuilt New York?
''Very little, I'm sad to say,'' said Preston T. Phillips, an architect, who designed the replacement with Abelow Sherman Architects. ''We have geared up twice to get it started. We have just had to pull back.''
He blamed the recession and the real estate slowdown. ''The economic downturn coincided almost immediately with the plans to begin,'' he said. ''I think that every time there's a glimmer of hope in the economy, it turns the other way, and it's just kept the project at bay.''
The lot was sold in 2007 to Janna Bullock, a Russian-born real estate developer. Tabloid newspapers have described how she went from baby-sitting in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, to private jets and an art collection. But in the go-go years, she appeared to have a knack for breathing new life into town houses and marketing them at a profit.
She paid $8.3 million for the East 62nd Street lot and announced plans for what promised to be the ultimate green town house. It was to have a geothermal heating and cooling system that involved channeling 1,500 feet down into the earth. There would be a system to collect rainwater runoff, clean it and use it to irrigate a garden on the roof.
Then the recession hit. The doormen at the apartment building next door - which had been rocked by the explosion - watched and wondered when the work would begin. ''It's weird, being next to an empty lot,'' William Montanez, a building worker, said.
Dr. Bartha, 66, a physician, is believed to have destroyed the house to prevent a forced sale that would have involved dividing the proceeds with his ex-wife, Cordula. A sheriff's deputy had served him with eviction papers a few days earlier; about an hour before the blast, he sent Mrs. Bartha a rambling e-mail that said, among other things, ''I always told you I will leave the house only if I am dead.''
A long plastic tube was connected to the gas line in front of the house. Investigators thought Dr. Bartha unwound the tube, playing it out as he crossed the threshold.
Dr. Bartha, who weighed about 350 pounds, was pulled from the wreckage after the blast, still alive. He died five days later. The explosion also injured 10 firefighters and 5 passers-by.
As for the town house that Ms. Bullock had in mind for the site, a person associated with the project said that she was simply waiting for the real estate market to stabilize - that is, to reach a point where a ''top-tier luxury contemporary town house'' could be completed and sold without a lag. ''She does not want it to sit on the market for any length of time,'' the person said.
Mr. Phillips, who has images of the planned town house on his Web site, said he had ''a number of communications'' with Ms. Bullock last summer.
''We had a financial meeting last July where it looked as if things were going to happen,'' he said, ''and then it just never materialized.''
He said he still hoped for a green light for the project, adding, ''Her enthusiasm had not waned a bit.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Mets, in Hiring Financial Firm, Insist It's Not About Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CRG Partners lists as its special talents financial advisory work, restructuring and reorganization, and turnaround management -- polite descriptions of services needed by companies in distress. The firm's Web site names a long list of clients, from Kmart to Popeyes Chicken to Sunbeam Products.
As of this week, the firm's client list formally includes the New York Mets. Late Thursday, the team confirmed that it had hired CRG ''to provide services in connection with financial reporting and budgeting processes.'' The team would not elaborate on what that meant. But it was eager to insist that it was not hiring the firm for one of CRG's other professional strengths: helping businesses navigate bankruptcy. 
''To be clear: CRG's services aren't bankruptcy-related,'' the team posted on its Twitter account Friday. ''There are no bankruptcy services being provided by anyone.''
The hiring of the firm, at minimum, suggests that the Mets have reached a new moment of need -- for money, or for advice, or for some kind of re-engineering of the operation. For more than a year, the team has been looking for ways to slash costs and to raise cash as it has hemorrhaged losses, fully exhausted its line of credit with Major League Baseball and, just last month, obtained a $40 million ''bridge loan'' to keep operating while the club's owners solicit new investors.
Turnaround specialists like CRG rarely win popularity contests. That's because they help companies reduce expenses by taking unsavory steps like closing stores, shuttering factories, laying off workers and asking lenders to write off some of their clients' debts.
When turnarounds succeed, companies come out leaner and arguably healthier. CRG, for instance, was the chief restructuring officer for Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, one of the world's largest chicken producers. Processing plants were closed, workers laid off and finances restructured, allowing Pilgrim's Pride to emerge from bankruptcy protection in less than 13 months.
''CRG helped guide us through a very difficult financial time,'' said Don Jackson, the former chief executive officer of Pilgrim's Pride, who now has the same title with JBS USA, majority owner of Pilgrim's. ''The result: New ownership. New financing. New management. A new approach.''
CRG also helped restructure CompUSA, the electronics retailer.
In 2010, a bankruptcy court judge in Texas appointed William Snyder, a managing partner of CRG, as the chief restructuring officer of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Essentially, his job involved auctioning the team, which was ultimately sold to a group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg for $590 million. To sell the club, Snyder had the difficult task of getting the team's owner, Tom Hicks, and his lenders to agree on what was being sold and who would get how much from the sale.
Only 10 percent of CRG's work, however, took place in bankruptcy court last year, according to a company spokeswoman. More often, she said, CRG advises healthy companies on how to improve their financial performance, sometimes by cutting costs and other times by finding new ways to do things.
Later on Friday, the Mets again sent out a statement of sorts on Twitter, still sensitive to the public perception of CRG's hiring. It repeated that ''CRG isn't providing bankruptcy services'' and that CRG had no role in the team's efforts to line up $200 million in cash by selling 10 or more minority shares in the team to private investors.
It is unclear what CRG can do for the Mets that they have not already done on their own. The team, which lost an estimated $70 million last year, has already cut its payroll by trading Carlos Beltran, Francisco Rodriguez and other players with expensive contracts and by declining to re-sign free agents like Jose Reyes, who joined the Miami Marlins.
Last month, the Mets said they were eliminating their minor league team in the Class A Gulf Coast League, a move that baseball executives with other teams say will save $750,000 to $800,000. In November, the Mets laid off nearly 10 percent of their 180 front-office employees, not the kind of step teams take in good times.
The Mets still have not repaid a $25 million loan to Major League Baseball. They must also make bond payments worth more than $40 million a year.
To assuage their lenders, who are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, the Mets have been trying to sell a dozen $20 million stakes in the team for months. The club reportedly has commitments from seven buyers.
The Mets, whose deadline to repay some of their loans is approaching, may be worried about whether they can close all or some of the deals they have in place with prospective minority investors.
As if those problems weren't enough, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the team's owners, have been fighting a long and expensive battle with the trustee representing the victims of the Bernard L. Madoff fraud. If a settlement is not reached with the trustee, who is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars, a trial will begin in mid-March.
Given the weight of these problems, it is not unreasonable for Wilpon and Katz to at least explore ways to restructure their team's balance sheet, according to experts in sports finance. That includes, they say, considering whether to enter bankruptcy proceedings, or perhaps how to avoid that process.
''There are so many balls in the air, it becomes clear that Wilpon would want to sit down with bankruptcy specialists,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches sports economics at Smith College. ''It's complicated. It's not simply shuttering a plant.''

HEADLINE: The Capital of Sports

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- On Friday, players from Alabama and Louisiana State answered questions on the field at the Superdome, where S-A-I-N-T-S spread across the end zones and the B.C.S. national championship game logo decorated midfield. Such is life here, at the center of the American sports universe.
From Dec. 26 through Monday, the Superdome and the neighboring New Orleans Arena have hosted, or will host, nine sporting events. This includes two college football bowl games, including Monday night's championship; three Saints games, including Saturday's playoff contest against Detroit; and four N.B.A. matchups featuring the hometown Hornets.
This confluence of events, an athletic Mardi Gras of sorts, played out all over town. Crimson Tide fans waited for beignets at Cafe du Monde, while nearby a musician played jazz in a Saints sweatshirt. Lions supporters downed bottles of Abita at Bullet's Sports Bar. Hotels turned on ''no vacancy'' signs and a parking garage downtown charged $100 a night. 
''We're going to see our city filled to the brim, to a magnitude beyond what we've ever seen, even with Super Bowls,'' said Doug Thornton, senior vice president for the stadium and arena division at the arena management company SMG and the de facto director of Louisiana sports.
At the center of it all, on Poydras Street, the Superdome lorded over downtown, a symbol, always, of this city, but lately, perhaps, of something more. Home of the Saints, host of the largest-ever indoor concert, synonymous with the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, the stadium is rich with history, some of it dark.
Thornton stayed at the Superdome when Katrina hit in August 2005, when the roof ripped and water leaked in and about 25,000 people sought refuge. The conditions were later described as decrepit.
For Taylor Beery, a native who worked as policy director for President George W. Bush's Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding, the two sports arenas ''were the most obvious and emotional examples of the devastation Katrina caused.''
Local officials decided to renovate the Superdome, at the cost of $336 million, half of which came from federal recovery funds. Beery said he understood the commotion the renovation caused, with hospitals and schools also in dire need of repair.
But he argues, as do Thornton and Mayor Mitch Landrieu, that the Superdome has served as a catalyst for recovery. In the two-week bonanza of sporting events, city officials expect 250,000 visitors and an economic impact of $500 million. This, Thornton said, is validation of the rebuilding effort. Beery called the Superdome a ''symbol of optimism.''
Landrieu said, ''It's an example of what resurgence looks like.''
In 2004, according to Mark Romig, a local tourism official, more than 10 million visitors descended on New Orleans. Katrina, he said, ''knocked us to our knees.''
Then came the economic downturn and the Gulf Coast oil spill -- one hit after the next.
Romig's father is the Saints' longtime public-address announcer. His brother also works for the team. He saw the inspiring power of sports when the Saints won the Super Bowl after the 2009 season. He watched the growth continue, up to 8.3 million visitors in 2010.
Early Friday, the local writer Brett Michael Dykes, known as ''Cajun Boy,'' sipped coffee at Mojo Coffee House on Magazine Street, wearing a Saints sweatshirt with an L.S.U. T-shirt visible underneath. He noted that the surrounding area, once barren, is now thriving with local businesses, from the Great American Alligator Museum to the Garden District Pub, where waitresses wore shirts with L.S.U. across the front.
''There's an energy, a vibrancy, that is palpable, that you can feel almost when you step off the plane here,'' he said. ''It's a lot different than it was pre-Katrina.''
Dykes had spent the morning planning two bar-hopping routes with 30 friends for the Saturday and Monday games. He worried that too many pundits had picked the Saints to win the Super Bowl. He celebrated the Tigers' thus-far undefeated season. In recent days, he said he told friends to relish this long weekend, the likes of which may never occur again.
The logistical tasks fell to Thornton and his crew of 185 full-time employees and 1,500 part-time workers. They planned for this weekend over the past six months.
Among the tasks: removing 55,000 tons of trash between games and cleaning the 72,000-seat stadium; using detergent and high-powered gasoline brushes to wash the paint from the field, then repainting and drying it; replacing alternating signage in the stands and on the field; hosting different, competing television networks and their compounds for both games; restocking the concession stands, which do about $1.5 million in business each game; and restocking the warehouses.
The stretch that started with a Saints game in which quarterback Drew Brees broke the N.F.L.'s single-season passing record will end Monday night with the Bowl Championship Series game, at which point Thornton allowed he would take a ''10-minute break.''
That dizzying slate, though, marks only the beginning, because those sites will also host the Southeastern Conference's men's basketball tournament in March, the men's Final Four in March and April and both the Super Bowl and the women's Final Four in 2013.
This stretch, Landrieu hopes, will highlight a changed city, or a changing one, where property values are up, unemployment is down and recovery continues.
''We've never had a run of consecutive major events in the history of New Orleans,'' Landrieu said. ''It's maybe the most significant run of sporting events any major city has ever had. For a place that was on its back and dead less than five years ago, we feel like it's our time to shine.''
As this week wore on, more fans began to fill the French Quarter and surrounding areas. Hotel rooms, even budget ones, required a three-night minimum stay. The teams arrived in grand fashion at the airport, where bands played and fans held signs and players later marveled that a helicopter followed their buses into town.
L.S.U. Coach Les Miles said the bus ride brought back memories of Katrina, adding ''the attachment to this city is one that this team really feels.''
That goes for Robert LeBlanc, who served on the Super Bowl host committee and helps run Ste. Marie, a restaurant two blocks from the Superdome that serves grillades and grits and duck and waffles.
Still, in the center of the sports universe, he plans to cheer on the Tigers and the Saints. He wants Alabama fans to enjoy themselves -- until kickoff.
''I wouldn't say New Orleans is there yet,'' he said. ''But we're working on it.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Bracing For Dismal 4th Quarter

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
For most Wall Street bankers, 2011 was a year they would rather forget. Investors will soon find out just how bad that year was for the country's biggest financial institutions.
In recent days, analysts have been lowering their fourth-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America. Analysts are also bracing for lower earnings from JPMorgan Chase, which on Friday will be the first of the Wall Street banks to report results.
''It's likely 2011 will be the worst year for revenue growth for the banks since 1938, and so far 2012 isn't feeling much better,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities and the author of the recently published book ''Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst's Fight to Save the Big Banks from Themselves.'' ''The industry simply grew too fast over the past two decades and now it's downshifting. This process will take time, but the hit to revenue is happening now.'' 
Wall Street banks have been buffeted by a weak economy in the United States and by concerns that the European debt crisis will spread, sending shock waves through the financial system.
At the same time, most banks are expected to book an accounting loss in the fourth quarter from the performance of their own debt. In the previous quarter, this one-time item significantly bolstered the earnings of a number of banks.
With business sluggish, Wall Street banks have been chopping staff and expenses. A dismal 2011 will translate into smaller employee bonuses, which most banks will begin handing out in the coming weeks. Compensation experts are estimating compensation for Wall Street employees could fall as much as 30 percent from levels a year ago. While sharply lower bonuses may be politically popular, they will also eat into the revenue that New York State collects from Wall Street.
The challenges facing Wall Street are illustrated by the performance of Goldman Sachs - for years the envy of rivals for its ability to churn out rich profits even in rough times - in recent quarters. In the third quarter, Goldman reported a loss of $428 million, in contrast to a $1.74 billion profit a year ago. Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, told investors that Goldman was ''disappointed'' in the performance.
For the fourth quarter, the firm is projected to post a profit of $2.02 a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. That consensus number is down from $2.81 a month ago. And it is likely to fall further in the coming days as more analysts weigh in with new estimates. Some analysts already have Goldman, which reports on Jan. 18, earning less than $1 a share in the fourth quarter.
New regulations combined with a drop in client trading revenue and the falling value of some of its core equity holdings, like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a strategic investment the firm made in 2006, hurt Goldman in the third quarter. Equity markets, however, improved in the fourth quarter, so Goldman should gain from some of the same investments that ate into profits just a few months ago.
An analyst with Credit Suisse, Howard Chen, does not have high hopes for Goldman's fourth-quarter results.
''We're expecting a quiet finish to a challenging year for Goldman Sachs and the brokerage industry - while 2011 may now be in the rearview mirror, we do believe the year ended on a difficult note with highly depressed levels of institutional and corporate client risk appetite and year-end seasonal weakness,'' he wrote in a report issued on Thursday. Mr. Chen is predicting the firm will earn 70 cents in the fourth quarter.
Analysts are also notching down estimates for Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley was hit harder than Goldman by the financial crisis. While it is a major player in many areas Goldman dominates, like sales and trading, it decided after the financial crisis to make a big investment in wealth management, a lower risk business that tends to post steadier results.
So far the strategy, led by Morgan Stanley's chief executive, James Gorman, appears to be taking hold. The company earned $2.15 billion in the third quarter, up from a loss of $91 million in the year-ago period. In the fourth quarter, however, Morgan Stanley will be taking a substantial one-time pretax earnings hit of $1.8 billion related to a recent legal settlement. This will translate into a per-share hit of 64 cents and will most likely put Morgan Stanley into the red in the quarter. Analysts are predicting the bank will lose 54 cents a share in the fourth quarter. A month ago, the consensus was for a profit of 29 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. (Morgan Stanley has not yet announced when it will report.)
Investors will also keep a close eye on Bank of America, which has also struggled to recover from the financial crisis. The firm's shares are now trading above $6, a nice bump given it was trading at about $5 just a few weeks ago. Its legacy mortgage business, however, remains a burden. Bank of America, which reports on Jan. 19, is projected to post a fourth quarter per-share profit of 20 cents, up from 4 cents in the quarter a year ago.
JPMorgan Chase weathered the financial storm better than some, in part because it has a large retail bank that produces fairly steady earnings. Still, it owns a big investment bank and it is not immune to the same issues facing its rivals. JPMorgan's profit dipped 4 percent, or $1.02 a share, in the third quarter, in part because of lingering mortgage problems. Analysts are projecting the firm will post a profit of 93 cents a share in the fourth quarter. The bank posted a per-share profit of $1.12 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Citigroup is scheduled to report its earnings on Jan. 17. Analysts are forecasting that it will earn 76 cents a share in the fourth quarter, up from 40 cents in the year-ago period.
In a recent research note, Jeff Harte, an analyst at the brokerage house Sandler O'Neill, said Citigroup earnings would be dragged down by a number of one-time items, like severance payments to employees and credit hedging losses. Still, not all the news is bad.
''While we are also reducing our capital markets-related revenue estimates, the bottom-line impact should be offset substantially by lower-than-previously-expected credit costs,'' he wrote. Mr. Harte is predicting Citigroup will earn 43 cents a share.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Why Islamism Is Winning

BYLINE: By JOHN M. OWEN IV. 
John M. Owen IV, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia, is the author of ''The Clash of Ideas in World Politics: Transnational Networks, States, and Regime Change, 1510-2010.''

 BODY:
Charlottesville, Va.
EGYPT'S final round of parliamentary elections won't end until next week, but the outcome is becoming clear. The Muslim Brotherhood will most likely win half the lower house of Parliament, and more extreme Islamists will occupy a quarter. Secular parties will be left with just 25 percent of the seats.
Islamism did not cause the Arab Spring. The region's authoritarian governments had simply failed to deliver on their promises. Though Arab authoritarianism had a good run from the 1950s until the 1980s, economies eventually stagnated, debts mounted and growing, well-educated populations saw the prosperous egalitarian societies they had been promised receding over the horizon, aggrieving virtually everyone, secularists and Islamists alike. 
The last few weeks, however, have confirmed that a revolution's consequences need not follow from its causes. Rather than bringing secular revolutionaries to power, the Arab Spring is producing flowers of a decidedly Islamist hue. More unsettling to many, Islamists are winning fairly: religious parties are placing first in free, open elections in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt. So why are so many Arabs voting for parties that seem politically regressive to Westerners?
The West's own history furnishes an answer. From 1820 to 1850, Europe resembled today's Arab world in two ways. Both regions experienced historic and seemingly contagious rebellions that swept from country to country. And in both cases, frustrated people in many nations with relatively little in common rallied around a single ideology -- one not of their own making, but inherited from previous generations of radicals.
In 19th-century Europe, that ideology was liberalism. It emerged in the late 18th century from the American, Dutch, Polish and especially French revolutions. Whereas the chief political divide in society had long been between monarchs and aristocrats, the revolutions drew a new line between the ''old regime'' of monarchy, nobility and church, and the new commercial classes and small landholders. For the latter group, it was the old regime that produced the predatory taxes, bankrupt treasuries, corruption, perpetual wars and other pathologies that dragged down their societies. The liberal solution was to extend rights and liberties beyond the aristocracy, which had inherited them from the Middle Ages.
Suppressing liberalism became the chief aim of absolutist regimes in Austria, Russia and Prussia after they helped defeat France in 1815. Prince Klemens von Metternich, Austria's powerful chancellor, claimed that ''English principles'' of liberty were foreign to the Continent. But networks of liberals -- Italian carbonari, Freemasons, English Radicals -- continued to operate underground, communicating across societies and providing a common language for dissent.
This helped lay the ideological groundwork for Spain's liberal revolution in 1820. From there, revolts spread to Portugal, the Italian states of Naples and Piedmont, and Greece. News of the Spanish revolution even spurred the adoption of liberal constitutions in the nascent states of Gran Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Mexico. Despite their varied grievances, in each case liberalism served as a rallying point and political program on which the malcontents could agree.
A decade later, in July 1830, a revolution toppled France's conservative Bourbon monarchy. Insurrection spread to Belgium, Switzerland, a number of German and Italian states and Poland. Once again, a variety of complaints were distilled into the rejection of the old regime and the acceptance of liberalism.
The revolutions of 1848 were more numerous and consequential but remarkably similar to the earlier ones. Rebels with little in common -- factory workers in Paris, peasants in Ireland, artisans in Vienna -- followed a script written in the 1790s that was rehearsed continuously in the ensuing years across the continent.
Today, rural and urban Arabs with widely varying cultures and histories are showing that they share more than a deep frustration with despots and a demand for dignity. Most, whether moderate or radical, or living in a monarchy or a republic, share a common inherited language of dissent: Islamism.
Political Islam, especially the strict version practiced by Salafists in Egypt, is thriving largely because it is tapping into ideological roots that were laid down long before the revolts began. Invented in the 1920s by the Muslim Brotherhood, kept alive by their many affiliates and offshoots, boosted by the failures of Nasserism and Baathism, allegedly bankrolled by Saudi and Qatari money, and inspired by the defiant example of revolutionary Iran, Islamism has for years provided a coherent narrative about what ails Muslim societies and where the cure lies. Far from rendering Islamism unnecessary, as some experts forecast, the Arab Spring has increased its credibility; Islamists, after all, have long condemned these corrupt regimes as destined to fail.
Liberalism in 19th-century Europe, and Islamism in the Arab world today, are like channels dug by one generation of activists and kept open, sometimes quietly, by future ones. When the storms of revolution arrive, whether in Europe or the Middle East, the waters will find those channels. Islamism is winning out because it is the deepest and widest channel into which today's Arab discontent can flow.

HEADLINE: Mother in Custody After Death of Girl, 2, in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and TIM STELLOH; Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

 BODY:
10:21 p.m. Updated Officers responding early Friday to a call of a jumper on the roof of a four-story building inBrooklynfound a blood trail leading down to Apartment 4A. The door was ajar, and when they walked in, the police said, the picture got even worse: A young mother was sitting on a couch in the living room, babbling and cradling her fatally wounded 2-year-old girl.
The girl, identified by officials as Cathryn Nwegbo, was in cardiac arrest with puncture and strangulation wounds to her neck and face, one city official said, adding that she also had ''major bleeding to the back of her head.'' 
One officer took the girl - who was wearing only a diaper - into his arms and raced for the stairs, yelling, ''She is not breathing,'' the official said. Emergency Medical Service workers took her to Woodhull Medical Center, where she was declared dead.
Other responders, meanwhile, attended to the mother, identified as Brandis Nwegbo, 29, but she resisted. She had a cut on the right side of her face, but when paramedics tried to treat her, she withdrew and warned them not to touch her, the city official said.
She told the medical responders, ''I only just trust the white blanket,'' the official said. It was not clear what she meant.
She was taken into custody and driven to Woodhull for psychiatric evaluation, officials said. Investigators said they believed that Ms. Nwegbo killed her child in their apartment at1078 Putnam Avenue, on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Bushwick. No charges had been placed as of Friday evening. A large fish tank that was in the home was found smashed when the police arrived about 4 a.m., and investigators were trying to determine if shards were used as a weapon, one official said.
The city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's Services, did not have an open file on the child, who was 2$ years old, according to an official with knowledge of the case. The agency did, however, receive a report in April 2010 that Ms. Nwegbo, while living with her daughter in a homeless shelter in the city, was involved in an altercation with another shelter resident, the official said. But Cathryn was not hurt in that incident, and ''there were no allegations that the mother was abusive of the child,'' one official said.
Ms. Nwegbo's father, Lawrence Nwegbo, 58, originally fromNigeria, said he was stunned by the news about his daughter and granddaughter.
''I don't think she has any problems,'' said Mr. Nwegbo, a loan officer inDallaswho said he had not spoken to his daughter in six months. ''She is very happy with the baby.''
Neighbors and friends of Ms. Nwegbo's said she appeared to be a loving mother, but was struggling financially and had little support. She was growing increasingly distraught, one said. Another, Jessica, 28, who would only provide her first name, said Ms. Nwegbo had previously lived in the Rose F. Kennedy homeless shelter, in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
A spokeswoman for the city's homeless services department confirmed that Ms. Nwegbo lived at the shelter from June 2009 to April 2010 - and that her daughter was born in that period. A workman at thePutnam Avenuebuilding, who declined to give his name, said the family had lived there for a year and a half. He said a city worker came about twice a month to check on the woman and her daughter.
In 2009, police officers responded to a domestic incident at the home of Ms. Nwegbo's mother, Emma Kent Traore, onRutland RoadinBrooklyn, an official said. Ms. Traore told officers ''her daughter was not respecting her,'' the official said, but no charges were filed. Reached by phone, Ibrahim Traore, who said he was once married to Ms. Nwegbo's mother, said there came a time when Ms. Nwegbo moved away from home. She went to school, ''but decided to jump out and look for a job,'' he said. She worked in aManhattanrestaurant, was let go, and then pursued other things like making hand jewelry, he said.
Though officials said Ms. Nwegbo was employed when she left the shelter, Cyril Joseph, the director of the Linden-Bushwick Community Garden, where he met Ms. Nwegbo a couple of years ago and where she planted herbs and volunteered, said she was now unemployed and facing eviction from her apartment.
To stay here, Mr. Joseph said, Ms. Nwegbo needed a letter showing her daughter was in day care, which he said she could not afford. ''She's going through stress,'' Mr. Joseph said. He said she did not know ''which way to turn or where to go.''
Last August, knowing that Ms. Nwegbo had financial problems and no job prospects, Mr. Joseph, 67, said he offered to adopt Cathryn, but Ms. Nwegbo turned him down; she was a loving, protective mother who would never harm her daughter, he said.
''Cathryn is the heart of Brandis,'' Mr. Joseph said.
''This is the very, very last thing I thought Brandis would do,'' he said, adding, ''It's not the Brandis I know. The Brandis I know would take a bullet for that child.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China to Release More Data On Air Pollution in Beijing

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- China said on Friday that it would begin to publish more detailed air quality data on Beijing later this month, following a public outcry over official government readings that critics said underestimated the severity of the air pollution problem in the smog-filled capital. 
Beijing plans to publish hourly air quality reports based on an international standard known as PM 2.5, which measures tiny particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter, according to an announcement on the Web site of the Beijing municipal government. Those are the particles that are considered the most serious health hazard.
Big cities in China, including Beijing, generally publish air quality data that measure particles that are up to 10 microns in diameter. Using that standard has allowed Beijing to record more than 250 ''blue sky days'' during each of the past two years.
China's Ministry of Environmental Protection also said early Saturday that monitoring pollution levels using the PM 2.5 standard would be included in a newly amended draft of national air quality standards, according to Xinhua, the state news agency.
The public's anger over declining air quality has been intensified by hourly readings released by the United States Embassy in Beijing. Those reports, released on a Twitter feed, use the 2.5 standard and paint a far grimmer picture of the city's air problems, annoying Chinese officials and alarming residents who are aware of the feeds.
Beijing's ''blue sky days'' have often turned up in United States Embassy readings as ''unhealthy.''
In 2009, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official pressed the United States Embassy to stop reporting the data, saying the information was ''confusing'' and ''insulting,'' according to a State Department cable published by WikiLeaks. The embassy continues to release the readings via Twitter.
Twitter is blocked by the Chinese government, but some Chinese are able to access the site, and republish the data.
During the past year, smog has forced the city to periodically close highways, cancel flights and even cope with state-run media assaults on health problems caused by poor air quality.
Public anger over traffic jams and smog in the capital is doing economic and political damage to the city's leaders. Some prominent bloggers, including the real estate tycoon Pan Shiyi, have sharply criticized the government's official readings on microblogs and encouraged others to vote online about whether Beijing should publish more detailed air quality readings.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Block New Uranium Mines Near Grand Canyon

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Obama administration is set to announce on Monday that it will block new uranium mining on one million acres in northern Arizona near the Grand Canyon, lobbyists and Interior Department employees who had been informed about the decision said on Friday. 
The department, which in 2009 imposed an interim ban that is soon due to expire, now plans a 20-year moratorium on new mines. Western environmental groups have long sought such a measure.
In proposing an extended moratorium last year, the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, cited the potential for pollution in waterways and harm to wildlife, desert vegetation and air quality.
There is perennial dispute over whether uranium contamination detected in the area is natural or caused by humans.
The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, says that at least one creek in Grand Canyon National Park, immediately below an old site known as the Orphan Mine, is contaminated with levels of uranium more than 10 times the federal limit.
Lee Allison, Arizona's state geologist, citing his office's work, questioned whether any Colorado River pollution from mining would be detectable, given that about 60 tons of natural uranium flow down the river each year.
Uranium mining in northern Arizona and southern Utah has moved ahead in fits and starts over the past 80 years, generally in tandem with demand.
The pressure for new mines has abated in anticipation of the ban, state officials said. Existing mines, numbering perhaps a dozen within the three blocs of land that make up the million acres in question, will probably be able to continue operations or to restart them when uranium prices make mining worth the effort again.
The long moratorium has been opposed by the region's Congressional Republicans. They argue that it would prevent the creation of thousands of jobs and upend a 28-year-old compromise on land use forged by environmentalists and mining proponents during the Reagan administration.
Taylor McKinnon, the public lands campaigns director at the Center for Biological Diversity, welcomed the decision. ''Grand Canyon National Park is an international icon, a biodiversity hot spot and the economic engine for much of the Southwest's tourist industry,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Filmmaker Walks the Line Between Outsider Status and Official Approval

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING
THE Communist Party official now expected to be the next leader of China, Xi Jinping, sat down to dinner four years ago with the American ambassador here and talked movies.
Mr. Xi told the ambassador at the time, Clark T. Randt Jr., that he liked Hollywood movies about World War II, according to a State Department cable released by WikiLeaks. Such films are ''grand and truthful,'' and ''Americans have a clear outlook on values and clearly demarcate between good and evil,'' Mr. Xi said.
By contrast, ''Curse of the Golden Flower,'' a 2006 film by Zhang Yimou, China's most prominent director, focused too much on ''bad things in imperial palaces,'' he added. ''Some Chinese moviemakers neglect values they should promote,'' Mr. Xi said, according to the cable. 
Now, Mr. Zhang has unveiled his own World War II movie, a $94 million spectacle with a clear line between good (Chinese civilians on the run, and an American helping them) and evil (Japanese invaders). The film, ''The Flowers of War,'' which opened last month across China and in a few theaters in the United States, is Mr. Zhang's take on the Nanjing Massacre. The Chinese government estimates that Japanese soldiers killed 300,000 people, many of them civilians and prisoners of war, in the six-week massacre, which started in December 1937.
The film stars Christian Bale as an undertaker who works with 13 prostitutes to try to rescue schoolgirls trapped in a church.
As of Tuesday, it had earned about $82 million at the Chinese box office, and it is China's official entry for an Oscar. At the moment, no other cultural product or artist better embodies the hunger by the Chinese state and its citizens to create culture that can attract foreigners, bolstering China's projection of ''soft power'' across the globe.
And it requires something of a delicate balancing act for Mr. Zhang, a polarizing figure eager both to stay in the good graces of the Chinese authorities and to somehow preserve the international artistic plaudits he won as an outsider to China's political establishment.
''I feel very lucky this year that the Chinese government recommended my film,'' Mr. Zhang, 60, said in an interview. ''But that doesn't make me the representative. It also doesn't mean that I will be recommended again in the future.''
In the first part of his career, Mr. Zhang made beautiful art films set in rural China that were banned by censors here. In the second part, he made beautiful historical epics that alienated many of his early supporters, who say Mr. Zhang's narratives now toe the party line.
THEN there was his stint designing the cast-of-thousands opening ceremony for the 2008 Summer Olympics. It was a moment of pride for many Chinese and for Mr. Zhang, though some critics said he had become China's Leni Riefenstahl.
But Mr. Xi's criticism of Mr. Zhang in 2007 shows that Mr. Zhang does not necessarily command respect from Chinese leaders. And Mr. Zhang said he did not see himself as a voice of the government.
Indeed, Mr. Zhang criticized the capricious system by which a film is selected to be the country's Oscar entry. That choice is left up to the powerful agency regulating the film industry. ''It should really be the job of a committee of experts in the film industry, so that the film that is artistically the best will be recommended,'' Mr. Zhang said.
As for censorship, Mr. Zhang said the script and final cut of ''The Flowers of War'' had to be approved by officials, as does any domestic film for which theatrical distribution is sought here.
''It can't be changed, and it will be there in the future,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''It's my personal wish that the process will be increasingly tolerant as Chinese society and the economy develops, to allow creative people more and more space.''
He added: ''Foreigners think that because I did the opening ceremony of the Olympics, I have certain privileges, but in fact it's not like that at all. In front of censorship, everyone is equal. My film may be subject to more scrutiny. Leaders in charge often tell me in private that my film will be looked at more closely because I will have bigger audiences, both in China and overseas.''
But Mr. Zhang did not draw a straight line between China's censorship system and the inability of its artists to consistently create cultural products that attract global respect. Others see cause and effect here. One of them is Han Han, a novelist and China's most popular blogger, who addressed the issue last month in an online essay called ''On Freedom.''
''Many things just cannot be bought with money,'' Mr. Han wrote. ''Cultural prosperity is actually the least costly to attain. The lesser the restrictions, the greater the prosperity.''
It is telling that when asked what films in his oeuvre were his favorites, Mr. Zhang first named five early ones, all independent features made outside the censorship system: ''Red Sorghum''; ''Ju Dou''; ''Raise the Red Lantern''; ''To Live''; and ''The Story of Qiu Ju.'' (''And, of course, this one, 'The Flowers of War,' '' he quickly added.)
Given his prominence, it would be impossible for Mr. Zhang to sidestep what some Chinese leaders call a cultural rivalry with the West. This week, a Communist Party magazine, Seeking Truth, published an essay by President Hu Jintao in which Mr. Hu said ''international hostile forces'' were intensifying a plot of ''Westernizing and dividing China'' by dominating its culture.
The struggle is not alien to Mr. Zhang, though he does not express it in such stark terms.
''We need good films more than ever because Hollywood films put lots of pressure on us,'' he said.
''Now we brag about how many screens we have -- 8,000 today and 10,000 or 20,000 tomorrow,'' he added. ''Hardware is easy. It's no different than building houses. The Chinese can build houses very fast. But if we don't have good Chinese films, for whom are the screens? Hollywood!''
WHILE ''The Flowers of War'' was the highest-earning Chinese film of 2011, it still finished behind ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon'' and ''Kung Fu Panda 2'' here.
Much has been written about Mr. Zhang's rise to eminence from humble roots. His first jobs were as a farmhand in his native Shaanxi Province during the Cultural Revolution and as a laborer at a cotton mill. He entered the Beijing Film Academy when it re-opened after Mao's death, and went on to film his classmate Chen Kaige's ''Yellow Earth'' before making his own features.
The idea for Mr. Zhang's latest project came when he read ''Thirteen Flowers of Nanjing,'' by Yan Geling.
Mr. Zhang wanted an A-list Hollywood actor, and his friend Steven Spielberg suggested Mr. Bale. Both Mr. Zhang and Mr. Bale say they worked well together on the set. But it is unclear what Mr. Zhang thought of Mr. Bale's attempt, after the film's premiere here, to go with a CNN camera crew to try to visit Chen Guangcheng, a blind rights lawyer under house arrest.
Mr. Bale, the star of the current ''Batman'' movies, had to fend off hostile guards. (The interview with Mr. Zhang was done the day before Mr. Bale made his trip.)
The main financing for ''The Flowers of War'' came from a private company, New Pictures, which took loans from a state bank, Mr. Zhang said. Several state-run enterprises are distributing it here.
The subject of the war with Japan and the Nanjing Massacre is a common one on television and film here, reinforcing enmity toward the Japanese, and Mr. Zhang's vision falls in line with the standard depictions of brutality. ''That is undeniable, just like the Holocaust,'' Mr. Zhang said.
Reviews by critics in the United States have not been kind. The Hollywood Reporter said it ''plays like hokum.'' There are doubts as to whether this is the film that helps China achieve cultural superpower status, even if Mr. Zhang recognizes the importance of that goal.
''We have seen many incidents where people feel lost spiritually, when culture lags behind the economy so much,'' he said. ''I think it is necessary for culture to develop in pace with the economy; otherwise the world will see China as a rich neighbor that lacks culture.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A profile on Saturday about the Chinese filmmaker Zhang Yimou misspelled the surname of a German filmmaker to whom some critics compared Mr. Zhang because of his work on the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics. She was Leni Riefenstahl, not Reifenstahl.

HEADLINE: A Tenuous Trend in Obama's Favor

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Susan Saulny contributed reporting from Conway, S.C.

 BODY:
Friday's jobs report, after weeks of other good data, makes it reasonable to wonder whether the economy may turn out to be less of a drag on President Obama's re-election campaign than has long been expected.
The economy has added 1.5 million jobs over the last year, and the pace seems to be picking up. The unemployment rate last month, 8.5 percent, was at its lowest level since February 2009, Mr. Obama's first full month in office. 
Of course, the economy has been here before, only to fall back again. In both early 2010 and early 2011, job growth picked up briefly, before the continuing global financial crisis -- including Europe's problems -- again reasserted itself.
The White House made the mistake of reacting too quickly and positively to some of that earlier news. It went so far as to refer to the summer of 2010 as ''recovery summer.''
As they had in recent weeks, Mr. Obama and his aides noted the good news on Friday, though they said there was a long way to go, and urged Congress to extend the payroll tax cut and pass other parts of the president's agenda.
''The economy is moving in the right direction,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We're creating jobs on a consistent basis.''
But he added: ''There are a lot of people that are still hurting out there. After losing more than 8 million jobs in the recession, obviously, you know, we have a lot more work to do.''
And the economy clearly remains a problem for Mr. Obama. Shortly after the release of the jobs report, Mitt Romney, the winner of this week's Republican caucus in Iowa, said at a campaign stop in South Carolina, ''This president doesn't understand how the economy works.''
In a statement, Mr. Romney called the unemployment numbers ''good news'' but said it is ''no cause for celebration.'' He added: ''President Obama's policies have slowed the recovery and created misery for 24 million Americans who are unemployed, or stuck in part-time jobs when what they really want is full-time work.''
The big question is whether the economy will continue to improve. The recent job growth, on its own, is not enough to keep unemployment falling at a significant pace.
But there is some reason for optimism. The Labor Department conducts two surveys each month, one of households and one of businesses. The business survey produces the widely cited number on job changes -- 200,000 in December.
The household survey, although usually more volatile, can sometimes provide a more accurate estimate at turning points. IT often captures jobs at new companies that are not included in the business survey.
Over the past six months, the household survey shows an average monthly gain of about 230,000, compared with a gain of only 142,000 in the business survey. Normal population growth means that the economy needs to add between 125,000 and 150,000 a month to keep unemployment from rising.
If the household survey is really the more accurate one, the good news on jobs may well continue, complicating a central point in the Republican case against Mr. Obama.
On the other hand, some of the recent strength comes from the restocking of warehouses, which will not continue. Europe still has not solved its problems. The troubles in Iran could cause oil prices to jump. And American businesses and consumers, still scarred by the financial crisis, are probably still easy to scare.
No one knows what the economy is going to do in 2012, but the chances of it improving markedly are higher than they were a couple of months ago.

HEADLINE: 200,000 New Jobs Are Positive Sign In U.S. Recovery

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Helene Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Maybe it is time to start calling the glass half full.
Employers in the United States added 200,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday, a report that came on the heels of a flurry of heartening economic news and signaled gathering momentum in the recovery. Consumer confidence lifted, factories stepped up production and small businesses showed signs of life. The nation's unemployment rate fell to 8.5 percent, its lowest level in nearly three years.
It was the sixth consecutive month that the economy showed a net gain of more than 100,000 jobs -- not enough to restore employment to prerecession levels but enough, perhaps, to cheer President Obama as he enters the election year.
Mr. Obama is calculating that he can make a credible argument that he took over a country in an economic disaster and slowly walked it back. 
Still, his response to the jobs report was more tempered than triumphant. ''We have made real progress,'' Mr. Obama said during a visit to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ''Now is not the time to stop.''
He called on Congress to extend a payroll tax cut that is set to expire at the end of February.
Mr. Obama apparently does not want to repeat the mistake of overenthusiasm. In early 2010 and again in early 2011, the White House was quick to trumpet the news when the economy made moves toward recovery that turned out to be feints, going so far as to refer to the summer of 2010 as ''recovery summer.''
There are reasons for caution. Many economists do not expect growth in 2012 to keep up the pace of the fourth quarter of last year. Expectations are generally positive, but very modest.
And the president remains vulnerable to attack on his economic record. ''This president doesn't understand how the economy works,'' Mitt Romney, the winner of this week's Republican caucus in Iowa, said at a campaign stop in South Carolina shortly after the jobs report was released.
But economists like Markus Schomer of PineBridge Investments now have a much rosier view than they had back in August, after a spring and summer of lost economic ground and a demoralizing political debate over the nation's debt ceiling. At that time, Mr. Schomer thought, as many did, that government dysfunction was paralyzing the economy. Now, he is ratcheting up his growth forecast for 2012.
''The improving trend in the U.S. labor markets is not just a temporary blip, but seems to be something quite sustainable,'' he said.
Which is not to say that there are no potential headwinds -- last year's signs of momentum were dashed by global factors like gas prices and the earthquake in Japan. ''I'm a little bit concerned that Iran could be this year's Japan,'' Mr. Schomer said.
Among the pieces of good news in Friday's report is that the drop in the jobless rate came largely from real gains, not from discouraged workers giving up the job hunt. The new jobs were spread broadly across industries, with transportation and warehousing, retail, manufacturing and restaurants all adding jobs.
In addition, average wages on private payrolls ticked up by 4 cents an hour, though over the year wages have not kept pace with inflation. And government downsizing, which has been a drag on the jobs numbers, slowed in December, with only 12,000 public jobs lost. The private sector added 212,000 jobs.
In another positive sign, the unemployment rate seemed to be dropping at a faster rate than the number of new jobs would imply. New businesses and the newly self-employed are less likely to be counted by the Labor Department's survey of businesses, from which the job numbers are drawn, than by the department's survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is calculated. The December rate of 8.5 percent was down from a revised 8.7 percent in November.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who can find only part-time work and people who have stopped looking for work, declined to 15.2 percent. A year earlier, it was 16.6 percent. Over the same period, the United States added 1.6 million jobs.
Economists continued to warn of potential dangers ahead, including the crisis in the euro zone, increased tensions with Iran which could lead to higher gas prices and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. Congress could decline to continue extensions of the payroll tax break and unemployment benefits that have given spending a boost. Loans are still hard to obtain, and home prices have continued to fall.
Still, context is everything. The same modest upward trends that a few months ago were dismissed as far too anemic to be noticeable are now greeted with tentative praise. ''People were very much thinking that the sky was falling,'' said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. ''It's no small victory that we're up here, even with all these headwinds.''
Economists suggested that the good news and consumer confidence might feed off each other, leading to further increases in spending that, they hope, will be followed by the wage increases necessary to sustain that spending.
Bullish types were quick to trumpet the American economy's resilience.
''This is the real thing,'' said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. ''This is finally the economy throwing off the shackles of the credit crunch.''
But there is a deep hole to climb out of. There are still more than 13 million jobless Americans, 5.5 million of whom have been unemployed for half a year or more. And even those finding work are often taking salary cuts, with job creation concentrated in low-wage sectors.
''We need reports this strong and stronger for many years to come to bring our labor market back to health,'' said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute.
The report was brighter for some groups than others. Unemployment among men continued to decline, while for women it stayed flat, in part because women held a disproportionate share of the state and local government jobs that were lost, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Over all, women left the labor force, which includes job seekers as well as job holders, and men joined it. Unemployment among teenagers ticked down a bit, but more than one in five Iraq and Afghanistan veterans were unemployed, double the rate of the previous year.
Kitty Kent, 58, who lost her census job in March, got the call she had been waiting for from a temporary agency three weeks ago. She is now working part time as a receptionist. ''I don't expect it to have a direct effect on me,'' she said of the jobs report, ''but what I do expect is that the president will get a little bit of respect and perhaps more cooperation.''
Hamdi Ulukaya, the chief executive of Chobani, the yogurt company, said he was building a new plant in Idaho, investing $100 million in upgrades to the company's plant in South Edmeston, N.Y., and hiring hundreds of workers. ''The worst is over,'' Mr. Ulukaya said.
Stock markets seemed to have already factored in the news, which was foreshadowed in a report on Thursday by ADP, the payroll processing company, that showed a gain of 325,000 private sector jobs in December. ADP's reports do not always correlate with the Labor Department's findings, but they can provide additional insight. Diane Swonk, an economist with Mesirow Financial, said most of the new jobs in the ADP report were at small businesses and that generally only newer small businesses use a payroll company.
''It's one of those things where you look at that and say, 'That would be really cool if that continues,' '' Ms. Swonk said. ''It's not just small business -- it's new business formation.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about job statistics for December described the data incorrectly at one point. It showed a rate of 8.5 percent for unemployment, not for employment. The article also referred incorrectly to the historical significance of high unemployment during presidential elections. Franklin D. Roosevelt was twice re-elected with a jobless rate higher than 8.5 percent; it is not the case that no sitting president has won re-election with a jobless rate that high.

HEADLINE: In New Hampshire, Fiscal Anxiety Despite Relative Economic Health

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Concord, N.H.

 BODY:
PITTSFIELD, N.H. -- Karen Eastman has worked at the same small manufacturing company for 18 years and makes a solid living stitching sleeves for firefighter coats, but the economy is still her foremost concern heading into this state's presidential primary voting next week.
''For now I'm O.K.,'' she said, ''but you just don't know what could happen.''
Although New Hampshire has one of the healthiest economies in the country -- with the lowest poverty rate of any state and the fourth-lowest unemployment rate, at 5.2 percent -- polls and interviews suggest voters are still deeply nervous about the nation's fiscal health and the rising cost of groceries, health care and other staples, even if they are working and relatively secure. 
The high anxiety -- in a state where the jobless rate is much lower than some other early nominating states, including South Carolina (9.9 percent), Florida (10.0 percent) and Nevada (13.0 percent) -- portends just how dominant an issue the economy will be in the presidential campaign. It also suggests trouble here for President Obama, who won New Hampshire in 2008 with 54 percent of the vote but may face an uphill battle this year even as the state's economy shows signs of improving further.
''I hear a lot of people that voted for him the first time around that say they're really not keen on him this time,'' said Margo Weeks, a nurse from Gilford who said she would probably vote for former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts on Tuesday. She voted for Senator John McCain in 2008.
Mr. Romney's business background and two decades in the private sector are crucial to her support, she said. ''I'm worried about the cost of living going up and up; that's what really bothers me,'' she said. ''I make decent money, but to put gas in your car, buy your groceries -- I mean, it is unbelievable.''
New Hampshire was in a better position than most states to weather the economic crisis because of its diversified economy, its relatively low cost of doing business in an otherwise expensive region, and a cautious approach by its banks to the subprime lending practices that wreaked havoc in other states, said Dennis C. Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies. The state lost 4.5 percent of its jobs from December 2007 to early 2010, Mr. Delay said, compared with a 6.5 percent loss nationally.
Even so, there were 38,660 people out of work here in November, the latest month for which data is available, compared with some 30,000 before the national economic crisis began in the fall of 2008. Mrs. Eastman's husband is one of them; his job at a textile mill went to China two years ago, she said.
The state has lost more than 14,000 manufacturing jobs since 2005, its construction industry is still flagging, and hospitals began laying off workers after the state legislature sharply cut Medicaid reimbursements last year.
''Nobody here thinks, 'Oh well, at least things are better in New Hampshire than they are in New Jersey,' '' said Charlie Arlinghaus, president of the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a conservative research organization in Concord. ''Everybody is just worried.''
A poll released last week by CNN and Time magazine found that 47 percent of likely Republican primary voters here said the economy would be ''extremely important'' to their vote, a far greater portion than those who named foreign affairs (28 percent) or moral issues (13 percent). The poll of 543 likely voters had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Sheila Dickerson, 57, an independent voter, has worked at Globe Manufacturing, a company that has made turnout gear for firefighters here since 1901, for almost 25 years. She said she felt confident she could hang on to her job until retirement but worried what would happen afterward. She is leaning toward voting for Representative Ron Paul of Texas on Tuesday, she said, because ''his thing is about straightening out the overspending that government's doing.''
Of Mr. Obama, she said, ''I feel he doesn't really care about America.'' She voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008.
Jim Roche, president of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, said members of his group were ''very cautiously optimistic'' about an economic turnaround. Still, he added, in a recent survey, 79 percent said they did not plan to add employees in 2012. ''There's just a fair amount of uncertainty that most people recognize,'' he said, ''both domestically and internationally, that makes them very nervous and frankly reluctant to commit to hiring new people.''
Rob Freese, a senior vice president at Globe, said he had ruled out supporting Mr. Romney because the health care law he signed in Massachusetts had raised costs for businesses, something he did not want to happen in New Hampshire.
''On 380 employees, it's over $1 million a year that we're paying in health insurance rates,'' Mr. Freese said. ''Just this year, we paid for a 30 percent increase in our premiums. It's all supposed to be getting better, and yet it certainly doesn't feel that way.''
New Hampshire also has some of the highest property tax rates in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, and they are rising because of the drop in real estate values. Garry Haworth, a retired chemist who was volunteering at a phone bank for Mr. Obama in Manchester on Tuesday, said his property taxes had increased 10 percent last year.
''Most of the people I know who probably could afford to retire don't dare,'' said Mr. Haworth, who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2008.
Still, Mr. Haworth said he wanted to give Mr. Obama's policies a chance to work, as did Lucy Natkiel, a small-business owner from Hill who said the Republican candidates were not offering solutions that could get through Congress.
''I think it's unrealistic to expect it to turn around and return to boom times in a short period of time,'' Ms. Natkiel said.
Mary Lynn Edwards, an independent voter who supports Mr. Obama, said it was impossible not to worry about the national economy even if New Hampshire's was relatively stable.
''I do realize we're in a better position than most states,'' she said, ''but it affects every single one of us.''

HEADLINE: As Romney Jabs at Obama, His Rivals Swing at Him

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and SUSAN SAULNY; Michael D. Shear reported from Manchester, N.H., and Susan Saulny from Conway, S.C.

 BODY:
CONWAY, S.C. -- Mitt Romney on Friday slammed President Obama for failing the American people and accused him of dragging ''the soul of America'' toward a ''European-style welfare state.''
Speaking to a crowd of several hundred people at a peanut warehouse here, Mr. Romney did not mention new data showing that the country added 200,000 jobs in December, sending the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years. The better-than-expected jobs data was released just moments before Mr. Romney took the stage in South Carolina. 
''We're taking it back!'' Mr. Romney said of the White House before returning to New Hampshire for the final weekend before the voting in there. ''We're taking it back!''
Flanked by Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Senator John McCain of Arizona, who won this state in 2008, Mr. Romney continued his criticism of Mr. Obama's leadership.
''This president doesn't understand how the economy works,'' Mr. Romney said. ''It's time to get a president who does.''
In a statement, the White House said the employment report ''provides further evidence that the economy is continuing to heal from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.''
In a statement issued after the rally, Mr. Romney called the unemployment numbers ''good news'' but said it was ''no cause for celebration.'' He added: ''President Obama's policies have slowed the recovery and created misery for 24 million Americans who are unemployed, or stuck in part-time jobs when what they really want is full-time work.''
In New Hampshire, Mr. Romney's rivals are sharpening their attacks against him and intensifying their appeals to voters as they try to slow Mr. Romney's march toward the Republican nomination. A new poll suggests that while Mr. Romney remains well in the lead in New Hampshire, Rick Santorum is gaining support in that state. In a 7 News/Suffolk University tracking poll, 40 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for or leaned toward Mr. Romney, 17 percent backed Ron Paul and 11 percent choose Mr. Santorum.
In a television appearance late Thursday evening, Newt Gingrich savaged Mr. Romney's record in Massachusetts, accusing him of appointing liberal judges, raising taxes and allowing abortions to be financed in the health care law he pushed through in the state.
''Governor Romney will not be able to hide behind negative ads,'' Mr. Gingrich said on Fox News's ''Sean Hannity Show.'' He added, ''People will go, 'Oh yes, that's not somebody I want to be the Republican nominee.' ''
Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor, also took aim at Mr. Romney at an event Thursday night as he tried to jump-start his struggling campaign.
''The establishment is teeing up Mr. Romney as their choice,'' said Mr. Huntsman, who received the endorsement of The Boston Globe on Thursday. ''The people of New Hampshire will not be told for whom to vote. The people of New Hampshire do not want a coronation.''
The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times, said that ''while Romney proceeds cautiously, strategically, trying to appease enough constituencies to get himself the nomination, Huntsman has been bold.''
The paper added that Mr. Huntsman ''would be the best candidate to seize this moment in G.O.P. history, and the best-prepared to be president.''
At an early-morning rally in South Carolina on Friday, Mr. Romney did not respond to the attacks against him. But John H. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor who backs Mr. Romney's presidential campaign, fired back during a Fox News interview Friday morning.
Mr. Sununu challenged Mr. Gingrich's claim about abortion funding, calling that charge ''wrong'' and saying that ''Mr. Gingrich has a little difficulty with the truth.''
And Mr. Sununu mocked Mr. Huntsman, saying: ''Poor Jon Huntsman got stuck with another Democratic endorsement. Mr. Huntsman still can't decide which primary to be in.''
Mr. Romney is scheduled to fly back to New Hampshire from South Carolina Friday afternoon after spending 24 hours campaigning in the Palmetto State.
South Carolina is a critical piece in the strategy of the Romney campaign. The outcome of the primary could play a crucial role in determining how long the Republican nominating contest remains a competitive fight.
Referring to Mr. Romney as ''landslide Mitt,'' a reference to Mr. Romney's razor-thin win in the Iowa caucuses on Tuesday, Mr. McCain said: ''It's going to come down, my friends, as it always does, to South Carolina. Whoever gets out their vote is going to win. And we're not taking a single vote for granted.''
''This is going to be a very, very close South Carolina election,'' Mr. McCain said. ''If Mitt Romney wins here, he will be the next president of the United States.''
While Mr. Romney won the endorsement of Ms. Haley and other leading Republicans in the state, the socially conservative landscape remains difficult political terrain for him.
Ms. Haley, whose endorsement was highly coveted by the candidates because of the cachet it holds with the most conservative voters, said, ''Governor Romney will be a friend in the White House, which is what we need to see.''

HEADLINE: Chinese News Agency Issues Warning Against U.S. Moves

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- China's state-run news media warned Washington on Friday not to ''recklessly practice militarism'' or engage in ''war mongering,'' a day after the Obama administration outlined a new military strategy with an increased focus on China. 
The sharply worded commentary, published by the official Xinhua News Agency, also urged the United States to play a constructive role in the region.
President Obama introduced a new defense strategy on Thursday, aimed at creating a leaner, more dynamic American fighting force with an enlarged presence in Asia and the Pacific.
Although the administration is seeking to trim hundreds of billions of dollars from the Pentagon budget, the president and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta have said the United States will shift resources to the region because of its growing economic and military significance.
The United States had signaled its intention to bolster its military presence in Asia last month, and analysts say that has heightened concerns here that Washington is trying to counter China's rise.
Relations between the United States and China have often been strained over military issues, including the American decision to continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, which Beijing views as a breakaway province.
China has rapidly expanded its military in the past year, and plans to spend aggressively in the hopes of creating a military that can match the country's growing economic might. Last week, China announced ambitious plans to expand its space program and put a person on the moon in the next five years.
That move comes as the American space program is slimming down.
China has also begun releasing information about its own advanced weapons and technology, including its first aircraft carrier and a stealth fighter jet.
A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry could not be reached for comment late Friday.
The Xinhua commentary, published under the byline Yu Zhixiao, does not represent China's official position on the Obama administration's new defense strategy. But because Xinhua is the official propaganda arm of the Communist Party, its editorials often mirror Beijing's positions.
The commentary seemed to echo earlier statements by Chinese military officials.
''The U.S. role, if fulfilled with a positive attitude and free from a cold war-style zero-sum mentality, will not only be conducive to regional stability and prosperity, but be good for China, which needs a peaceful environment to continue its economic development,'' the commentary said.
''However, while boosting its military presence in the Asia-Pacific, the United States should abstain from flexing its muscles, as this won't help solve regional disputes.''

ANXIETY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
DESPITE ECONOMIC HEALTH
New Hampshire has one of the healthiest economies in the country, but polls and interviews with voters there suggest they are still deeply nervous about the nation's fiscal health and the rising cost of groceries, health care and other staples. The high anxiety portends just how dominant an issue the economy will be in the presidential campaign. PAGE A11

SUBWAY RIDERS FACE FINES

Sitting improperly on a subway seat is perhaps the most minor crime New Yorkers are routinely arrested for. Riders also cannot recline across more than one seat or stand too close to subway doors if it obstructs other passengers. In 2011, police officers handed out more than 6,000 tickets for these violations, which resulted in more than 1,600 arrests. PAGE A17

HEADLINE: In Climate of Disaffection, Democrats See Hope in Their Battle for Congress

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Marjorie Connelly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- While most of the political world's attention has been focused on the presidential primaries, Democrats who took a beating in the midterm elections say they have slowly but steadily gotten back in the game when it comes to the battle for control of Congress.
A year of fiscal fights that left the country careening from threatened government shutdown to federal default back to shutdown has hurt every member of Congress, but polls show it has hurt Republicans a bit more. Just before Christmas, House Republicans were forced to make humiliating concessions to Democrats over the extension of a payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits, dinging the party's tax-cutting brand.
And improving economic signs captured in jobs gains reported on Friday also have Democrats feeling more optimistic.
''This morning's announcement that our economy added 200,000 jobs in December, bringing our unemployment rate down to 8.5 percent, is a sign of progress and provides further evidence that our economy is recovering,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Friday. 
At the same time, President Obama, while still embattled, has seen his poll numbers improve slightly in the wake of the chaos on the Hill. Further, the Republican narrative that so dominated 2010 -- deficit spending as the nation's greatest ill -- has been matched in recent months by the Democratic pounding of the table on income inequality.
Occupy Wall Street protests eclipsed Tea Parties around the nation this fall in defining at least some of the national mood. In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in October, 66 percent of respondents who were asked if they felt that ''the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among more people'' said it should be more evenly distributed, while 26 percent said the system was fair.
All of this has left Democrats feeling more hopeful that they can recapture many of the 25 House seats needed for a majority, fend off a formidable challenge by Republicans over control of the Senate and perhaps keep Mr. Obama in Washington.
''A year ago today we were depressed, we were doubtful and we were in debt,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, who oversees the committee that works to get Democrats elected to the House.''
''Since then, because of Republican mishaps and our own aggressiveness,'' he said, the party has regrouped in its fund-raising and persuaded more Democrats to run. ''I am not predicting we are going to take the House back,'' Mr. Israel said. ''But I am willing to sign an affidavit that it will be razor close.''
Color Republicans unimpressed.
There are far fewer Republicans in Democratic districts now than there were Democrats in Republican districts in 2010, and many of the current batch of Republicans have been shored up through redistricting. More Democrats are also retiring from both chambers than Republicans; in the Senate, seven Democrats have decided to leave, the most recent being Ben Nelson of Nebraska, whose announcement last week further hurt his party's chances of holding onto control there.
What is more, Republicans often cite the respected political expert Charlie Cook, who points out that only once since World War II has the party holding the White House gained more than 15 House seats in a presidential election year. And Mr. Obama remains an impediment in many crucial districts.
''House Democrats' public chest-thumping is recurring entertainment,'' said Representative Pete Sessions of Texas, who is Mr. Israel's counterpart at the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''But it falls far from political reality. Even Democrats know that the Republican majority is strengthening as more Democrats throw in the towel in order to avoid facing a referendum election on their job-destroying policies.''
Republicans and others also argue that the president's new strategy of running against Congress carries risks for Democrats who could be tarred along with Republicans.
But Democrats hope that by narrowing their majority in the House, even if Republicans win control of the Senate, they can push back against the policy agenda that Republicans have pressed, often with great success, over the last year.
In any event, the political complexion of the 113th Congress will almost certainly complicate the agenda of whoever is in the White House come January 2013.
''What will most likely happen is you will either have a narrow majority in either chamber or a still-divided Congress,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. ''You are looking at a president who is going to face the same governing environment that President Obama faces and Bush before him faced, and in some ways the problems might be worse.''
There are two ways to look at current polling, and Democrats choose the glass-is-half-full approach.
In a December poll conducted by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal , 45 percent wanted the Democrats to win control of Congress in November while 43 percent supported the Republicans.
That is a slight uptick for Democrats since the summer, when the news organizations found 47 percent of voters surveyed said they preferred a Republican-controlled Congress, and 41 percent said they would rather see the Democrats win a majority this year.
However, while 72 percent of the public disapproves of how Republicans in Congress are doing their jobs according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, nearly as many, 66 percent, disapprove of the job performance of Congressional Democrats.
''Democrats did a good job in the recent tax fight of drawing Republicans into the spotlight,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, an editor at The Rothenberg Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. ''But they don't want to go into 2012 having it simply be referendum on whether people feel good about the country, because Democrats are viewed as more responsible for state of the economy. I am not convinced that Democrats have won the message battle for the 2012 election.''
But Democrats believe that they have momentum on their side, just as Republicans did at this time in 2010. Democrats cite money, polls and candidate recruitment as the central beacons of light.
Last January, ''I couldn't even get people I wanted to run to return my calls,'' Mr. Israel said. These days, he is persuading some of them -- including nearly a dozen who lost their seats in 2010 -- to take another shot.
Dan Maffei, a Democrat who lost his New York seat by roughly 600 votes to Ann Marie Buerkle in 2010, said that after licking his wounds for several months, he decided over the summer to try and regain his seat.
''It was very challenging to lose,'' he said. ''After my wife and I saw how challenging it was, we just sort of wanted to walk away. But as my successor's record emerged, we kind of came to the conclusion, if I don't get back in, who will?''
While the party left him to his own devices last time, not anticipating a loss, Mr. Maffei said he has been assured help in this campaign. ''It is a lot easier to run if you have full support of D.C.C.C.,'' he said.
Congressional Democrats have raised more money lately than Republicans. But many campaign finance experts say that is less important than in past years because of the increasing influence of outside groups.
''If the D.C.C.C. outraises the N.R.C.C.,'' Mr. Gonzales said, ''big deal.'' Conservative groups like American Crossroads and other outsider organizations ''are going to have money and spend it in key races,'' he said. ''So analyzing fund-raising is more complicated than it has ever been.''
But Democrats are clinging to a series of new polls that they say show a momentum that can be harnessed to their advantage, particularly around fiscal policy issues. For instance, a recent poll by Gallup found that voters felt more confidence toward Mr. Obama and the Democrats in Congress (41 percent to 34 percent) concerning the extension of payroll tax cuts and unemployment benefits.
Democrats in competitive districts wasted no time conducting automated calls on the issue to voters, even before the final outcome of the payroll tax fight.
Both parties note the length of time until November, when anything can happen to shift the political ground. Republicans have a history of disciplined messaging, and Democrats have been known to allow infighting between its most liberal members and those who seek the center to unravel their unity. But the party continues to hope.
''The economy, jobs and income equality are the biggest issues,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chamber's no. 3 Democrat. ''Taken together, Republicans are having trouble getting their arms around the issue. The ballgame is changing.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Iranian Leader, Increasingly Isolated, to Visit Latin America

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and SIMON ROMERO; William Neuman reported from New York, and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro. Maria Eugenia Diaz contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela.

 BODY:
When President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran begins a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday, showcasing his support in the region against a backdrop of international tensions over his nation's nuclear program, he is set to visit some of the United States' most ardent critics: Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador.
But the list of countries Mr. Ahmadinejad will not be visiting is equally telling.
Though Iran is reeling from successive rounds of international and unilateral sanctions, Mr. Ahmadinejad is not visiting Brazil, the region's economic powerhouse. Nor is he going to other large countries like Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, underscoring that his visit is limited to nations without extensive influence or the capacity to offer much of a major economic partnership. 
''If Iran is intent on spreading its political influence, it will not find a hospitable environment in Latin America,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue. ''Most governments may want more breathing space from Washington, but they are not looking to be aligned strategically with Tehran.''
The trip, Mr. Ahmadinejad's sixth official visit to the region since becoming president in 2005, seems intended as a counterstrike against Iran's increasing international isolation. But his previous trips have not always gone smoothly; his one visit to Brazil, in 2009, was met with protests.
''Dealing with Iran has been nettlesome for Brazil,'' said Stephen C. Johnson, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''There's not a lot of enthusiasm for welcoming Iran's president at this time, particularly as sanctions begin to tighten and there are continuing indications that Iran is developing a nuclear weapon.''
When Brazil's previous president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, went to Tehran in 2010 to help negotiate a deal for Iran to exchange uranium, he stirred up a hornet's nest of criticism that Mr. Ahmadinejad had used him to try to derail United Nations sanctions against Iran. It was widely interpreted as a blot on Mr. da Silva's otherwise enviable legacy, causing the kind of friction with Washington that Brazil's current president, Dilma Rousseff, might try to avoid.
''I'm not sure if Dilma wants to cause a big uproar at this point,'' said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor of international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo.
Iran remains an important trading partner for Brazil, passing Russia last year as the top export market for Brazilian beef. It is also a large buyer of Brazilian sugar and soybeans.
But the relationship is asymmetrical and may be more important to Iran. In 2010, Brazil was Iran's 10th largest trading partner, ranked by the value of goods exchanged, according to data compiled by the European Union's directorate general for trade. But Iran ranked 27th among Brazil's trading partners.
As for Iran's trade with some other countries in the region, including Ecuador, it has grown considerably in a short time, but still remains relatively small.
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela is Mr. Ahmadinejad's most vociferous ally in the region, but Iran ranks 42nd on the list of Venezuela's trading partners, accounting for less than 0.1 percent of Venezuela's total imports and exports, according to the European Commission data.
With the international sparring over Iran's nuclear program escalating, the visit gives Mr. Ahmadinejad the chance to glad hand with leaders from other countries who have shown sympathy and solidarity. He will attend the inauguration of President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua on Tuesday.
The visit also brings benefits for Mr. Ahmadinejad's hosts, giving them the opportunity to thumb their noses at the United States in front of their own political constituents.
''You shore up your base,'' Mr. Johnson said of the impact of the visit for leaders like Mr. Chavez in Venezuela. ''You enhance your standing as an actor on the global stage.''
Elsa Cardozo, a professor of international studies at the Central University of Venezuela, said the Iranian president's visit gave Mr. Chavez a chance to strike a combative pose as he embarks on a nearly yearlong re-election campaign, allowing him to ''project his own style and radical message.''
''His core supporters are very radical and he doesn't want to lose them,'' Ms. Cardozo said.
Last month, President Obama addressed the Venezuela-Iran relationship in written responses to questions from El Universal, a newspaper in Caracas.
''Ultimately, it is up to the Venezuelan people to determine what they gain from a relationship with a country that violates universal human rights and is isolated from much of the world,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Here in the Americas, we take Iranian activities, including in Venezuela, very seriously.''
Mr. Chavez responded by lambasting Mr. Obama, calling him a fraud and an embarrassment and telling him to mind his own business.
Iran appears eager to exploit seams in hemispheric relations at a time that the United States' sway has diminished. The Organization of American States, a traditional mechanism for Washington to project its influence, was weakened last year when Brazil delayed its annual $6.5 million payment to the body. The dispute arose after the organization's human rights commission called on Brazil to suspend construction of its Belo Monte dam complex in the Amazon River basin.
Countries in the region are also seeking new alliances to counterbalance the traditional weight of the United States. A meeting of heads of state from Latin America and the Caribbean, including Cuba, which is excluded from the O.A.S., was held in Caracas in December. The United States was not invited.
The regional dynamic has also shifted as other major countries, particularly China, make large investments and take an increasing role in trade.
In that context, Iran is a minor player but one that can be particularly problematic. Iran appears to have used its relations with some Latin American countries to try to circumvent international sanctions on its financial operations.
In 2008, the United States imposed sanctions aimed at shutting down a Venezuelan-based bank that it said was operating closely with an Iranian bank that helped finance Iran's weapons development program.
That was followed by efforts to establish ties between a sanctioned Iranian bank and the Central Bank of Ecuador, according to news reports in that country and State Department cables revealed through WikiLeaks.
And last May, the United States sanctioned Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, for shipping a gasoline blending component to Iran. The sanctions barred the state oil company from doing some business with the United States government but it did not affect Venezuelan oil exports to the United States.
Iran's ties in the region have often resulted in announcements of joint economic initiatives, like the establishment of development funds, construction of car or tractor factories in countries like Venezuela or Bolivia, or a port project in Nicaragua. But the projects have either failed to materialize or offered little in the way of real economic activity.
Douglas C. Farah, a senior fellow of the International Assessment and Strategy Center, a national security research group in Alexandria, Va., said such financial relationships were easily manipulated.
''It gives them a chance to get into countries to buy much needed equipment and ways to get into financial systems that will allow them, unsanctioned, to move their money around the world,'' Mr. Farah said.

HEADLINE: Once Critical of Bain, But Now Advising Romney

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
It is has become a staple of Mitt Romney's campaign stump speech: the claim that appointees to the National Labor Relations Board are ''labor stooges'' whose anti-business approach has impeded economic growth.
But a top adviser to Mr. Romney's presidential campaign has his own intriguing relationship with the labor board: as a member in the early 2000s, he found that two companies controlled by Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mr. Romney, had violated labor rules. 
At the time, Peter Schaumber, now the co-chairman of Mr. Romney's labor advisory team, served as an appointee of President George W. Bush. The board, a federal agency, safeguards workers' right to unionize.
In both cases, Mr. Schaumber signed opinions that found the companies, Nutraceutical International and the Walco International Company, had engaged in unfair labor practices.
Mr. Romney was the chief executive of Bain Capital when the firm originally invested in the two companies, but had left by the time of the labor board rulings. As The New York Times has reported, he continued to earn a share of Bain Capital's profits for at least a
decade after his retirement in 1999.
Mr. Schaumber co-wrote an opinion finding that that Nutraceutical, a maker of nutritional supplements, had improperly closed a store in 2003 - and fired 31 workers - to prevent employees from establishing a union.
Mr. Schaumber also attached his name to a ruling that Walco International, a distributor of pet and livestock supplies, had failed to recognize and bargain with a newly formed union that same year.
Mr. Schuamber's rulings could prove tricky for Mr. Romney, since they serve as a reminder of the sometimes messy consequences of Bain investments.
And by naming Mr. Schaumber as a campaign adviser, Mr. Romney may be undercutting his stinging critique of the board's members.
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney's campaign, did not address Mr. Schaumber's role at the N.L.R.B., but said the candidate stood by his remarks about the board.
''Governor Romney's extensive business experience has given him a deep understanding of how the economy works and how jobs are created, and that includes the effects of labor policy,'' she said.
''He supports strong protections for worker rights, which are being undermined by President Obama's labor stooges as they use the National Labor Relations Board to increase the power of union bosses over businesses and workers.''
Mr. Romney has relentlessly attacked the N.L.R.B. as ''out of control'' and ''unaccountable'' under President Obama, even suggesting that it be eliminated.
This week, he intensified that critique, calling President Obama a ''crony capitalist'' for appointing three members of the board without Congressional approval. He said the appointments were a reward for labor unions that had endorsed him in 2008.
In a series of new TV and radio advertisements running in South Carolina, he even calls the N.L.R.B.'s challenge against Boeing's new aircraft plant in the state ''un-American.'' The board had charged that moving jobs to the new plant was an illegal retaliation against union members in Washington state. The case was later dropped.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Prophet for a New Workplace

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: The words of Peter Drucker, the sociologist, management thinker and best-selling author, who died at age 95 in 2005, still resonate with anyone in technology. His thinking about the new networked era offers insights into the changing way we work. Business schools, heavy with math and economics majors, may not be recruiting the right kind of people to learn how to run this kind of workplace. 

 BODY:
 The business world is embracing social networks, both as work enablers and as products. Sites like LinkedIn keep people up on job opportunities, while professional "friends" on Facebook can keep us abreast of advances in our fields.
More recently, office software with instant messages, "likes" and fan pages are replacing e-mail and Power Point presentations as tools for efficiency. Ideas will be communicated more rapidly and refined better, proponents say, and the informal collaborative tools will make it easier to identify the smartest talent that contributes the most.
Technology like this foreshadows changes in how we do everything from brainstorming about a new product to developing relationships with partners and customers. Big companies like I.B.M., Google and Salesforce, along with upstarts like Asana, which was started by the co-founder of Facebook, are readying products that alter the way workers work and managers manage.The effect on work, proponents say, will be as big as those wrought by the assembly line, time clocks and the organizational chart.
Somebody else was thinking about this quite a while ago.
Peter Drucker, the sociologist, management thinker and best-selling author who died at age 95 in 2005, devoted most of his late work to exploration of "the knowledge society," which he termed "a new basic civilization." He foresaw new social structures and new kinds of leadership and power emerging, as they would with any civilization. While Mr. Drucker didn't have all the answers, his ideas about the governing principles of the new era offer some intriguing clues about which of the new software offerings have the best chances and what business schools should be, but aren't, teaching.
The new civilization, said Mr. Drucker, began with the creation of Eniac, the first general-purpose digital computer, in 1946. It ended the previous technology-driven civilization, which started with the development of the steam engine in the 17th century. That era's linear, mechanistic view of the world has slowly been supplanted by a networked one.
In a 1989 essay titled "From Analysis to Perception -- The New Worldview," (available in the book "The New Realities") Mr. Drucker wrote, "Since information knows no national boundaries, it will also form new 'transnational' communities of people who, maybe without ever seeing each other in the flesh, are in communion because they are in communication." Not a bad call, almost a quarter-century before 2011's uprisings across the Arab world, the rise of the leaderless, transnational Anonymous hacker group and the Occupy movement in the United States and abroad.
Mr. Drucker thought the new civilization's development would probably last longer than his life or any of ours. While it is impossible to know what such a world would finally look like, he noted that it would be marked by a biological, systems-based view, a significant change from the more linear command and control systems that created the Industrial Revolution.
Leaders in business must learn to think in terms of relationships and ecosystems among both employees and companies, rather than repeated execution of sharply defined roles, he said. "The question of the right size for a task will be the central one," Mr. Drucker wrote. "The right size will increasingly be whatever handles most effectively the information needed for task and function. Where the traditional organization was held together by command and control, the 'skeleton' of the information-based organization will be the optimal information system."
This is exactly what the proponents of workplace social media think their products can create. Outfits like oDesk and Elance help companies manage teams of contractors across the globe for specific jobs, then rate individuals, the way restaurants are reviewed on Yelp. Inside companies, social software is seen as a way of figuring out who is really good at doing what and which workers in different divisions should be brought together for different projects.
"When you have informal discussions and updates between different parts of the company that the rest of the company can see and act on, you build a denser network," says Timothy Young, founder of Socialcast, a social software company bought by VMWare last spring. "A manager can look up any employee and see who talks with him the most, who he talks to, how well they answer questions, what groups he interacts with and how much work he ships. He can assemble teams from across the company, made up of all the right skills for a particular job."
The big challenge presented by this more powerful but less structured world, as Mr. Drucker saw it, is for managers to correctly describe jobs to the dispersed groups, build the proper size teams of compatible players and motivate people in new ways that give their lives meaning. Because managers have little experience with this in the real world, their knowing how to do it online is not easily taught.
That means treating the new technology as a significant break from the past and not just an incremental improvement. While software vendors typically like to portray their products as easy upgrades, so as not to frighten their customers, this time the successful products and practices may have to address real change head on.
Business schools, heavy with math and economics majors, may not even be recruiting the right kind of people to learn how to run this kind of workplace. In the same book as "From Analysis to Perception," Mr. Drucker wrote that "management will increasingly be the discipline and practice through which the humanities will again acquire recognition, impact and relevance." Those are mental habits of psychologists and poets, though in the new civilization, most likely poets comfortable in statistical analysis.

HEADLINE: Investing in Early Childhood

BYLINE: NICHOLAS KRISTOF


HIGHLIGHT: Readers comment on my column about the perils of toxic stress and the importance of early-childhood interventions. 

 BODY:
My Sunday column looks at new evidence of the importance of early childhood and pregnancy on life outcomes. I've been increasingly impressed by the research that suggests that biological mechanisms -- such as the way cortisol floods a small child under stress, disrupting brain development -- appear to lay the groundwork for social disadvantage later. But I was looking for a peg to write about this, and then the American Academy of Pediatrics provided it by issuing a landmark policy statement endorsing this new science of toxic stress.
One thing I should clarify. I think the evidence is pretty good that investments early on get the most bank for the buck, and that's one reason I'm a huge fan of early childhood education (and of earlier interventions, such as Nurse-Family Partnership, that support vulnerable women in pregnancy). But that's not to say that school isn't important, too. There's no silver bullet to addressing these issues, only silver buckshot. We need to do more in early interventions, but also more in school -- and at every stage thereafter. 
One of the biggest long-term challenges we face, I think, is the way an underclass is becoming stratified in the United States, replicating poverty from generation to generation. That makes poverty a more serious problem in America than in other countries, and it's probably a reason why there's now less economic mobility in the US than in Europe. Changing that social structure is going to require many kinds of changes, but the point of this latest research is that we have to start early. By the time a child reaches kindergarten, it's not exactly too late. But it's certainly harder.
Your thoughts?

HIGHLIGHT: For Sunday's paper, I wrote about a $1 million customized training program that North Carolina designed for the benefit of Caterpillar, Inc., the global industrial equipment maker. 

 BODY:
When companies are deciding where to build new facilities or whether to expand in places where they already have factories or offices, states compete to shower them with incentives like tax breaks and help buying land. Increasingly, companies have come to expect that state and local governments will pay for job training, too.
For Sunday's paper, I wrote about a $1 million customized training program that North Carolina designed for the benefit of Caterpillar, Inc., the global industrial equipment maker. The company opened a new plant in Winston-Salem in November, and the state is paying to train nearly 400 workers who will make axles for mining trucks.
North Carolina is also spending about $1.5 million to train workers for a new Honda Aircraft plant in Greensboro. About 163 workers went through training at Guilford Technical Community College in various areas including jet assembly and electrical system installation in the hopes of securing a job. Because Honda delayed the opening of its production lines, some of those workers, like Kent McDaniel, featured in this report from the video journalists at Purple States, decided to seek work elsewhere. Others, like Linda Merritt, stuck it out and are now working at Honda.

HEADLINE: Inside Dirt on the N.F.L. in 2012: Mayans, and Others, Get It Wrong

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: Something for everyone, from Jon Gruden in full snarl to Tom Brady in humble mode. With the obligatory Rex Ryan guarantee. 

 BODY:
From the combine to the draft to the end of the 2012 season, our N.F.L. crystal ball has provided inside information on every transaction, touchdown and scandal.
JAN. 10 Having lost their first choice for general manager when A. J. Smith was retained by the Chargers, the Rams promote an executive of similar temperament: a ferret that has been poked with a stick.
JAN. 10 Jon Gruden flunks head coaching interviews with the Dolphins and the Chargers by snarling at team officials and gnawing on the back of his chair.
JAN. 12 Jon Gruden wins the Rams' head coaching job by snarling at team officials and gnawing on the back of his chair.
JAN. 16 Deliveryman walks into Chargers headquarters, sees Norv Turner in his office, drops his clipboard, rubs his eyes, checks Turner's office again, shrugs and plays it as if nothing unusual happened.
JAN. 18 Jeff Fisher says he spent so much time flying around with team owners in helicopters that he cannot get the theme from "M*A*S*H" out of his head.
JAN. 29 In the third quarter of the Pro Bowl, Eli Manning walks past Philip Rivers on the field. Their eyes meet, and both begin giggling uncontrollably.
FEB. 5 Super Bowl halftime show. Madonna sings "Like a Prayer" while wearing a Tim Tebow jersey, and crows, "I am still controversial!" during the tepid applause. Watching on television, Katy Perry sees herself in the year 2038, feels a cold shiver down her spine and decides to open a used-book store.
FEB. 6 Super Bowl-winning quarterback is accused of being arrogant by a television sports personality who calls his longtime research assistant "the kid with the funny glasses."
FEB. 10 New Colts general manager learns that wearing a bathrobe to a front-office meeting is an Irsay-only privilege.
FEB. 23 At his combine news conference, Rex Ryan guarantees that the Jets are a football team.
FEB. 24 During predraft coverage, Matt Millen acknowledges that he thought Robert Griffin III was the final installment in a vampire trilogy.
MARCH 1 Start of free agency. Santonio Holmes, DeSean Jackson and Steve Johnson schedule simultaneous visits to the Raiders. Carson Palmer has a Terrell Owens/Chad Ochocinco flashback and retreats to his cave in Bhutan.
MARCH 2 Redskins sign Marques Colston, Marshawn Lynch and Cortland Finnegan. "No, I never learn my lesson," says Daniel Snyder, adding that he has no doubt Mike Shanahan can develop the new quarterback Kevin O'Connell.
MARCH 5 With Super Tuesday hours away, political candidates work extra hard to avoid an endorsement from Peyton Hillis.
EARLY MARCH Regional minicombines cause a severe reduction in the number of scouts, coaches and draft reporters scouring the collegiate hinterlands. In a possibly related note, the Gravy Boat Cafe outside Manhattan, Kan., no longer offers free Wi-Fi.
MARCH 21 The 2,128th article about Andrew Luck is written, two for each pass he attempted in college.
APRIL 3 Free agency starts for the Giants.
APRIL 19 Draft babble reaches fever pitch. Your cubicle neighbor, who spends autumn Saturdays watching VH1 music countdowns and thinks Stanford's nickname is the Trees, wants you to know that he does not think Andrew Luck is that good.
APRIL 26 The draft. Colts select Andrew Luck. Peyton Manning spent the previous three months in method acting workshops to perfect a facial expression of dispassionate approval, so he manages to catch his spleen between his teeth just as it leaps from his throat.
APRIL 28 After three days of nonstop draft coverage for Mike Mayock, on the heels of eight weeks of around-the-clock news media appearances, his laryngitis progresses until his voice is nothing but high-pitched, inaudible squeals. Dogs across America begin howling in a doomed effort to draft Alameda Ta'amu and fill that big need at nose tackle.
MAY 2 Pete Carroll introduces himself to the Seahawks rookies.
MAY 3 Pete Carroll tries to bum lunch money from the Seahawks rookies.
EARLY JUNE In an effort to curb statistical inflation, passing yardage is restandardized. Under the new system, Drew Brees hopes to throw for 500,000 lira.
JULY 27 Summer Olympics begin. N.F.L. training camps begin. The N.B.A. enjoys its seven-hour break between seasons.
JULY 29 Second day of Giants training camp. Everyone is injured.
AUG. 1 Rookie initiation in Indianapolis. Andrew Luck is forced to leave a flaming pile of Crosby, Stills and Nash albums on Jim Irsay's doorstep. Peyton Manning is formally reprimanded for putting him up to it.
AUG. 9 You may have a fantasy football addiction. With records being broken at the Olympics and pennant races going on around Major League Baseball, your week is ruined by the news that Jermaine Gresham twisted an ankle in practice.
AUG. 14 Minnesota voters approve a stadium referendum allotting $36,500 for printing and duplication in the next round of stadium referendums.
SEPT. 9 After the publication of a fawning Esquire profile on Aaron Rodgers, a light on his chest starts blinking. He is now overexposed, and if he does not win a Super Bowl by 2013, he will go supernova and start referring to himself in the third person.
SEPT. 13 The Thursday night season opener pits Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos against - it does not really matter.
SEPT. 27 While watching a Cowboys game, 11-year-old Jessica Baggamarbles of Glen Burnie, Md., blurts out, "They are blitzing Anthony Spencer off the edge, and the safeties are in man coverage," making it official: everyone in America has figured out Rob Ryan's defense.
OCT. 7 Tom Brady throws for 350 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 28-17 win. "We have a lot of work to do as a team," he says after the game.
OCT. 14 Tom Brady throws for 400 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 34-3 win. "We are nowhere near where we need to be as a team," he says after the game.
OCT. 21 Tom Brady throws for 500 yards and 7 touchdowns in a 56-0 win that persuades the opponent to cancel the rest of its season. "I am worthless pond scum," he says after the game, flogging himself with a knotted rope.
NOV. 6 Record morning turnout on Election Day is attributed to national interest in the presidential race and utter lack of interest in "Monday Night Football."
NOV. 22 Hours before the Lions' annual Thanksgiving game, Ndamukong Suh diversifies his villainous reputation by heading to Michigan frozen food aisles and licking every third turkey.
DEC. 2 Everyone notices for the first time that the Jaguars have been playing in Louisville all season.
DEC. 21 Counter to the Mayan prophecy, the world does not end, but the Cowboys are eliminated from playoff contention the next day, so it does not do Jason Garrett much good.
DEC. 23 Brian Schottenheimer calls a Jeremy Kerley Wildcat play to get something going on offense. Jets fans cry, "what a horrible, horrible future this is," even though it is really the present.
DEC. 30 Andrew Luck sees his first official action in a meaningless game after the Colts have clinched a playoff bye behind Peyton Manning. Angry season-ticket holders demand their money back.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Optimism

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, the president's weekly address and a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
After Occupy Wall Street protests eclipsed Tea Parties around the nation, a year of fiscal fights that hurt Republicans a little more than their counterparts, and a better jobs report that was released Friday, Democrats are feeling a lot more optimistic about the battle for control of Congress, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.
Dismayed by the prospect of Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential nominee, conservative Christian leaders are intensifying discussions about jointly backing an alternative candidate, Erik Eckholm writes. However, the religious right remains divided over which candidate to collectively support.
In every competitive contest since 1980, the Republican winner of the Iowa caucuses has fallen short in the New Hampshire primary, Jeff Zeleny writes. Mitt Romney is trying to avoid the missteps of leading candidates before him and to overcome the inclination of New Hampshire voters to knock a front-runner down to size.
Although Rick Santorum has tried to portray a peace-making nature this election, former Senate colleagues still remember him for his no-holds-barred political style, Mark Leibovich reports.
Weekly Address:
In this week's address, President Obama shared his goal for the New Year: rebuilding the economy and restoring security to the middle class. "Now, to get there, the most important thing we need to do is get more Americans back to work," he said, mentioning new employment figures showing that 212,000 private-sector jobs were added to the economy in December. "We're heading in the right direction," he said. "And we're not going to let up."
On Wednesday, the White House will host an "Insourcing American Jobs" forum with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America. "Because this is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and all those working to get there," he said, "we can't go back to the days when the financial system was stacking the deck against ordinary Americans." He is hoping that the recent nomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will offer American consumers the consumer safeguards his administration hopes to restore.
Happenings in Washington:
The group Witness Against Torture will mark the 10th anniversary of the first detainees' arrival at the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with 10 days of fasting and other activities.

HEADLINE: For Santorum, Miles to Go Before He Sleeps

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Even with back-to-back weekend debates, Rick Santorum has an almost full day of events. 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Despite the debate Saturday night, Rick Santorum kept up a busy schedule throughout the day. 
Usually, candidates will spend the day of a debate in seclusion with staff members, planning their strategies on how to deal with their rivals and how best to make an impact on viewers.
This is especially true this weekend, when back-to-back debates are set for Saturday night and Sunday morning. They are the first debates since before the Christmas break and the first since the voting began last week at the Iowa caucuses. They will also be the first with six, not seven candidates, since Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota dropped out last week.
All of this means that while the candidates have had plenty of practice at debates over the last several months, the dynamics of the race have changed in many ways.
Until now, Mr. Santorum has been stuck in the wings at the debates because his poor showings in the polls did not warrant him any more prominence.
But since he lost the Iowa caucus to Mitt Romney by a mere eight votes, he is likely to share center stage Saturday night with Mr. Romney. Having started to move up in the polls, he is likely to face unaccustomed attacks from his rivals.
If Mr. Santorum is preparing a new debate strategy to fit his new popularity, he must be fitting it in between his many events. His days are typically full -- on Friday he raced from event to event across southern New Hampshire, making six stops, not including various broadcast interviews -- and he plans an almost as full day on Saturday.
He began at an academic forum at St. Anselm College about the economy and the middle class. He became most impassioned as he took President Obama to task for encouraging everyone to pursue higher education. Mr. Santorum called this hubris and arrogance, saying that if any of his seven children did not want to go to college, he would be happy for them to do something else.
After the forum, he had planned to walk door to door in a neighborhood in Manchester to shake hands and ask residents for their votes. But he never showed up. About 20 protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement were preparing to demonstrate against him. It's not clear whether Mr. Santorum was avoiding the protesters.
But he may see them at his next event, where another protest is planned, at the Homestead Deli in Amherst, southwest of Manchester. He is then to conduct a town-hall-style meeting in Hollis, farther south in the most populous part of the state, followed by a meet-and-greet at a pharmacy, which is scheduled for 3:45.
Only then has he planned some "down time" for debate preparation.
Such an intense schedule reflects the exigencies of the compressed, six-day primary here in New Hampshire, where voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Every minute of exposure helps, especially on a Saturday, which can help a candidate get publicity in the Sunday newspapers.
Moreover, Mr. Santorum plans to dart down to South Carolina, which votes next, on Sunday after that debate. Perhaps the debate and his full schedule Saturday will be enough to feed the media beast until he returns for the final push on the campaign trail on Monday. And surely then, he will have another full day of events.

11:26 P.M. | Keep an Eye on Second Place
If Mr. Romney's Republican rivals failed to do much to slow him down, the impact of Saturday night's debate may really be about second place.
Did Mr. Santorum do enough to emerge as the better alternative to Mr. Romney than Mr. Gingrich or Mr. Paul? 
Did Mr. Perry rehabilitate himself in the eyes of voters who remember his bad debate performances from last year? 
And did Mr. Gingrich arrest the slide in his polling numbers that started when a group allied with Mr. Romney unleashed negative ads against him? 
The answer to those questions may not determine whether any of the three defeats Mr. Romney in New Hampshire's primary.
But it may determine who comes in second. And in a world where most people now expect Mr. Romney to come in first in the state, that could be just as important. 
The candidate who does this - especially if it's a close contest - may emerge as the best positioned to challenge Mr. Romney in South Carolina and beyond.
There's another debate tomorrow morning, and a lot could change. But for now, keep an eye on that second-place slot.
- 
11:19 P.M. | Voters' Voices: Debate Reactions
Kathy Langan, 47, said she was trying to decide between Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Romney but hadn't made up her mind yet. 
The debate, Ms. Langan said, "didn't really change my mind. I thought that the candidates didn't really go at each other. I would have liked to see them mix it up a bit more."
Of Mr. Huntsman's Mandarin flourish, Ms. Langan grimaced. "He does it too much," she said.
Shawn LaFrance, 54, who runs a small nonprofit, said, "I still think Huntsman is the best person. He seemed to be the most solid of the people in the debate. I know Romney's the front-runner, but he didn't really speak to the issues."
Linda Murphy, 53, said she went in undecided and came out undecided.
"I have a lot of research to do," she said as she left. Ms. Murphy, who manages a car dealership in Stratham, N.H., said she wanted to learn more about whether Mr. Romney had created jobs, because she had read that he took companies apart. She was impressed that he had worked with Staples.
Like many Republican voters, Todd Emmons, 58, of Goffstown, N.H., has had a hard time settling on a candidate. He hoped the debate would help him resolve his indecision and possibly tip him over the edge for Mr. Santorum. But he said he didn't see enough from the former senator as he answered questions.
"I was hoping to hear more leadership from Santorum, and I didn't hear it tonight. I think he's still trying to extend his appeal, but I don't think he broke through. Momentum is on his side, but he's running out of time. Based on tonight, I think he still needs more seasoning."
Tammy Simmons, a New Hampshire state representative who attended the debate, pronounced herself unimpressed with all but two of the candidates, Mr. Paul and Mr. Hunstman, and she predicted Mr. Huntsman would drop out after the Tuesday primary. She thought one of his more memorable moments, delivering a line in Chinese, fell flat.
"It was an incredibly dull debate," she said. "Honestly, at one point, I was like, I think I'm going to fall asleep." 
For Margaret Emmons, 58, the debate offered her a new image of Mr. Santorum - as suddenly formidable enough to win the Republican nomination.
"My impression of Rick Santorum changed in that I think he may be somebody who could challenge Mitt Romney," she said, standing outside the debate hall a few minutes after the session.
"I didn't know much about him before," she said of Mr. Santorum. "I hadn't heard him speak."
Ms. Emmons said the most memorable moment of the debate occurred when Huntsman described how he would spend a typical Saturday night - by calling his sons in the military. "I think that was quite poignant," she said. "I think military service is commendable."
Allan Lafleur, a 64-year-old retired school counselor who supports President Obama, thought that Mr. Romney had won the debate, but he was impressed by Mr. Paul's performance. "I think he has passion," Mr. Lafleur said, "whether you agree with him or not, and that's admirable. I didn't see that in any of the other candidates."
Ashley Stebbins, a 20-year-old student at Saint Anselm, is a "pretty conservative person," she said, and Romney supporter. "He's not the most conservative candidate," she said, "but I'll vote for him because he'll be able to get things done." Ms. Stebbins was also impressed by Mr. Huntsman's performance, saying, "I think he has made himself a good candidate for 2016."
Romney has a commanding lead in the polls and the advantage of Massachusetts' proximity to New Hampshire. However, David Cuzzi of Manchester, a Romney supporter, doesn't think he has it locked just yet.
"I wouldn't say anything is inevitable in New Hampshire," he said. "It was definitely good to see that we have a strong field."

11:10 P.M. | Gingrich Fumbles Softball Debate Question 
What should have been a softball final question of the debate tripped up Newt Gingrich. Asked what the candidates would be doing on this Saturday night if they were not debating, Mr. Gingrich said he would be watching the college basketball championship game.
But the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament championship isn't until April. "I mean football game," Mr. Gingrich said, quickly correcting himself.
Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney both said they would be watching football. The college championship, between Louisiana State University and the University of Alabama, is Monday night. But there was a N.F.L. playoff game on during the debate.
Mr. Perry said he would probably be at a shooting range. Maybe in Texas; shooting ranges are open on Saturday nights.
And Ron Paul, who likes to quote Ludwig von Mises, said he'd be home with his family, but "if they all went to bed, I'd probably read an economic textbook."
- 
10:55 P.M. | Cool, Calm Mitt Romney
At one of the earlier debates, Mr. Romney's rivals were able to get under his skin. They rattled him so much that he at one point put his hand on Mr. Perry's shoulder.
Saturday night, he remained mostly cool.
Going in ready to be a pinata, Mr. Romney avoided most of the harshest attacks that his advisers might have expected. 
And as a result, he never appeared flustered. He stood casually, hand in his pocket, while his rivals talked. And he often responded to specific questions with broad commentary about the future of the country.
The calm debate performance may not be the most exciting. But for a candidate already leading by double digits in most New Hampshire polls, perhaps calm is just what he needed.
- 
10:52 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Federal Government Consumption
Mr. Romney stated that government consumes 37 percent of the economy's output, but that should be put in perspective considering that he is running to head the federal government.
The 37 percent figure reflects the combined size of the federal, state and local governments. The Congressional Budget Office has reported that federal government spending alone in 2010 was equivalent to 23.8 percent of the gross domestic product, and it forecast that the percentage would be the same when final figures are in for 2011. Revenues coming into the federal government are much lower compared to the economy - just under 15 percent for 2010, according to CBO, and just over 15 percent in 2011, it forecast. The difference between outlays and revenues is the annual federal deficit.
- 
10:44 P.M. | Santorum Criticizes Romney on Economy
And there it is - Mr. Santorum's full-throated argument against Mr. Romney's bid for the presidency.
The former senator from Pennsylvania accused Mr. Romney's plan as not "particularly bold" and accused the former Massachusetts governor of buying into Democratic rhetoric that divides Americans.
"Middle class? There are no classes in America. We don't put people in classes," Mr. Santorum said, his voice rising. He said Republicans shouldn't "buy into the class warfare argument."
Mr. Santorum listed a litany of things that Mr. Romney had done to call into doubt his conservative credentials, including supporting the bank bailout. 
"We're looking for someone who can win this race," he said, "who can win this race on the economy" and other core issues.
Mr. Romney did not respond directly, saying instead that his economic plan was broader than just a tax plan. He talked about opening up foreign markets and being tough with China.
"I understand how the economy works because I've lived it," he said. "I want to use that expertise to get America working again. This is really a campaign about the direction of this country."
- 
10:34 P.M. | Anti-Catholic and Anti-Christian Sentiments? 
The candidates were quick to agree with Newt Gingrich's assessment that an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian sentiment underlies all the questions about gay marriage, gay adoption and contraception.
Without disputing their concerns on a religious level, politics may also be part of that assessment. It likely finds resonance in both New Hampshire, one of the least religious states in the country, and in South Carolina, one of the most religious.
Gallup says New Hampshire, which votes Tuesday, is among the "least religious" states (the others are also in New England, Vermont and Maine). This is based on polling from last year that says 20 percent of New Hampshire residents attend church weekly, well below the national average of 34 percent.
Still, 32 percent of New Hampshire residents are Roman Catholic, while 38 percent are Protestant. So the concern about an anti-Catholic and anti-Christian message will matter to some degree, despite the state's relative lack of church attendance.
But Mr. Gingrich and the others are probably also thinking a step ahead to South Carolina, which votes Jan. 21. Gallup says it is one of the most religious states in the country, with 43 percent of residents attending church regularly, far above the national average.
Only 10 percent of residents of South Carolina are Roman Catholic. But the state is one of the most Protestant in the country, with 74 percent identifying with a Protestant or non-Catholic Christian faith.
- 
10:30 P.M. | Gingrich Refrains From Attacking Romney
Newt Gingrich was given an easy shot - to explain how his job creation plan would differ from that of Mitt Romney.
But in his answer, he didn't mention Mr. Romney once. Instead, he offered a highly technical answer about investment in infrastructure.
It was Professor Gingrich rather than Candidate Gingrich.
Before the debate, an angry and bitter Mr. Gingrich had promised that he would now focus on contrasting his record with Mr. Romney's. The anger came from the negative ads in Iowa that had slammed Mr. Gingrich's record. They were produced by a so-called super PAC backing Mr. Romney's campaign.
But put Mr. Gingrich on a stage, and he often tends to go back to being explainer in chief (when he's not lecturing the media, which he did again on Saturday night.)
Republican audiences often say they like Mr. Gingrich's debate performances, crediting him with having innovative ideas. But it remains to be seen whether he missed an opportunity to do what he said he would: offer the contrasts.
- 
10:29 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Contraception and Personhood
Mr. Romney provoked the biggest laughs of the night by seeming mystified why Mr. Stephanopoulos kept pressing him to answer whether he thought the Supreme Court should allow states to ban contraception.
Mr. Romney never answered directly. He responded several times that no states were seeking such a thing. "States don't want to ban contraception," he said. "It's working fine. Leave it alone." The audience loved it.
What Mr. Stephanopoulos was trying to get Mr. Romney to respond to was the so-called "personhood" movement that seeks to legally define life as beginning at the moment of conception. It implies that certain common methods of contraception that stop implantation of a fertilized embryo, like birth control pills, would be illegal. 
Voters in Mississippi recently rejected a "personhood" ballot initiative, but abortion opponents led by a Colorado-based group, Personhood USA, seek to get the measure on ballots this year in several other states. The idea, which has split the anti-abortion movement over tactics, is designed to provoke a challenge to Roe v. Wade in the Supreme Court. 
Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Perry and Mr. Santorum have signed a pledge written by Personhood USA to support giving legal rights to embryos, but Mr. Romney has not. 
- 
10:24 P.M. | Fact Check: Perry on Obama's 'Kowtowing' in Iraq 
Mr. Perry objected to President Obama's withdrawal of all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, saying he was simply "kowtowing" to his liberal base. That timeline was first negotiated with the Iraqi government by former President George W. Bush, Mr. Perry's Republican predecessor as governor of Texas. 
Also, polls have shown overwhelming support for Americans' departure from Iraq. A CBS News poll found that 77 percent of Americans - more than three out of four - approve of Mr. Obama's decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq by the end of the year. Two in three said the war was not worth the cost.
- 
10:20 P.M. | Santorum Promoting Own Record Rather Than Attacking Romney
Mr. Santorum has clearly made a choice: promote himself tonight rather than attack Mr. Romney.
Coming into the debate, Mr. Santorum had two things he needed to accomplish. 
He needed to keep the pressure on Mr. Romney, possibly rattling him into making a mistake. Drawing a contrast with him, aggressively, was something he was expected to do.
But Mr. Santorum also needed to make sure people viewed him as a serious alternative, a man who could sit in the White House as president.
This debate is the first opportunity he's had since jumping up in the polls and coming close to winning in Iowa.
So far, he's clearly chosen to do more self-promotion and less criticism of Mr. Romney.
In his performance, he has stressed his own credentials, often with force and energy. But that has come at the expense of attacking Mr. Romney's credentials.
That may be in part due to the questions from the moderators, who have engaged the candidates in some subjects on which most of them agree. And they have spent a lot of time with Mr. Paul.
The question now - and in the debate tomorrow morning - is whether Mr. Santorum will get around to doing on national television what he's been doing on the trail for the last several days: going after Mr. Romney.
- 
10:19 P.M. | Republicans Offer Contrast on Foreign Policy
One of the big differences among the Republican candidates for president has long been foreign policy, and it showed again tonight.
Mr. Huntsman insists on pulling troops out of the wars abroad, while the others say that's a bad idea. In fact, Mr. Perry said he would send troops back into Iraq immediately if he were president.
"We are going to see Iran move back in at literally the speed of light," Mr. Perry said. "They are going to move back in."
The divisions over foreign policy present Republicans with a pretty stark choice.
When Mr. Santorum said that he would leave troops in the wars abroad, Mr. Huntsman challenged him.
"How long do you want to wait?" he asked.
"Until the security of our country is ensured," Mr. Santorum said. "That's what a commander in chief does."
Later, he criticized Mr. Paul for wanting to reduce military spending so much that there wouldn't have been resources to help rescue an Iranian fisherman from pirates this week.
"Ron, if we had your foreign policy, we wouldn't have a fleet there to rescue the fisherman," Mr. Santorum said.
- 
10:07 P.M. | Fact Check: Obama 'Silent' on Iran Demonstrations?
Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum attacked President Obama for being "silent" when 1 million Iranian demonstrators took to the streets in 2009 to protest a flawed election. It is true that some activists called on Mr. Obama to denounce the Iranian authorities more forcefully for using violence against protesters. But Mr. Obama did, in fact, speak out repeatedly in support of Iranian demonstrators. "The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. And despite the government's efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence, we see it, and we condemn it," he said in June 2009. In December, he said, "For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days."
- 
10:04 P.M. | Paul Won't Run as Independent 
Will Ron Paul think about running as an independent if he loses the Republican nomination? 
He won't say "no."
"I have no plans to do it," he said. "I don't intend to do it. I have no intention. But I don't know why a person can't reserve a judgement and see how things turn out."
Mr. Paul expresses indignation at being repeatedly asked the question, and says he has basically answered it.
But that doesn't seem very definitive.
- 
9:59 P.M. | Adelson Gives $5 Million to Pro-Gingrich Super PAC 
Outside of the debate, an update on Winning Our Future, a "super PAC" supporting Newt Gingrich. 
A longtime supporter of Mr. Gingrich has donated $5 million to a super PAC backing his presidential bid, providing a major boost to his ailing campaign in the critical lead-up to Tuesday's presidential primary in New Hampshire.
The donation, reported on Saturday night by The Washington Post, came from Sheldon Adelson, a Las Vegas casino mogul who has long been a generous patron of Mr. Gingrich's political career. The "super PAC," Winning Our Future, was formed last month by Becky Burkett, who served until earlier this year as chief development officer for American Solutions, a political action committee that Mr. Gingrich founded. Rick Tyler, a former spokesman and longtime aide to Mr. Gingrich, is a senior adviser to Winning Our Future.
Ms. Burkett declined to comment on the donation on Saturday.
The cash infusion from Mr. Adelson instantly catapults Winning Our Future into the top ranks of so-called candidate super PACs, groups that can raise unlimited amounts of money from donors and spend it all on advertisements and other expenditures to back a specific candidate, as long as they do not coordinate with the campaign.
Restore Our Future, one such group, backs the former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and is run by his former aides. It spent millions of dollars in Iowa on advertisements attacking Mr. Gingrich, a withering barrage widely credited with torpedoing Mr. Gingrich's standing in the state and opening the door for Mr. Romney to narrowly win last Tuesday's caucus. The group is already running ads in Florida and South Carolina attacking Mr. Gingrich and had spent roughly $3.7 million by the beginning of last week.
Make Us Great Again, a super PAC backing Rick Perry, had spent about $3.4 million by that point.
- 
9:57 P.M. | Fact Check: The Times on Bain
Mr. Gingrich repeatedly referred to an article that he said had appeared in The New York Times "two days ago," about a company bought by Bain Capital, the private equity firm started by Mr. Romney. During the time that Bain owned the company, it laid off hundreds of workers. 
Mr. Gingrich appears to have misspoken. He was referring, it seems, to an article by Reuters, which appeared on Jan. 6.
The Times did run a long piece about layoffs at a different company purchased by Bain Capital, which appeared on Nov. 12.
After Mr. Gingrich referred, incorrectly, to "The Times story," Mr. Romney took a jab at the newspaper, saying he was "not surprised The New York Times is trying to put free enterprise on trial."
- 
9:52 P.M. | No Economy Discussion - Yet
What's missing from the debate with almost an hour gone?
How about talk of the economy?
There was a bit of discussion at the beginning, but since then, there's been much more about gay marriage, leadership, contraception and adoption.
Taxes? Not yet. Debt ceiling. Nada. Budgets? The stock market? Housing? Nope, nope and nope.
There's about an hour left, so it may yet come up. But you have to assume that the White House is pretty happy about the course of the discussion so far.
- 
9:47 P.M. | Fact Check: Santorum on Accusations of Corruption
When Mr. Santorum dismissed Mr. Paul's assertion that he was corrupt by saying Mr. Paul had based the contention on information from a liberal group called CREW, he was referring to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, a good-government group in Washington that criticizes members of both parties for purported and real ethical violations. "If you haven't been sued by CREW, you're not a conservative," Mr. Santorum said.
But on the group's Web site, four of the 14 lawmakers listed as "most corrupt" for 2011 are liberal House Democrats: Representatives Gregory Meeks of New York, Nick Rahall of West Virginia, and Laura Richardson and Maxine Waters of California. Of five lawmakers named for "dishonorable mention" in 2011, three are Democrats: Shelley Berkley of Nevada, Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas.
- 
9:41 P.M. | Paul Criticizes Gingrich on Draft Deferment
Mr. Gingrich expressed resentment at charges from Mr. Paul about having taken a deferment instead of going to war.
Mr. Gingrich noted that he was married with a child at the time, and had a father fighting in Vietnam.
"I personally resent the kinds of comments and aspersions" made without facts, Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Paul responded that "I was married and I had two kids and I went."
Mr. Gingrich responded: "I wasn't eligible to go."
- 
9:38 P.M. | A Raucous Start to the Debate
As expected, the debate is off to a rowdy, raucous start.
But so far, Mr. Romney - who is leading in the polls here - has largely escaped any political damage. 
Much is on the line in just three days, when New Hampshire voters go to the polls. And that appears to have given the candidates a bit of a kick in the pants.
Mr. Santorum has attacked Mr. Romney. Mr. Paul has attacked Mr. Santorum. Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry have said "a pox" on all of them. One person who has not gotten into the attacks is Mr. Gingrich, who might be waiting for the right opportunity.
Mr. Romney also has benefited by Mr. Paul's aggressive attacks on Mr. Santorum, which has taken up precious time and diverted attention from him.
Will it calm down? The ABC moderators seem pretty eager to make sure the engagement continues. And - so far - the candidates seem more than willing to oblige.
Another winner out of all this? Probably President Obama, who has been criticized a bit, but who fades into the background as the Republicans argue among themselves.
- 
9:30 P.M. | Fact Check: Romney's 100,000 Jobs
Mitt Romney said that during his tenure at Bain Capital, a private equity firm, he helped create 100,000 jobs, even when layoffs from downsized firms were factored in.
The Romney campaign bases that figure on the current employment of three major companies that Bain Capital invested in during Mr. Romney's tenure: Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's.
But documenting a "net" gain of 100,000 jobs - with layoffs at other companies included - is extremely difficult. Neither Bain Capital nor Mr. Romney is willing to disclosure the number of layoffs at companies that Bain Capital has invested in.
The New York Times examined Bain Capital's involvement in one such a deal in the 1990s, a medical diagnostics firm called Dade Behring. The company's employment grew overall during the years in which Bain was an investor. But during that period, Dade's United States employment fell by more than 1,700 jobs as Bain Capital oversaw corporate mergers and plant closings.
- 
9:27 P.M. | Santorum in the Cross Hairs 
Rick Santorum - moving up in the polls - found himself in the cross hairs tonight.
Ron Paul called Mr. Santorum "a big-government person" and accused him of becoming a high-paid lobbyist after leaving the Senate.
"He's a big-government person, along with him being associated with the lobbyists," Mr. Paul said, getting very animated. He also repeated a charge from a Washington watchdog group that Mr. Santorum was corrupt.
Mr. Santorum called that charge "ridiculous" and said, "You should know better than to cite George Soros-like organizations."
He also shot back at the big-government charge.
"My record is actually pretty darn good," he said.
- 
9:17 P.M. | Quick Contrast for Romney and Santorum
It took only moments for moderators of the debate to draw Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum into the most direct contrast of the campaign.
Prodded by ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Santorum charged that Mr. Romney was a "manager," when the country needs "a leader."
"The commander in chief of this country isn't being a C.E.O.," Mr. Santorum said. "You've got to lead and inspire. That's what I think the people here in New Hampshire are looking for."
Mr. Romney appeared to be ready for the charge, saying that Mr. Santorum didn't understand that people who run businesses are leaders.
"My experience is in leadership," Mr. Romney shot back. "They are not successful because they are managers. They are successful primarily because they are leaders."
- 
9:14 P.M. | More on 'Romney the Manager'
Earlier today, Rick Santorum took some swipes at Mitt Romney, including the accusation that Mr. Romney was a mere "manager."
- 
9:07 P.M. | No Bachmann on Stage
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. - For the first time since the 2012 presidential field came together, there won't be a woman on the debate stage.
Michele Bachmann dropped out of the race after a disappointing last-place finish in Iowa. That leaves only men to debate.
Will that change the dynamic? Make it more of a slugfest? But Mrs. Bachmann did not exactly shy away from being aggressive when she was in the race, so perhaps it will make little difference.
There was a moment after the Iowa vote when candidates, and their debate advisers, thought there would be only five men on the stage tonight. 
But then Rick Perry, after saying he was suspending his campaign to "assess" the future, decided to jump back in after all.
- 
8:52 P.M. | Gingrich Looking for Debate Surge
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. - For Newt Gingrich, whose now-vanished surge owed all to his strong debate performances, tonight calls for a clutch performance. 
But Saturday afternoon Mr. Gingrich showed little sign of Big Game anxiety. Asked how he would prepare, he said: "Standard preparation. Drink a Diet Coke. Call Maggie and Robert'' - his grandchildren, 10 and 12, respectively - "for their sophisticated coaching advice,'' which always includes smiling and using short sentences. 
But Gingrich aides were nowhere near as casual. The next two weeks are crucial, they understand, to slow Mitt Romney's sense of inevitability. 
"He's got to take him on in the debate," a top Gingrich aide said. "They'll say something like, 'Speaker Gingrich, your polls have plummeted everywhere. They show Gov. Romney has the best chance of beating Barack Obama.' Some form of that question will be asked. It will be an opening."
- 
7:55 P.M. | Live From New Hampshire - It's Saturday Night!
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. - The Republican candidates for president have gathered at St. Anselm's College for the first of two back-to-back debates that could serve as a televised confrontation of Mitt Romney, who has a large lead in the polls here.
What will happen tonight? 
Aides to Mr. Romney were bracing for the possibility of an all-out assault on his record from the other candidates in the race as they seek to slow the former Massachusetts governor's march toward the party's nomination.
Rick Santorum, who has seen some movement in his poll numbers here since his near win in Iowa, spent Saturday telegraphing his message for the night: Mr. Romney is not a conservative. Expect him to hit that theme hard tonight.
Mr. Romney's other rivals won't be far behind.
Newt Gingrich is still seething over ads in Iowa by a "super PAC" backing Mr. Romney's campaign. Ron Paul is looking for new momentum after falling to third in Iowa. Jon Huntsman and Rick Perry are desperate to get noticed to save their campaigns.
But there's always the possibility that the debate won't live up to its rock-'em, sock-'em billing. With only three days before New Hampshirites go to the polls, the candidates may be wary of being too aggressive, for fear of making a mistake that they don't have time to repair.
The debate starts at 9 p.m. Eastern time on ABC, which is co-sponsoring it with Yahoo! and WMUR-TV, the ABC affiliate in Manchester.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths MONSERRATE, CAREY

 BODY:
MONSERRATE--Carey. The friends and family of Carey Monserrate are grieving for him, with love and sorrow. Carey was born in New York City on October 28, 1970, and died there on December 28, 2011. He grew up largely in Providence, Rhode Island, graduating from the Wheeler School in 1988, and then cum laude from Harvard, where he studied English and American Literature as a member of the class of 1992. He formed many close friendships in his school years-and everywhere he went-which endured throughout his life. 
Carey was a writer, editor, poet, and musician. He lived with an openness to the world and to the experiences of others: born Catholic, he considered himself culturally Jewish and spiritually Zen Buddhist. In Red Hook, Brooklyn, he was well known as a community activist, engaged with his neighbors on issues ranging from helicopter-noise pollution to economic justice; he was also the founding manager of the Red Hook Wobblies softball team. He would cook for friends and loved ones or gather them for expeditions to Chinatown restaurants, and talk with them for hours around the table. His conversation, like his correspondence and his kindness, could lighten their darkest moments. Carey took his own life. His mother, Rose Monserrate, mourns the loss of her beloved son. Carey is also survived by his paternal grandmother and a loving circle of uncles, aunts, cousins, and step- and half-siblings. A memorial in New York is being planned. In Carey's memory, donations may be made to Added Value, www.added-value.org, or to the Buddhist Peace Fellowship: www.bpf.org.

HEADLINE: Continuing Assault on Unions

 BODY:
Along with their shameful campaign to curb the collective bargaining rights of public sector workers in Wisconsin and Ohio last year, Republicans in statehouses around the country are taking aim at private sector unions. 
Twenty-two states, mainly in the South and the West, have long had ''right to work'' laws forbidding contracts that require workers to pay union dues. After a decade in which business has ignored the issue, Republicans in more than 10 states over the last year have begun pushing similar laws. Indiana's Legislature is expected to approve the antiunion legislation as early as next month.
Many Republican leaders are adopting model legislation proposed by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national corporate-financed conservative organization that is also assisting the Republican push to require voter identification cards to suppress the vote of minorities, young people and other constituencies that tend to favor the Democratic Party.
There is little doubt that politics is also behind the Republicans' push for right-to-work laws: they see an opportunity to further weaken unions, which are far more likely to support Democrats -- as well as health care reform and a higher minimum wage -- by slashing their funding and their donating power.
The G.O.P. and its allies, like the Chamber of Commerce and brethren organizations, are trotting out the charge that unions reduce economic growth and jobs.
It stands to reason that a union will reduce a company's profits somewhat, by obtaining a higher share for workers. But over the last three decades, economists have found that unionization has a minimal impact on growth and employment in an entire state or country. In fact, six of the 10 states with the highest unemployment have right-to-work laws. North Carolina, a right-to-work state, has a private sector unionization rate of 1.8 percent, the lowest in the nation. It also has the sixth highest unemployment rate: 10 percent.
Unionized workers earn more and get more generous benefits. In 2010, wages of workers in unionized manufacturing companies in Indiana were 16 percent higher than in nonunion plants. One study concluded that the decline in unionization since the 1970s is responsible for one-fifth to one-third of the growth in inequality in this country. Voters, unionized or not, should recognize the new ''right to work'' push for what it is: bad economics and cynical politics.

HEADLINE: Reusable Goes Residential

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
FOR Sara Schmidt, an actress, moving to a new apartment used to involve a tiresome quest for cardboard boxes. She picked up castoffs from the street and canvassed her local liquor stores for others -- and even then, she still found herself buying expensive new boxes and supplies like packing tape.
But this fall, when she moved to Hoboken from Midtown West, Ms. Schmidt, who is in the cast of ''Jersey Boys'' on Broadway, took a far less labor-intensive approach: she rented stackable plastic moving boxes from a new service called Bin-It. 
Bin-It and a similar service, Jugglebox Moving, have recently entered the New York moving market. Both deliver stacks of sturdy boxes and pick them up after the move is complete.
The boxes can be ordered online or by phone. Bin-It's price for a one-bedroom move, with 25 boxes, is $109 plus a $30 service fee. At Jugglebox, a one-bedroom move with 35 boxes is $129. Other necessities, including wardrobe boxes, packing paper, labels and dollies, are available from each service.
Ms. Schmidt was happy with the service, especially because she didn't have to lug used boxes down to the garbage. ''I will never do cardboard boxes again,'' she said.
Both services recommend that people hire movers to transport the boxes and larger items like furniture. Robert Theryoung, one of Bin-It's founders, said using the service could save money with movers who charge by the hour, because his company's rigid cartons can be stacked four to five feet high, reducing the number of trips.
Mr. Theryoung started Bin-It with a high-school friend, Chris Walsh, and Jef Walker. The idea stemmed from Mr. Walsh's small company making T-shirts for musicians and artists, which relied on plastic containers to transport gear. The concept seemed easily transferrable to residential moves.
Surinder Singh founded Jugglebox after helping a friend who had just moved within Brooklyn. ''There were a ton of cardboard boxes all over her apartment,'' Mr. Singh said. She complained about the effort involved in assembling, disassembling and disposing of them. The move was just a few blocks away, which ''amplified the waste,'' Mr. Singh said. Reusable boxes struck him as so much more convenient, economical and environmentally friendly.
Both services started last year, serving New York City and northern New Jersey. Both plan to expand geographically.
And both are working out some kinks. Bin-It is about to charge that $30 service fee upon reservation, instead of requiring payment in full upfront. That is because people are often afraid to commit because of uncertain moving dates, Mr. Walsh said.
Shortly after Jugglebox opened for business, so many orders poured in that ''we could barely handle the demand,'' Mr. Singh said. Because boxes filled with books or china are heavy, Jugglebox plans to add boxes in a smaller size.
Another Bin-It client, Maria Elena Romagnolo de Laurentiis, a designer from Italy, moved last fall with her family of four, plus their ''tremendous amount of stuff,'' to Westchester County from the Upper East Side. She bought Bin-It's four-bedroom package, along with five wardrobe bins, for nearly $400.
''I had an argument with my husband,'' she said, ''because at the end, when you see the bill, it looks maybe high as a number.'' But considering ''how much trouble you will have to get the cardboard, buy the tape and cut the tape every time you close and seal the box,'' she said, she felt it was a bargain.

HEADLINE: The Myth of Japan's Failure

BYLINE: By EAMONN FINGLETON. 
An author who predicted the Japanese financial crash of the 1990s; he is working on a book about the end of the American dream.

 BODY:
Tokyo
DESPITE some small signs of optimism about the United States economy, unemployment is still high, and the country seems stalled.
Time and again, Americans are told to look to Japan as a warning of what the country might become if the right path is not followed, although there is intense disagreement about what that path might be. Here, for instance, is how the CNN analyst David Gergen has described Japan: ''It's now a very demoralized country and it has really been set back.''
But that presentation of Japan is a myth. By many measures, the Japanese economy has done very well during the so-called lost decades, which started with a stock market crash in January 1990. By some of the most important measures, it has done a lot better than the United States.
Japan has succeeded in delivering an increasingly affluent lifestyle to its people despite the financial crash. In the fullness of time, it is likely that this era will be viewed as an outstanding success story. 
How can the reality and the image be so different? And can the United States learn from Japan's experience?
It is true that Japanese housing prices have never returned to the ludicrous highs they briefly touched in the wild final stage of the boom. Neither has the Tokyo stock market.
But the strength of Japan's economy and its people is evident in many ways. There are a number of facts and figures that don't quite square with Japan's image as the laughingstock of the business pages:
Japan's average life expectancy at birth grew by 4.2 years -- to 83 years from 78.8 years -- between 1989 and 2009. This means the Japanese now typically live 4.8 years longer than Americans. The progress, moreover, was achieved in spite of, rather than because of, diet. The Japanese people are eating more Western food than ever. The key driver has been better health care.
Japan has made remarkable strides in Internet infrastructure. Although as late as the mid-1990s it was ridiculed as lagging, it has now turned the tables. In a recent survey by Akamai Technologies, of the 50 cities in the world with the fastest Internet service, 38 were in Japan, compared to only 3 in the United States.
Measured from the end of 1989, the yen has risen 87 percent against the U.S. dollar and 94 percent against the British pound. It has even risen against that traditional icon of monetary rectitude, the Swiss franc.
The unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, about half of that in the United States.
According to skyscraperpage.com, a Web site that tracks major buildings around the world, 81 high-rise buildings taller than 500 feet have been constructed in Tokyo since the ''lost decades'' began. That compares with 64 in New York, 48 in Chicago, and 7 in Los Angeles.
Japan's current account surplus -- the widest measure of its trade -- totaled $196 billion in 2010, up more than threefold since 1989. By comparison, America's current account deficit ballooned to $471 billion from $99 billion in that time. Although in the 1990s the conventional wisdom was that as a result of China's rise Japan would be a major loser and the United States a major winner, it has not turned out that way. Japan has increased its exports to China more than 14-fold since 1989 and Chinese-Japanese bilateral trade remains in broad balance.
As longtime Japan watchers like Ivan P. Hall and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr. point out, the fallacy of the ''lost decades'' story is apparent to American visitors the moment they set foot in the country. Typically starting their journeys at such potent symbols of American infrastructural decay as Kennedy or Dulles airports, they land at Japanese airports that have been extensively expanded and modernized in recent years.
William J. Holstein, a prominent Japan watcher since the early 1980s, recently visited the country for the first time in some years. ''There's a dramatic gap between what one reads in the United States and what one sees on the ground in Japan,'' he said. ''The Japanese are dressed better than Americans. They have the latest cars, including Porsches, Audis, Mercedes-Benzes and all the finest models. I have never seen so many spoiled pets. And the physical infrastructure of the country keeps improving and evolving.''
Why, then, is Japan seen as a loser? On the official gross domestic product numbers, the United States has ostensibly outperformed Japan for many years. But even taking America's official numbers at face value, the difference has been far narrower than people realize. Adjusted to a per-capita basis (which is the proper way to do this) and measured since 1989, America's G.D.P. grew by an average of just 1.4 percent a year. Japan's figure meanwhile was even more anemic -- just 1 percent -- implying that it underperformed the United States by 0.4 percent a year.
A look at the underlying accounting, however, suggests that, far from underperforming, Japan may have outperformed. For a start, in a little noticed change, United States statisticians in the 1980s embarked on an increasingly aggressive use of the so-called hedonic method of adjusting for inflation, an approach that in the view of many experts artificially boosts a nation's apparent growth rate.
On the calculations of John Williams of Shadowstats.com, a Web site that tracks flaws in United States economic data, America's growth in recent decades has been overstated by as much as 2 percentage points a year. If he is even close to the truth, this factor alone may put the United States behind Japan in per-capita performance.
If the Japanese have really been hurting, the most obvious place this would show would be in slow adoption of expensive new high-tech items. Yet the Japanese are consistently among the world's earliest adopters. If anything, it is Americans who have been lagging. In cellphones, for instance, Japan leapfrogged the United States in the space of a few years in the late 1990s and it has stayed ahead ever since, with consumers moving exceptionally rapidly to ever more advanced devices.
Much of the story is qualitative rather than quantitative. An example is Japan's eating-out culture. Tokyo, according to the Michelin Guide, boasts 16 of the world's top-ranked restaurants, versus a mere 10 for the runner-up, Paris. Similarly Japan as a whole beats France in the Michelin ratings. But how do you express this in G.D.P. terms?
Similar problems arise in measuring improvements in the Japanese health care system. And how does one accurately convey the vast improvement in the general environment in Japan in the last two decades?
Luckily there is a yardstick that finesses many of these problems: electricity output, which is mainly a measure of consumer affluence and industrial activity. In the 1990s, while Japan was being widely portrayed as an outright ''basket case,'' its rate of increase in per-capita electricity output was twice that of America, and it continued to outperform into the new century.
Part of what is going on here is Western psychology. Anyone who has followed the story long-term cannot help but notice that many Westerners actively seek to belittle Japan. Thus every policy success is automatically discounted. It is a mind-set that is much in evidence even among Tokyo-based Western diplomats and scholars.
Take, for instance, how Western observers have viewed Japan's demographics. The population is getting older because of a low birthrate, a characteristic Japan shares with many of the world's richest nations. Yet this is presented not only as a critical problem but as a policy failure. It never seems to occur to Western commentators that the Japanese both individually and collectively have chosen their demographic fate -- and have good reasons for doing so.
The story begins in the terrible winter of 1945-6, when, newly bereft of their empire, the Japanese nearly starved to death. With overseas expansion no longer an option, Japanese leaders determined as a top priority to cut the birthrate. Thereafter a culture of small families set in that has continued to the present day.
Japan's motivation is clear: food security. With only about one-third as much arable land per capita as China, Japan has long been the world's largest net food importer. While the birth control policy is the primary cause of Japan's aging demographics, the phenomenon also reflects improved health care and an increase of more than 20 years in life expectancy since 1950.
Psychology aside, a major factor in the West's comprehension problem is that virtually everyone in Tokyo benefits from the doom and gloom story. For foreign sales representatives, for instance, it has been the perfect get-out-of-jail card when they don't reach their quotas. For Japanese foundations it is the perfect excuse in politely waving away solicitations from American universities and other needy nonprofits. Ditto for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in tempering expectations of foreign aid recipients. Even American investment bankers have reasons to emphasize bad news. Most notably they profit from the so-called yen-carry trade, an arcane but powerful investment strategy in which the well informed benefit from periodic bouts of weakness in the Japanese yen.
Economic ideology has also played an unfortunate role. Many economists, particularly right-wing think-tank types, are such staunch advocates of laissez-faire that they reflexively scorn Japan's very different economic system, with its socialist medicine and ubiquitous government regulation. During the stock market bubble of the late 1980s, this mind-set abated but it came back after the crash.
Japanese trade negotiators noticed an almost magical sweetening in the mood in foreign capitals after the stock market crashed in 1990. Although previously there had been much envy of Japan abroad (and serious talk of protectionist measures), in the new circumstances American and European trade negotiators switched to feeling sorry for the ''fallen giant.'' Nothing if not fast learners, Japanese trade negotiators have been appealing for sympathy ever since.
The strategy seems to have been particularly effective in Washington. Believing that you shouldn't kick a man when he is down, chivalrous American officials have largely given up pressing for the opening of Japan's markets. Yet the great United States trade complaints of the late 1980s -- concerning rice, financial services, cars and car components -- were never remedied.
The ''fallen giant'' story has also even been useful to other East Asian nations, particularly in their trade diplomacy with the United States.
A striking instance of how the story has influenced American perceptions appears in ''The Next 100 Years,'' by the consultant George Friedman. In a chapter headed ''China 2020: Paper Tiger,'' Mr. Friedman argues that, just as Japan ''failed'' in the 1990s, China will soon have its comeuppance. Talk of this sort powerfully fosters complacency and confusion in Washington in the face of a United States-China trade relationship that is already arguably the most destructive in world history and certainly the most unbalanced.
Clearly the question of what has really happened to Japan is of first-order geopolitical importance. In a stunning refutation of American conventional wisdom, Japan has not missed a beat in building an ever more sophisticated industrial base. That this is not more obvious is a tribute in part to the fact that Japanese manufacturers have graduated to making so-called producers' goods. These typically consist of advanced components or materials, or precision production equipment. They may be invisible to the consumer, yet without them the modern world literally would not exist. This sort of manufacturing, which is both highly capital-intensive and highly know-how-intensive, was virtually monopolized by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s and constituted the essence of American economic leadership.
Japan's achievement is all the more impressive for the fact that its major competitors -- Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and, of course, China -- have hardly been standing still. The world has gone through a rapid industrial revolution in the last two decades thanks to the ''targeting'' of manufacturing by many East Asian nations. Yet Japan's trade surpluses have risen.
Japan should be held up as a model, not an admonition. If a nation can summon the will to pull together, it can turn even the most unpromising circumstances to advantage. Here Japan's constant upgrading of its infrastructure is surely an inspiration. It is a strategy that often requires cooperation across a wide political front, but such cooperation has not been beyond the American political system in the past. The Hoover Dam, that iconic project of the Depression, required negotiations among seven states but somehow it was built -- and it provided jobs for 16,000 people in the process. Nothing is stopping similar progress now -- nothing, except political bickering.

HEADLINE: The Fall Of Ireland's Mighty Quinn

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
DUBLIN
IN the green borderlands of County Fermanagh, there was nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
That is what they called Sean Quinn -- canny conglomerateur to his friends, wily rogue to his enemies and, until recently, the richest man in Ireland.
Even now, with times so hard in this country, his up-by-the-bootstraps story is the stuff of legend, a Celtic fairy tale for strivers and climbers. This, after all, is the farmer's son who became a quarry man and then, with gravel and grit and yes, a bit of old-fashioned greed, became a billionaire.
Until, that is, it all came crashing down.
Mr. Quinn, 65, contends he lost nearly everything when the bottom fell out of the Irish economy. His business empire, his concrete factories, his wind farms and hotels, the helicopter and the Falcon jet -- all gone. Last November, after apparently gambling away his fortune on disastrous investments, he was declared bankrupt by a court in Belfast. During the proceedings, he said he was down to his last 11,000 euros, and an aging Mercedes and 166 acres of land. 
That, anyway, is what Mr. Quinn says. Here in Dublin, at the financial institution formerly known as the Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Quinn's skeptical bankers say his assertions are, well, blarney. They suspect that he and his family still secretly control valuable assets as varied as a shopping tower in Ukraine and real estate in Hyderabad, India's Silicon Valley.
And so the bankers have begun a global treasure hunt. Anglo Irish, which got into so much trouble that it had to be nationalized, says that the Quinns owe it more than 2.8 billion euros, and that it will fight to recover that money for Irish taxpayers.
It is yet another remarkable turn of events in the long, painful saga of the Irish economic collapse. In many ways, Mr. Quinn personified Ireland's boom. Now, he has come to personify its bust. Banks like Anglo Irish lent lavishly to builders and investors like Mr. Quinn. But when the real estate market finally came unglued, the banks were left with more than 70 billion euros in loans that could not, or would not, be repaid.
The Irish government was forced to rescue the financial industry, and the whole debacle eventually led to a bailout by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Today, Ireland's economy is still struggling. Unemployment is over 14 percent, and home prices are down 60 percent from their peak. Resentment lingers toward reckless lenders and borrowers.
One thing is sure: the Quinn story is full of surprises. Every effort to claim and manage the assets that he used as collateral for his loans from Anglo Irish has run into mysterious -- and sometimes violent -- difficulties. Last April, shortly after the bank tried to seize the Quinn Group, his holding company, an earthmover smashed through posts outside the company's headquarters in Derrylin, Northern Ireland, where the Quinn family has kept a farm for five generations. A few months later, a firebomb destroyed a BMW that belonged to the new chief executive of the Quinn Group appointed by the bank. In December, a truck rammed through the company's canteen.
No one knows who was behind most of the vandalism, and Mr. Quinn and his family have condemned the violence. In court filings, he said he passed his former headquarters nearly every day and still feels pangs of loss. ''I no longer own or control the businesses which I have spent my life building up,'' he said.
Such assurances aside, his former bankers suspect that Mr. Quinn has masterminded various maneuvers to hang on to at least part of his fortune. They say he has used offshore companies to thwart their efforts to gain control of his empire's foreign holdings -- a contention that the Quinns have denied.
''It is very much a three-dimensional chess game,'' said Richard Woodhouse, a British accountant who is leading the quest by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish, to find and seize the Quinn Group's international properties.
While Mr. Quinn is pleading poverty, his wife, Patricia, and his five adult children are battling the bank in court. They say they don't owe the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation anything, since they didn't know what they were doing when they signed the paperwork for Mr. Quinn's loans.
Neither side agrees on much -- not even who said what to whom. When his bankers told Mr. Quinn last April that they were seizing control of his conglomerate, Mr. Quinn said he would fight like a cornered rat, according to the bankers.
One of Mr. Quinn's daughters, Aoife Quinn, remembers a more poetic declaration: ''Put a dog into a corner, and it will come out barking.''
Mr. Quinn, who rarely grants interviews, declined to comment.
HOW Sean Quinn fell so hard, so fast is a story for Ireland's anguished economic times. Born John Ignatius Quinn, he got his start in business in 1975, when he borrowed 100 Irish pounds to dig a gravel quarry on his family's farm.
But by 2007, having built a globe-spanning empire, he was borrowing billions to gamble on the shares of Anglo Irish. As the bank teetered, it lent huge sums of money to Mr. Quinn.
Hoping to turn a quick profit, he gambled on derivatives, financial instruments that, on the western side of the Atlantic, proved disastrous for the likes of the American International Group. Specifically, he wagered on what are known as contacts for difference, which are used to speculate on the price of a particular asset -- in this case, the shares of Anglo Irish itself.
During the boom, these contracts were wildly popular in Ireland, in part because they enable investors to put down as little as 10 percent of the value of the underlying investment. They can be enormously profitable if the price of the underlying shares move in the investor's favor -- and disastrous if prices go the other way.
For Mr. Quinn, the contracts turned out to be cataclysmic. He lost so big that, combined with Ireland's deep recession and other missteps, his empire was brought to its knees.
Only now the Quinns argue that the loans from Anglo Irish are invalid. They say that the bank doled out money recklessly and that it was hoping that Mr. Quinn's maneuvers in the financial markets would help prop up its share price. In their view, Anglo Irish, not Sean Quinn, is the villain.
''They would blame my father for the fall of Europe if they could,'' said Aoife Quinn, 30, the fourth of Mr. Quinn's five children. All five have been ousted as shareholders and from their jobs at various Quinn companies. ''I know he is no angel and not without blame, but they seem intent to drag him down.''
The two sides sparred last month in bankruptcy court in Northern Ireland and are now waiting to go to court again early this year in Ireland. The bankers challenged Mr. Quinn's bankruptcy declaration, which could allow him to emerge in a year to resume his business, as he has vowed to do.
The two sides seem to be playing a game of cat and mouse. But just who is the cat, and who is the mouse? Even though he has been declared bankrupt, Mr. Quinn still lives in a sumptuous mansion in Ballyconnell, Ireland. His five children are listed as the owners.
For the bankers, one challenge is the sheer size and reach of the Quinn Group. Its international property portfolio stretches over 70 companies in 14 countries. Each week, bankers get thick reports chronicling legal skirmishes in various jurisdictions.
The paperwork provides a glimpse into a byzantine organization. In some cases, foreign third parties have claimed enormous debts that, remarkably, equal the exact share value of landmark buildings. In other cases, stock and vital voting rights have been transferred in return for little more than a 380-euro Sony laptop.
''I feel sometimes that I am researching a cold-war novel, rather than urban development and finance,'' said Brendan Williams, an economist at University College Dublin who has been tracking the fallout from Ireland's property bust. ''Leaves 'Tinker Tailor' in the shade.''
In India, for example, representatives for the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation are struggling to gain control of a $5 million site for a hotel in Hyderabad. A local injunction blocked them, but they have no idea who is behind it. The company disputing their takeover, Mecon Manufacturing and Contracting FZE, is based in the United Arab Emirates, where registration of corporate directors is secret.
''Slowly but surely it got more and more difficult,'' said Robert Dix, who was named by the bank to direct Quinn Holdings Sweden AB, a company Mr. Quinn established in Sweden in order to minimize taxes and enable his children to control his global portfolio.
''We have no idea who the brain is,'' Mr. Dix said, ''but it has to be somebody very clever because it's very consistent.''
THE Mighty Quinn was still flying high when the crash came in 2008. That year, Forbes magazine estimated his personal wealth at $6 billion, and his companies employed almost 6,000 people. Among them were his five children, who began working for their father as teenagers, picking up stones on a family-run golf course.
Mr. Quinn rarely speaks publicly. But in 2005, he delivered a prophetic speech about his hard-charging business style. ''I suppose I was always very greedy,'' he said. ''I was never happy with what we had, and I was always looking for new opportunities.''
Last autumn, a very different Sean Quinn stood outside a bankruptcy court in Belfast. He said he was an unwitting victim of the global financial panic that had led to Ireland's economic collapse.
''People like me were foolish enough to get stuck in the height of it, and borrowed too much money, believed in banks,'' he said.
For all his problems, Mr. Quinn remains a nearly legendary figure in the rural, predominantly Catholic borderlands that straddle Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He brought jobs to a poor region once shaken by Irish Republican Army shootings and bombings.
Mr. Quinn has shaped a public narrative of himself as a billionaire with a common touch -- a regular bloke who plays weekly penny-ante card games, shuns celebrity-studded affairs and plans to be buried at his home Catholic parish, St. Mary's Church, in Teemore, Northern Ireland, where he is a lifelong member of the Shamrocks Gaelic Football Club.
His daughter Aoife and her sister, Ciara Quinn, 35, say their father instilled in his family his relentless work ethic. During a two-hour interview in the Dublin office of their public relations representative, the sisters vigorously defended their father and said their family had unwittingly become enmeshed in his nightmare.
''My father tirelessly worked seven days a week and he built something real and lasting for a community on its knees,'' said Ciara Quinn, a trained nurse who worked in Mr. Quinn's insurance business until she was laid off in a systematic process that the children have labeled as ''de-Quinning.''
''My father has never taken a two-week holiday,'' she said. ''Never.''
Their mother, Patricia Quinn, unsuccessfully argued in court in December that she was not personally responsible for an unpaid 3 million euro loan. She said she had signed the loan documents without reading them and was influenced by her husband.
That prompted the judge, Peter Kelly, to quote Mr. Bumble, from ''Oliver Twist,'' on the legal validity of alleged spousal ignorance: ''If the law supposes that, then the law is an ass.''
THE Quinns paint a picture of a trusting family that didn't know what it was getting into. But that's not quite the way executives see it at the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.
''The Quinn family says the loans were illegal so therefore they shouldn't have to pay them back,'' said Mike Aynsley, the chief executive. ''On the other hand, the bank is involved in a series of litigations that we are defending in multiple jurisdictions that are designed to take control of the assets away from the bank -- and therefore from the taxpayers.''
According to court documents and interviews, after the bank took control of the Quinn Group, clues emerged that Mr. Quinn and several of his trusted executives were preparing for the worst. The bankers already knew that Mr. Quinn often created layers of companies for tax advantages, conducting his purchases of Anglo Irish shares, for example, through a company registered in Madeira. The bankers searched for clues in unlikely places -- including Gaelic football blogs because of Mr. Quinn's ties to the Shamrocks.
Mr. Dix, the new overseer at Quinn Holdings, said that at one point he was handed a document that had been created a few weeks before the bank stepped in. It was marked ''strictly confidential,'' and had been created on a computer that was accessible to only five Quinn executives. Charting a new corporate structure called the Cranaghan Foundation, it appeared to set out a plan to put the company's international properties ultimately in the names of Mr. Quinn's young grandchildren. Then a Swedish law firm mistakenly sent a bill to Quinn Holdings' new leadership, revealing more about the plan, Mr. Woodhouse said.
''Our concern was this was a new structure put in place to hollow out companies that owned valuable assets and put them beyond the reach of the bank,'' Mr. Woodhouse said.
The name Cranaghan emerged in some of the litigation involving the Kutuzoff Tower in Moscow, whose ownership passed through a chain of four companies in Sweden, Cyprus and Russia. In Ukraine, the bank has encountered stiff resistance to taking over Ukraina, a Soviet-era shopping mall in Kiev. Ukraina's new chief executive has been barred from the administrative offices and there are two sets of security hired by the two different managements.
In the last few days, a judge in Kiev granted a $45.2 million claim against that property by a mysterious company named Lyndhurst Development Trading, which is based in the British Virgin Islands. The Irish bank called the judgment ''a tool of legalized robbery by foreign investors.'' A court in Northern Ireland subsequently barred the claim, and a lawyer representing the bank promised to disclose evidence of fraud. Mr. Dix went as far as to appeal to Ukraine's prime minister. In November, Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, brought up the issue with Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych.
The Quinns say they aren't involved in this battle -- and that all the finger-pointing is part of a plot against the family by the bankers. They call the latest allegations in Northern Ireland ''groundless.''
''I know they have it out for my father, but they seem determined to bring all of my family down,'' Aoife Quinn said. ''This is no longer about pursuing debts, but some vendetta.''
The bankers say it's nothing personal. In more than 30 years in accounting and in business, Mr. Woodhouse said, he has never seen such a complicated clash over ''obscene'' debts.
Whatever the outcome, for many Irish -- who ultimately are paying the bills -- the old lyrics by Bob Dylan might sum it up best: ''Come all without, come all within. You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2012

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about Sean Quinn, the Irish businessman, misidentified the sport with which he is affiliated. It is Gaelic football, not soccer. The article also misspelled the name of one of three countries that were home to companies that at various times owned the Kutuzoff Tower in Moscow. It is Cyprus, not Cypress.

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
9 P.M. (13, 49) DOWNTON ABBEY ''Masterpiece Classic'' inaugurates a new chapter in this soap opera, created by Julian Fellowes, about masters and servants at the twilight of the British Empire. Hugh Bonneville returns as Lord Grantham, who, with three daughters and no direct male heir, is being forced to hand down his beloved ancestral home to a middle-class third cousin, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens), along with the fortune of his American-born heiress wife (Elizabeth McGovern, above). Maggie Smith is his imperious mother, and Siobhan Finneran is Miss O'Brien, Lady Grantham's Machiavellian maid. The story reopens in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme, where Matthew -- his romance with Lord Grantham's eldest daughter, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), derailed -- is now an officer trying to keep his troops alive. ''As the dowager countess, Ms. Smith has many of the best lines and usually the last word,'' Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times. 
''When her middle granddaughter, Lady Edith, frets that she will end up a spinster, Lady Violet says briskly, 'Don't be defeatist, Dear, it's very middle class.' There is nothing middle class about 'Downton Abbey.' Even a world war can't sever the bond between aristocrats and the servants who love them.''
9 A.M. (CNN) STATE OF THE UNION WITH CANDY CROWLEY In a broadcast from New Hampshire, Ms. Crowley interviews the Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, as well as Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.
10 A.M. (Fox) FOX NEWS SUNDAY Chris Wallace interviews Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, and Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, on the presidential race. Mr. Wallace also discusses the coming New Hampshire primary with the Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul.
10 A.M. (ABC) THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The guests include David Axelrod, a campaign adviser to President Obama, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas.
10:30 A.M. (ABC) MEET THE PRESS David Gregory moderates a debate among the Republican presidential candidates in Concord, N.H.
8 P.M. (CBS) 60 MINUTES Lara Logan travels to Afghanistan to report on five sets of brothers serving in the Marine Reserves. Scott Pelley investigates stem cell fraud. And Lesley Stahl looks at the world's most expensive food: European white truffles, which can sell for as much as $9,500 a pound.
9 P.M. (NBC) THE FIRM Josh Lucas, below, steps in for Tom Cruise as Mitch McDeere, a lawyer embroiled in corporate conspiracy, in this new series spun off from the 1993 movie based on the novel by John Grisham. This time Mitch's storefront idealism is tested by an offer of a partnership from a law firm whose parallels to the original film's mob-connected Bendini, Lambert & Locke are obvious. And someone still wants Mitch dead. ''Having performed such leaps of logic, the writers apparently didn't have much strength left for the weekly plot, which is notably slight and unbelievable, even for a TV legal drama,'' Mike Hale wrote in The Times. ''Mitch is forced by a do-gooder judge to defend a teenager in a schoolyard killing. Hearing that the dead student's father wants to put out a hit on his young client, Mitch does what any good lawyer would do. No, not call the police. He has his brother pretend to be a hit man and solicit the job. The folks over at 'The Good Wife' will be wondering why they didn't think of that one.'' ''The Good Wife'' plays opposite at 9 on CBS.
10 P.M. (Showtime) HOUSE OF LIES Don Cheadle, below, plays Marty Kaan, a professional manipulator popularly known as a management consultant, who with his damage-control squad (Kristen Bell, Ben Schwartz and Josh Lawson) promises to save corporations in exchange for fat fees in this new series. ''Especially these days, with big bonuses once again being pulled down by corporate barons while high unemployment continues to bedevil the land, 'House of Lies' could easily begin to feel lazy, a weekly blasting of easy targets,'' Neil Genzlinger wrote in The Times. ''The show's creators seem to know this, and as the series rolls along, they try to build up a personal life for Marty that takes advantage of Mr. Cheadle's acting skills.'' A new season of ''Californication'' follows at 10:30. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

PITY THE BILLIONAIRE
The Hard-Times Swindle and the Unlikely Comeback of the Right
By Thomas Frank
225 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $25
Thomas Frank is the thinking person's Michael Moore. If Moore, the left-wing filmmaker, had Frank's Ph.D. (in history from the University of Chicago), he might produce books like this one and Frank's previous best seller, ''What's the Matter With Kansas?''
As you can tell from its ham-fisted title, ''Pity the Billionaire'' is not the world's most subtle political critique. But subtlety isn't everything. Frank's best moments come when his contempt boils over and his inner grouch is released.
This book is Frank's interpretation of developments since ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' was published eight years ago. Frank's thesis here is basically that the thesis of the old book has been confirmed. He will not persuade anybody who does not already buy the Tom Frank line. But those who do (as I do, more or less) will enjoy a very good time having their predispositions massaged. 
Frank sometimes writes in an arch voice that seemed familiar when I first encountered it but that I couldn't place. Then I read in his book-jacket bio that he writes for Harper's Magazine, and I thought, ''Zounds, Watson, the man may have Lapham's Disease.'' The symptoms of this malady, named after the longtime editor of Harper's, Lewis H. Lapham (now of Lapham's Quarterly), include an elevated, orotund, deeply ironic prose style that, in severe cases, reveals almost nothing about what the topic is or what the author wishes to say about it except for a general sense of superiority to everyone and everything around.
Fortunately, Frank's case is very mild. What he retains is a healthy refusal to be intimidated by charges of ''elitism.'' He's not afraid to give his chapters titles like ''Mimesis.'' (I looked it up. It's a good joke.) He says of some right-wing nut who enjoyed 15 seconds of YouTube fame that he possessed ''an understanding of German history that bordered on complete fantasy.'' His message to liberals is: Oh, for heaven's sake, don't be so defensive! The other side (Republicans, financiers, business executives, billionaires) has most of the economic -- and therefore political -- power. Today's conservatives wield reverse snobbery as a weapon, accusing liberals of sins like living on the East or West Coast. Frank mocks conservatives' claims that they are victims of an all-powerful liberal establishment. He calls this ''tearful weepy-woo.''
Meanwhile, things have gone from bad to worse. Conservatives continue their Sherman's march through the landmarks of liberal government, burning and looting as they go. They've gone after the legacies of Lyndon Johnson (Medicare), Franklin Roosevelt (Social Security; financial regulation) and Theodore Roose/velt (environmentalism). And working people continue to be duped into supporting measures manifestly against their own self-interest. In ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' Frank attributed this to a clever bait-and-switch by conservatives, who appeal to middle- and lower-class voters on the basis of social issues like abortion and gays in the military, and values like patriotism and religion. And then they govern on the agenda of traditional Republican groups like businessmen and bankers.
With ''Pity the Billionaire,'' the emphasis is different and the explanation is simpler: President Obama has betrayed the voters who elected him. He ran like a populist, Frank believes, but he has governed like a plutocrat, or at least a friend of plutocrats. Frank quotes a remarkable passage from Obama's book ''The Audacity of Hope'' about ''people of means'' whom he met at Democratic fund-raisers:
''As a rule they were smart, interesting people, knowledgeable about public policy, liberal in their politics, expecting nothing more than a hearing . . . in exchange for their checks. But they reflected, almost uniformly, the perspectives of their class. . . . They believed in the free market and an educational meritocracy. . . . They had no patience with protectionism, found unions troublesome and were not particularly sympathetic to those whose lives were upended by the movements of global capital. Most were adamantly pro-choice and anti-gun and were vaguely suspicious of deep religious sentiment.''
Obama goes on to admit that by hanging around with these people, he was becoming ''more like'' them, and Frank -- refusing to plea-bargain this stunning confession for a milder sentence -- agrees, then piles on.
It seems to me that a Democratic president who gets us health care reform and tough new financial protection for consumers, who guides the economy through its roughest period in 80 years with moderate success (who could do better?), who ends our long war in Iraq and avenges the worst insult to our sovereignty since Pearl Harbor (as his Republican predecessor manifestly failed to do, despite a lot of noise and promises); a president who faced an opposition of really spectacular intransigence and downright meanness; a president who has the self-knowledge and wisdom about Washington to write the passage quoted above, and the courage to publish it: that president deserves a bit more credit from the left than Frank is willing to give him.
Frank may also be a bit overly impressed by what the right has achieved. Evelyn Waugh complained that the British Conservative Party had failed to turn back the clock by a single second. Have the Republicans done much better? (Waugh was speaking long before the Margaret Thatcher revolution, which really did change British society enormously.) Conservatives have dominated the debate, and usually the government, for three decades now, yet they haven't managed to abolish a single cabinet department or eliminate a single major entitlement program. Nothing big has been ''privatized.'' Somehow or other, against all expectations and despite a conservative Supreme Court, abortion rights and affirmative action have been preserved. Gay rights are advancing so fast that the Republican Party itself is probably ahead of where Democrats were a generation ago. The Constitution has not been amended to require a balanced budget or forbid flag-burning.
True, they've pretty much killed the union movement. While they are not to blame for the effects of globalization and technology on income distribution, they've done nothing to mitigate these. And then there are tax cuts -- especially tax cuts for the wealthy. That we have had. In spades. Actually, all this tends to confirm Frank's contention that what Republicans really care about, politically, is money, and all that other stuff is just prole meat.
Frank dates the discovery by conservatives that they are being oppressed by a liberal elite all the way back to 2010, when The American Spectator magazine published an article by Angelo Codevilla called ''America's Ruling Class.'' I believe that, in fact, the funhouse-mirror class war (in which liberals and poor people are the upper class and billionaires are among the oppressed masses) has been going on longer than that -- at least since Nixon's ''silent majority.'' (The man was president, but he still felt oppressed.) But then Frank, as a liberal elitist, has a touching belief in the influence of words. He believes a magazine article can change the world. He quotes from obscure books and pamphlets he has picked up as if each one had been read by everyone in the Tea Party.
The two great antiheroes of ''Pity the Billionaire'' are Ayn Rand and Glenn Beck. You might say that Frank is intrigued by Beck, or you might say he is obsessed. He is like an intellectual stalker, following Beck around as he attends to his empire of projects, making sure we don't miss a single lie or absurdity. Beck is influential, and he was enjoying his 15 minutes when Frank was writing this book. But is he more influential than any other radio talk-show host? I'd put my money on Rush. Or how about Grover Norquist, whose ability to pressure members of Congress into supporting his agenda is like nothing since ''Red Channels'' (the McCarthy-era publication that maintained the blacklist)?
Frank spends 11 out of 187 pages (before the endnotes) in this short book on an entertaining deconstruction of Ayn Rand's masterwork, ''Atlas Shrugged.'' ''For me,'' Frank writes, ''it is the political flimflam of our times wrapped up in one big package: the manifesto of the deregulators and free marketeers who caused the economic disaster.'' ''Atlas Shrugged'' is certainly a ridiculous book, and a good illustration of the absurd self-pity of the rich that Frank so deftly skewers in ''Pity the Billionaire.'' But the notion that this 1,000-page novel about the breakdown of society due to a corrupt government plays any role in, say, the debate over ''cap and trade'' seems far-fetched.
This is not a book about policy, and Frank shouldn't be expected to have a 10-point program for reforming the Federal Reserve Board before he allows himself a sarcastic reference to Ben Bernanke. But when he casually uses phrases like ''deregulators and free marketeers'' to define the bad guys, it does give one pause. For Frank, are government regulations ever excessive? Does he see no merit at all in free trade? Frank surely doesn't oppose free-market capitalism as a general principle, however much he may dislike Glenn Beck. Or does he? It would have been nice to know a bit more about where Thomas Frank is coming from. Otherwise, he starts to sound like those Tea Party people whom he rightly mocks for being very, very angry with no idea why or what to do about it.

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
KERNERSVILLE, N.C. -- Some of Caterpillar's newest factory workers are training inside a former carpet warehouse here in the heart of tobacco country. In classrooms, they click through online tutorials and study blueprints emblazoned with the company's logo. And on a mock factory floor, they learn to use wrenches, hoses and power tools that they will need to build axles for large mining trucks.
The primary beneficiary is undoubtedly Caterpillar, a maker of industrial equipment with rising profits that has a new plant about 10 miles away in Winston-Salem.
Yet North Carolina is picking up much of the cost. It is paying about $1 million to help nearly 400 workers acquire these skills, and a community college has committed to develop a custom curriculum that Caterpillar has valued at about $4.3 million. 
Caterpillar is one of dozens of companies, many with growing profits and large cash reserves, that have come to expect such largess from states in return for creating jobs. The labor market is finally starting to show some signs of improvement, with the government reporting on Friday that employers created 200,000 jobs in December.
Although the sums spent on training are usually small compared with the tax breaks and other credits doled out by states, some critics question the tactic.
''The question is, why shouldn't the company pay for this training?'' asked Ross Eisenbrey, the vice president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ''It's for their benefit.''
Critics suggest the programs may not even be in the best interest of workers if the resulting jobs pay low wages or simply disappear after a few years, leaving employees with narrow skills that do not help them land new positions. In North Carolina, for example, people are still smarting from the departure of a Dell factory that put nearly 1,000 people out of work just five years after the state spent close to $2 million on training.
Various studies have long questioned whether states get their money's worth from incentives for companies that build facilities or expand existing ones. In a report last month, Good Jobs First, a nonprofit research organization that tracks such spending, found that states often attract companies that create few jobs, pay low wages or scrimp on health insurance.
But customized job training for a specific employer still holds favor with public officials, who often argue it may be an effective use of taxpayer dollars, especially when so many workers have been displaced. Targeted programs can be preferable to the more general training paid for by the federal government, programs that have been used by hundreds of thousands of Americans yet have left many participants still out of work.
''On the whole spectrum of things that are done to attract businesses, this is one of the best investments and highest return for the invested dollar that our state and many other states do,'' said J. Keith Crisco, North Carolina's secretary of commerce.
Caterpillar, which is investing $426 million in the new factory, is one of several companies supported by North Carolina, where the unemployment rate hovers around 10 percent and thousands of textile, furniture and other manufacturing workers have lost their jobs in recent years. The training support is part of a $51 million package of incentives from the state to lure Caterpillar to Winston-Salem.
The state is also paying to train workers for a new Honda Aircraft factory in Greensboro, an expanding Siemens plant in Charlotte and an existing call center in Winston-Salem for US Airways, which relocated 200 jobs from Manila last year.
According to the state, North Carolina spent about $9.4 million to train workers as part of projects that created nearly 4,500 jobs in the 12 months through June 30. (The total cost per job rises sharply beyond the $2,000 in training because of voluminous tax breaks and other incentives.)
Business executives argue that government-subsidized training is a fair payoff given what the companies bring to the table.
''At the end of the day we're creating more jobs for the state of North Carolina,'' said Mark Pringle, director of operations at a Siemens gas and steam turbine plant in Charlotte that has received close to $1.2 million worth of training from the state for about 700 new workers. ''There's no doubt it's a competitive process,'' he added.
The weak economic recovery has prompted states to be more aggressive in the race to snag precious jobs. Louisiana started a training assistance program four years ago to help companies expand and relocate there, and has ramped up financing despite cuts in the state budget over all. In Wisconsin, Representative Louis Molepske Jr. is proposing legislation to allocate state funds for customized training programs.
Especially with such high unemployment, ''politicians of both parties tend to like job training,'' said Gordon Lafer, professor of political science and labor education at the University of Oregon. ''Because it's cheap, doesn't require taking sides and because you can say you're for workers and business at the same time.''
Workers who have spent months, or even years, hunting for jobs view a training spot as a stroke of good fortune.
Dante Durant, a 42-year-old former Dell employee, had been searching for more than two years when he attended a Caterpillar job fair at Forsyth Technical Community College in June. He arrived at 9 a.m. and was number 1,808 in line. Although he was five weeks into another customized training program for a smaller manufacturer in Greensboro, he submitted an application to the Caterpillar Web site.
A few days later he was invited to take a series of tests administered by staff at Forsyth Tech.
He was one of the first 13 people offered a job, and finished training here in Kernersville in October. Besides screening applicants, Forsyth Tech instructors are teaching a large portion of the classes, and state dollars paid for laptop computers, tools and the warehouse space.
The training ''was definitely precise,'' said Mr. Durant, who was paid during the training and started at the factory recently. ''Once we came out of there, everybody was prepared to go to work.''
Caterpillar officials, who expect to create 392 full-time jobs with an average annual salary of $40,000 in Winston-Salem, say they are committed to the community and will invest in training, too. The company does not disclose how much it spends on training, but it runs an online ''Caterpillar University'' for its workers. It also offers college tuition assistance to employees.
Nonetheless, the state-financed training is a perk. Rusty Davis, operations manager of the Winston-Salem plant, said that in his previous assignment at a Caterpillar plant in Torreon, Mexico, the company trained its own recruits. ''We had to devote a certain section of our facility to training,'' he said. ''We could have been doing more products there and making more money.''
When programs focus on the specific needs of one company, workers may be vulnerable if the firm has layoffs or closes shop.
Many of the workers displaced by the closing last year of the Dell plant, next door to the new Caterpillar factory, have yet to find work, though some are showing up at Caterpillar.
North Carolina officials say the skills these workers learned in training are not wasted.
Mr. Durant, who worked at Dell for three years on the factory floor, secured a spot in another training program last summer to learn how to operate computerized machining tools.
There were no job guarantees, and he spent $100 a week in gas commuting to a community college. When the Caterpillar job came up, he left the program.
Still, some of the skills he picked up have come in handy. ''All my training, even the training I got from Dell, helped me with my jobs,'' said Mr. Durant.
For now, he is grateful to be working, even though he is earning less than he did at Dell. ''It feels good,'' he said as he helped two colleagues affix steel plates to a wheel carrier. ''I wake up and know I am going to work.''
But Mr. Durant, who dropped out of college more than 20 years ago, is determined his 2-year-old son will get a college degree.
''I don't want him to go through what I have had to go through,'' he said.
Learn to Earn: Articles in this series are examining vocational training at high schools, community colleges, companies and student organizations in the United States.

HEADLINE: They Pay a Dividend, but Can You Afford Them?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
WHEN gains in the stock market are hard to come by, dividend-paying stock funds really stand out.
In fact, the four best-performing categories of equity funds in 2011 -- portfolios that specialize in utilities, health care, real estate investment trusts and consumer companies involved in food, beverages and other household products -- all dabble in dividend-rich parts of the market. And all of these groups produced average gains of more than 7 percent last year, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose a mere 2 percent, according to the fund tracker Morningstar.
But almost as quickly as investors rediscovered dividend payers, they've started to learn that this strategy is becoming expensive. 
''It does beg a little closer inspection,'' said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ''Investors have plowed into these areas without much regard for what underlying securities are actually producing these yields and what their valuations are.''
Mr. Luschini noted, for instance, that because of their recent popularity, shares of many utilities and consumer-staples companies -- businesses that produce basic household necessities like food and toothpaste -- are now at or near their recent highs.
Utilities, which have historically traded at a significant discount to the S.& P. 500, owing to the sector's slower-than-average growth, have an average price-to-earnings ratio of 15, based on the trailing 12 months of earnings. That means the sector trades at a premium to the overall market P/E of about 13.
And as far as real estate investment trusts go, their prices are starting to become uncomfortably high, said Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic Capital. ''We've been in REITs for clients for more than 20 years, but we're completely out of them right now because of their valuations,'' he said.
Still, prices in income-producing sectors haven't reached the point where strategists recommend abandoning the search for dividends. Instead, they say, investors just need to be more mindful of how they use the strategy.
Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, which outperformed 56 percent of its peers last year, noted that his fund sold its shares of a giant utility, Dominion Resources, when they were trading at a P/E of above 15.
But his fund has not given up on the sector entirely. It continues to own shares of utilities with lower-than-average P/E ratios, like American Electric Power, which is trading at just 11 times last year's earnings.
Mark R. Freeman, co-manager of the Gamco Westwood Balanced fund, which beat 65 percent of its peers in 2011, adds that investors would be wise to focus on high yielders and on companies with the potential to methodically bolster payouts over time. ''This is the wrong time to reach for stocks with the absolute highest yields,'' he said. ''I'm a bigger fan of companies that are yielding 2 to 4 percent now but that promise earnings growth in the future and higher-quality balance sheets.''
FOCUSING on dividend growth should help create a more stable portfolio, market strategists say. After all, companies that can bolster their earnings and payouts consistently are likely to withstand an economic downturn better than their peers.
What's more, this approach should help investors find dividend-payers in less-expensive sectors of the economy.
Henry B. Smith, chief equity investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, an asset management firm in Radnor, Pa., said that the firm maintains two separate blue-chip dividend stock strategies. The first focuses on companies in position ''to increase their dividends over time based on their above-average earnings growth,'' he said, and is used in the Haverford Quality Growth Stockmutual fund. The other, available to clients though not through a retail fund, pays more attention to companies with higher current yields.
While the second approach outperformed the first in 2011, the dividend-growth portfolio has a lower average P/E ratio -- around 10 times 2012 estimated earnings, versus about 11 for the high-yielding portfolio.
By focusing on dividend growth, investors will also be drawn to less-traditional income-producing sectors like technology.
Mr. Cordaro of RegentAtlantic says that one of his favorite dividend-paying stocks these days is Intel, the chip maker now paying out a market-beating 3.3 percent dividend yield. The stock is trading at a modest P/E of 10, and its earnings are expected to grow roughly 10 percent annually.
''You've got the same exact thing going on at Microsoft,'' he said, referring to the software giant whose shares have a 2.9 percent dividend yield. Like Intel, Microsoft has earnings that are expected to grow around 10 percent annually, yet it is trading at less than 10 times last year's earnings.
''If I told you in 1998 that these companies would turn into dividend leaders,'' Mr. Cordaro said, ''you'd say I was crazy.''

HEADLINE: A Vision for Urban Parks

BYLINE: By DAN BIEDERMAN. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
WHEN I was 9, a trip to the White Mountains in New Hampshire during summer camp started my interest in parks and hiking. After that, I visited national parks and decided I liked rugged rural areas. Later, I grew to appreciate bits of nature that governments provide for urban residents.
I graduated from Princeton in 1975 with a bachelor's degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. I liked the idea of working in cities because they're intellectually stimulating, but the ideal job for me was probably as a forest ranger. Redeveloping city parks, which now accounts for half of my work, is a compromise. 
I also create business improvement districts, in which businesses pay extra taxes or fees to improve their areas. I co-founded and serve as president of three management organizations for redeveloping sections of New York City: the 34th Street Partnership, the Bryant Park Corporation and the Chelsea Improvement Company.
I started Biederman Redevelopment Ventures in 1998 because I was getting so many requests for free advice. Through the company, I've consulted on projects in places including Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Finland, Britain, Canada and Israel.
Three experiences helped prepare me for this career. The knowledge I gained from my M.B.A. program was key; I graduated from Harvard Business School in 1977. My father, a textile executive, was also instrumental in my training. He had a good management eye; he knew how businesses should operate. When we went to a movie or to a restaurant, he'd point out things to me. I don't know if he was even aware of what he was doing.
Finally, I've been influenced by some of the sites I've seen, like Rockefeller Center in New York, Faneuil Hall in Boston, the Royal Parks of London, and Luxembourg Gardens in Paris. If you're observant, visits to such places build your skills as a public space designer.
I start with a vision and then raise money from private sources. I don't seek public funds because there are strings attached to how the money can be spent. Also, I work mostly in commercial districts. I'd rather not compete for funds in neighborhoods that have few options for improvement other than government.
I approach each project differently. Often, business owners who want to improve their neighborhood ask me what I would do. I tell them my ideas, which may start with removing litter and graffiti and adding beautiful lampposts and attractive benches and plants. Then I figure out how to find the money to pay for the capital and operating improvements.
One of my college internships, with a city agency, has had a lifelong impact on my use of interns. The agency didn't really know what to do with me; it put me in a back room and gave me a report to write. I was falling asleep at my desk. After a few weeks, I asked to become more involved in the work of the office.
As a result of that, I decided to always be attentive to interns and junior staff members. The second that interns start with us, we drop them in the middle of an exciting project and include them in meetings. Recently, the 34th Street Partnership issued bonds for capital improvements. I took three junior staff members along to the investment bank pricing the bonds because I thought they'd find it interesting.
Bryant Park is special to me. I tell people that it's my life's work, but some of them correct me and say no, that it's the first park I redeveloped. We're not done there, however. We've got to keep perfecting it.

HEADLINE: He's Back, Just as Curious as Ever

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
THAT didn't last long. Just 20 months after retiring his PBS series ''Bill Moyers Journal,'' Mr. Moyers was back in the studio on a Wednesday morning in December, deep in conversation about moral political psychology with the author Jonathan Haidt.
The interview veered from Manichean thinking among baby boomers to the social conservative understanding of karma, all as it related to the roots of the country's political divide. Mr. Moyers worked his way through a sheaf of notes, as the scheduled 90 minutes stretched a good hour longer. (''This is fun,'' he said to his guest during a pause.) Emerging from the studio, he said he had decided mid-interview that the discussion would probably take up the entire hour on his new weekly program, rather than be a 20-minute segment.
''Bill Moyers Journal'' ended in April 2010 because Mr. Moyers, now 77, said he needed a break from the incessant demands of weekly television. But there's no sign he is easing up this time around. 
The new show, which begins this month on public television stations, has a different name, ''Moyers & Company,'' and a warmer set, featuring a blue-and-green background. But much will carry over from the old program, including Mr. Moyers's thoughtful interviews with thinkers who wouldn't otherwise get much television face time and a focus on the country's most pressing political and economic questions. ''I'm coming back because in tumultuous times like these I relish the company of people who try to make sense of the tumult,'' Mr. Moyers writes on his Web site, billmoyers.com.
In an interview in his sprawling new Manhattan office he said that during his break he explored the possibility of a documentary on Lyndon B. Johnson, the president he served as press secretary, but decided that ''today is more interesting than yesterday.'' Also a factor: the passionate viewers who write him by the hundreds and stop him on the street to talk about his past programs like ''On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying,'' from 2000.
Aided by 30 employees (just over half that of ''Journal''), Mr. Moyers has banked interviews in recent weeks with the former Reagan budget chief David Stockman, the former Citibank chief executive John S. Reed and the poet Rita Dove (with whom he read ''The Hill'' by Edgar Lee Masters). He also held a marathon four-hour chat with the political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson, authors of ''Winner-Take-All Politics,'' which he called ''the most important book I've read'' since ending the old show; it will provide the backbone for his first three episodes.
The seeds of Mr. Moyers's return were planted several months after his last show ended by Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
When ''Bill Moyers Journal'' ended, ''I was very sad,'' Mr. Gregorian said in a telephone interview, praising the host's intelligence and ''the respect with which he approached everyone, whether he agreed with them, to know their ideas.'' Mr. Moyers, he added, helps in ''enlightening our democracy'' -- a Carnegie mission -- by putting ''before our nation questions that we should discuss.'' The Carnegie Corporation, which was instrumental in the founding of public television, gave Mr. Moyers a lead gift of $2 million for the new show.
In an odd twist, however, ''Moyers & Company'' is not being distributed by PBS, but by American Public Television, a separate distribution service. Viewers will find it at a hodgepodge of times, but Mr. Moyers is so popular that many stations are scheduling multiple broadcasts. In New York WNET will run it on Sundays at 6 p.m. starting on Jan. 15, with a rebroadcast Mondays at 10 p.m.
Mr. Moyers said he was unsure why PBS, where he has spent most of his career since 1971, declined the show for its main schedule. Some public television executives, who would not publicly comment on a sensitive issue, said they believed that PBS did not want to realign itself with Mr. Moyers, a longtime target of some conservatives, as it was fighting to keep its federal financing.
In a statement a PBS spokeswoman, Anne Bentley, said of Mr. Moyers that ''we respect him immensely and the outstanding work he has done,'' and that PBS had discussed carrying the show. She did not address why he wasn't offered a prime spot. PBS will, however, stream the show at video.pbs.org.
No longer tied to PBS, Mr. Moyers was free to create his own Web site, where for the first time much of his work, old and new, will be in one place. He is soliciting viewer participation, writing: ''This will be a political series but not a partisan one. In the conversation of democracy, everyone's invited. That means you too.''
In the interview Mr. Moyers added that with the Web site, ''we don't have to worry about somebody at PBS losing sleep over the fact that David Stockman says the Republicans have lost their minds on taxes.''
His return comes as public television executives are debating their path: More ''Downton Abbey,'' or local and national news? So far public affairs programming is losing. PBS canceled ''Now'' when ''Bill Moyers Journal'' ended; the replacement show ''Need to Know'' was recently trimmed from one hour to 30 minutes.
Yet, Mr. Moyers noted, PBS announced an additional version of ''Antiques Roadshow'' just a few weeks after the Census Bureau released figures showing the number of people living in poverty had risen to more than 46 million.
''I love 'Antiques Roadshow,' '' he added. ''But it is just symbolic of how we're not connected viscerally to the state of the American people right now.''
In November he called for executives at local stations to come to grips with financing and governance issues that he contends threaten public television's future.
''We're just hanging on, leaking away, fraying at the margins, scrambling year by year to survive, hoping all the while for what in an era of trillion-dollar deficits and austerity will never be: more and more funding from Congress,'' he said in a speech to his colleagues. ''What we need is a makeover of our own'' to help ''realize the goals of our founders: diversity, public access, civic discourse, experimentation, a welcoming place for independent spirits.''
Many stations are already on that path, said Rich Homberg, president of Detroit Public Television, adding, ''I think we need an army of people to read that speech and go act on it.'' He said Mr. Moyers has been ''an important voice for a long time, and we welcome him back.''

HEADLINE: School Cuts Also Threaten Culture Sites

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH. 
msmith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
As Texas schools whittle their budgets in response to the state's multibillion dollar education cuts, they are eyeing every expenditure, from athletics to busing and even field trips. 
Museums, symphonies and other cultural institutions, already suffering from the economic downturn, may be an unexpected casualty of state budget cuts, said Bruce H. Esterline, vice president for grants of the Meadows Foundation. His organization, which supports philanthropic efforts statewide in areas like education and health, has seen an increase in the number of grant proposals from cultural arts groups that cited reduced revenue from school activities this year.
State lawmakers last year cut $4 billion in general revenue from public education plus $1.4 billion in discretionary grants for programs like pre-kindergarten and remedial tutoring.
Schools' budgetary constraints have ''really put a damper'' on visits to museums, said Jacki Womack, the booking services manager for ArtReach-Dallas, an organization that coordinates tours for several cultural agencies in the Dallas area. This year, instead of booking visits for each grade level, she said, many elementary and middle schools are opting to take all of their students on one trip. Other districts may choose to follow the model of Cypress-Fairbanks, the third-most populous district in the state, which for years has not offered any field trips at all, instead relying on in-school presentations to keep expenses down.
Pascual Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Northside Independent School District in San Antonio, the state's fourth-most populous, said there had been a significant decrease in the number of field trips for middle and high school students. He said elementary teachers usually select free destinations like parks or the Alamo and then raise money through parent-teacher associations for transportation.
Private fund-raising has helped cushion some of the blow. Many cultural groups have corporate and individual underwriters for school visits that can defray most of the costs.
Schools also receive financing for cultural activities through the Texas Commission on the Arts. Jim Bob McMillan, the commission's deputy director, said the demand for school programming money has grown to an average request of about $24,000 in the first quarter of the current fiscal year from about $13,000 last year. But the commission's budget was cut by 56 percent last year, and Mr. McMillan said it had been able to award an average of only $2,200 to the schools.
Anthony Corroa, the executive director of the Austin Symphony, which reaches more than 90,000 students a year through performances and in-school presentations, said budget cuts have not yet affected his institution, which receives financing for music education in schools through many sources.
The Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas, however, has definitely felt the impact of school budget cuts, said Linda Murdock, the museum's director of sales. The museum has earmarked more of its financing for scholarships than in any other year, she said, and it has received several donations specifically for subsidizing field trips.
But in many cases, those dollars do not cover transportation, she added, and some of the schools cannot afford to transport the students from the school to the museum.
When that happens, she said, the museum offers in-school programs.
''We're still reaching students,'' Ms. Murdock said. ''But we're reaching a few less than we did last year.''

HEADLINE: The 45 Places to Go in 2012

BYLINE: By NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
1. Panama Go for the canal. Stay for everything else.
It's been 12 years since Panama regained control of its canal, and the country's economy is booming. Cranes stalk the skyline of the capital, Panama City, where high-rises sprout one after the next and immigrants arrive daily from around the world. Among those who have landed en masse in recent years are American expatriates and investors, who have banked on Panamanian real estate by building hotels and buying retirement homes. The passage of the United States-Panama free trade agreement in October is expected to accelerate this international exchange of people and dollars (the countries use the same currency).
Among the notable development projects is the Panama Canal itself, which is in the early stages of a multibillion-dollar expansion. The project will widen and deepen the existing canal and add two locks, doubling the canal's cargo capacity. For those who want to see the waterway as it was originally designed, now is the time. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2014, the canal's 100-year anniversary. 
Other high-profile projects include the construction of three firsts: The Panamera, the first Waldorf Astoria hotel in Latin America (set to open in June 2012); the Trump Ocean Club, the region's tallest building, which opened last summer; and Frank Gehry's first Latin American design, the BioMuseo, a natural history museum scheduled to open in early 2013. Even Panama City's famously dilapidated historic quarter, Casco Viejo, has been transformed. The neighborhood, a tangle of narrow streets, centuries-old houses and neo-colonial government buildings, was designated a Unesco World Heritage site in 1997 and is now a trendy arts district with galleries, coffeehouses, street musicians and some of the city's most stylish restaurants and boutique hotels.
Across the isthmus, on Panama's Caribbean coast, the Bocas del Toro archipelago has become a popular stop on the backpacker circuit, with snorkeling and zip lining by day and raucous night life after dark. FREDA MOON
2. Helsinki, Finland Design. Design. Design. Aesthetics fuel a new cool.
Copenhagen's culinary awakening and Stockholm's trend-setting fashion may have ignited the world's current infatuation with Nordic culture; now Helsinki is poised for the spotlight. The International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has designated it the World Design Capital for 2012.
Design has long been part of the city's DNA, but in recent years the scene has been increasingly energized: the official Design District has ballooned to encompass 25 streets and nearly 200 design-minded businesses, which range from shops selling housewares and furniture to boutique hotels and clothing stores. Design has infiltrated the restaurant scene as well, notably the elegant Chez Dominique and the hot newcomer (and Michelin-starred) Olo.
On top of all that is the spectacular new $242 million Helsinki Music Center. Student ensembles from the Sibelius Academy -- the sole university in Finland devoted exclusively to music -- will perform in the striking glass-walled space, and both the Vienna Philharmonic and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestras will give concerts in 2012. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
3. Myanmar Back on the tourist map after being off-limits for years.
With renowned cultural treasures, world-class boutique hotels and deserted beaches, Myanmar has long been high on intrepid travelers' wish lists. For years, though, heeding calls by the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others, many stayed away in protest of Myanmar's authoritarian regime.
Now, however, this is changing.
Since November 2010, when Myanmar's rulers held nominally free elections and released Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi after 15 years of house arrest, the boycott has been lifted and Myanmar is set for an influx of visitors.
Because the country has been so isolated, the deeply Buddhist ''Land of the Golden Pagoda'' resonates with a strong sense of place, undiluted by mass tourism and warmed by genuine hospitality. Travelers will find atmospheric hotels and a network of well-maintained regional jets serving the main sites. (Keep in mind that visas are still required and that the economy remains largely cash-based.)
But locals are aware of the potential downside of tourism as well. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has called for sustainable development and ''trickle down'' tourism where dollars will do the most good.
With these goals in mind, nestled along the banks of meandering Lake Inle in eastern Myanmar, the ViewPoint eco-lodge combines locally sourced materials with individually tailored activities supporting the local economy (like garden-to-table lunches at an island village house).
Similarly, in Ngapali Beach -- a pristine swath of coastline on the Bay of Bengal -- the Amara Ocean Resort ratchets up the om factor with a hand-built spa. The resort finances relief projects in the Irrawaddy River delta. CEIL MILLER-BOUCHET
4. London The Olympics! The Queen! Charles Dickens turns 200!
Dotted with construction sites, London is preparing for the pomp and circumstance of the Olympic Games and the Diamond Jubilee celebration of the Queen's 60th year on the throne. New stadiums, public spaces and shopping centers are emerging on the city's eastern edge, and on the western edge a 137-room Waldorf Astoria has opened on a 400-acre estate near Heathrow Airport.
But it's not all sport and royalty. On a street of chocolate-box Georgian houses in Bloomsbury, the Charles Dickens Museum is open, in time for the author's 200th birthday. Across town, Warner Brothers Studio Tour will open the Harry Potter studios to those keen to re-live the films. The Rolling Stones, celebrating their 50th anniversary, might tour again, with a possible finale here. And Robert Redford will inaugurate a London outpost of the Sundance Film festival at the O2 Arena in April.
Amid the hubbub, flashes of eccentricity emerge. If the Waldorf doesn't appeal, stay in an architect-designed boat, perched on the edge of a roof overlooking the Thames. Or visit the British outpost of Occupy London, which will be maintaining its tent city outside St. Paul's cathedral. RAVI SOMAIYA
5. Oakland, Calif. New restaurants and bars beckon amid the grit.
Tensions have cooled since violence erupted at the recent Occupy Oakland protests, but the city's revitalized night-life scene has continued to smolder.
The historic Fox Theater reopened in 2009 and quickly cemented its status as one of the Bay Area's top music venues, drawing acts like Wilco and the Decemberists. Meanwhile, the city's ever more sophisticated restaurants are now being joined by upscale cocktail bars, turning once-gritty Oakland into an increasingly appealing place to be after dark. James Syhabout, the chef who earned Oakland its first (and only) Michelin star two years ago at Commis, followed up in May with the instant-hit Hawker Fare, a casual spot serving Asian street food. Big-name San Francisco chefs are now joining him. Daniel Patterson (of two-Michelin-star Coi) opened the restaurant Plum in late 2010 and an adjacent cocktail bar later, and another restaurant, called Haven, in the recently renovated Jack London Square last month. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
6. Tokyo With some tourists slow to return, greater opportunities for those who do. The thought of traveling to Tokyo will most likely make some people nervous. Though the city is about 180 miles from the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, the site of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl -- and the State Department recommends travelers avoid only the area directly around the disaster site -- Tokyo has suffered as well, a problem of perception as much as reality.
But from another vantage point, it's a perfect time to visit. A decrease in tourism and business travel is making the city all the more accessible and welcoming. According to Laurent Vernhes, a founder and the chief executive of TabletHotels.com, a travel site with a curated list of distinctive lodging options, tourism hasn't yet returned to normal levels. ''Rates are still down about 10 percent on average compared to the same time last year,'' Mr. Vernhes said.
When I visited the city in the fall, it was clear that it is still crackling with energy. But now it's possible to get a previously unthinkable last-minute reservation at one of the city's many world-class restaurants or a room in hotels usually booked solid. A Saturday night dinner at Kagurazaka Ishikawa, a pricey but discreet restaurant with three Michelin stars and an artful tasting menu? No problem. And lodging options for all budgets have gotten easier. Chances are you can find a room at the elegant Park Hyatt Tokyo, a luxurious high-rise, or at the Tokyo Ryokan, a family-run hotel with just three simple bedrooms that often are reserved well in advance. OLIVER STRAND
Note: An earlier version of the subheading with this entry has been changed because it was unintentionally insensitive in making a link between last year's tragedy in Japan and the opportunity for tourism. 7. Tanzania Coming into its own as an upscale safari destination.
For the last several years the number of tourists going to Tanzania has been edging up, according to East African travel specialists like Hippo Creek Safaris and Abercrombie & Kent. But it wasn't until several violent attacks on visitors to neighboring Kenya that the numbers really took off, as Tanzania started to absorb skittish Kenya-bound safari seekers.
Not that Tanzania is coasting along solely on Kenya's troubles; it's always had Mount Kilimanjaro, after all. And now other attractions are being discovered, too -- places like Gibb's Farm, a small lodge from which guests can hike to the Ngorongoro Crater area, a prime destination for big game viewing. In addition, the opening of exclusive safari reserves like the Singita Grumeti and the upscale camps managed by Nomad Tanzania and Chem Chem are evidence that the country's tourist infrastructure is becoming more sophisticated, perhaps even catching up to Kenya's. GISELA WILLIAMS
8. Chilean Patagonia Proof that adventure doesn't have to mean roughing it.
With its mix of snowy peaks, pristine rain forest and network of virgin national parks, Chile is emerging as one of the world's adventure hot spots and now has a spate of rugged luxury lodges in which adventure-seekers can stay.
Puma Lodge, a glass-and-wood design showcase about an hour and a half south of Santiago, features heli-skiing through miles of untouched powder, and outside of Patagonia's Torres del Paine Park, the brand-new Tierra Patagonia offers activities like horseback riding over the steppes and boat outings on a glacial lake (while also offering creature comforts like a spa and a heated indoor pool). Meanwhile, the latest Singular property, which also opened in November outside the park, leads expeditions into the nearby glaciers. For custom trips, pioneers to the region like Cazenove & Loyd can help navigate the logistical challenges of criss-crossing Chile's dramatic landscapes. ONDINE COHANE
9. Lhasa, Tibet New luxury hotels bring respite -- and controversy.
Tibet's holy capital is in the throes of a luxury-hotel boom. In Lhasa, this is news: not only is operating an upscale hotel at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level no small feat, but real-estate developments here are, almost by default, also culturally loaded.
The majestic, 162-room St. Regis Lhasa Resort has been in full operation since May. In 2010, a charming Tibetan-owned villa called the Lingtsang reopened as a boutique hotel with opulent, colorful woodwork and courtyard verandas. And coming soon are the sprawling InterContinental Resort Lhasa Paradise and the 284-room Shangri-La, both scheduled to open in 2013.
On the upside, it's the first time that travelers can get high-end amenities in a city where even basic hospitality has been a challenge. On the downside, the openings -- like Lhasa's booming population, new business districts and shopping malls -- are seen by many Tibetans and interested outsiders as more cultural colonization and exploitation of a sacred land. KIMBERLY BRADLEY
10. Havana, Cuba The Cuban capital is once again within Americans' reach.
The only thing that lies between Americans and the sultry streets of Havana these days is the Florida Straits, since the Obama administration has widened the kind of travel allowed. A growing list of organizations have licenses to operate trips to Cuba, including National Geographic Expeditions, Austin-Lehman and the Center for Cuban Studies. There are also more flights from more American cities: Fort Lauderdale and Tampa recently joined New York, Miami and Los Angeles on the list, and Chicago will be added this year.
The ''people-to-people'' rules require Americans to interact with Cubans (sun-and-sand vacations are still prohibited) so tours involve meeting with art historians, organic farmers and others. Conveniently, new restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts, some in gorgeous colonial villas, have sprung up over the past year as the government has allowed more private enterprise. Havana is also gearing up for its 11th Biennial, from May 11 to June 11, which will draw more than 100 Cuban and international artists. VICTORIA BURNETT
11. Moscow New cultural venues add a dash of the sacred and profane.
The extravagantly renovated Bolshoi Theater has been preening like a prima donna before the news media's flashbulbs since it reopened in October. And given the $760 million face-lift to the 236-year-old grand dame you can almost hear the czars applauding from their tombs.
But beyond the spotlight, two compelling museums have also made their debuts. The Russian Icon Museum is said to hold the largest private collection of Russian and Eastern Christian religious artwork (some 4,000 pieces). Admission to the museum is free.
You won't find many virgins or saints at Tochka G, whose name translates as ''G Spot.'' With more than 3,000 sex-related items, the bounty includes everything from Soviet-era condoms to high-tech sex dolls to ''Wrestling,'' a 2011 painting by the Russian artist Vera Donskaya-Khilko that depicts a buff Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama challenging each other with their cartoonishly oversized phalluses.

12. Glasgow Zaha Hadid takes on a Scottish waterfront.
Scotland's second city now has a $115 million museum designed by Zaha Hadid to go with its shiny new harbor and river promenade.
The Riverside Museum, which opened in June, is housed in a stunning building on the waterfront, with a 3,000-piece collection devoted to Glasgow's rich shipbuilding and engineering past. Its location, along the River Clyde, was once home to many shipyards, and considered the economic heart of Glasgow. But when the industry left, the area stagnated.
Not anymore. Glasgow has spent more than a decade redeveloping 130 acres of derelict shipyard and unused dockland in an effort to restore the waterway to its former glory. Now there's a pleasant riverside walkway with steel street furniture, cobblestones from Victorian Glasgow and maritime paraphernalia. Lime trees are planted on both sides of the esplanade, and there are bicycle paths throughout. A new ferry stop for the Riverside Museum, which just saw its one-millionth visitor, marks the first time in around 50 years that this section of the river has had regular passenger service.

13. Puebla, Mexico International mole festival. Need we say more?
PUB-DATE: May 5, 2012,
But the city's biggest draw might be its famous mole poblano. The city is inaugurating an international mole festival which will begin on May 2. Hopes are that it will attract celebrity chefs like Rick Bayless, who recently took staff members to Puebla's Mural de los Poblanos restaurant for their annual employee trip. FREDA MOON
14. San Diego With breweries and brewpubs, a sunny heaven for suds lovers. Slide Show
Even in times of tight budgets, finely crafted beer remains a relatively approachable luxury, and few American regions have more brewing momentum than San Diego County. Maybe it's time, then, to think about building a beer safari in the land of sunshine, fish tacos and hopped-up American IPAs. Long established craft breweries like Karl Strauss Brewing Company and the cheeky Stone Brewing Company have mentored brewmasters and created demand for some seriously offbeat ales.
The area has long been a hotbed of garage-based hobbyists, so it's no surprise that the region also has a tradition of dedicated home brewing. The result is a cluster of small breweries, like the tiny but soon-to-expand Hess Brewing.
And there are numerous opportunities for rigorous but never dour beer tastings, at staggeringly comprehensive shops like Bottlecraft Beer Shop & Tasting Room and Pizza Port Bottle Shop, as well as beer-obsessed taverns like Hamilton's and O'Brien's and restaurants like Local Habit. Those looking for full immersion can pack a stein for the fourth annual San Diego Beer Week in November. SARA DICKERMAN
15. Halong Bay, Vietnam New ways to visit a natural wonder in Southeast Asia. Slide Show
Though Halong Bay, a staggering seascape of some 1,600 limestone islands and islets in the Gulf of Tonkin, formed over millions of years, there's never been a better time to visit. In November, the Unesco World Heritage site was provisionally named one of the world's ''new seven wonders of nature'' based on a global poll conducted by the Swiss foundation New7Wonders -- just as Vietnam Airlines announced the first-ever nonstop flights between London and Vietnam. Largely untouched by humans and topped with thick jungle flora, the rock formations rise dramatically in conical peaks and pillars from the surrounding waters, which feature offshore coral reefs, freshwater swamps, mangrove forests and sandy beaches. Visitors can now reach what Ho Chi Minh himself called ''the wonder one cannot impart to others,'' on local junk boats, luxury cruises or a spate of new adventure tours offered by companies like InterAsia, World Expeditions and the Luxury Travel Group.

16. Florence, Italy A Renaissance city gets a contemporary kick.
Since 2009, Florence's youthful mayor, Matteo Renzi, has championed efforts to build a livable, living city that celebrates -- but is not yoked to -- its rich history (and historic riches). The result? An energized arts scene unfolding inside various medieval palazzi, ancient landmarks restored and reopened to the public for the first time in decades and restaurants abandoning traditional Tuscan staples for sophisticated contemporary food.
The grand 15th-century Palazzo Strozzi is now home to the Center for Contemporary Culture Strozzina and a destination for must-see events like the coming ''Americans in Florence: Sargent and the American Impressionists,'' which opens in March. Spazi Urbani Contemporanei, an arts space occupying a 15th-century former monastery, now features works from emerging Italian artists. Last year, the 148- foot-tall 14th-century San Niccolo tower reopened to the public with one of the best panoramic views of the city. And in September, the flagship Gucci Museum made its debut in the historic Palazzo della Mercanzia.
The city's stock of refined hotel offerings has also been elevated by the opulent new St. Regis Florence, which opened in a palatial riverside palazzo in May, and the Grand Hotel Villa Cora, another five-star stunner near the Boboli Gardens. Even the once-staid Florentine dining scene has been reborn with new restaurants like IO Osteria Personale and Ossi di Seppia.
Next for the Tuscan capital are plans to restore the banks of the Arno River and spruce up the city's largest park. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
17. St. Vincent A new resort may put this Caribbean island on the map.
The fact that American Airlines does not fly there could explain why St. Vincent remains among the Caribbean's best-kept secrets: a stunningly lush, unspoiled gem of an island surrounded by water cerulean enough to render that of other islands murky by comparison. What there is here -- a climbable volcano, dramatic waterfalls, black-sand beaches -- is dwarfed by what there isn't: chain stores, crowds, big hotels.
Except, that is, for one notably new exception. Buccament Bay, a five-star resort, opened in the fall and boasts more rooms, about 360, than all other hotels on the island combined. And there are the resort's five restaurants, a spa, a soccer camp and performing arts center. The resort, along with a new international airport that is scheduled to open in late 2013 and designed to handle five times the number of passengers currently arriving at the island, will most likely let the cat out of the bag and attract the long overdue crowds. Get there before they do. BAZ DREISINGER
18. Moganshan, China Luxury in the former mountain hideaway of Shanghai gangsters. Slide Show
For much of the early 20th century, Moganshan, a bamboo-covered mountain about three hours from Shanghai, served as a tranquil retreat for the elite. Wealthy foreigners took up residence on the mountain first, building stone villas and tennis courts. Then came the Chinese power brokers, including the Shanghai mob boss Du Yuesheng and the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek, who honeymooned here in 1927.
After a lull, the past decade has seen foreigners repopulating Moganshan's sleepy slopes, transforming old villas into homes and guesthouses. And in late 2011, the mountain went upscale with two new luxury properties. The 121-room eco-resort Naked Stables features tree-top villas with Jacuzzis set on balconies overlooking the mountains, and African-inspired ''earth huts'' built with environmentally friendly rammed-earth walls. Set on a tea plantation, the 40-room Le Passage Moganshan, which partly opened in December, takes its inspiration from Moganshan's historic manor homes, with century-old recycled wood floors and a magnificent garden planted with 12,000 rose bushes.

19. Birmingham, England Could England's second city be first in food?
Olive, the BBC's food magazine, recently startled British gourmands when it declared Birmingham, England's second largest city, the United Kingdom's ''foodiest town,'' ahead of London and Edinburgh. The award came last October, just as Birmingham was hosting an annual festival, the 10-day Birmingham Food Fest, which featured such local talents as Aktar Islam of Lasan Restaurant; up-and-comers like David Colcombe of Opus, Andy Waters of Edmunds Restaurant and Steve Love of Loves Restaurant; and a troika of Michelin-starred chefs: Glynn Purnell of Purnell's; Andreas Antona, Luke Tipping and Adam Bennett of Simpsons Restaurant; and Richard Turner of Turners of Harborne.
The chefs are building on an already rich dining scene. Birmingham is famous in Britain for its Balti Triangle, an area of town that is home to a beloved Pakistani-Kashmiri curry dish invented here; it is also birthplace to such classically British food items as Typhoo Tea, Bird's Custard and HP Sauce.

20. Space The final frontier now has a ticket agent.
It's not just the imaginings of science fiction geeks. Pretty soon anyone with $200,000 will be able to travel to the last frontier: space or -- more specifically -- the upper edge of Earth's atmosphere. In 2004 Richard Branson founded Virgin Galactic with the primary goal of pioneering commercial flights to space. Last year the company began test-flying SpaceShipTwo, an aircraft that will enable two pilots and six passengers to travel to suborbital space. Although no launch date has been confirmed (a 2012 date was pushed back to 2013), about 450 people from around the globe have already purchased tickets; the first passengers will be (surprise!) Richard Branson and his two children, Sam and Holly.
Flights will take off from the brand-new spaceport near Las Cruces, N.M., but Virgin Galactic ''Space Agent'' Joshua Bush of Park Avenue Travel in Philadelphia, predicts that in a few years ''We'll eventually be able to take off from New York, orbit the Earth and then land in Tokyo in two or three hours.'' What will it be like? ''After the rocket motor turns off there is complete silence,'' said Mr. Bush, who has read about the experiences of many astronauts. ''You look out the window and see a thin blue line of the atmosphere and comprehend how small and insignificant we are.'' GISELA WILLIAMS
21. Kerala, India A new Indian biennale will make its debut in this coastal state.
Last year India hosted its first pavilion at the Venice Biennale. This year the country inaugurates a biennale of its own. To be held in the southwestern state of Kerala, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale will feature contemporary painting, film, sculpture, installations, new media and performances by Indian and international artists. Most of the action will unfold in the colonial city of Kochi, whose contemporary art scene already offers more than a dozen venues, from the two-year-old David Hall -- a 1695 Dutch colonial mansion -- to the longstanding Kashi Art Cafe, a restaurant-gallery-garden-cafe. To host the events, the city's 19th-century Durbar Hall and other old buildings are getting top-to-bottom face-lifts.
But the most remarkable historical reclamation project is happening in the biennale's other Kerala site, Muziris. A fabled ancient port that traded spices and silk with Egypt and Greece two millennia ago, Muziris mysteriously vanished sometime after the fall of Rome. Archaeologists have recently located and started to excavate the vanished settlement, which opened to tourists this year. The biennale's start date is Dec. 12, 2012, or 12/12/12. SETH SHERWOOD
22. Paraty, Brazil Putting Brazil's Costa Verde on the cultural map. Slide Show
This peaceful hideaway is swiftly becoming the most culturally rich destination in Costa Verde, the 325-mile coastline between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Paraty's cultural calendar includes a three-year-old jazz, blues and soul festival organized by Sao Paulo's top live music venue, the Bourbon Street Music Club. Every June, acts like the American trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the Brazilian trombonist Raul de Souza bring their sounds to the historic quarter's cobblestone streets. Another recently inaugurated event is Paraty Em Foco, a yearly series of photography exhibits showcasing up-and-coming artists from Brazil and beyond. And there's Flip, a literary festival packed with readings, caipirinha-fueled parties and erudite stars like Ian McEwan, Isabel Allende and Salman Rushdie.
Paraty's other attractions include boutiques with tasteful handcrafts, cozy cafes, candlelit seafood restaurants and charming inns. The most stylish is Casa Turquesa, voted best new pousada of 2009 by Guia Quatro Rodas (Brazil's version of the Michelin guide). Late this year, Paraty will get its first high-profile luxury hotel. The French brand Maisons des Reves -- known for its chic Relais & Chateaux lodgings -- plans to open a property near the town's sailboat-lined harbor. PAOLA SINGER
23. Koh Rong, Cambodia A string of islands recalls an undiscovered Asian paradise. Slide Show
Many adventurous travelers are looking beyond the temples at Angkor to see what else Cambodia has to offer. One possibility is the Koh Rong Archipelago, whose main island is a 30-minute boat ride from the coastal town of Sihanoukville. Until recently there was no place to stay on this string of islands, but that changes with the opening of the Song Saa resort this year.
Rory Hunter, the owner, and his wife, Melita, discovered the untouched archipelago several years after they moved to Cambodia in 2004. Melita, previously an artist specializing in sculptural art installations, designed Song Saa to resemble a Cambodia fishing village -- at least from the outside. Inside guests will find luxurious contemporary comforts like an infinity pool and Wi-Fi complimented by Asian antiques and market finds, like large driftwood columns, old copper bowls, recycled boat timber walls and century-old Cambodian day beds. (For about $600 per person a night.)
Guests will be able to snorkel with sea horses by day and swim in bioluminescent waters at night. And then there's the food. The resort's chef, Neil Wager, imported from the exclusive North Island resort in the Seychelles, will be serving up his own version of local Khmer cuisine starring sustainable local seafood. GISELA WILLIAMS
24. Vienna
Modern art spruces up Austria's imperial capital.
After a flurry of activity, Vienna's venerable museum scene is prepped for a banner year. July marks the 150th birthday of its native son Gustav Klimt, the Vienna Secessionist master whose dreamily erotic gold-leaf paintings have become some of modernism's most popular (and expensive) works; in a range of exhibitions throughout 2012, more of his pieces will be on display in one place than ever before.
And in a city known for its starchy reluctance to change, two pre-eminent institutions have taken on ambitious new directors: Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, the influential former director of the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York, was announced as the new head of the sprawling Museum of Applied Arts, and the Museum of Modern Art reopened in September after extensive renovations and the appointment of a new director, the German curator Karola Kraus.
Last month, another modern art specialist, 20er Haus, reopened as 21er Haus, an exhibition space and cultural center presenting Austrian art from 1945 to the present. And a new high-profile collaboration, to make its debut this spring, will further strengthen the city's art scene: the contemporary art doyenne Francesca von Habsburg will lend both her keen artistic direction and considerable coffers to Augarten Contemporary at the Belvedere museum, set in a Baroque palace complex. The three-year project, called Thyssen-Bornemisza Augarten Contemporary, weds the Belvedere, one of the city's biggest public art institutions, with Ms. von Habsburg's private foundation, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary.

25. Chattanooga, Tenn. A city stages a comeback fueled by artists and retailers.
In 1969, Walter Cronkite famously called Chattanooga the ''dirtiest'' city in America. In recent years, though, it has undergone a dramatic overhaul with a radical gentrification plan and an aggressive citywide push to lure artists. In addition to a $120 million clean-up-and-invest 21st Century Waterfront Plan, an incentive program called Arts Move brings artists of all mediums into town; a yearly Southern arts fair called Four Bridges draws thousands each April; and several arts districts have been cultivated and nurtured.
On the heels of this artistic transformation has come the inevitable, yet not unwelcome, boutique boom in places like the recently restored Warehouse Row, a Civil War-era factory turned shopping center filled with local, upscale and artisanal goods. SARAH WILDMAN
26. Dakhla, Morocco In Morocco's south, an arty hideaway. Slide Show
Morocco's cool crowd doesn't want anyone else to discover this remote but strangely beautiful desert town on the Atlantic Coast of the Western Sahara, an area with a tumultuous history now governed by Morocco. On a 30-mile-long spit of sand between the ocean and a tranquil lagoon about 600 miles south of Marrakesh, the town is becoming one of the world's greatest wind- and kite-board surfing destinations.
But there's more to Dakhla than high-flying fun. Many come for its fledgling bohemian status: it's a wild, remote, sun-drenched place with a freewheeling atmosphere and plenty of local Tuareg culture. Water temperatures remain a constant 80 degrees year-round, the desert is a short trek away, and the locally caught seafood is delicious. Sleepy during the day thanks to the often intense Saharan heat, the town comes alive after dark with lively cafes and restaurants. Dakhla also finally has a place for nonbackpackers: the Calipau Sahara hotel, a modern riad that opened two years ago, with a long stretch of private beach and a seawater pool. And although part of Dakhla's charm is its relative inaccessibility, Royal Air Maroc offers daily flights from Casablanca. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
27. Maldives A cushy place for hard-core surfers? Here it is.
When one thinks of the Maldives, a necklace of 26 tropical atolls in the Indian Ocean, one might envision $2,000 suites on stilts over turquoise waters and honeymooners dining barefoot on the beach. But world-class surfers? Not so much. Think again. ''It's ideal,'' said Ross Phillips, founder of Tropicsurf, a leading outfitter in the high-end surfing scene. ''Good, consistent waves, warm water, a wide choice of five-star resorts and plenty of things to do for the partners who don't surf.'' This past summer six world champion surfers headed to the Maldives for what was billed as the world's most exclusive surfing event: Four Seasons Maldives Surfing Champions Trophy, which was held at the Four Seasons Kuda Huraa resort.
Early 2012 will see several new splashy resorts, like the Niyama, which has an underwater restaurant, and the Viceroy, 66 villas on the remote private island of Vagaru. GISELA WILLIAMS
28. Malacca, Malaysia A World Heritage site ramps up its tourism options. Slide Show
With its lantern-lighted canals and silent, narrow streets lined with decades-old ornate temples and shop houses, few places in Southeast Asia conjure romantic images of the past as effectively as Malacca, Malaysia's oldest city. A former Portuguese, Dutch and British colony, this Unesco World Heritage site is now attracting record numbers of tourists lured by its unusual architecture and cuisine, which reflect centuries of foreign influences.
More than seven million visitors are expected in 2011, so the town, about 90 miles southeast of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is welcoming new hotels like the Casa del Rio, a Portuguese-inspired luxury boutique property with 66 rooms; and Courtyard@Heeren, a 100-year-old shop house converted into a 14-room hotel. When you're not exploring places like the 17th-century former Dutch town hall or Jonker Street's antiques shops, gorge on Malacca's outstanding local specialties, like creamy, piquant nyonya laksa at the family-run Donald & Lily's. NAOMI LINDT
29. The Algarve Portugal's Riviera gets a new spate of luxury hotels.
The Algarve, on Portugal's southern coast, has long been a major package-holiday destination for northern Europeans. But the sun-drenched region is aiming to attract a wider crowd as it recycles itself with a crop of new or renovated luxury hotels emphasizing style, authenticity and eco-friendliness. In Portimao, a perfect example is the just reopened 38-room Hotel Bela Vista. This 1918 villa overlooking the famous seaside Praia da Rocha was renovated by the French hotelier Thierry Naidu and features a stunning design by the Portuguese decorator Graca Viterbo.
There are hotels opening in quieter areas of the Algarve, too, including the striking Martinhal resort in Sagres, and a Conrad hotel scheduled to open in November. Trendy Lisboans are also flocking to Olhao, a former fish-canning town turned resort with stylish lodging options, like the recently opened Real Marina Hotel & Spa, and natural attractions, including the Ria Formosa, a national park made up of one of the largest barrier-reef lagoons in Europe, where you might have the pristine beauty of white sand beaches to yourself -- for now, at least. ALEXANDER LOBRANO
30. Tahoe, Calif. New lifts, lodging, trails and snowcat rides.
Lake Tahoe's seven major ski areas have been undergoing a dizzying slate of improvements that will eventually tally at least $100 million. Most notable is Squaw Valley's November merger with adjacent Alpine Meadows; at 6,000 acres, it now offers the most ski terrain in the United States. Guests can take a free shuttle between base areas and will find, among other upgrades, new ski school services, expanded terrain parks, a kids' snow-play area with mini-snowmobiles, and new restaurants, including Rocker @ Squaw, a burger joint where skiers can upload their own helmet-cam videos to TV.
Improvements at Northstar, recently acquired by Vail Resorts, include a quad chairlift and an on-mountain restaurant with stellar views of the Pacific Crest. Advanced skiers can explore 170 acres of new gladed terrain or hop a snowcat to ski the Sawtooth Ridge. Likewise, Sierra-at-Tahoe introduced snowcat rides to Huckleberry Canyon. Kirkwood renovated its Mountain Club hotel and Heavenly added three trails, a children's ski school center and a kids' trail. CINDY HIRSCHFELD
31. Wales A new hiking path brings new views of rugged shores.
Wales's many hiking trails are known for their views of rugged highlands and cliff-hemmed coasts. Exploring the country by foot will become easier in May, when the Wales Coast Path is completed, connecting several disparate paths and creating a 1,030-mile pedestrian route that rings the country. The Wales Coast Path -- which in stretches will be open to cyclists and horseback riders -- follows the Atlantic and the Irish Sea over the length of the country, passing medieval castles and threading through cities including Cardiff and seaside resort towns like Tenby.
While few will have the legs to tackle the entire trail, outfitters including Celtic Trails and Contours Walking Holidays lighten the load by offering inn-to-inn luggage shuttles over several portions of the long distance path. ELAINE GLUSAC
32. Antarctica Still remote and exotic. Now luxurious too.
A hundred years ago the race to the South Pole held the world in thrall -- poor Robert Falcon Scott lost the title as the first man there, by a month, to the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, and died on his way back through the unforgiving landscape.
The 100-year anniversary of the arrival of these rugged explorers is a reminder of our continued fascination with a region that remains in many ways as remote, exotic and evocative as it ever was. White Desert is marking the event with a new camp that allows travelers to spend the night in accommodations that Amundsen and Scott could only have dreamed of: fiberglass pods with en-suite bathrooms, dressing rooms and comfy beds. During the day, groups (limited to 12 ) pass the time ice climbing, abseiling through open crevasses, kite skiing and visiting colonies of Emperor penguins.
Another way to see the icy scapes is by ship: Abercrombie & Kent's Le Boreal, for example, can navigate some of the smaller fjords and has onboard experts who lecture on everything from wildlife to the history of the region.
Luckily though, the number of overall visitors will remain restricted, guaranteeing, it is hoped, at least another 100 years of relative isolation and pristine wilderness. ONDINE COHANE
33. Uganda Stability and sustainable tourism restore luster to Africa's pearl.
Marred by the murderous regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, Uganda remained largely off the typical African safari tour map. But after more than two decades of relative stability under President Yoweri Museveni, the country that Winston Churchill called the ''pearl of Africa'' is regaining some of its allure for tourists.
While Uganda has not been without problems, including twin bombings in Kampala during the 2010 World Cup, some street clashes during political protests last year and a history of extreme antagonism toward gay people, it's still considered one of the more stable countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The country is perhaps best known to tourists as the home of half of the world's last remaining mountain gorillas, and this year there are more opportunities to spot the elusive creatures. The Uganda Wildlife Authority recently added two gorilla families to the groups it tracks on tours in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, a Unesco World Heritage site in southwest Uganda. Sanctuary Gorilla Forest Camp, a luxury tented camp inside the forest, is working with the Batwa Pygmy tribe, indigenous hunter-gatherers who were relocated when the park was established, to share their history and culture with guests. And Country Walkers , based in Waterbury, Vt., is offering its first safari ever in Uganda.
Beyond up-close gorilla encounters, Uganda is also the source of the Nile, boasts mountains that are among the highest in Africa -- the Mountains of the Moon in Rwenzori Mountains National Park -- and offers formidable white-water rapids for thrill seekers. MICHELLE HIGGINS
34. Ukraine Virginal beaches and czarist palaces -- at Old World prices.
Ukraine has finally seen an influx of much-needed cash to fund its long underdeveloped tourism sector, in part thanks to its selection as a co-host of the 2012 Union of European Football Associations European Championship. Beautiful, historic cities like Kiev, Odessa and Lviv have seen modernization, restoration and fresh cultural energy, but are still cheap, laid-back and largely free of tourist traps. All three cities have revamped their airports and added numerous hotels, restaurants and retail outlets, while new roadwork makes travel outside the city centers easier and more comfortable.
Beach lovers are well advised to head to the Black Sea coast, which extends along the Crimean Peninsula to Odessa. Long a popular beach destination for Russians, the area has slowly begun attracting a wider audience with its pristine beaches, mild climate, jutting cliffs and architectural marvels. CHARLY WILDER
35. Samana Peninsula, Dominican Republic Unspoiled beaches, but not for long.
For years, the Samana Peninsula on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic was one of the Caribbean's remaining natural holdouts, largely untouched because of its remote location. But an international airport, El Catey, built near the peninsula's base a few years ago and, more recently, a highway that shortened the drive from Santo Domingo to two hours from five, are bringing new development.
Balcones del Atlaantico, a RockResort that opened last May in the village of Las Terrenas, is the newest luxury resort on the peninsula. Its 86 two- and three-bedroom villas start at $500 a night, supplying a cushy base from which to explore ecotourism. The Peninsula House, a plantation-style estate with just six suites from $580 a night, was named a 2011 Grand Award winner by Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report. And Auberge Resort's' Casa Tropicalia , with 44 beachfront suites and an open-air spa on Samana Bay, is to open in 2014.
There are plenty of off-resort attractions, too. Just last month, Bavaro Runners, an adventure tour operator, opened a new zip-line tour consisting of 20 platforms and 10 zip-lines.
Go now, before the crowds arrive. MICHELLE HIGGINS
36. Dubrovnik, Croatia The St.-Tropez of the Balkans, equal parts classic and modern.
The last five years have been good to Dubrovnik: as it has opened to Western tourists, its number of visitors has climbed steadily -- around 10 percent a year -- since the global recession hit in 2008. Often called the Jewel of the Adriatic, this seaside city features marble streets, Renaissance fountains and white sand beaches. It has also recently completed an expansion of its airport and a sleek renovation of its cable car system, offering improved city access and views.
Meanwhile, local hoteliers compete to capture the growing stream of high-end tourists, with the 17th-century Pucic Palace , the upscale Excelsior Hotel & Spa and the gorgeous clifftop Villa Dubrovnik all seeing extensive renovations in the last few years. Newer culinary draws include the French-fusion spot Gil's, the two-year-old Panorama and Lucin Kantun, a Croatian tapas restaurant that opened last year in the Old Town. CHARLY WILDER
37. Chiloe Island, Chile A new look, and controversy, on the edge of South America. Slide Show
Just off the west coast of Chile, where the land starts to look as if it had been broken apart by a jackhammer, Chiloe Island -- known for its stilt houses, Unesco-anointed churches , nature preserves, unusual wildlife and raw natural beauty -- is getting a facelift. Until recently, the 3,200-square-mile island was mainly a respite for locals. But President Sebastian Pinera has plans to share the island with the rest of the world.
The Chilean government has started pouring billions of pesos into the island's infrastructure and the results are already evident: new paved roads, a new ferry terminal and the soon-to-open Mocopulli Airport in the town of Castro, which will offer direct flights to Santiago. The Chilean power company Ecopower has plans to build a 56-turbine wind farm, which is expected to produce three times the island's power needs. Once construction begins, however, the island could lose many of its migratory birds, penguins and endangered blue whales, environmental groups have cautioned. In other words, the time to go is now. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
38. Jordan New flights and a new modernist airport ease the way for visitors.
It might seem foolhardy for an airline to add a Middle East destination just as much of the Arab world is in political turmoil. But the airline is easyJet, known for its forays into unexpected markets, and the country is Jordan, which has mostly been spared the kind of protests that have toppled leaders elsewhere.
Why get on board? Starting this summer, travelers will be able to disembark at the new state-of-the-art terminal of Queen Alia airport. Designed by Sir Norman Foster using desert and Middle Eastern motifs, the building is a fitting welcome to a country that is trying to modernize while maintaining its natural beauty and traditions.
From there, head to the infinity pool of the new DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in the Red Sea resort of Aqaba. It's a soothing way to wind down after a camel expedition through the Mars-like landscape of nearby Wadi Rum, a 285-square-mile expanse of desert punctuated by wind-eroded rock formations. The region -- ''vast, echoing and God-like,'' in the words of Lawrence of Arabia -- was named a Unesco World Heritage site last year. SETH SHERWOOD
39. Crans-Montana, Switzerland Restaurants and luxury chalets shine a light on an Alpine resort.
Surprisingly few international tourists visit Crans-Montana, favoring better-known Alpine resorts like Zermatt and Verbier to see and be seen. But with its upmarket designer shops, five-star hotels, Michelin-starred dining and 87 miles of downhill slopes, the word is getting out.
Perched high above the Rhone Valley in western Switzerland on a sunny, south-facing plateau, the two-town resort offers panoramic views of the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. With more than 250 boutiques, 60 restaurants and 30 hotels, Crans-Montana isn't lacking for apres-ski activities. And new flights from the charter airline Snowjet from London Stansted to Sion airport, about 19 miles from the resort, are making it easier to be on the slopes within an hour of stepping off the plane.
Abercrombie & Kent Villas, a division of the luxury tour company, has taken notice, adding the destination to its collection of luxury ski chalets this season. Weekly rental rates at one of its five 2,700-square-foot chalets, each featuring a Jacuzzi and wine cellar, start at 3,936 euros (about $5,085) for a four-bedroom.
The mountain resort is also celebrated for being the host of the Omega European Masters, among Europe's largest golf events, every September at one of the highest 18-hole golf courses in the Alps, the Severiano Ballesteros. Last year, the Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club opened the first year-round high-altitude European golf training center so avid duffers can practice their swing despite the snow. MICHELLE HIGGINS
40. Montpellier, France France's eighth-largest city is dressing up in designer style.
The most celebrated architect in France, Jean Nouvel, and a collaborator, Francois Fontes, introduced their blue and cube-like city hall in November, and early next year Mr. Nouvel's RBC Design Center -- another coolly modernist structure that will house the RBC brand's furniture showroom -- is to open its doors in this medieval, student-filled Mediterranean city.
Even more innovative, the long-awaited Pierres Vives Building from the star architect Zaha Hadid will be ready by year's end. A long, sprawling edifice of swirly white concrete layers and green-tinted glass, the futuristic structure will hold a library, archives and municipal offices.
And to reach them, the city is installing what may be Europe's sexiest tram system. The two existing lines sport exteriors of kaleidoscopic birds and flowers by Christian Lacroix, and two new lines with Mr. Lacroix's trademark color-soaked style are on their way. Both will make their debut this spring with an underwater design theme and a solar theme, respectively, along roughly 17 miles of new track. Think of it as France's longest fashion runway. SETH SHERWOOD
41. Nosara, Costa Rica Surfing geeks have descended on a remote little town.
With sandy beaches, warm, jade-green waters and rolling waves that rarely get too big, the remote jungle community of Nosara on the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica has become the ideal spot to learn to surf. The crescent-shaped Guiones beach is a good jumping-off point to go hiking or visit the nearby turtle refuge, and there are small, charming hotels and local bars with live music. But in a place that sees sunny, rainless weather from December to May, surfing's the thing.
Surf schools have popped up all over town, including Surf Simply, which focuses on a technical, sports-coach philosophy and has a new guided trip option along the coast for its 2012 surf programs, and Safari Surf School , an official Billabong-certified surf camp. Nosara Surf Cam offers a real-time Web feed of the waves. Take a look and get your stoke on. BONNIE TSUI
42. South Korea Is golf's newest hot spot in Asia?
South Korea is redefining just how luxurious golf resorts can be. A slew of new private clubs -- the kind with six-digit membership fees, designs by celebrity architects and clubhouses that look like modern art museums -- have opened recently in the country.
The most prestigious is Haesley Nine Bridges, just outside Seoul, with a clubhouse covered by a huge, sinuous web of wooden beams (it also features one of Jeff Koons's giant balloon toy sculptures).
Then there's the Ananti Club, also a commuter's distance from Seoul: 486 acres containing three courses nestled in the Yumyeongsan forest, with a clubhouse, designed by the architect Ken Min, built almost entirely underground. And the futuristic Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, which opened last year in the financial center of Songdo, has a huge, undulating clubhouse designed by the California architect Mehrdad Yazdani.
In 2015, South Korea will be the host of the Presidents Cup for the first time; apparently there are some tournament-worthy courses to go with all those fancy new clubhouses. DANIELLE PERGAMENT
43. Lodz, Poland The Hollywood of Poland reclaims its industrial past.
Poland's third-largest city and the movie-making headquarters of the country (with a film school that started the careers of Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wajda), Lodz has seen its labyrinth of textile warehouses and industrial-era relics repurposed for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.
The latest is by the director David Lynch, who has a deal to establish a major film studio in a former 19th-century power plant in the city. Its makeover -- which will also include a planetarium, a library, an exhibition space and a theater -- is scheduled to be shown to the public in 2014. Additionally, the architect Frank Gehry, whose grandparents were from Lodz, is in talks to design a festival and congress center with an avant-garde, building-block shape.
These ventures will be in good company. One Lodz weaving mill is now a retail and entertainment center called Manufaktura, while another, Ms2, is a three-year-old contemporary art museum filled with experimental leanings. A 19th-century industrial complex has been reborn as an art incubator, Lodz Art Center, that is the host of lectures and festivals. RACHEL B. DOYLE
44. Dalarna, Sweden A storied region offers a getaway from Stockholm.
Most travelers know Sweden only for the urban cool of Stockholm and Gothenburg. But when the sun approaches its summer apex, city dwellers often leave town for one of the country's central provinces, Dalarna. Its deep forests and glimmering lakes host traditional midsummer parties, and every brick-red farmhouse deserves its own postcard. With Dalarna's southern edge only about 125 miles from the capital, getting there -- by car, bus or rail -- is easy enough, though the rustic landscape of ''the Dales,'' as Dalarna translates, can feel worlds apart.
That's made it a natural respite for Swedish painters like Anders Zorn, whose home in the town of Mora is now a museum. Artisans still produce traditional handicrafts like the Dala Horse, a national mascot. But Dalarna is not just for summer journeys: every March, the region hosts the Vasaloppet, one of the world's biggest cross-country ski races, and autumn brings incredible foliage and rich game dishes at restaurants of surprising sophistication like the Dala-Husby Hotell.

45. Portovenere, Italy Stepping in while the Cinque Terre rebuilds. Slide Show
In late October, torrential rain caused catastrophic mudslides and flooding that devastated Monterosso and Vernazza, two of the cliff-clinging, seaside villages in the famed Cinque Terre on Italy's northwestern coast.
Though the towns are slowly being rebuilt, travelers seeking the pleasures of the area in 2012 should instead consider Portovenere, an equally charming, though largely overlooked, town just south of the Cinque Terre.
Like its more famous neighbors, Portovenere is a traditional fishing village with a picturesque jumble of pastel houses, boats bobbing in the harbor and a network of meandering hiking trails. But here, crowds are sparse, so poke around the 13th-century, black-and-white striated church in peace, before marveling at the views across the glittering Bay of La Spezia, which has long inspired poets and writers, from Lord Byron to D.H. Lawrence. INGRID K. WILLIAMS
Correction: January 22, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article on Jan. 8 about 45 places to go in 2012 contained errors in the entries for 4, 20, 34 and 37, about London, space, Ukraine and Chiloe Island, Chile.
The Charles Dickens Museum in London is now open; it is not reopening in time for the author's 200th birthday, Feb. 7. Because of an editing error, both the Waldorf-Astoria hotel and Heathrow Airport were described as being east of London; they are west of the city.
The location of the spaceport from which Virgin Galactic flights into space will depart is about 55 miles north of Las Cruces, N.M.; it is not in Las Cruces.
Ukraine is a co-host of the Union of European Football Associations Championship, not the host.
And a wind turbine project in Chiloe Island, Chile, is expected to produce three times the island's power needs; it will not triple the island's power needs.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2012

 CORRECTION:
The cover article on Jan. 8 about 45 places to go in 2012 misspelled the name of an adventure tour operator on the Samana Peninsula of the Dominican Republic. It is Bavaro Runners, not Bravaro.

HEADLINE: The Art of Bargaining, So Lost Upon Washington

BYLINE: By RICHARD H. THALER. 
Richard H. Thaler is a professor of economics and behavioral science at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. He has informally advised the Obama administration.

 BODY:
ALMOST everyone agrees about one thing these days: Congress is malfunctioning. To help our representatives escape from their current morass, I suggest that they read ''An Essay on Bargaining,'' the classic 1956 article by Thomas Schelling, the Nobel laureate economist. It is profound, and it doesn't contain a single equation.
The article's primary theme is that the key to success in many bargaining situations is the ability to commit to a future course of action. In this analysis, the Senate ''won'' the payroll tax cut showdown late last year by passing a bill and then going home for the holidays. This was a highly credible ''take it or leave it'' offer.
This ability to commit can help solve games in which the two players must choose between strategies: either they cooperate or they ''defect,'' as a decision not to cooperate is called in the literature. They are much better off if they both cooperate, but there is always a temptation to defect when the other player cooperates, scoring a big win at the other player's expense. 
When this game is played repeatedly, a natural -- and often successful -- strategy is called tit for tat. You begin by cooperating, hoping for the best. If the other side cooperates, too, all is good. But if it defects, you retaliate. And once the retaliating starts, it is hard to stop.
When I asked a former Republican senate staff member to explain why so many qualified Obama administration nominees were being denied confirmation hearings, he told me, ''We are tatting.''
Last year has to be one of the worst episodes of senatorial tatting in history. Extraordinary nominees like Peter A. Diamond, the Nobel laureate economist who was nominated twice to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a leading authority on evidence-based medicine, nominated to head Medicare and Medicaid, never got an up-or-down vote. (Dr. Berwick served for a while after receiving a recess appointment.)
Turning down such experts' offers to help is like declining an offer from Phil Jackson to help coach your high school's basketball team.
Even more worrisome was the failure to confirm Richard Cordray, a former Ohio attorney general, to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. In this case, many Senate Republicans did not deny that he was qualified; they said they just didn't like the agency and refused to confirm anyone to run it. The president has responded by making an unusual type of recess appointment of Mr. Cordray. Republicans are furious because they thought they had blocked such a move by holding ''pro forma'' sessions, in which the sole business conducted was to adjourn for a few days. Expect each side to argue that the other is behaving unreasonably.
Perhaps the refusal to confirm Mr. Cordray was simply follow-through on the publicly stated goal of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, to assure that President Obama is a one-term president.
But I have a question for Senator McConnell: If you achieve your goal and a Republican is elected president. what will happen then? Won't Senate Democrats take it up a notch? If they don't like the new president's foreign policy, for example, they could refuse to confirm a secretary of defense, citing the Cordray case as a precedent, and leading to either more recess appointments or 24/7 sessions for the Senate.
Clearly, we must find a way to avoid this escalation of retaliation. Professor Schelling's teachings suggest that to gain a new cooperative equilibrium in the Senate, both sides must be able to make credible commitments to cooperate in the future. And right now is a propitious time to strike a deal, as neither party can be sure who'll be in charge in 2013. So I urge Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, to seek a Senate rule change so all presidential appointees get an up-or-down vote within 90 days of nomination or gain automatic confirmation.
Yes, the Republicans could block this bill with a filibuster, but if they really think they can win the presidency, shouldn't they be willing to trade a year of allowing Mr. Obama's appointees a chance to serve for an assurance that they'd get the same treatment when in power?
After the bill was passed, neither side could change it without overcoming another filibuster, so it would most likely stick; it would be a commitment. Individual senators who can now block any appointment at their whim would lose power, of course, but the country would be a big winner. (The nonpartisan group NoLabels.org supports this idea.)
President Obama has some negotiating decisions ahead, too. Regardless of whether the payroll tax cut is extended, the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012, and $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts would begin to kick in, hitting military spending especially hard. From a bargaining-theory perspective, it's important that these are the default options: it will take the agreement of Congress and the president to avoid these changes. And remember that no matter what happens in November, President Obama and the current Congress will still be in power on New Year's Eve.
This puts the president in a very strong bargaining position. Though he and both parties in Congress would prefer to avoid the consequences of inaction, it's safe to say that Republicans would especially hate the expiration of the Bush tax cuts because the rich would take the hardest hit. Keep in mind that once the tax cuts expired, it would take a new bill in 2013 to reinstate them, and even if the Republicans won the presidency and both houses of Congress, they would still need 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster.
How should President Obama play this powerful hand? This could be his last chance, at least for this term, to strike the grand bargain he so wants. Again, while the two parties have their differences, there are some zones of agreement. We all know it's possible to lower tax rates and keep revenue constant by reducing deductions and loopholes. Certainly, no one -- aside from some tax accountants -- thinks our tax system is close to perfect. An agreement can be reached only as part of a substantial tax reform.
My suggestion would be for the president to first propose his own plan, borrowing some concepts from the Bowles-Simpson commission, and then to challenge members of Congress to come up with something they like better. But he must list conditions that have to be satisfied if he is to sign the bill.
Professor Schelling teaches that the best ''lines in the sand'' are for principles, not for arbitrary numbers. One such principle might be the so-called ''Buffett rule,'' that the rich should not pay a lower proportion of income in taxes than their secretaries. But whatever principles the president chooses, he must make everyone believe that he will keep his word and veto any bill that does not include these features.
I think that he can make such a pledge credible. If he loses the election, why not go out in a blaze of principled glory? And if he wins, he will want to begin his second term on a strong and constructive note.

HEADLINE: The Crisis You Don't Know

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is the co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
One great way to start a bar fight during an American Economic Association conference is to claim that the U.S. economy is preferable to Europe's. Someone will undoubtedly start quarreling about how G.D.P. per capita doesn't measure a person's happiness. Someone else may point out that if you look at income inequality and entitlements, the average European is doing much better.
But G.D.P. per capita (an insufficient indicator, but one most economists use) in the U.S. is nearly 50 percent higher than it is in Europe. Even Europe's best-performing large country, Germany, is about 20 percent poorer than the U.S. on a per-person basis (and both countries have roughly 15 percent of their populations living below the poverty line). While Norway and Sweden are richer than the U.S., on average, they are more comparable to wealthy American microeconomies like Washington, D.C., or parts of Connecticut -- both of which are actually considerably wealthier. A reporter in Greece once complained after I compared her country to Mississippi, America's poorest state. She's right: the comparison isn't fair. The average Mississippian is richer than the average Greek. 
Europe is undergoing not one but two simultaneous economic crises. The first is a rapid, obvious one -- all about sovereign debt, a collapsing currency and austerity measures -- that we hear about all the time. The second is insidious but more important. After decades of trying, Europe as a whole still can't quite figure out how to be flexible enough to compete in the global economy.
The story of how Europe lost its flexibility can be told in three stages. First came rapid growth that economists called ''convergence.'' With a lot of help from the U.S., Europe developed massive industrial capacity in the postwar years. Many of Western Europe's economies grew so fast that governments could easily afford health and unemployment insurance and other benefits that, by U.S. standards, were remarkably generous. Most observers expected that its wealth would soon ''converge'' upon that of the U.S.
But the European economy did not recover from the worldwide oil shock of 1973 nearly as quickly as its American counterpart. For more than 25 years (phase two), as its population aged, Europe's economy grew more slowly than the United States'. Its active capitals belied bloated businesses that were losing contracts to U.S. competitors or growing suburban ghettos filled with a permanently unemployed underclass.
Even its major successes -- like Germany's impressive machine-tool and automotive-industrial sectors -- were refinements of old ways of making money rather than innovations in new industries. Western Europe played a remarkably small role in the computer and Internet revolutions. (On the other hand, Estonia, with less than two million people, gave the world Skype.) When the economic forecasts were written during Europe's doldrums, the Continent looked destined to become a decrepit old-age home with too few young people around to pay the bills.
Enter phase three: what might be called the Principled Compromise. Increasingly since the mid-1990s, European leaders have been trying to figure out how to keep up with this new globalized digital economy. To compete with the U.S., China, India and Brazil, Europe focused more intently on broadening its internal market. It's easier for businesses to stay competitive when there are a few hundred million potential customers using the same currency and not requiring customs forms.
To many American eyes, however, Europe's creation of a common market and currency was only half the battle -- and probably the less important half. It's a core view of U.S. business that success requires a degree of destruction. If workers can't be fired, companies can't drop unproductive businesses and invest in more promising new ones. If workers know they'll get generous government benefits no matter what, so the theory goes, they'll get lazy.
But just as the U.S. was dismantling much of its welfare system -- replacing it with the welfare-to-work reforms of the mid-1990s -- Europe was (somewhat nobly) trying to show that an economy can be humane and competitive. In 1994, Denmark modernized a system, which came to be known as ''flexicurity,'' that offered American-style flexibility (layoffs, transitions into new lines of business) coupled with traditional European security. Laid-off workers were offered generous benefits, like 90 percent of their last salary for two years and opportunities to be retrained.
And it worked incredibly well. After Denmark's unemployment rate sank to among the lowest in the world, the flexicurity model spread throughout Europe. It has been successfully implemented, in locally appropriate ways, in Norway, Sweden and Finland. But in other countries -- like Germany, France and Spain -- similar reforms faced stiff resistance from workers who preferred the old way. Several countries applied the measures in a two-tier system: people who already had jobs were protected by pretty much the same old rules, while the unemployed -- who were often younger -- were offered less secure work at lower pay. Greek unions insisted on so much security and so little flexibility that now the country has neither. Flexibility has done little to help Italy, which remains effectively two countries. There is a rich nation in the north where workers earn great salaries in highly productive and competitive industries; many people south of Rome are living in a broken, developing economy that's considerably poorer than Greece.
Many now believe that Europe's decision to create a common currency ended up pushing much of the Continent further behind. Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal would arguably be much better off if they could simply devalue their old currencies and sell exports at a relative discount. Instead, they're stuck with a euro whose value is largely based on their more successful neighbors. The U.S. is in no position to gloat, but our basic mechanisms of competitiveness are still in place. We'll grow again. We just need to figure out how to distribute the spoils. And Europe, we once thought, was supposed to teach us how to do this.
European leaders like to mock the U.S. for its inequality and lack of social safety net. Though, for now, it looks as if Europe is headed for a two-tier society without any plan for improving the lot of the lower tier. How can Brussels excite a generation of ambitious young people -- the ones who will determine Europe's future success -- when too many of them are offered low-wage, short-term work in stagnant industries to pay for the far more generous benefits their elders receive? How can Europe compete if its youth experience the flexibility while the old get the security?
Deep thoughts this week: 1. Europe has been experiencing an economic crisis for longer than you thought. 2. It's pretty hard to promote competitiveness in a place where cheesemakers still qualify for early retirement. 3. The euro: it seemed like a good idea at the time.

HEADLINE: Healthy Options Vs. Economic Realities

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''I Just Got Here, but I Know Trouble When I See It'' (Economic View, Jan. 1), in which six economists looked at the issues of 2012: 
One of the economists, Richard H. Thaler, suggested that companies fight rising health care costs by establishing their own health and nutrition programs. But I respond as a business owner who knows what's realistic today.
I am the third-generation owner of a 96-employee company -- a mix of white-collar and blue-collar workers in the construction industry. Only twice in the last 10 years have we been able to avoid any increase in our health care costs. All other years had double-digit increases, some more than 20 percent.
We care about our employees' health and have offered many programs to promote it. We have had ''Biggest Loser'' contests that rewarded money to participants, and have offered health fairs, flu shots and stop-smoking classes. But we have also found that healthy foods in vending machines have weak sales at best, and we recently removed an on-site workout room because it was used only minimally.
Unfortunately, many businesses today are short-staffed. There is no extra time for exercise during work and at lunchtime. Many hourly employees are working second jobs, if they can find them, reducing the time they can spend on improving their health. Meanwhile, employers lack government incentives, in the form of tax credits, to offer good-health programs.
Simply put, these are the realities -- and, meanwhile, our insurance costs have recently risen again. Adam Lewin

The writer is president of the Hamilton Parker Company.
To the Editor:
I laughed when I first saw the illustration that accompanied the column, showing the New Year's baby crying over the 2012 economy. Then I realized that the baby might represent the 99 percent of Americans who are struggling in these difficult times. The other 1 percent, including the bankers who caused the financial crisis, are smiling as they read their year-end financial statements.
This year, we can look forward to more political influence by corporations and the wealthy, thanks to a few Supreme Court justices and to potential cuts to vital social safety programs. Now I feel like shedding a few tears, too -- for the plundering of our democracy and the plight of the poor and the middle class.

HEADLINE: Primed for a Celebration, But Restraint Still Prevails

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
AS final touches are applied to carmakers' displays ahead of the opening of the 2012 North American International Auto Show, the auto industry has good reason to celebrate.
With 12.8 million vehicles sold in the United States in 2011, it was the industry's highest-volume sales year since 2008. The Detroit automakers each finished in the black for the full year -- the first time that has happened since 2004.
Monday's start of two press preview days at Cobo Center in Detroit will no doubt bring reminders from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors that each gained market share for the year. Analysts contacted for this article could not remember the last time that happened. 
Optimism is growing for success in 2012, too. Forecasters queried by Automotive News, an industry publication, said that sales volume could exceed 13.6 million in the new year.
The organizers of the Detroit exhibition, the Detroit Auto Dealers Association -- which is renewing its contract to keep the show at Cobo Center through 2017 -- are suggesting that this will be the best showcase here since 2008.
''Re: the strength of the show, we are in a great position,'' Marc Harlow, a spokesman for the show, wrote in an e-mail. ''On the global stage, the N.A.I.A.S. remains one of the major players, with about 40 vehicle introductions this year.''
Still, it may be a bit early to schedule Champagne showers. Clouds hover over the industry, the city and the auto show.
Despite renewed hiring by the area's resurgent auto industry, the local economy remains as bleak as the surrounding landscape. Vast swaths of downtown are vacant; the 2010 census found the city's population had shrunk to 713,777 from a high of nearly 2 million in the 1950s, at the peak of the American auto industry's hegemony.
Notwithstanding talk of yet another downtown renaissance -- following similar pronouncements in the 1970s and 1990s -- Detroit remains in harrowing financial shape. Mayor Dave Bing, the former professional basketball player, rebuffed recent suggestions that the state of Michigan should seize control of the city's operations.
In 2009, a new regional authority took control of the convention center. A $288 million expansion plan was subsequently rejected in favor of almost $200 million in repairs, updates and reconfiguration of the half-century-old complex.
Damage to Cobo had threatened the 2009 show; many automakers suggested the time had come to move to a different venue. Automakers including Porsche, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, Suzuki, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Infiniti did not bother with displays at the show.
Some have since returned -- most notably Nissan and Infiniti this year -- although Land Rover and Jaguar have snubbed Detroit to attend the 2012 New Delhi auto show instead.
Meanwhile, the renovation of the American auto industry remains a work in progress.
The federal government, which oversaw the reorganization of G.M. and Chrysler in 2009, still owns 26 percent -- 500 million shares -- of G.M. stock. Despite shedding billions of dollars of debt in bankruptcy, financial obligations remain, including a pension plan that is underfunded by at least $22 billion. The chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, ordered thermostats lowered this winter to further pinch pennies.
Though Chrysler repaid its federal loans last year, the Fiat Group of Italy now controls the company. In an unexpected twist, Fiat, struggling in Europe, is actually being buoyed by Chrysler's profits. And Ford, the only one of the Detroit 3 to eschew a federal bailout, is likewise seeing its profit-generating North American earnings dragged down by losses in Europe.
But after four years of cutbacks throughout the auto industry, Detroit's hometown show has, like the industry it serves, diminished in both size and international stature.
Consider it a sensible-shoes kind of show, featuring downsized sedans, people movers, hybrids and customized compacts.
The lavish, multimillion-dollar displays, impractically wild and exotic concept cars, smoke machines and Champagne fountains of yesteryear are, for the most part, just memories.
The 40 ''world premieres'' constitute a rather modest display of lowered expectations, from a vehicular standpoint. Almost no major introductions are planned for the types of fire-breathing, high-horsepower machines that once made Detroit famous, though there will be a shapely Lexus sport coupe, the LF-LC, and Mercedes-Benz will unveil a new high-tech SL550 two-seater.
Small is no longer a bad word: G.M.'s brands are presenting a compact Buick Encore crossover sport utility; Cadillac will show its new, smallest sedan, the ATS; and Chevy will offer a souped-up RS version of its Sonic subcompact.
Ford is rolling out a revamped version of its Fusion midsize sedan. Also on tap are two new compact hybrid crossovers in its C-Max line. Dodge is bringing back the Dart name for a new small sedan based on an Alfa Romeo Giulietta, one of Fiat's brands, to replace the Dodge Caliber.
Japanese automakers, after a dismal 2011 disrupted by earthquakes, a tsunami and nuclear emergencies in their homeland; floods devastating their suppliers in Thailand; and seemingly endless quality and safety recalls in the U.S., are looking at Detroit for their own sort of renaissance.
Toyota, which was cleared by a 2011 federal study of unintended acceleration accusations, is emphasizing improved hybrid propulsion systems here for its sedans, hatchbacks and even small sports cars. Its Scion division will introduce a rear-drive sporty coupe, the FR-S.
Nissan returns to show off the latest Pathfinder, its enduringly popular sport utility vehicle. And Honda, along with its luxury brand, Acura, is trying to re-energize its lineup with new sedans, crossovers and a powerful hybrid sports car.
The Korean automakers, Hyundai and Kia, are still celebrating their record sales in 2011 -- if not by introducing so many new vehicles, then in sponsoring some of the more exuberant parties during the week of press previews.
Only the Europeans seem to be holding back, perhaps waiting to see if American automotive tastes are really becoming more conservative.
Mercedes-Benz is showing two E-Class hybrids here, even though they may not be sold, at least initially, in this country. BMW is giving American audiences their first look at its new 3 Series compact sedan. Audi has a small crossover concept.
Volkswagen will show a Jetta hybrid and a whimsical electric design study. Porsche, which is returning to Cobo after several years away, will offer convertible versions of its latest 911.

HEADLINE: Just Tell Me How to Join the Club

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
WE'VE all been hearing about the 1 Percent -- you know, the nation's fat cats. This small percentage of wealthy Americans has been reviled by the Occupy Wall Street movement and liberal politicians alike.
They have been called greedy. They have been called destructive to our nation's sense of equality and justice. They have been called a risk to our future. The rich, in angry response, have stamped the floor -- threatening, in the process, to scuff their marvelously comfortable handmade leather shoes -- and pointed out that they are job creators, at least for Italian shoemakers.
Camping out in Zuccotti Park apparently didn't beat them. They appear to be rather entrenched. But all the shouting had me thinking long and hard about the big issues that the conflict raises, and now I'm left with just this question: How do I get in on some of that sweet 1 Percent action? 
First, I need to determine what the 1 Percent actually is. I checked with Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University, who told me that there is more than one way to look at the issue. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve, the minimum income required to become a member of the 1 Percent was $700,000 in 2010. But, Professor Wolff said, records from the Internal Revenue Service placed the bar at something closer to $400,000, which is ''probably more reasonable,'' he said.
I have to say that $400,000 seems a little anemic to me. A person making $400,000 a year is sort of rich, sure, but that figure doesn't make him sound filthy rich. At that income level, your manservant can't afford his own manservant, and you can't even own a single jet. So it seems to me that as long as I'm engaging in delusional thinking, I should aim for the upper end of the 1 Percent.
Sadly, it is becoming increasingly obvious that with my current income and investments, I won't even get to the lower estimate of the golden percentile. My investments' performance, such as it is, has been -- well, ''lackluster'' describes it best without resorting to cursing.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index ended 2011 at essentially the same place as it closed 2010, meaning that the money I poured into my index fund 401(k) essentially sat there like the fiscal equivalent of chopped liver for 12 months. And the gold coins I bought as a hedge against hard times at such a terrific price? They ended up being foil-wrapped chocolate Hanukkah gelt.
In climbing the income curve, I'll also have to make up for my own financial handicap: I don't actually know anything about economics. Or business.
That means if I'm going to climb from my status of genteel poverty into the vaunted one-tenth of the 1 Percent, I'll need some outside help.
So I e-mailed a certified rich person: Mark Cuban. Mr. Cuban is a billionaire, having made his fortune through entrepreneurship and smart investments; he owns a bundle of companies these days, including the Dallas Mavericks of the N.B.A. When I told him that I was hoping to get rich, he quickly responded with some advice. ''Easy answer,'' he wrote. ''Stop investing in mutual funds and depending on some kid in a gerbil cage running and trying to get ahead of his/her peers and instead pay off all of your debt, including your credit cards, and invest in yourself.''
Wow! This sounds so easy. I wasn't quite sure what investing in myself meant, aside from buying food. I did enjoy eating the gelt, but somehow I think that's not what he meant. So I asked Mr. Cuban to clarify, and he wrote back, ''start a business around something you are great at, and you have a chance to hit the 1 percent.''
This made sense, but it was also starting to depress me. The only thing I'm even reasonably good at is knocking paragraphs together. So far it hasn't gotten me that Gulfstream. So I brought this up, and he suggested that I give him money.
Well, what he actually did was mention that he wrote an e-book, ''How to Win at the Sport of Business: If I Can Do It, You Can Do It.'' As he explained, ''whipping together e-books that you can sell for three bucks a pop is quick, easy and a way to build a business that even reporters may be able to excel at.''
I thanked him, sort of, and realized that I might need to seek further advice. Since the easiest way to get rich is to choose your parents well, I tracked down Jamie Johnson, a filmmaker whose documentary, ''The One Percent,'' introduced many people to the private world of the very rich, with an embedded critique of so much concentrated wealth. Mr. Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, was the very model of noblesse oblige.
I told him of my plans and mentioned that his words of wisdom would appear in a humor column. He gamely told me that in order to make it in the world of truly enormous wealth, ''money has to be the single most important thing in your life.'' The very wealthy, he said, ''live in a culture of affluence: your friends, your neighbors, your colleagues, your associates are all vastly rich.''
I pondered this for a moment, then wondered aloud: ''Does this mean I have to upgrade my friends?''
He answered somberly, ''I think you have to upgrade your friends.''
What about my parents? I asked.
''It would be very helpful to upgrade your parents,'' he agreed.
That comment made a lot of sense. My parents, after all, didn't show the basic courtesy to the next generation of becoming obscenely wealthy. They earned a good living, sure. But they put a huge amount of their time and effort into raising four boys whose lives are a reflection of their values and their love.
What were they thinking?

HEADLINE: Disclosure Often Spotty Or Inaccurate

BYLINE: By FREDRIC N. TULSKY and JOHN SULLIVAN; Kristen McQueary contributed reporting. Ms. McQueary covers state government for the Chicago News Cooperative and the public radio station WBEZ.

 BODY:
Public officials who are lobbyists routinely defend decisions to play both roles by saying they disclose their relationships publicly, as the law requires.
But the disclosure rules and practices in Illinois leave room for lobbyists to operate without public notice, leaving room for conflicts of interest, according to statements of economic interests of public officials, lobbying registrations filed with the City of Chicago, Cook County and the state, and records of state bills and local ordinances examined by Medill Watchdog, a journalism program at Northwestern University. 
The investigation showed that the filings frequently are inaccurate. Both lobbyists and their clients are required to disclose their lobbyist-client relationships. In 242 instances, records show, lobbyists reported working for a client but there was no corresponding registration by the client.
Lobbyists also do not have to detail all of the money they spend lobbying public officials. Most lunches or other entertainment are reported, but other outlays are not required to be disclosed. The nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause Illinois compared Illinois' filings to those in Pennsylvania and found that Pennsylvania lobbyists reported $470 million in expenditures in 2009, compared to only $1.3 million reported by Illinois lobbyists that year.
When lobbyists work as subcontractors to other lobbyists, as often happens, they are not required to identify the ultimate beneficiary of their efforts. They are required to report only the name of the lobbyist who hired them.
A result is a tangled web of connections.
The lobbying firm owned in part by Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios, B-P Consulting, listed 10 clients on its disclosure reports in 2010. B-P Consulting also hired a lobbying firm owned by Brent Hassert, the former deputy minority leader in the Illinois House. Mr. Hassert listed eight clients that were not clients of Mr. Berrios. One of those clients was also a lobbying firm, Curry & Associates, which listed 26 more clients, and had a contract with yet another lobbying firm, Thomson Consulting, which had even more clients.
''There is no way of connecting the dots here, and that partly defeats the point of having disclosure,'' said David Morrison, deputy director of the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. ''It's impossible in Illinois to figure out whom lobbyists are representing.''
The stakes are raised, Mr. Morrison said, when the lobbyists are, like Mr. Berrios, public officials, because voters cannot determine if their public acts create conflicts with paying clients.

HITLER'S HANGMAN
The Life of Heydrich
By Robert Gerwarth
Illustrated. 393 pp. Yale University Press. $35.
In June 1942, Thomas Mann, who was living in exile in California, delivered a commentary on a German-language BBC radio program that decried the sanguinary actions of the Third Reich in avenging the assassination of the leading SS official Reinhard Heydrich in Prague. After Heydrich's elaborate funeral ceremony at the new Reich Chancellery in Berlin, Hitler screamed at the Czech president, Emil Hacha, ''Nothing can prevent me from deporting millions of Czechs if they do not wish for peaceful coexistence.'' It wasn't an idle threat. ''Since the violent death of Heydrich,'' Mann lamented, ''terror is raging everywhere, in a more sickly, unrestrained fashion than ever before. . . . An entire town, that supposedly sheltered the perpetrators, is massacred and razed.'' Indeed, to honor Heydrich and help create what Hitler referred to as ''Germany's Garden of Eden'' in the East, the Nazis chose the code name ''Aktion Reinhard'' for the extermination of two million people, most of whom were Jewish, in the General Government of Poland by the end of 1943. 
None of Hitler's paladins did more to realize the Final Solution than Heydrich and his superior Heinrich Himmler, who ran the SS and the Gestapo. This pair worked assiduously to expand their influence from modest beginnings to the establishment of the most powerful and fearsome security apparatus in the Nazi empire. Now two supremely enlightening biographies, Peter Longerich's ''Heinrich Himmler'' and Robert Gerwarth's ''Hitler's Hangman,'' show how they did it. Longerich is a professor of history at the University of London and the author of several books on the Holocaust. Gerwarth is the director of the Center for War Studies at University College Dublin. These two books don't fundamentally revise our understanding of the Final Solution -- too much has already been published for bold revision to be remotely plausible -- but they significantly deepen it.
Little in either Himmler's or Heydrich's upbringing would have indicated their future line of work. While Hitler came from Austrian peasant stock, Himmler, who was born in 1900, and Heydrich, who was born in 1904, belonged to thoroughly respectable Catholic families. Himmler's father, Gebhard, taught Greek and Latin at the renowned Wilhelm Grammar School in Munich, and his son was a diligent student. Heydrich's father, Bruno, was a gifted composer who ran a conservatory in the city of Halle and ensured that his son enjoyed a rigorous musical education, including playing the piano and violin by age 6 and attending Wagner operas.
Then came World War I, followed by the sudden collapse of the monarchy. Heydrich was too young to serve but experienced the upheaval and violence that accompanied the demise of Wilhelmine Germany. Soon his parents saw their livelihoods and social standing jeopardized by Germany's economic woes. Allegations of a Jewish pedigree in the Heydrich family tree further discombobulated the parents and would later plague the son.
For his part, Himmler had eagerly marched off to war, entering a Bavarian regiment in 1918, but to his lifelong regret was demobilized before he could see action. During the tumultuous postwar era, his parents' financial difficulties meant that he couldn't afford to study at Munich University as he might have liked. Instead, he earned an agricultural degree in 1922 and accepted a job in an artificial fertilizer factory, which he left after a year.
For both Himmler and Heydrich, the Nazi Party offered a second chance. They became professional Nazis. Himmler was first off the mark. His initial whiff of excitement came in 1923 during Hitler's abortive Munich putsch, which Himmler participated in as a member of a paramilitary organization known as the German Combat League, led by Ernst Rohm. After Hitler's imprisonment in Landsberg in 1924, the banned Nazi Party went underground, but Himmler worked for it as a courier. In his spare time, Longerich reports, Himmler read various anti-Semitic and astrological tracts in an effort to ''integrate the most important elements of radical right-wing ideology, which are increasingly apparent in his thinking -- anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, racism, hostility to democracy -- into a far more comprehensive worldview, cobbled together from the most varied sources.''
Fortified with these newly won insights, Himmler, who had become an aide to the leading Nazi Gregor Strasser (whose murder he would later connive at during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934), traveled around lower Bavaria to educate peasants about the diabolical links between capitalism, Freemasons and Jews. He also married a blond, blue-eyed nurse named Margarete Boden whose credo was ''A Jew is always a Jew!''
Himmler's big break came in September 1927 when Hitler appointed him deputy leader of the ''protection squads,'' or SS, that were supposed to guard Nazi bigwigs. This small grouping gave him the chance to build up a modern and racially aristocratic order of the Teutonic Knights. It was supposed to provide a stark contrast to the rowdy SA brownshirts led by his erstwhile mentor Rohm (whom Himmler also had murdered in the Night of the Long Knives). When it came to the SS, Himmler's officious punctiliousness can hardly be exaggerated. He saw himself as a paterfamilias, fussing over his young charges. He demanded that each local SS leader ensure that ''his squad brings with it a sufficient number of shoe and clothes brushes'' to the 1929 Nuremberg rally. Himmler also insisted on such precautionary measures as examinations of the ''hereditary health'' of any future SS wives. Himmler loved to talk of his ''decency,'' and would later complain that the task of eliminating Jews and other undesirables was a burden, a heroic, if unpalatable, task that he could not shirk.
If anyone seemed to conform to Himmler's aspirations for a Nordic elite, it was Heydrich. Himmler himself suffered from poor posture and a recessed chin, which he liked to hide in photos by covering it with his left hand. Heydrich represented everything Himmler was not -- a tall blond with blue eyes who was a ladies' man as well as a skilled sportsman, musician and pilot. Heydrich's career as a naval officer ended abruptly because of an affair; his insolent conduct before a military court of honor resulted in his dismissal in 1931.
Heydrich was devastated. But his fiancee, Lina von Osten, was an ardent Nazi, and Heydrich's family pulled some strings, landing him an interview with Himmler, who was impressed by Heydrich's apparent familiarity with espionage, mostly gleaned from reading spy potboilers as a boy. According to Gerwarth, Heydrich had been largely apolitical and entered the most extreme paramilitary group within Hitler's movement ''not out of deep ideological conviction, but because Nazism offered him the opportunity to return to a structured life in uniform, providing along with it a sense of purpose and a way of regaining the confidence of Lina and her family of devoted Nazis.'' Soon enough, however, Heydrich became one of the most zealous exponents of Nazi racial doctrine. Under Himmler's guidance, Heydrich would play a key role in preparing the political and bureaucratic terrain on the road to Auschwitz.
When was the decision actually made to move from the extrusion of Jews from Germany and Western Europe to their actual liquidation? This question has vexed scholars for decades, leading to controversies between two schools of historians: the intentionalists, who believe Hitler was always determined to exterminate the Jews, and the functionalists, who contend that the Holocaust was arrived at in a rather haphazard fashion. The truth probably lies somewhere in between.
Hitler scarcely made a secret of his desire to wipe out the Jews: in 1939 he prophesied the extinction of world Jewry during a speech at the Kroll Opera House. And contrary to the notion derived from Hannah Arendt, most of the SS officials were not soulless technocrats -- or as the German phrase has it, ''desktop perpetrators'' -- but skillful bureaucrats driven by seething ideological hatreds. Himmler himself, Longerich writes, ''liked to present himself in the pose of the victor'' when visiting concentration camps and give ''guided tours'' of them. His eventual goal would have been to replace the Wehrmacht itself with his elite corps of Waffen-SS troops.
For all of Himmler's zeal, however, the SS had to proceed carefully. It attracted much criticism, Longerich writes, from the Wehrmacht for engaging in flagrant atrocities during the 1939 invasion of Poland. Yet as Himmler saw it, the SS murdered ''decently.'' He distinguished between valid ''political motives'' for killing Jews and illegitimate ''selfish, sadistic or sexual motives,'' which would lead to prosecution for murder or manslaughter. It is important to remember that it was always Hitler who made the ultimate decisions in steadily moving toward a state-/sanctioned policy of extermination. According to Longerich, in 1941 ''the initiative for the intensification of Jewish policy -- in this case, the start of the deportations -- once again came from Hitler, but Himmler, like other leading functionaries, intuited such a decision, felt his way forward and acted in advance of it and took on an active role as soon as the time was ripe.''
By 1942, the Nazis' rapid military successes and anger over Heydrich's death accelerated their plans to annihilate the Jews. Then, as defeat loomed, and in the wake of the failed assassination plot against Hitler on July 20, 1944, Himmler devoted himself to settling scores with the military and the Prussian aristocracy, who were often one and the same. The result was a fresh blood bath.
From the outset, Hitler and his fellow conspirators had been obsessed with the idea of avoiding a new November 1918, when they believed that internal Jewish and Communist subversives had stabbed imperial Germany in the back and cost it victory in World War I. And to the end, Hitler clung to the conviction that he was engaged in a titanic battle with world Jewry; in his final statement before he committed suicide, he called upon future generations to carry on the fight. Himmler himself committed suicide after he was captured by the British. Longerich and Gerwarth underscore that the Nazis' sinister delusions about Jewish power prompted them to transform an entire continent into what Thomas Mann in his postwar novel ''Doctor Faustus'' called a ''thick-walled torture chamber.''

HEADLINE: A Year To Tread Carefully in Bond Funds

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
BOND funds as a group outperformed stock funds last year, though not in the fourth quarter. And despite the bond funds' less-volatile performance, choosing one is scarcely a piece of cake.
Last year, markets were constrained by multiple storm clouds: high unemployment in the United States, gridlock in Washington over the nation's debt and tax laws, and a continuing fear of European contagion stemming from crises over sovereign debt in Greece, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Spain. No one foresees a quick solution to any of these problems, and that makes it hard to invest for both a solid return and protection of principal.
Over all, Morningstar says, the average taxable bond fund returned 2.1 percent for the quarter and 4.6 percent for the year. In contrast, the average general stock fund surged 10.8 percent for the quarter but lost 1.7 percent for the year. But achieving high bond returns in 2012 may be more challenging. 
Nevertheless, Eric Jacobson, director of fixed-income research at Morningstar, said he saw promise in some emerging markets because of ''their structural reforms, growth rates and underlying fiscal health.'' And there is value in some of these markets, he said: ''The sell-offs in the fall actually made some of those markets even cheaper than they were earlier in the year.''
In 2011, municipal and high-yield bond funds, especially, turned in strong performances. And because Treasury and investment-grade corporate yields have both been low, that trend is expected to continue. But in choosing a fund, investors are advised to look for careful risk management and portfolio selection.
Kevin R. Lorenz, who manages the TIAA-CREF High Yield fund, described his approach. He and his team do fundamental research to look for good companies with strong cash flow, he said, generally choosing securities with the better ratings in the high-yield category that meet his criteria.
A vital part of risk management, Mr. Lorenz said, is to avoid any issuer that might default. As a result, he eschews the junk portion of the high-yield market, where default risk is relatively high. He also invests only in dollar-denominated bonds, avoiding currency risk. ''U.S. corporates are strong,'' he said. ''Assets are underpriced.'' He says he expects good returns for investors with a four- or five-year horizon, but he calls the short-term picture unsure, with volatility ahead.
Mr. Lorenz, who has 24 years of experience, advised investors to study five-year total returns in selecting a fund. At present, that includes both a very bad year for high yield, 2008, and a very good one, 2009, so there is an unusual opportunity to see a fund's overall performance.
Jason T. Thomas, chief investment officer at Aspiriant, a national fee-only wealth management firm, said it was currently focused on municipal bonds, especially high-yield ones, for the bond portion of portfolios. Carefully selected issues offer great value, he said, and are relatively cheap, with yields equivalent to after-tax yields of 7 to 9 percent.
For fund investors, he likes the Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond fund, which has recently performed well despite keeping down the duration of its holdings -- a move that has reduced interest rate risk.
Guy J. Benstead, a portfolio manager of the Forward Credit Analysis Long/Short fund, which Morningstar classifies as a nontraditional bond fund and is based in San Francisco, said he had a ''flexible mandate to seek out opportunities.''
Mr. Benstead, too, is overweighting municipal bonds. About 85 percent of the fund is in munis, with the remainder in corporate bonds and preferred stock. It sells short other corporates and Treasuries.
He said his fund uses leverage, borrowing at low rates to increase returns, a practice that has ''inherent risk.'' But, he added, ''we have the tools to address and mitigate risk.''
MR. BENSTEAD predicted that the overall bond market wouldn't fare as well in 2012-13 as it did in 2011, adding that his outlook for the economy, both in the United States and globally, was ''not optimistic.'' That is partly because of the European debt crisis, which he expects will lead to fiscal austerity in many countries.
Kurt Brouwer, chairman of Brouwer & Janachowski, an investment management firm in Tiburon, Calif., said that a recession was possible but that he expected the economy ''to muddle through'' with a ''pretty good'' environment for bond funds. Still, he warned against seeking the highest yield, which he said would inevitably lead to more risk, or choosing funds tilted toward long-term bonds.
Mr. Brouwer said his clients had quite a bit of money in bond funds, including two Pimco funds -- its Total Return and its Unconstrained Bond fund, as well as in the DoubleLine Total Return Bond fund, which has only a two-year history. Mr. Brouwer called the fund's manager, Jeffrey Gundlach, formerly with TCW, ''a super bond manager.''
Not every manager is enthusiastic about bond funds. Michael Stolper, head of Stolper & Company, an investment manager in San Diego, said stock dividend yields, relative to bond yields, ''would suggest a strong tilt toward equities and away from bonds and bond funds.''
Mr. Stolper predicted that someday, perhaps soon, the ''new normal will be trend-line economic growth of 2 percent or greater,'' leading to higher stock prices and dividends, as well as higher interest rates. With that, he continued, prices of bonds and bond funds will decline.
Nevertheless, he conceded that bonds ''are useful in a low-interest-rate environment, primarily to temper the volatility of equity markets,'' which, he said, could decline 50 percent at any time because of economic or political events -- ''and take years to recover.''

HEADLINE: For Three Funds, a Front-Row Seat to a Fourth-Quarter Rally

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
THE Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned nothing in 2011, but a lost year overshadowed a late rally. Managers of three of the fourth quarter's better-performing mutual funds found winners in such varied places as small-capitalization stocks, auto parts retailers and aerospace companies.
Buying What They Like 
Robert E. Killen and Lee S. Grout, co-managers of the Berwyn Fund, call themselves contrarians but might be better termed investment agnostics, as they pay little attention to such orthodoxies as benchmarks and broad diversification. Instead, they buy what they like, sector weightings be damned. If they find themselves with, say, lots of industrial stocks, so be it. They just want companies -- typically about 40 -- that meet their quality screens.
''We own a collection of really good businesses,'' Mr. Grout said. ''Beyond that, there's no grand plan.'' Their fund, which holds mainly small-capitalization stocks, carries an expense ratio of 1.26 percent and returned 19.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
Lately, Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout's willingness to go where other investors won't has led them to Winnebago Industries, the motor home maker. When they invested, the stock had sagged for fear that high gasoline prices and a soft economy would sap sales. Prices for the company's campers start at about $70,000 and climb to more than $300,000, and the weak economy had driven several competitors to bankruptcy. But Winnebago, which carries no debt, was protected by its well-known brand and sturdy financials, Mr. Killen said.
One unifying factor in the portfolio is its companies' distaste for debt. Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout prefer businesses that can finance their own expansions and acquisitions and don't have to rely on the capital markets, particularly in times of stress.
In Search of Fortresses
Eric S. Ende, co-manager of FPA Paramount, also favors companies with the financial wherewithal to endure tough times -- or, as he terms them, those with ''fortress balance sheets.'' His fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.93 percent, returned 16.7 percent for the quarter.
Mr. Ende ranges wider than Mr. Killen and Mr. Grout in hunting for investments. His fund owns both small- and mid-cap companies, and he lately has put a growing portion of the portfolio abroad. In 2011, Paramount's parent, First Pacific Advisors in Los Angeles, announced that the fund would gradually increase its foreign stake and would eventually invest more than half its assets in companies based outside the United States. Its foreign holdings stood at 12.5 percent on Sept. 30, the most recent data available.
That transition may not happen quickly, because of Mr. Ende's penchant for sticking with stocks. He sells only about 10 percent of the fund's holdings annually. His largest holding, O'Reilly Automotive, the auto parts retailer, has been in the fund since 1998.
But he has been adding names from outside the United States. A recent addition is L'Occitane, the French cosmetics company. Mr. Ende liked its broad reach, with sales in Europe, Asia and the United States, as well as its control over its supplies and distribution. L'Occitane buys raw materials, like lavender, directly from farmers in the Provence region of France and owns many of its retail outlets.
Mr. Ende seeks out well-run companies, rather than betting on sectors or macroeconomic trends, but he does have one sector-specific rule: he shuns banks and insurers.
''If you own a bank or an insurance company, you basically don't know what's in its portfolio, and you have to depend on your warm, fuzzy feelings about management,'' he said. ''And then, every 10 years, you find that they blow up.'' That happened with the recent real estate crash but also with earlier debacles like the Latin American debt crisis and the savings-and-loan scandal in the United States.
Jets, Robots and Profits
Like the managers of Berwyn and FPA Paramount, John S. Sheehy of the Fidelity Select Defense and Aerospace Portfolio pores over financial statements to winnow candidates for investment. It's a discipline for which he's well trained: before managing money, he was a certified public accountant, working as an auditor in the New York and Boston offices of Deloitte.
Mr. Sheehy's fund, which carries an expense ratio of 0.88 percent, returned 12.7 percent for the quarter.
Lately, the military and aerospace sectors have felt headwinds: United States military spending is falling, and high fuel prices are cutting into airline profits. But Mr. Sheehy has managed to find winning stocks among obvious names, like Boeing, and lesser-known ones, like iRobot.
Boeing, the fund's second-largest holding, behind United Technologies, accounted for 13.66 percent of assets on Nov. 30, the most recent reporting date. The stock has risen thanks to strong orders for its commercial jets, Mr. Sheehy said. In December, for example, Southwest Airlines announced that it would buy 208 more of Boeing's 737 jets.
On top of that, international carriers are lining up for Boeing's newest offering, the 787, he said. Airlines in Moscow and Abu Dhabi placed orders in December.
Like Boeing, iRobot splits its business between commercial products and gear designed for the Defense Department and similar buyers. Perhaps its best-known offerings are its robotic vacuum cleaner, the Roomba, and its robotic mop, the Scooba. But the company, based in Bedford, Mass., also makes small robots for military uses like bomb disposal and surveillance. It even makes a maritime robot -- think of it as a tiny submarine -- that does ocean surveillance.
Mr. Sheehy prefers companies, like these two, that don't depend only on military spending for their revenue. He looks for ones with sales split between public and private clients or those that sell to the militaries of a variety of countries.
His fund tends to hew to domestic companies. Partly, that's an outgrowth of the size of the military budget in a period when the United States maintained large armed presences in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
Despite the budget-cutting under consideration, the United States is still likely to account for much of the world's military spending, he said.

HEADLINE: Defenses Give Edge to the Giants and the Steelers

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER

 BODY:
Lions (10-6) at Saints (13-3) Saturday, 8 p.m. Line: Saints by 10.5
From the birth of the N.F.L. until 1960, no quarterback ever threw for more than 3,000 yards. As recently as 1997, it was still possible for Jeff George to lead the league with less than 4,000 yards passing: 3,917, to be exact. For most of football's history, a 3,000-yard season was an accomplishment, 4,000 yards were a feat and 5,000 yards marked the distance from home to the nearest hardware store, not an attainable passing goal. 
Saturday will mark the first time that two quarterbacks who threw for over 5,000 yards in a season will face each other. While Drew Brees - who broke Dan Marino's single-season record by throwing for 5,476 yards - is getting his due as one of the league's best passers, Matthew Stafford (5,038) could not even muster a Pro Bowl selection. Stafford's numbers are partially a reflection of passing inflation, but he has also been unfairly overshadowed this season, not just by Brees and Aaron Rodgers, the favorite to be the N.F.L.'s most valuable player, but by his own team's tortuous climb out of a decade-long funk, the acrobatic excellence of his best receiver and his defense's attempt to jump-start the economy by increasing the demand for yellow penalty flags.
When the Lions have the ball The Lions use shotgun formations on 68 percent of all offensive plays, the highest percentage in the N.F.L. (the league average is 40.1 percent). Stafford's primary weapon, Calvin Johnson, was the third-most targeted receiver in the league with 158 passes. (Atlanta's Roddy White and New England's Wes Welker finished first and second.) Johnson compensates for the Lions' poor running game by doubling as the team's top threat in the red zone: he has caught nine touchdowns passes on plays that start inside the 20-yard line. Tight ends Brandon Pettigrew and Tony Scheffler also make great short-yardage options (10 combined red-zone targets), and they work underneath so the rookie receiver Titus Young can supplement Johnson as a deep threat. The Lions have running backs, but they ignore them, and you can, too.
Gregg Williams's blitz-heavy defense yielded just 33 sacks and 16 takeaways this season. Only the Patriots and the Packers allowed more passing yards than the Saints, and they compensated by producing 31 and 23 interceptions to the Saints' nine. Many of those passing yards were the result of opponents trying to keep pace with the Saints' offense, but Williams does not have the same manpower he had when the Saints reached the Super Bowl two years ago.
When the Saints have the ball Whole articles can be filled with impressive Brees statistics, but we will settle for one: his completion percentage over the last three seasons is 69.9, better than all but three quarterbacks have ever mustered in a single season. Sean Payton's offense makes the most of Brees's accuracy and ability to distribute the ball to legions of potential targets. Nine different players have caught at least 10 passes for the Saints this season, led by Jimmy Graham, a college basketball forward turned mismatch nightmare at tight end. Despite their reputation as a pass-happy team, the Saints often line up in the I-formation and pound the ball. Saints running backs combined for 2,127 yards, and Brees's long touchdown throws are often set up by play-fakes.
The Lions' notorious defensive line recorded just 36 sacks this season, though they committed 43 penalties in the process. The Lions rarely blitz, so while their sack totals are low, Cliff Avril, Ndamukong Suh, Kyle Vanden Bosch and their linemates provide enough pressure for Jim Schwartz to keep seven defenders back in coverage, minimizing the risk of breakdowns.
Pick In what will probably be a shootout, the Lions' inability to run the football and their tendency to spot opponents 100 penalty yards will matter much more than their lack of postseason experience. Saints
Bengals (9-7) at Texans (10-6) Saturday, 4:30 p.m. Line: Texans by 3
Two rookie quarterbacks will face off in the playoffs for the first time, and you will be able to tell. Before the pyrotechnics of the Saints and the Lions, the boom-or-bust bombing of the Giants and the Falcons, and the Broncos' homage to Depression-era strategies, T.J.Yates and Andy Dalton will demonstrate just how fast they can pedal bicycles with training wheels. Both are gutsy, resilient and all of those other things we say quarterbacks are when they reel off a few close wins, but both are also propped up by simplified passing schemes that allow them to throw a long pass here, a screen there and hand off anywhere and everywhere. The Texans came back to beat the Bengals, 20-19, in the regular season, and this game promises to be just as close, if only because neither team is a safe bet to score that 21st point.
When the Texans have the ball Gary Kubiak's zone-blocking, run-oriented offense was easy to scale back when injuries to Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart forced Yates into the lineup. Zone blocking requires linemen to move laterally, double-team defenders and slip out to block any linebacker who attempts to attack a particular gap. An adjunct to zone blocking is cut blocking, which is legal but frowned upon, and the Texans linemen Duane Brown and Chris Myers are among the most feared cut blockers in the league. Watch the line, and you will see defenders fall down in pursuit as if the Texans strung the field with piano wire. Watching the line carnage will be far more interesting than watching the passing game: Yates averages 8.2 yards per pass on first down, when opponents fear the run, but just 5.9 yards per pass on third down, when Kubiak does not want his young passer to take risks.
When the Bengals have the ball The rookie A.J. Green does not have to get open to catch a long pass. If the ball is in his vicinity, and if his defenders do not have rocket packs, he will likely outjump them. Green has caught 15 of the 29 bombs thrown to him this season (a ''bomb'' being defined as any pass that goes 20 or more yards in the air), gaining 562 yards, scoring 4 touchdowns and drawing 4 pass interference penalties as a bonus. Bombs to Green and Jerome Simpson - the guy who did the flip in the end-zone that you will see in every highlight reel ever made for eternity - provide the Bengals with the bulk of their offense: running backs Cedric Benson and Bernard Scott are plow horses, and tight end Jermaine Gresham is the only viable short-passing option. The Bengals even use six offensive linemen in some of their formations, a tactic which demonstrates their commitment to running and bombing. Because Green and Simpson need room to maneuver, the Bengals often stall at the red zone: they were 11 of 26 on touchdown conversions inside the 20 in the second half of the season.
The defensive coordinator Wade Phillips will call plays from the coach's box after missing two late-season games while recovering from surgery, and the Texans appeared to miss his leadership in losses to the Panthers and the Colts. His game plan on Saturday should not be too complex, however: assign his top cornerback, Johnathan Joseph, to Green in man coverage, keep a safety deep and let the rest take care of itself.
Pick The Bengals settled for field goals in their last meeting with the Texans, and it cost them. It will cost them again. Texans
Falcons (10-6) at Giants (9-7) Sunday, 1:00 p.m. Line: Giants by 3
It is possible to arrive at the same place by multiple paths. After getting crushed by the Packers in last year's playoffs, the Falcons decided they were just a playmaker or two short of the Super Bowl. General Manager Thomas Dimitroff engineered a daring draft-day trade to acquire the rookie receiver Julio Jones, then signed defensive end Ron Edwards to upgrade the pass rush. The moves worked - Jones caught 54 passes, Edwards added three and a half sacks and solid run defense - but holes opened up on the offensive line and the secondary, and the Falcons are no further along than they were in 2010: good, but an obvious notch below the elite teams in the conference.
The Giants, meanwhile, treated the lockout as a duck-and-cover drill, hoping that continuity and player development would compensate for free-agent losses. Thanks to the emergences of Jason Pierre-Paul and Victor Cruz, typically excellent play on the defensive line and a businesslike approach to battling through injuries and losing streaks, the Giants are not only hosting a playoff game against one of the league's favorite Next Big Things, but they are favored to win it.
When the Giants have the ball Most of the Giants' big plays come when Cruz is in the slot, matched up against a nickel defender or safety while the opponent's top cornerbacks take on Hakeem Nicks and Mario Manningham. This strategy was particularly effective against the Jets and the Cowboys, though defensive coordinators who do not spend the work week polishing their news conference bon mots may have caught on to Kevin Gilbride's (extremely simple) tactic. Falcons cornerback Brent Grimes (knee) missed practice Wednesday but is expected to play. The Falcons typically keep Grimes on the left side of the formation, but his return may allow cornerback Dunta Robinson to move inside to cover Cruz.
Falcons linebackers Stephen Nicholas (toe) and Sean Witherspoon (head) may not play. Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw has caught just 10 passes in five games since returning from a foot injury, but look for him to be more involved in the passing game if he is matched up against any Falcons linebacker but their leading tackler, Curtis Lofton.
When the Falcons have the ball Everyone has a well-established role in the Falcons' offense. Roddy White is the go-to receiver, Jones the deep threat, Tony Gonzalez the short-yardage receiver, Michael Turner the battering ram running back and Jason Snelling the third-down back who blocks and catches dump-off passes. Jones (17.8 yards per catch) and White (the league's most targeted receiver with 180 passes) stretch defenses enough to make this by-the-numbers offense viable, and quarterback Matt Ryan overcame an early-season slump by learning to rely on Gonzalez and Snelling more often.
The Falcons had to shuffle their offensive line early in the season when the play of the once-promising left tackle Sam Baker rapidly deteriorated. Will Svitek replaced Baker, who briefly moved inside to replace the penalty-prone Joe Hawley at right guard before flunking out at that position. Svitek and Hawley are adequate-at-best starters, and the Falcons will use play-fakes to Turner and maximum protection to keep the Giants' front four away from Ryan.
Pick The Falcons are no longer a receiver and a pass rusher from a deep playoff run. They are now a linebacker and a left tackle away. Giants
Steelers (12-4) at Broncos (8-8) Sunday, 4;30 p.m. Line: Steelers by 8.5
We all know what happens when an immovable force meets an irresistible object: an explosion of cliches results. But what happens when a team that lets weak opponents hang around until the final minutes faces a weak opponent that reached the playoffs by hanging around until the final minutes? The answer is simple: a low-scoring game that hinges on one or two big plays.
The Broncos are one of the weakest playoff participants in years. Opponents outscored them by 81 points over the course of the season; by contrast, the 5-11 Redskins were outscored by just 79 points. Denver's passing game is a throwback to the Studebaker era, and while its defense can smother weak opponents, it cracked late in the year under the strain of trying to pitch a shutout every week. Then again, the Seahawks were pretty weak last year, and they beat the Saints. With Ben Roethlisberger hobbling on a re-injured ankle and running back Rashard Mendenhall out, the Steelers lack the firepower to score the 24 points needed to put the game out of reach of Tim Tebow's fading magic. The Steelers will try to grind out one of their 13-9 wins, but the Broncos have a knack for turning those into 16-13 overtime upsets.
When the Broncos have the ball Tebow runs a scaled-back version of the spread-option offense used by many college teams. Most plays begin with a fake (or real) handoff to Willis McGahee and the threat of a Tebow keeper; passing plays are designed to exploit the defensive indecision caused by the run action. The passing game takes a long time to warm up, and Tebow completes just 41 percent of his first-half passes, averaging just 4.4 yards per attempt. The rushing game compensates to a degree, and John Fox often uses the threat of a Tebow keeper as a surrogate for a pass: the Broncos lead the N.F.L in running plays on 3rd-and-medium (4 to 8 yards), and Fox will punt and give his defense a chance rather than risk a turnover. In late-and-close situations, Tebow becomes Randall Cunningham from the 1980s, capable of running around until the defense is out of position, then delivering a game-changing play.
The Steelers' defense is one of the league's great constants: their ability to apply pressure from all angles, disguise their coverage and (critically) pursue and corral fast quarterbacks will keep the Broncos' offense in low gear. Safety Ryan Clark (altitude-affected anemia) cannot play, taking away the Steelers' best deep defender, but the Broncos will be without guard Chris Kuper (broken leg), which will make it easier for the Steelers to crash the middle on option fakes.
When the Steelers have the ball Like their defense, the Steelers' offense is familiar to most fans. They line up in a single-back formation, with receivers and tight ends bunched to one side of the field, and mix power runs with a hefty dose of wide-receiver screens. Steelers receivers have caught 62 of 79 screen passes thrown to them, for 421 yards, and once defenders start crowding the line to stop short passes, Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown start going deep. Roethlisberger's injuries are the inevitable result of his willingness to take hits instead of dumping the ball to a running back. Roethlisberger has taken 40 sacks, while the Steelers' top two running backs have combined for just 36 receptions. With Mendenhall out, Isaac Redman will get the bulk of carries. Redman accomplished the rare feat of gaining more yards per rush (4.4) than reception (4.3) this season.
The Broncos pass rushers Elvis Dumervil and Von Miller combined for 21 sacks, 42 quarterback hits and countless disrupted plays. With the pass rush causing havoc and the future Hall of Famer Champ Bailey still capable of shutting down most top receivers, opponents frequently get lulled into punt battles with the Broncos. Denver excels in that kind of game: Britton Colquitt finished second in the league in punts inside the 20-yard line, and two return men (Eddie Royal and Eric Decker) brought back punts for touchdowns this year.
Pick The Broncos are the surrogate Ravens: the team that throws a postseason scare into the Steelers with sacks and one or two offensive lightning strikes, but ultimately falls short. Steelers
All times Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shootings Soar in Oakland; Children Often the Victims

BYLINE: By SHOSHANA WALTER. 
swalter@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Five-year-old Gabriel Martinez Jr. died Dec. 30, shot as he played under a streetlight near his father's taco truck on an East Oakland street corner. He was the third young child killed in Oakland since August, the 110th homicide of 2011, and the 199th juvenile shooting victim of more than 2,000 people who were victims of gun violence in an especially bloody year in an increasingly violent city.
His killer has not been found. There have been no arrests. In that, the shooting of the boy known in the neighborhood as Gabrielito is typical. According to preliminary data provided to The Bay Citizen by the Oakland Police Department, of the 1,500 reported incidents of gun violence in the city last year, arrests were made in just 117 of the cases -- less than 8 percent. In 2010, the police made arrests in close to 13 percent of the 1,280 shootings. There were 1,045 shootings in 2009, according to the police department. 
After several years of declining rates of violent crime in the Bay Area, Oakland shooting incidents increased dramatically in 2011. On an average day, five or six people were shot or shot at. The number of shootings is up 60 percent in the past five years, according to Urban Strategies Council, a crime analysis firm previously under a city contract.
Law enforcement officials and crime experts said they did not know why Oakland experienced such a spasm of violence in 2011.
''If I could tell you what the causes were, then that would be a great story because then we could figure things out and wrap this up in no time,'' said Sgt. Chris Bolton, the department's chief of staff. ''Obviously, we have in this city a problem with violence.''
The shootings of young victims seemed particularly high in 2011.
In August, 3-year-old Carlos Nava was shot and killed while his mother pushed him in a stroller on the same busy East Oakland street where Gabriel Martinez would later be killed. Lawrence Denard, 26, and Willie Torrence, 26, were arrested and charged with Carlos's murder, according to the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. Later that month, a 2-year-old in the same neighborhood was shot in the arm.
On Nov. 28, 1-year-old Hiram Lawrence was shot in the head during a music video taping outside a West Oakland liquor store, one of eight people shot by six gunmen. He died Dec. 9.
Despite a $35,000 reward in Hiram's shooting and $25,000 in Gabriel's, no arrests have been made.
Community organizers and city officials tried to make sense of the grim statistics last week. Some blamed the proliferation of handguns, others faulted an understaffed police department, still others said the problem was the city's high unemployment and poverty rates.
According to the Oakland police, handguns were used in 82 murders, assault rifles in nine, and rifles and shotguns in seven. There are no gun stores in Oakland, but street outreach workers said it is easy to buy an illegal gun on the street for $75 to $400. Still, the police are confiscating only about 700 firearms per year, little more than half of what they did in 2007.
''To secure a gun in Oakland is like looking for some candy,'' said Anthony Del Toro of California Youth Outreach, a gang prevention and intervention program.
Although homicides increased to 110 in 2011, from 95 in 2010, street outreach workers said they did not see a rise in gang-related shootings, but rather in domestic violence and robberies.
The Oakland Police Department now has about 630 officers after layoffs, attrition and budget cutbacks -- a loss of about 150 officers since mid-2009 -- a number that police officials say has affected the response times and services for the city's 400,000 residents. The department takes an average of 15 minutes to respond to the highest priority calls.
The frequency of shootings and the fact that most gunmen and their weapons remain on the street led many to expect violence and made others afraid to speak up, community leaders said.
''They're desensitized to violence,'' said Kyndra Simmons, of Youth Alive. ''Young people see it all the time. They've just learned that that's kind of how things are.''

HEADLINE: That Bright Light May Be Deceiving

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHO said making money was supposed to be fun?
You wouldn't know it from all the fretting about the domestic economy and the European currency and financial system, but the last three months of 2011 produced the best quarter for American stocks in more than two years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.2 percent.
Part of the strength was a matter of timing. The index fell 14.3 percent in the third quarter and bottomed on Oct. 3, the first trading day of the fourth. For the full year, the S.& P. 500 was essentially flat.
The late rally was also a result of American companies' remarkable ability to make decent money despite an unstable global backdrop, investment advisers say. The challenging conditions aren't expected to abate soon, and opinion differs on just how long the resilience will last. As 2012 begins, the big question for investors is whether the corporate profit picture will continue to resemble Teflon or morph into something like Krazy Glue. 
''The market is in between highs and lows, and you wouldn't expect it given the news from Europe,'' said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF. ''Why we're not falling back is that earnings growth has been O.K., although not spectacular. That's keeping things from looking worse.''
Mr. Hammond estimates that earnings for the S.& P. 500 companies grew 10 percent in 2011, and he expects a similar pace in the initial months of 2012. He does not envision an imminent improvement in Europe, but his outlook is rosier elsewhere.
''We can all see that Europe is going to get worse before it gets better,'' he said. ''On the other hand, we're going to get a bit of an uptrend from Asia.''
The combination of iffy economic conditions and robust corporate results pushed down interest rates on Treasury bonds and high-yield issues alike. That propped up bond mutual funds; the average one in Morningstar's database gained 2.1 percent.
Stock funds fared much better; the average portfolio that specializes in the domestic market rose 10.6 percent. The strongest sector funds focused on real estate, cyclical industries, energy and other natural resources, while technology and communications lagged. International stock funds were up 4.3 percent, as meager gains in Europe and Asia brought down the average.
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, sees several reasons for strength in the economy and stocks to persist well into 2012.
''People aren't giving any credit to the fact that we're picking up here,'' he said. ''Europe slowing down is a negative, but mortgage rates have dropped from about 5 percent to 4 percent. The energy bite, which was killing us early in the year, is down 20 percent.'' Inflation in general has eased in the last year, he added, providing ''a 2 percent boost to incomes.''
If the glass is at least half-full for Mr. Hammond and Mr. Paulsen, it is half-empty, or even on the verge of shattering, for others. As they see it, official Europe, in its efforts to resolve its debt crisis, is like the smoker in the old joke who has no trouble quitting -- he's done it many times.
Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, counts 15 ''crisis summits'' in the last two years, yet ''they have not achieved a lasting solution,'' he said. He is scornful of the half-measures he sees and contends that only ''radical surgery'' -- some combination of reduced debt obligations for troubled European borrowers or an engineering of higher inflation that will have the same effect by stealth -- can fix the problem once and for all.
The longer that takes to happen, the more likely that American companies' immunity will erode, in his view. He noted that about 20 percent of American exports and S.& P. 500 earnings come from Europe. What concerns him more is ''financial intertwinings'' between the regions.
''If a major European institution were to fail, it would cause a big hiccup in the U.S. financial system,'' Mr. Sri-Kumar warned. That would produce a greater impact on the economy and stock market, in his opinion, than the hit to earnings from slower European growth.
''People say, 'Europe is going to worsen and emerging markets are going to slow down, but don't worry, the U.S. will maintain its vibrancy.' '' he said. ''That's inconsistent. Something has to give. The next wind likely to blow is an ill wind.''
David C. Wright, a manager of the Sierra Core Retirement fund, says he also expects heavy weather.
''We've had some upticks in some data series,'' he acknowledged, adding: ''We think that's a little bit of calm before the downtrend resumes. Our view is that the biggest risk will continue to be stress from the huge global deleveraging cycle'' as debt, one way or another, is wiped off the books.
As political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic seek ways to shore up their financial systems, they are hamstrung by another thorny problem: huge fiscal deficits. Investors have been relieved to hear announcements of European deficit-reduction programs, and they hope for something similar to emerge from Washington -- but they may want to be careful what they wish for.
''If there's massive austerity without offsets elsewhere, you're going to have much less economic growth in places where there is growth or a recession in places without growth,'' said John McDermott, lead manager of the Evercore Wealth Management Macro Opportunity fund.
That would be bad for equities, Mr. McDermott cautioned. By contrast, another round of quantitative easing, in which the Federal Reserve buys Treasury bonds or other debt instruments, would not help the deficit, but could help stocks.
Investment advisers who anticipate more problems than solutions in the months ahead see no reason for fund owners to abandon traditional havens.
''You're safer in high-grade fixed income, such as Treasury bonds and government bonds issued in Germany and Britain, as well as bonds of the most creditworthy corporate borrowers,'' Mr. Sri-Kumar said. ''On the stock side, you want to be very defensive -- utilities, health care, consumer staples. Stay away from consumer discretionary and European equities.''
Consumer discretionary industries include car manufacturing, tourism and retailing.
Mr. Wright also recommends a heavy allocation to the best bonds. As for the stock market, he said, ''we expect a really difficult quarter with exceptional volatility continuing.''
OTHERS have a more benign outlook for stocks. Mr. Hammond suggests a mix of sectors, including consumer staples and commodities, and ''you also want to throw in some consumer durables'' like carmakers, he said. As for bonds, he would throw out Treasury issues and emphasize corporate high-yield instruments.
Mr. Paulsen is vehemently negative on Treasury bonds.
''The first thing I'm worried about is bonds getting killed in the United States,'' he said. Treasury yields could soar ''if confidence picks up and it turns out the U.S. economy is growing at 3 percent and not faltering below 2 percent.''
While he says he is ''leery of bonds and steady-Eddie consumer staples,'' Mr. Paulsen favors commodities, cyclical industries and emerging markets. He added that while better economic and financial news would help the stock market, a better mood might help more. He wants owning stocks to be fun again.
''It feels like a horrible, terrible year, but it's actually unchanged,'' Mr. Paulsen said, looking back at the stock market in 2011. ''The biggest asset going forward could be fearcoming down.''

HEADLINE: In Florida, Lawmakers Consider Gambling Bill

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ; Christine Sexton contributed reporting from Tallahassee, Fla.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- As the Florida Legislature sprints into action on Tuesday for its annual two-month session, lawmakers will face the politically volatile task of redrawing the electoral map (sure to attract a court challenge) and devising new ways to plug a $2 billion deficit in the state budget.
But it is the ''do we, don't we'' battle over whether to allow resort casinos into the state that has the state capital's adrenaline pumping. The bill, which proposes opening the door to three large casinos in Florida, is expected to be one of the few major nonbudget-related pieces of legislation to be voted on this busy session.
With a few powerful Republican lawmakers either opposed to the bill or skeptical of its benefits and the session packed with other business, odds that resort casinos will be setting down stakes this year in South Florida, where major casino companies have shown the most interest, are getting longer. Some lawmakers worry that casinos will do more harm than good by tarnishing Florida's wholesome beach-and-theme-park image, a position espoused by the influential Florida Chamber of Commerce, the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association and Walt Disney World. 
The first test will be on Monday, a day before the session's official opening, when the bill, which was revamped last week to try to garner more support, is scheduled to face an initial Senate committee vote. The biggest change made to the bill involves giving voters a say on the casino issue, a tactic that could make it more difficult for lawmakers to oppose it. A referendum would let voters decide whether to expand gambling in their county and allow all counties to compete for one of the three casino permits. The casinos would have to invest at least $2 billion to qualify.
''Let the voters decide if they want or don't want it,'' said the Senate bill's author, State Senator Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Broward County Republican.
State Senator Dennis L. Jones, the Republican chairman of the Senate's Committee on Regulated Industries, which is to vote on the bill on Monday, said Friday that he would support it. Ms. Bogdanoff, he said, had addressed most of the committee's concerns in her revised bill. Mr. Jones also pointed out that while the bill would expand casino gambling, it would also pave the way for much-needed large convention centers and hotels in the state.
''We have cut the budget in the last three years, and when they get up there and realize we are another $2 billion short, you get the feeling maybe the time has come,'' Mr. Jones said. ''We need some new revenue.''
But one of Ms. Bogdanoff's chief opponents is State Senator John Thrasher, a Republican from north Florida who is the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the bill's final stop before it reaches the Senate floor. He has made it clear that he believes the bill would harm the state and could dissuade families from visiting, a position taken by most conservatives in the Legislature. Republicans hold a supermajority in the Florida House and Senate.
''I do not believe we ought to be expanding gaming,'' Mr. Thrasher said. ''I think we have enough gaming in the state of Florida. We are not known as a gaming state, in spite of what some folks have said. We are known as a tourist-oriented, family-friendly tourism state. And to change the brand of Florida at this point to a gaming state, to me, is going in the wrong direction.''
Ms. Bogdanoff said she had received assurances from the Senate president, Mike Haridopolos, that if the bill cleared the committees, he would allow an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.
Some Democratic leaders said they were concerned about allowing private casinos in South Florida. They said they worried that the bill was moving too quickly.
''I think that the bill has serious problems,'' said State Senator Nan H. Rich, the Democratic leader, who sits on the committee scheduled to vote Monday.
Ms. Rich said she was pleased that a change in the bill would give South Florida's parimutuels -- its jai alai frontons and racetracks (they are allowed slot machines) -- the same 10 percent tax rate as the proposed casinos. But she said she worried about the $1 billion in state revenue from the Seminole Indian casinos in Florida, which would be lost over five years, if private casinos were approved.
Allowing private casinos would breach a compact that the state signed with the Seminoles, and the tribe would no longer owe the money.
Her biggest concerns, though, are broader. ''I have issues with the concept of that much gaming,'' Ms. Rich said. ''Those three destination resorts change the face of South Florida, particularly Dade County, which is where I grew up.'' Adding that the bill should not be rushed, she said, ''We don't have the answers yet to what the true impact of this will be economically and to the quality of life.''
But Ms. Bogdanoff and her allies, including the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce (it supports the bill, with certain conditions) and Florida's construction industry, said the Legislature was not facing the fact that Florida already has lots of gambling.
Bringing high-end resort casinos will attract new tourists and create thousands of jobs at a time when the state's unemployment rate is 10 percent, Ms. Bogandoff said. Also, she said, a gambling commission would serve as a vigilant overseer of gambling rules and laws.
To sweeten the pot for both sides, Ms. Bogdanoff added measures to regulate so-called Internet sweepstakes cafes, ban new parimutuel permits, lower the tax rate for casinos and parimutuels to 10 percent and compel casinos to put at least $250,000 into a fund to help compulsive gamblers. ''I'm trying not to give away the house just because I am trying politically to get their support,'' she said.
The Las Vegas Sands Corporation and other gambling companies have been scouting locations in South Florida. The Genting Group, a Malaysian company, has bought bayfront property in downtown Miami to build a resort (with a casino or without). Genting also has its sights set on New York City, where it hopes to enter into a joint venture with the state to build the country's largest convention center, at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens. It already operates a ''racino'' -- a combination racetrack and gambling parlor -- there and is lobbying for a casino.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is seeking a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling in the state as a way to raise revenue.
In Florida, casino advocates say a referendum proposal should make it easier for the bill to clear the Legislature.
''It's tough for lawmakers to say that citizens shouldn't have the right to vote, to decide if they want this in the community or not,'' said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist for Las Vegas Sands.
The Florida House, which is generally more averse to gambling than the Senate, has done nothing with the bill. The House speaker, Dean Cannon, a Republican who has said he is philosophically opposed to gambling, has done little to inspire hope among casino proponents.
Mr. Cannon recently said getting the bill through the House this year would be an ''uphill battle,'' with the Legislature facing a difficult budget and the onerous task of redistricting, all within two months.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Do We Live in a Less Deadly Time, or Not?

 BODY:
Robert Jay Lifton, Steven Pinker and readers discuss violence in this and other eras.
The Letter
To the Editor:
I have been studying violent events for several decades, so I was deeply interested in Steven Pinker's new book, ''The Better Angels of Our Nature,'' which claims that violence has long been declining and that this may be our most peaceful era in our species' existence. Dr. Pinker argues that, over centuries, human beings have become less prone to kill and engage in torture and other cruel and sadistic behavior.
I have not experienced the 20th and 21st centuries that way. My work has taken me to Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and I have come to see these two dreadful events as largely defining our era.
Our subsequent development not only in nuclear but also chemical and biological weapons, and our pollution of the planet with our wastes, suggest further directions of mass killing and dying. 
The deaths over the last two centuries reflect a revolution in the technology of killing. During the 20th century we saw the emergence of extreme forms of numbed technological violence, in which unprecedented, virtually unlimited numbers of people could be killed. Those who did the killing could be completely separated, geographically and psychologically, from their victims.
Millions of people were also killed during the 20th century in more old-fashioned, low-tech ways during genocides, induced famines and wars.
There is a terrible paradox here. Dr. Pinker and others may be quite right in claiming that for most people alive today, life is less violent than it has been in previous centuries. But never have human beings been in as much danger of destroying ourselves collectively, of endangering the future of our species.
We are not helpless about our fate. There could not be a more crucial moment to draw upon our gradual taming of individual violence, along with our growing awareness of the grotesque consequences of numbed technological violence, to achieve lasting forms of what can be called peace.
ROBERT JAY LIFTON New York, Jan. 3, 2012
The writer is a psychiatrist and the author of, most recently, ''Witness to an Extreme Century: A Memoir.''
Readers React
Robert Jay Lifton has profoundly illuminated the human dimension of the 20th century's most destructive events. Yet precisely because he has singled out the worst events of one century, his observations cannot speak to the prevalence of violence in the world as a whole, or to its trajectory over history. Only quantitative comparisons can do that, and they suggest that Hiroshima and Auschwitz do not, fortunately, define our era.
Contrary to decades of predictions that nuclear world war was inevitable, no nuclear weapon has been used since Nagasaki, and today's threats, as terrifying as they are, cannot compare to the now-defunct prospect of all-out war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Nor did the mid-20th-century genocides become the new normal. While the world has seen some horrific mass killings, the global rate of death from genocide has plummeted over the decades, and may now be at an all-time low.
Estimates of the carnage wreaked by the swords, pikes and arrows of earlier centuries (and by the machetes of the past one) show that remote-control technologies are not necessary for high-volume killing.
As fellow students of the human mind, Dr. Lifton and I might agree that the causes of violence lie not so much in the machinery of killing as in the psychology of killers: in the balance between tribalism, vengeance, sadism, amoral predation and toxic ideologies on the one hand, and compassion, self-control, fairness and reason on the other.
The fact that the balance can change (and, I argue, has changed) over time is perhaps the firmest ground for another shared conviction: that we are not helpless about our fate.
STEVEN PINKER Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 4, 2012
The writer is a professor of psychology at Harvard and the author of ''The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined.''
Steven Pinker and Robert Jay Lifton may be talking at cross-purposes.
Dr. Pinker may be correct that the actual number of killings has declined over the centuries, which implies that any given person today stands less of a chance of dying violently than just a few centuries ago. But Dr. Lifton focuses on concentrated instances of mass killing in the 20th century, like Auschwitz and Hiroshima. He rightly implies that humanity's capacity to kill has increased exponentially with the rise of industrialized technology.
But these are two different analyses. Dr. Pinker's is a statistical description of actual killings. Dr. Lifton's is an appraisal of humanity's potential to increase that number almost beyond imagining.
Perhaps the moral to be drawn from this comparison is that we can continue the encouraging trends that Dr. Pinker notes only if we're wise enough to heed Dr. Lifton's blood-chilling advisory.
MARK PACKER Spartanburg, S.C., Jan. 5, 2012
The writer is a professor of interdisciplinary studies at the University of South Carolina, Upstate.
Robert Jay Lifton, picking up on Steven Pinker's book ''The Better Angels of Our Nature,'' calls attention to the fact that most of the world's people today experience less mass killing than in previous eras but endure the modern danger of ''numbed technological violence.'' Citing the horrific events in Auschwitz and Hiroshima in the 20th century, Dr. Lifton rightly acknowledges yet understates the perilous conditions facing marginalized peoples in our times.
Having lived and worked in Africa and Southeast Asia for many years, I have observed structural violence there as a combination of human indignities and entrenched poverty. For the marginalized, systemic violence is a spiral of widespread rape, legalized and other forms of homophobia, chronic hunger and environmental degradation, often worsened by collusion among local elites and external interests in resource grabs.
Lasting peace requires measures for controlling technologies of violence, plus achieving human dignity and alleviating poverty.
JAMES H. MITTELMAN Bethesda, Md., Jan. 4, 2012
The writer is a professor of international affairs at American University and the author of ''Hyperconflict: Globalization and Insecurity.''
To judge whether the human species is more or less violent at different times in history, one requires a definition of violence. I have defined violence in my studies as acts and/or socially maintained conditions that inhibit human development by interfering with the fulfillment of universal human needs, including biological/material, social/psychological, productive/creative, security, self-actualization and spiritual needs.
Using this concept of violence when examining global realities, one is forced to conclude that large segments of the global population of seven billion are victims of violent acts and conditions. They experience hunger, malnutrition, material and psychological poverty, widespread unemployment, lack of health care, including family planning, lack of meaningful education and adequate social supports, and lack of a sense of security. Moreover, they are subjected to economic and sexual exploitation. Their human development is consequently severely obstructed.
These conditions, in addition to constant local and trans-local wars, suggest that the human species may be on a suicidal course rather than a course of declining violence.
DAVID G. GIL Lexington, Mass., Jan. 4, 2012
The writer is emeritus professor of social policy at Brandeis University and the author of ''Violence Against Children: Physical Child Abuse in the United States.''
Robert Jay Lifton's description of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare as well as environmental pollution provides him with ammunition for his argument that the 20th and 21st centuries reflect continuing fratricide.
We need more Dr. Liftons. We need curbs and restraints, whether sponsored by the United Nations or promoted by individuals, states or nations. We need a United Nations with sanctions to halt violence. We need to be hailed as the decade that defined peace and made war obsolete.
NANCY M. DAVIS Avon, Conn., Jan. 4, 2012
Both Steven Pinker and Robert Jay Lifton left out of their observations what can be referred to a as ''structural violence,'' a system placing profit over human need resulting in social problems like extreme poverty, lacks of security in old age, access to health care, and socially useful work at reasonable wages.
By and large, we have become dulled to such violence, which is something like the ''banality of evil'' that Hannah Arendt spoke about. These growing economic and social inequalities within and among countries can easily lead to full-scale wars, as former President Jimmy Carter suggested upon accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. Fortunately, movements like Occupy Wall Street may have awakened some of us to such inequities, which are socially violent.
JOSEPH WRONKA Springfield, Mass., Jan. 4, 2012
The writer, a professor of social work at Springfield College, is permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva for the International Association of Schools of Social Work.
Robert Jay Lifton's critique of Steven Pinker's thesis brings to mind the usefulness of the adage that not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.
Dr. Pinker's argument depends on statistics, but Dr. Lifton's rejoinder depends on the historical sense that modernity has been permeated by violence in ever-diversifying forms.
We have come to accept a permanent state of war as the ''new normal.'' Societies throughout the world, including our own, suffer from the structural violence of poverty, inequality, pollution, hunger, racism and so on. And now we read daily reports of soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder -- invisible violence that is often overlooked by the statistics.
MARK HUSSEY Nyack, N.Y., Jan. 4, 2012
I side more with Robert Jay Lifton than with Steven Pinker. My recent book looked at war frequency and fatalities since 1816. Sadly, the number of wars remains about the same.
For instance, in the period 1816 to 1825, there were eight wars continuing in the world; in 1996 to 2005, there were twice that -- a rate of 17 a year.
In the last five years, there have been eight wars a year, the same number as two centuries ago. Forty-two civil wars started in the 1990s, more than in any previous decade in the last two centuries.
Not surprisingly, the number of civil wars has gone down in the first decade of the 21st century. Statistically, something that's been the worst ever will tend to improve at the next measuring point. This also happens if one compares current death rates to World War II.
Meanwhile, as Dr. Lifton indicated, millions can die with the push of a button. We continue to live in an age of great power, great insecurity and, alas, war.
FRANK WAYMAN Dearborn, Mich., Jan. 4, 2012
The writer, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, Dearborn, is co-author of ''Resort to War: 1816-2007.''
I couldn't agree more with Robert Jay Lifton. He knows history. He knows humanity. His books about Hiroshima and nuclear war are a testimony to a human being who cares about the survival of the species.
His statement that ''we are not helpless about our fate'' points to a future where ''occupiers of the Progressive mind'' will bring the nation's power brokers to their knees, and their deadly game of nuclear roulette will become a dim memory for generations to come.
DAVID ROTHAUSER Brookline, Mass., Jan. 5, 2012
The Writer Responds
My concern is with the new dimension of violence at this moment in human history. The lethal technologies of Hiroshima and Auschwitz have vastly improved since the mid-20th century. Nuclear weapons can be made in various sizes, can continue to proliferate to other countries and possibly terrorist groups, and now enable us to do what in the past only God could do: destroy the world.
This capacity for killing in numbers nothing short of the infinite cannot be adequately grasped by statistics concerning past war-making and killing.
Nor can we simply say, as Dr. Pinker does, that ''the causes of violence lie not so much in the machinery of killing as in the psychology of killers.'' Rather, I would point to the dynamic of mind and technology, in which the technology creates a psychological attraction to ultimate power and protection from painful feelings associated with more direct forms of killing.
People who construct nuclear weapons or plan their possible use do not have to be angry. They need only be socialized to the ideology of nuclear necessity, whether for ''national security'' or ''deterrence'' or other plausible purposes.
Of course there has been more to the 20th and 21st centuries than Auschwitz and Hiroshima. But they are nonetheless defining events in that they brutally displayed this new killing potential and created the imagery of extinction that continues to haunt us.
I agree with Drs. Mittelman, Gil and Wronka and Mr. Hussey about the more insidious and widespread effects of structural or systemic forms of violence. As for Ms. Davis's generous sentiment that ''we need more Dr. Liftons,'' I have to say that there are those who think that one is more than enough.
I'm also in full agreement with Dr. Pinker and the other letter writers about our capacity to take constructive steps to diminish the dangers we face. Indeed, much protest over the years has sought to do that, whether as 1960s and 1980s opposition to war and weaponry or today's Occupy movement. We would do well to channel more of this protest into combating all violence, but especially the numbed technological variety.

HEADLINE: A Children's Story

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
When I first met Hayley Parker-Barker, in 2007, she was just Hayley Parker, a sweet, level-headed senior at F.I.T. and an intern at Narciso Rodriguez. She acquired Barker when she married her husband, Cameron, whom she has known since they were toddlers. And now they have a child of their own, Ender, and live near Salt Lake City, where Cameron is studying computer programming.
But I digress. Well, actually, careers these days are one big digression. ''We just sort of boomeranged,'' Ms. Parker-Barker, 25, said brightly of the last few years. She thought, as many fashion graduates did, that she would be living in New York, working for a big-name designer and eating pizza at Roberta's. But the recession, as well as a rekindled romance with Cameron and a return to Utah, changed that. Ms. Parker-Barker isn't complaining, though. 
Two months ago she and her husband introduced their boys' clothing line, Culdesac, on the Web, which allowed them to combine their skills and, as well, to significantly lower their learning curve. Ms. Parker-Barker isn't a novice entrepreneur. While in college she began doing hand-drawn designs on sneakers. ''Basically anything under the sun - graffiti, album covers, robots,'' she said. Patricia Field took several pairs on consignment; they sold, and Ms. Parker-Barker decided to e-mail other retailers, including Sarah Lerfel of Colette in Paris. ''One day Sarah came to my little apartment'' on the Lower East Side, she said, still sounding excited. Colette sold the 15 pairs it ordered.
Ms. Parker-Barker also got her shoes into 10 Corso Como in Milan, and some magazines, but the problem was that she was unable to make the shoes in quantity. She briefly considered having them made in China. ''I heard they have communities of artists in China that can replicate anything, even hand-drawn sneakers,'' she said.
Instead, Ms. Parker-Barker, newly married, decided to move back to Utah, to be closer to the couple's families. She taught art for awhile. And she continued to practice her pattern-making and draping. In hindsight her internships - at Kate Spade, Moschino, Narciso Rodriguez - were invaluable. ''Working at Narciso gave me a great idea of how a true designer works,'' she said. ''He does everything there.''
Last year Ms. Parker-Barker and her husband decided to create a children's line, with Cameron building the site. ''I just had a hard time finding non-graphic T-shirts for our son and things that didn't have trucks on them,'' she said. She also felt that boys' clothes looked too boxy. ''It's that age-old feeling of 'there's nothing out there, let's make something,' '' she said. Although girls can wear the Culdesac designs, she wanted to focus on boys. ''I didn't think there were good options for boys, especially in suiting,'' she said.
She looked into making the clothes in New York or Los Angeles, but factories wanted large minimum orders. In the end, she made everything in Utah, using home seamstresses she found on Craigslist. ''There's just a vast amount of local talent,'' she said.
I asked Ms. Parker-Barker what she has learned from her homegrown enterprise. She laughed and said: ''It's been unimaginable, like how hard it is to find fabric that can be reordered. It's like a secret society, with suppliers who are very old school. That was the hardest thing.'' She and her husband also realized that since she is doing the patterns and fitting herself, it's wiser to have a few styles rather many.
The first season has nearly sold out and she is working on a new collection, which will be available in March.
''Women's wear is still my love,'' Ms. Parker-Barker said. But the initiative she has shown with Culdesac has demonstrated a point to her. As she said: ''I design everything in a week. It's the fittings and the patternmaking that take the most time. That's where the real skill comes in that makes the company.''

HEADLINE: Be It Resolved

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
The Findings columnist for Science Times and co-author, with Roy F. Baumeister, of ''Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength.''

 BODY:
IT'S still early in 2012, so let's be optimistic. Let's assume you have made a New Year's resolution and have not yet broken it. Based on studies of past resolutions, here are some uplifting predictions:
1) Whatever you hope for this year -- to lose weight, to exercise more, to spend less money -- you're much more likely to make improvements than someone who hasn't made a formal resolution.
2) If you can make it through the rest of January, you have a good chance of lasting a lot longer.
3) With a few relatively painless strategies and new digital tools, you can significantly boost your odds of success. 
Now for a not-so-uplifting prediction: Most people are not going to keep their resolutions all year long. They'll start out with the best of intentions but the worst of strategies, expecting that they'll somehow find the willpower to resist temptation after temptation. By the end of January, a third will have broken their resolutions, and by July more than half will have lapsed.
They'll fail because they'll eventually run out of willpower, which social scientists no longer regard as simply a metaphor. They've recently reported that willpower is a real form of mental energy, powered by glucose in the bloodstream, which is used up as you exert self-control.
The result is ''ego depletion,'' as this state of mental fatigue was named by Roy F. Baumeister, a social psychologist at Florida State University (and my co-author of a book on willpower). He and many of his colleagues have concluded that the way to keep a New Year's resolution is to anticipate the limits of your willpower.
One of their newest studies, published last month in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, tracked people's reactions to temptations throughout the day. The study, led by Wilhelm Hofmann of the University of Chicago, showed that the people with the best self-control, paradoxically, are the ones who use their willpower less often. Instead of fending off one urge after another, these people set up their lives to minimize temptations. They play offense, not defense, using their willpower in advance so that they avoid crises, conserve their energy and outsource as much self-control as they can.
These strategies are particularly important if you're trying to lose weight, which is the most typical New Year's resolution as well as the most difficult. The more you starve your body, the less glucose there will be in your bloodstream, and that means less willpower. Because of this vicious cycle, even people with great self-control in the rest of their lives can have a terrible time remaining slim.
Self-restraint can seem harder than ever because there are so many new temptations being marketed -- high-calorie foods, distracting gadgets, time-sucking Web sites. But there are also better strategies than ever available thanks to new research in both the lab and the real world, including vast troves of data from online programs for improving self-control.
Before we get to the data, consider how one well-financed pioneer put these strategies into practice. It is not exactly a typical story -- the hero is a hedge fund manager who could afford the ultimate in outsourcing -- but it's a good outline of the future of self-control for the rest of us.
DOUG TEITELBAUM was utterly self-disciplined in business and utterly unable to control his weight. He ran a hedge fund in New York and made fortunes turning around companies like Barneys, the tony clothier, but he couldn't stop himself from reaching nearly 375 pounds.
Once, he'd been a serious tennis player, but he'd had to give it up because the weight put too much strain on his 6-foot-1-inch frame and legs. At the age of 40, convinced his own willpower was not enough, he looked for outside help.
He had a gastric band surgically placed around his stomach, and he began slowly exercising again under the supervision of Jim Wharton, a trainer on the Upper West Side who worked with professional athletes. Then a new problem arose. After Mr. Teitelbaum's company bought the Planet Hollywood chain, he had to go to Las Vegas to oversee the conversion of the old Aladdin into the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino.
It meant leaving home and living for months in a suite at the hotel above the glittering Las Vegas Strip, surrounded by an endless supply of alluring food -- all available 24 hours a day. Mr. Teitelbaum knew that his gastric band, the least extreme form of weight-loss surgery, wouldn't save him from 4 a.m. room-service pizzas. He didn't trust his willpower in the global capital of hedonism: the pounds gained in Vegas would not stay in Vegas.
So he and his trainer went on the offensive. To inspire him over the long haul, they aimed for him to lose 100 pounds so that he could return to tennis and play in a popular tournament for charity. To sustain him in the short term, they planned the foods he should eat in Las Vegas and drew up daily schedules for exercise. To make it easy for him to work out, one room in his hotel suite would be turned into a personal gym, complete with dumbbells, weight machines, exercise bike and elliptical trainer. But Mr. Teitelbaum still had doubts.
''I knew if I were going out to dinner every night, the diet would derail,'' he said. ''I knew I had to have a trainer to get me into an exercise routine. If I'm not forced to exercise, I'll end up working instead. I have to be corralled.''
Mr. Teitelbaum took the next step in outsourcing willpower. He hired Jim Wharton's son and fellow trainer, Phil, to move into the hotel to oversee his daily regimen. Every morning, Mr. Teitelbaum would weigh himself, breakfast on a protein smoothie prepared by Phil, and then work out under Phil's supervision.
Phil oversaw all the other meals, too, except for one day a week when Mr. Teitelbaum was free to eat whatever he wanted. After four months of this routine, he left Las Vegas 50 pounds lighter than when he arrived. He went on to lose the 100 pounds and more -- he hit 190, half his former weight, and took second place in the tennis tournament that had once seemed impossible.
OBVIOUSLY, Doug Teitelbaum is not Everyman. Most of us can't afford to hire personal trainers to monitor us around the clock. But anyone with a smartphone or a computer has access to outside help, and anyone can still follow his basic strategies:
SET A SINGLE CLEAR GOAL Instead of resolving to ''lose weight'' or ''eat healthier,'' set a specific goal -- say, lose a pound a week. And limit yourself to one big resolution at a time. If you're trying to quit smoking or save money, don't bother counting how many calories you consume or burn up. With a finite supply of willpower, it's tough enough to keep one resolution, as John C. Norcross and other psychologists at the University of Scranton reported in 2002 after having tracked people for six months after New Year's.
By the end of January, 36 percent of them had broken their resolutions. After that, the failures happened more slowly. Half were still keeping their resolutions in March, and by July the success rate was still 44 percent -- less than half, admittedly, but still impressive compared with a control group of people who had the same goals (like losing weight) but didn't make formal resolutions. Only 4 percent of the control group made progress.
''Contrary to widespread public opinion, a considerable proportion of New Year resolvers do succeed,'' Dr. Norcross said. ''You are 10 times more likely to change by making a New Year's resolution compared to non-resolvers with the identical goals and comparable motivation to change.''
PRECOMMIT Odysseus' classic strategy, having himself tied to the mast, still works against modern sirens. Besides the simple things you do yourself -- plan meals in advance, keep junk food out of the kitchen, schedule workouts with friends, go to the store without a credit card -- you can further bind yourself by e-mailing your goal to friends or posting it on Facebook.
OUTSOURCE You can outsource self-control by sharing your progress with friends through Twitter posts about your weight or your workouts, or by making a formal contract at Web sites like stickK.com, which was started by economists at Yale. At stickK, you set the goal and have the option of naming a referee to enforce it. You also set the penalty. It might be just an e-mailed announcement to a list of friends (or enemies), but you can also put money on the line. You can precommit to paying the penalty to anyone you designate, including an ''anti-charity,'' which for a Democrat could be the George W. Bush library. (The Clinton library is available for Republicans.)
The more you precommit, the better you do, according to stickK's analysis of 125,000 contracts over the past three years. The success rate for people who don't name a referee or set financial stakes is only 29 percent, but it rises to 59 percent when there's a referee and to 71.5 percent when there's money at stake. And when a contract includes a referee and financial stakes, the success rate is nearly 80 percent.
KEEP TRACK Nutritionists used to advise people not to weigh themselves more than once a week -- supposedly so as not to get discouraged by fluctuations -- but recent research has shown that daily weigh-ins work better. Self-monitoring is vital to any kind of resolution, and new tools will do the grunt work for you. Scales like one made by Withings will log your weight on your computer and notify your friends (if you want). Gizmos like the BodyMedia Fit armband and the FitBit clip can estimate how many calories you've burned by keeping track of your movements all day long. You can let all your financial transactions be automatically categorized by Mint.com. After analyzing 2 billion transactions by 3 million users, Mint's analysts confirmed the benefits of monitoring: once people started tracking where their money went, they tempered their spending.
Entrepreneurs are rushing to monitor just about every aspect of your life -- your health, your moods, your sleep -- and you can find dozens of their products by consulting Web sites like Quantified Self and Lifehacker.
DON'T OVERREACT TO A LAPSE One reason dieters fail is a phenomenon formally known as ''counterregulatory eating'' -- and informally as the ''what the hell effect.'' Once they lapse, they figure the day's diet is blown anyway, so they go on to finish the whole carton of ice cream, thereby doing far more damage than the original lapse.
TOMORROW IS ANOTHER TASTE One of the cheeriest new findings from diet research comes from an experiment in which people had to resist a bowl of M&M's. The ones who told themselves they could have the candy later had a much easier time than the ones who swore off M&M's permanently. So when the dessert cart arrives, promise yourself that you'll sample each of the treats, but just not tonight.
REWARD OFTEN If you use willpower only to deny yourself pleasures, it becomes a grim, thankless form of defense. But when you use it to gain something, you can wring pleasure out of the dreariest tasks. Young people who seem hopelessly undisciplined in school or on the job will concentrate for hour after hour on video games because there's a steady series of prizes. That's the feeling to aim for in the real world.
If you quit smoking, earmark some of the savings for expensive meals. If your waistline shrinks, splurge on new clothes. One new exercise monitor, the Striiv, will make donations to charity based on how many steps you take. Other gadgets and apps will award points or trophies. Even the tiniest and silliest rewards can make a difference. If you want your willpower to last all year, every little bit helps.

HEADLINE: Public Officials Found Helping Clients of Family

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN, FREDRIC N. TULSKY and KRISTEN McQUEARY. 
Fredric N. Tulsky and John Sullivan are faculty members who direct the school's Medill Watchdog program, an initiative designed to hold public officials accountable through in-depth reporting.

 BODY:
Denny Jacobs, a former state senator, had a special ally last year when the state's largest electric utility company hired him to lobby for a controversial smart-grid energy bill that many say makes it easier for utilities to raise rates.
His son, State Senator Mike Jacobs, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, sponsored the bill and actively promoted the campaign of the Commonwealth Edison Company, one of his father's clients, to win its passage.
The downstate utility Ameren Corporation also backed it. ''I'm with ComEd and I'm with Ameren on this bill,'' Senator Jacobs, a Democrat from East Moline, said in a floor speech. He even took to the floor to invite his colleagues to a reception hosted by ComEd. He denies that his father influenced him.
The smart grid legislation is one of several bills pushed by Senator Jacobs that benefited clients of his lobbyist father, a review of legislation by Medill Watchdog, a journalism program at Northwestern University, found. And Mike Jacobs is hardly the only Illinois public official supporting measures backed by close relatives. 
Medill Watchdog examined statements of economic interests of public officials, lobbying registrations filed with the City of Chicago, Cook County and the state, and records of state bills and local ordinances. The investigation found 14 elected officials from Cook County alone who, while not lobbyists themselves, are related to or in business with lobbyists.
The review found more than a dozen instances in which an official took action that benefited the lobbying client of a family member or business partner.
Reformers say Illinois has a historic tolerance for corruption. ''There are people who believe that's just the way it's done,'' said Kyle McCarter, a Republican state senator from Lebanon. ''Cultures don't change overnight.''
At the state level, Illinois law leaves it to legislators to decide whether to recuse themselves from matters that present potential conflicts of interest. At the local level, public officials must disqualify themselves if they have an ''interest,'' but the law defines interest only as owning part of a company.
Some states are stricter. After a series of political scandals, Rhode Island adopted a constitutional amendment in 1986 demanding ethical conduct of public officials. The law there restricts officials from taking part in matters if they have direct or indirect financial interest. It restricts action in matters that benefit family members, including stepchildren or grandfathers-in-law, as well as restricting votes in cases that benefit business partners.
''Illinois law is really behind on this,'' said Paula Franzese, a Seton Hall law professor and former chairwoman of New Jersey's ethics commission.
Actual or potential conflicts are widespread, public records show.
Joseph Berrios, chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, was also chairman of the county Board of Review when he was elected county assessor in 2010. All the while, he was a registered lobbyist and partner of the lobbying firm B-P Consulting. Since 2004, Mr. Berrios and his partner, Sam Panayotovich, have lobbied for the Illinois Coin Machine Operators, the group that makes and distributes video poker machines.
Mr. Berrios was a lobbyist in 2009 pushing a bill legalizing video poker when his daughter, State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios, a Democrat from Chicago, voted to approve it. Ms. Berrios also supported bills to allow racetracks to install slot machines, another measure the coin operators favored.
Ms. Berrios said there was no conflict, because her father had not lobbied her directly. Her spokesman, Manuel Galvan, said, ''The truth is she would have voted for it regardless, and her father really did not lobby her except for the first year she was in office,'' in 2003.
On the night he won election as county assessor, Mr. Berrios repeated a campaign promise that he would give up his lobbying business. He no longer registers as a lobbyist, but state incorporation records still list him as an officer of B-P Consulting, and Mr. Panayotovich continues to lobby for the coin machine operators.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Berrios said he is in the process of selling his share of the business to Mr. Panayotovich.
Last year, state Representative Angelo Saviano, Republican of Elmwood Park, co-sponsored a bill in the House to help Mesirow Financial, a global investment firm, withhold some shareholder information when bidding on state contracts. Nicholas Saviano, Mr. Saviano's brother, is the senior managing director of business development and a registered lobbyist for Mesirow.
''There is no connection,'' Mr. Saviano said. ''My brother is just an insurance salesman there. He didn't even know about the bill.'' Mr. Saviano said an outside lobbyist hired by Mesirow, William Filan, approached him to support the bill.
Few relationships are as striking as the one between Senator Jacobs and his father, the ex-senator. Lawmakers and lobbyists said the elder Mr. Jacobs often is found in his son's Senate office, sometimes with his feet propped up on a desk.
''He is a lobbyist. I am a senator,'' Senator Jacobs said. ''He doesn't lobby me. There is no financial benefit,'' he said, and he discloses the relationship on ethics statements. Denny Jacobs did not return phone calls seeking comment.
In 2007, Denny Jacobs received $9,000 from the Illinois Recovery Association, which represents auto-repossession businesses, to lobby for a bill that would regulate the industry more tightly, according to Rick Constantine, who led the association's lobbying effort at the time. Senator Jacobs introduced the bill, which died in committee.
Denny Jacobs registered last year as a lobbyist for the Rock Island Boatworks, which owns the casino in that city. Senator Jacobs had sponsored a bill narrowly tailored to give the casino a tax break.
At the time Denny Jacobs was lobbying for the smart-grid bill last year, Senator Jacobs took to the floor of the Senate and invited colleagues to a reception of ''appetizers'' and ''liquid libations'' hosted by ComEd. State records show that the company spent $3,818 on the reception and an additional $5,690 taking lawmakers to dinner that night.
During hearings before the Senate Energy Committee he oversees, Senator Jacobs allowed less than 15 minutes of testimony before adjourning, sending the measure to the Senate floor.
The move denied Scott Musser, the associate state director of the AARP, the opportunity to express his opposition. ''It was very suspect, especially on such a huge and controversial issue,'' Mr. Musser said.
Senator Jacobs said later, ''I knew I had the votes, so I moved it.'' When the measure came up for debate on the Senate floor, Mr. McCarter, the Republican senator, criticized Senator Jacobs for being the chief sponsor of a bill for which his father lobbied. Senator Jacobs walked across the aisle and thumped Senator McCarter on the chest.
Senator McCarter later complained to Capitol police that Senator Jacobs punched him; Senator Jacobs said he merely poked him. He apologized, and a local prosecutor declined to pursue the matter.
Senator McCarter, a first-term legislator, said he felt disillusioned by the whole experience.
''It was a conflict of interest then, and it's still a conflict,'' Mr. McCarter said. ''It's the way things have been done for so long, they don't even see it as wrong.''
Senator Jacobs said that supporting a bill that benefited his father's client did not involve a conflict because the legislation was ''good for Illinois.'' Many of his colleagues agreed, passing the law over the governor's veto.
This article is based on reporting by faculty and students of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.

HEADLINE: Prostitution at Age 52: Questions Linger

 BODY:
In last week's Character Study column, Corey Kilgannon wrote about Barbara Terry, 52, a prostitute still working the streets in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Readers responded via e-mail to the article. Below is a sampling of their comments.
Nicely written piece on Barbara Terry, well presented, without any moral judgments. Still, I wonder about the romanticization of prostitution that Ms. Terry seems to promote. (''It was beautiful out here then,'' she said. ''There was so much money out here, you wouldn't believe it.'') 
As a clinical social worker and therapist who has worked with prostitutes, violent criminals and those addicted to drugs, I worry mainly about the children of these clients. Ms. Terry treats what she does as a ''business,'' has her mother and grandmother pray for her and tells her children that this is how she provided them an education. And yet, the life of this parent can't but have a profound effect on her sons and daughters in unhappy and unhealthy ways. Depression, shame, anger and fear result -- emotions not unlike those that must have propelled Ms. Terry into this business, along with likely physical or sexual abuse.
She ''completed two years of college, training to be a medical lab technician,'' and yet became a prostitute just to make more money? There are questions that remain unanswered.
Gary Golio
That Ms. Terry does what she does because she enjoys its stimulation is a refreshing myth buster of the impression that it's an occupation that is never freely chosen. May she retire comfortably when she wants to. Her children are remarkably mature in that they have accepted their mother's choice of occupation.
shandilya99 Your Character Study ''52, and Still Working the Streets'' read more like a character assassination of Black women.
During a week when a Black woman became Jamaica's first woman prime minister in an upset victory, a year when two Black women won the Nobel Peace Prize and an era when scores of Black women -- and women of all races -- are working overtime, and legally, to raise their families, rebuild our economy, serve our Nation in harm's way and, around the world, challenge injustice and topple dictatorships, it would seem that The New York Times would have far more interesting and appropriate material to mine.
Trooper Sanders
At age 49, I became a call girl in Washington, D.C. I was told there was a ''market'' for ''mature'' women. My ''market'' was different from Barbara's and so was my ''office.'' My clientele stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, J.W. Marriott, Willard, the Mayflower, etc., and I worked out of my art- and book-filled apartment. It was the best job I ever had in my life! I met wonderful people, some of whom I am still in touch with. I wish I was still doing it. It was a greater education than four years of college and decades of globe-trotting.
I learned about myself. I learned about boys, men, girlfriends, wives and human nature. I became less judgmental of men. My self-esteem and self-respect soared. I don't regret this part of my life for a moment; I only wish I had done this sooner.
This isn't a career for everyone. Some girls and women become ''bitter and twisted'' or end up involved in drugs or with the wrong element. I came out of this unscathed, and I attributed that to listening to my intuition, not being greedy, and being a New York City girl.

HEADLINE: How Often to Trade? It's Tricky for Funds, Too

BYLINE: By NORM ALSTER

 BODY:
AS an indecisive market kept reversing direction last fall, portfolio managers faced a choice: Try to time its helter-skelter moves, or simply sit back with confidence in an existing portfolio, resisting the temptation to trade with each new bullish or bearish lurch.
The quandary was an acutely stressful version of the ancient mutual fund issue of turnover. Does rapid-fire trading produce worthy advantages? Or does it just run up brokerage costs and generate higher tax bills for investors? 
Morningstar has examined the question several times over the years, said Karen Dolan, its director of mutual fund analysis. Results have been inconclusive, though she seems to give a bit of an edge to funds that do not trade often. ''Some of the more successful funds tend to have lower turnover,'' she said. ''It's very difficult to have a successful high-turnover strategy.''
The stakes are high for an investor choosing funds in volatile times. And they were raised even higher in the last quarter, one of the most turbulent in history. Four times between Oct. 13 and Nov. 10, the market followed triple-digit losses or gains on one day with triple-digit reversals the next. Up 166 points on Oct. 14, for example, the Dow lost 247 points the following trading day.
Since 1900, the average month of trading has had a daily gain or loss of 0.62 percent, reports Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research. But in October, the average move was 1.38 percent. In November, it was even bigger, at 1.42 percent.
Of course, no single trading strategy can perfectly deal with a market that toggles almost daily between huge losses and gains. And managers of both high- and low-turnover funds struggled to weather the turbulence of the fourth quarter of 2011.
Gentry Lee, a portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Worldwide Growth fund, generally holds stocks for years, tending to ignore sharp market swings.
''That volatility, which might lead you to emotional decisions, is not something that distracts us,'' Mr. Lee said. ''When we buy something, we tend to hold it for at least five years. Typically, we hold for seven to 10 years,'' he added.
The fund has managed a respectable performance, outperforming its MSCI EAFE world stock benchmark during the October and November turbulence.
Low trading costs help performance at low-turnover funds like Dreyfus Worldwide Growth. The fund reported brokerage commissions last year that were well under 1 percent of net assets. High-volume traders, by contrast, can run up hefty commission bills that eat into total returns. Morningstar found 14 equity funds based in the United States that have commission costs of 2 to 6 percent of net assets, thus reducing investor returns by a like amount. Constant trading can also produce a stream of short-term capital gains on which investors must pay taxes at a higher rate.
But even low-turnover funds can be tempted by the bargains created in sharp downturns. ''The volatility provides an opportunity to enter stocks that the market may have unduly punished,'' said Aram Green, one of four portfolio managers of the Legg Mason ClearBridge Mid Cap Growth fund. Though generally slow to turn over its portfolio, the fund managers did some selective nibbling during recent market sell-offs. One buy was F5 Networks, a computer networking company whose stock peaked above $140 early last year, but by August had dipped below $70. The fund stepped in, and the stock has since rebounded.
Mr. Green favors companies with ''relatively high'' investment in research and development. Amid so much economic uncertainty, the fund also tries to gauge an investment's ability to continue financing growth. ''We test the fortitude of the balance sheet,'' Mr. Green said. ''We try to understand if a business can withstand a credit crunch and whether it could continue to invest.'' When such companies are battered in downturns, the fund is ready to pounce.
But pouncing comes with risk. Stephen Shipman, portfolio manager of the Quaker Small-Cap Growth Tactical Allocation fund, says he uses mostly fundamental measures in choosing stocks. But this high-turnover fund uses one technical measure that can automatically set off buys or sells -- and that measure cost the fund in the last quarter.
Mr. Shipman adheres to the premise that stocks showing an improving trend in their 150-day moving average are poised to perform well. After the market sell-off last summer, many stocks began to recover, so their 150-day moving averages soon showed positive trends. These were buy signals for the Quaker fund.
But those signals often turned out to be ''head fakes,'' said Mr. Shipman, as the stocks subsequently turned downward. One such issue was Dawson Geophysical. Mr. Shipman bought the stock on improvement in the moving average. But it did not, as he put it, ''have stickiness.'' Mr. Shipman sold Dawson quickly when the moving average again turned down, minimizing losses. But moves like these contributed to higher turnover, and the fund underperformed for the quarter.
Sometimes, even successful active traders do not make the one big trade they need. James Dailey, manager of the high-turnover Team Asset Strategy fund, used market sell-offs last fall to get into stock sectors that suddenly became affordable. Mr. Dailey took advantage of sharp declines to pick up shares of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley around Thanksgiving. He quickly sold the next week after shares rebounded. All three trades were ''significantly profitable,'' he said. In major market sell-offs, he explained, ''you get the baby thrown out with the bath water.''
All that trading worked well for the fund early in the quarter. But in December, the fund floundered as gold stocks, which had been big winners, sold off. ''We've been obliterated with the rest of the gold bugs,'' Mr. Dailey said on Dec. 15. So for all the opportunistic trading success, it was a failure to trade that led to the fund's underperformance in late November and December.
Undaunted, he says he's been adding to positions in gold stocks. ''We're buying into it,'' he said. ''The best time to buy is when there's blood in the streets. Even better when it's your own blood.'' Spoken like a true trader.

HEADLINE: Young, Obese and in Surgery

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Though Shani Gofman had been teased for being fat since the fourth grade, she had learned to deal with it.
She was a B student and in the drama club at school. She had good friends and a boyfriend she had met through Facebook. She even showed off her curves in spandex leggings and snug shirts.
When her pediatrician, Dr. Senya Vayner, first mentioned weight-loss surgery, Ms. Gofman was 17, still living with her parents in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, her bedroom decorated with glow-in-the-dark stars because she was afraid of the dark.
There was no question, at 5-foot-1 and more than 250 pounds, she was overweight. But she resisted, saying she could diet. 
''I'll lose weight,'' Ms. Gofman assured her doctor.
Dr. Vayner said, prophetically, ''It's not your fault, but you're not going to be able to do it.''
Along with the obesity epidemic in America has come an explosion in weight-loss surgery, with about 220,000 operations a year -- a sevenfold leap in a decade, according to industry figures -- costing more than $6 billion a year. And the newest frontier is young patients like Ms. Gofman, who allowed The New York Times to follow her for a year as she had the operation and then embarked on a quest to lose weight, navigating challenges to her morale, her self-image and her relationships with family members and friends.
But the long-term effectiveness of weight-loss surgery, particularly stomach banding, the procedure Ms. Gofman had, is still in question. And the push toward surgery on the young has brought some resistance from doctors who say it is too drastic to operate on patients whose bodies might still be developing and who have not been given much time to lose pounds on their own.
''I think it's pretty extreme to change the anatomy of a child when you haven't even tackled the other elements,'' said Dr. Wendy M. Scinta, a family practitioner in Manlius, a suburb of Syracuse, who specializes in pediatric weight loss. Unlike with older patients, she said, ''there is not a huge rush to fix it or they will die.''
One percent to 2 percent of all weight-loss, or bariatric, operations are on patients under 21, but studies are under way to gauge the outcomes of surgery on children as young as 12. Allergan, the maker of the popular Lap-Band, a surgically inserted silicone band that constricts the stomach to make the patient feel full quickly, is seeking permission from the Food and Drug Administration to market it to patients as young as 14, four years younger than is now allowed. Hospitals across the country have opened bariatric centers for adolescents in recent years.
Doctors who are open to operating on younger patients note there is substantial evidence that dieting frequently fails.
''Most of us have witnessed the medical establishment provide the same advice over and over again to kids who are overweight -- they just need to diet and play more outside,'' said Dr. Thomas Inge, a professor of surgery and pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati, who is participating in a National Institutes of Health study of weight-loss surgery on teenagers. ''I wish it were that simple.''
25 Minutes, and It's Done
Ms. Gofman has been overweight for almost as long as she can remember. The boys on the school bus made fun of her. In school pictures, she never wanted to be shown sitting. ''I wanted to be standing with people blocking me,'' she said.
After her doctor proposed surgery, she tried to lose weight but failed miserably, gaining 30 pounds in eight months. Maybe, she said, she secretly wanted to qualify for ''the easy way out.''
In December 2010, Ms. Gofman, who had just turned 19, and her mother arrived at the office of Dr. Danny Sherwinter, the wiry, fast-talking chief of bariatric surgery at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, for a consultation. Ms. Gofman was nervous but eager.
She had been sold on the Lap-Band, the only operation Dr. Sherwinter performs, because it is reversible and relatively low risk. She weighed in at 271 pounds, with a body mass index of 51, well above the minimum B.M.I. of 40, or 35 for people with at least one other related health problem, that was required for the use of the Lap-Band. (In February, the F.D.A. reduced the minimum B.M.I. for patients with another problem to 30, the threshold of obesity.)
Ms. Gofman's mother asked what would happen if her daughter wanted to get pregnant. The band would be decompressed, Dr. Sherwinter said, and ''basically you're a normal pregnant woman, eating your pickles and ice cream.''
''Yummy,'' Ms. Gofman said.
''What about the skin?'' her mother, Judith, asked, meaning loose skin that might develop after weight loss.
''That's going to be an incredible conversation,'' Dr. Sherwinter said. ''Let's just get there first.''
He told Ms. Gofman that, going by the averages, she could expect to lose about 40 percent of her excess weight, or 70 to 80 pounds. ''Which is better than any diet out there,'' he said. ''We'd be looking for you to come in around 200.''
But, he warned, ''If you don't follow along the average way, like have a milk shake every night or don't exercise at all, you will end up in the worser half.''
Dr. Sherwinter asked her to prepare for surgery by going on a liquid diet. But she privately reasoned, ''I'm about to have surgery, so I might as well enjoy myself.''
Ms. Gofman showed up at the hospital at 6 a.m. on Dec. 22, 2010, after staying up with friends the night before, too nervous to sleep. She kept asking the nurses and doctors to reassure her that she would wake up after the surgery. Her parents and her boyfriend, Abie Feldman, were by her side.
A friend sent her a text message: ''We're not fat. We're professional eaters. Why should we be punished for our profession?'' Ms. Gofman laughed.
By 8 a.m., she was under anesthesia. Dr. Sherwinter marked five points in black ink on her stomach, then used a knife to make five tiny slits, the largest about half an inch wide, through the layers of skin and fat.
He distended her abdomen with carbon dioxide so there would be more space to work, and asked for music, soft rock, to be turned on.
The operation was done laparoscopically, using a camera and surgical instruments inserted through the incisions, while Dr. Sherwinter watched on a video screen. He wrapped the band around the neck of Ms. Gofman's stomach and cinched it with a ridged buckle, like the type on swimming goggles.
Dr. Sherwinter wrapped part of the stomach around the band and stitched it into place, to prevent the band from slipping. On the screen, the white ring, prominently labeled ''Allergan,'' looked like a spaceship that had landed in alien territory.
The operation took about 25 minutes. Child Health Plus, a state insurance plan for low-income families, covered the $21,369 cost. Medicaid in almost every state and many private health plans now cover bariatric surgery, often more readily than diet or exercise plans.
On many days, Dr. Sherwinter performs three or four operations in a row. ''She's a relatively skinny woman, which makes it easier,'' he said of Ms. Gofman, using a jarring description for a woman who was 160 pounds overweight. ''When you get to the larger men, it becomes more difficult.''
Long-Term Questions
Ms. Gofman's procedure, called laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, constitutes about 39 percent of all bariatric surgeries. The other two main types are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which involves stapling the stomach into a tiny pouch and rearranging the bowel, and sleeve gastrectomy, which involves removing most of the stomach and turning what is left into a thin tube.
The risks of all the operations have declined, partly because surgeons are now more experienced and using less-invasive techniques, like laparoscopy, but also because they are beginning to operate on thinner, healthier patients.
One in 2,000 gastric banding patients, or 0.05 percent, and 1 in 900 gastric bypass patients die during or immediately after surgery, according to William Encinosa, a senior economist at the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality who analyzed 161,000 surgical records for 2009. For open -- not laparoscopic -- bypass surgeries, studies have put the death rate within 30 days as high as 2 percent. About 1 percent of banding patients and 3 percent of bypass patients develop major complications, like blood clots or perforation of the bowel, Dr. Encinosa said.
Allergan, which also makes Botox, so dominates the banding market that Lap-Band is often used as a generic name, like Kleenex or Band-Aid. But its push to win F.D.A. approval to market to younger patients comes amid early evidence that gastric banding may produce poor long-term results.
A Belgian study of adult patients found that nearly half had their bands removed within 12 years for various reasons, according to the study's principal author, Dr. Jacques Himpens: they did not lose much weight; they regained what they had lost; they had frequent heartburn or vomiting; or the band would slip or perforate the stomach.
A German study found that 30 percent of patients needed new operations within 14 years, some because they wanted bands removed, and others because of complications like slippage.
Another study in Australia found that one-third of operations on teenagers required follow-up surgeries within two years, often because of ''pouch dilation,'' when the stomach above the band becomes enlarged, which can happen if the patient does not follow the regimen and tries to eat too much.
Cathy Taylor, a spokeswoman for Allergan, noted that the studies involved small sample sizes: the adult ones had fewer than 300 patients combined, and the Australian study, two dozen. Ms. Taylor said that the adult studies did not reflect recent improvements in the band and in surgical techniques, and that the complications in the teenage study were not serious.
Stomach enlargement, she said, ''speaks to the importance of additional education for the adolescent to understand the importance of adhering to the new eating program.''
But that, said Diana Zuckerman, a psychologist and president of the National Research Center for Women and Families, goes to the heart of why teenagers are bad candidates for bariatric surgery: they are often immature, rebellious and uninterested in long-term consequences.
''It's not just you can't eat Thanksgiving dinner,'' Dr. Zuckerman said. ''You're going to have to have this tiny little meal for the rest of your life.''
A more critical question is whether surgery can lead to malnutrition, particularly in bypass patients because their shortened digestive tracts absorb fewer nutrients, which could affect bone growth, sexual maturation and other development.
''Kids across the country are getting this surgery, and we need to know the consequences,'' said Dr. Mary Horlick, project scientist for the National Institutes of Health, which is sponsoring a study of bariatric surgery in about 250 teenagers.
Surgeons who operate on teenagers say the alternative is worse: a lifetime of obesity, ostracism and diseases like diabetes. Dr. Jeffrey L. Zitsman, director of the center for adolescent bariatric surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, says that among the biggest obstacles are pediatricians and family doctors, nearly half of whom, according to a recent medical journal article, say they would never refer a teenager for obesity surgery.
But Dr. Zitsman said: ''These kids are sick, and they're going to get sicker. It's like having a precancerous condition that you can treat rather than waiting till it's cancer.''
And there are success stories. One of Dr. Inge's patients, Kelsie Blackwell, had gained weight after getting a cancerous brain tumor that is now in remission. She had bypass surgery at 16, and dropped to 130 pounds from 215. She has maintained that weight for three and a half years. ''She became much more social after the surgery,'' her mother, Tawana Blackwell, said.
Seeing Results
Ms. Gofman arrived for her first postoperative visit 13 days after the surgery, stylishly dressed in a bias-cut black sweater, blue pants and short snow boots. The scale read 251 pounds, 20 pounds below that of her last weigh-in.
But her mood did not match. ''You know how you said I can have mashed potatoes a little bit,'' she told Dr. Sherwinter. ''I measured it. I didn't feel full at all. Then I was bad. I ate a little bit more and a little bit more, and I still didn't feel full, but I stopped.''
Ms. Gofman wanted a ''fill'' of her band, an infusion of saline to make it even more constricting, even though Dr. Sherwinter had told her to wait six weeks before tightening it. She then confessed that she had also eaten a dumpling skin.
''That's probably not the best thing to do,'' Dr. Sherwinter said. ''Dumplings are fried and have mongo calories.''
''I'm just so nervous to fail my own diet,'' she said. ''There's a diner downstairs from my apartment, and a Dunkin' Donuts.''
''The key is moderation, having a little mashed potato but not a portion,'' he said.
''I'm not good at moderation,'' she replied.
Later, waiting on the elevated subway platform for the train to work, Ms. Gofman brooded about how her surgery had upset the rhythms of the household. ''My mother doesn't cook so much if there is no one to eat it,'' she said.
Three weeks later, she was down 8 more pounds, to 243. She had shrunk to size 20 from 26 and had bought several pairs of jeans. She had joined a gym and had bought a swimsuit.
''Friends give me compliments,'' she told the physician assistant, Elana Guzman. ''I go out more. It's easier walking upstairs. Exercising is not as hard. I fit into a lot of clothes I didn't fit into before.''
Ms. Gofman raised her shirt and Ms. Guzman inserted a needle into a port that Dr. Sherwinter had planted in her abdomen. Ms. Guzman squirted three cubic centimeters of saline solution, one-tenth of an ounce, into the band, which holds 10 cubic centimeters.
By June, Ms. Gofman was down to 237 pounds.
Bumps in the Road
Then summer came. Ms. Gofman took a free trip to Israel with other teenagers. She missed her clinic visits, and often ate on the run.
She would wolf down her food, and then she would run to the bathroom to vomit or sit in pain waiting for it to make its way through the band. ''I couldn't even have a single little sandwich without embarrassing myself and going to the bathroom,'' she said.
To her dismay, she discovered that ''all the fattening foods'' -- chips, chocolate -- went down easily. ''Apples and bread are hard,'' she said. ''It's annoying how hungry I was.''
Ms. Gofman started to feel judged by some of her friends. ''Some will ask a dumb question, like, how's the surgery going?'' she said. She felt like telling them, ''You obviously can tell it's stalled, right?''
By fall, she had canceled her gym membership because it was too expensive. When the hospital urged her to come in for a visit, she said she was busy. But the truth was that she had aged out of the child health insurance program, and she was embarrassed to be gaining weight.
She finally confessed to the hospital that she could not pay. The physician assistant told her they would ''work it out.''
Ms. Gofman, who has just turned 20, saw Dr. Sherwinter in November. She had regained not quite half of what she had lost. He did not scold or blame her. He tightened her band, so it now took an hour and a half to force down two scrambled eggs.
She does not want to reveal how much she weighs, but she is fighting constant hunger, and progress is slow.
Her boyfriend consoles her, she said: ''I say, 'I can't wait till I'm skinny,' and he says, 'You're beautiful the way you are.' ''

HEADLINE: News Narratives for 2012

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
AS public editor, I begin the New Year with a growing appreciation for the challenge The New York Times faces in maintaining its leadership in American journalism. I want to revisit five issues here, all requiring keen judgment on the part of the paper.
The presidential campaign: For Times journalists and their peers elsewhere, this quadrennial event is an adrenaline rush that requires sober oversight by senior editors to ensure that balance, fairness and accuracy survive the scramble to compete.
In a Dec. 4 column, I wrote about journalists' reflex to impose their own narrative on a race, a dynamic that can eclipse what candidates are actually saying. Well, as last week's Iowa caucuses demonstrated, the Republican nomination contest steadfastly resists any coherent narrative.
Early in the campaign, The Times decided to remain low key in its coverage of Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas congressman, and Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator. Their strong showings on Tuesday, following the serial derailments of other contenders, showed just how hard it is for the paper to read the plotline of this contest. 
In its coverage of Tuesday's results, The Times moved quickly to set a new narrative: New Hampshire might not be so important now (a premise that undercuts Mitt Romney, who hopes New Hampshire is important); this will be a long campaign (Mr. Romney, hoping to lock things down in January, is dinged again); Rick Santorum is the new rising star (or, I wonder, is he the next whack-a-mole victim?).
The premises of the emerging Times narrative are defensible, to be sure, but the nomination battle so far is teaching journalists a lesson: Be humble, because nobody knows what comes next.
The Times's coverage of itself: I said at the top that maintaining leadership in American journalism is a challenge for The Times. Part of that challenge is the exceptional volume and frequency of campaign coverage by newer competitors like Politico.
There is a rising tide of well-financed news organizations that, like The Times, are competing not only for readers but for advertisers in the digital arena. One of those is Reuters, which in late December reported on the lucrative exit package for Janet L. Robinson, the Times Company's departing chief executive.
Reuters said that Ms. Robinson would get not only a $4.5 million consulting fee, which The Times had previously reported, but would also be eligible to receive $10.9 million in pension benefits.
To its credit, The Times did report that before Ms. Robinson's exit was announced, the Times chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., had called a meeting with her in which he ''raised the issue of installing a different type of leadership at the company'' -- information that seemed to indicate she was being forced out.
A recent spate of news about the company, however, dictates a more in-depth effort to report on how economics and competition are affecting The Times. In addition to the sudden departure of its C.E.O., the latter half of the year saw the company paying back its $250 million debt to Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican magnate; the retirement at 56 of its top digital strategist, Martin A. Nisenholtz; the $143 million sale of its regional newspaper group; and a sharp 25 percent increase in the retail price of the Monday-Saturday paper.
But what really makes reporting on itself imperative is that The Times so aggressively covers its peers. For example, in a Dec. 13 story on the departure of The Los Angeles Times's editor, Russ Stanton, The Times paraphrased anonymous sources saying that Mr. Stanton ''did not have reporters' best interests in mind.'' Mr. Stanton angrily disputed this and told me he thought it simply wrong to allow anonymous sources to levy such an attack.
Bruce Headlam, the editor who heads the New York Times media desk, said the paper accurately reflected the sentiment in the Los Angeles newsroom. ''At least 10 current and former employees told her this,'' he said, referring to the reporter, Amy Chozick, and added, ''We also obeyed our own rules about negative anonymous quotes -- we didn't use them. But that doesn't preclude us from summarizing what we were hearing.''
My view is that, in most newsrooms, it is not hard to find staffers willing to criticize the boss anonymously. It is important to hold the line against publishing such anonymous attacks.
The European debt crisis: Last August, I said the paper's hefty investment in the Wall Street-centric DealBook blog would have been better allocated to covering the devastating developments in the euro zone. To give credit (no pun intended) where it is due, the paper went all out to cover the crisis as it crescendoed in November and December.
In a Dec. 21 story, The Times reported that the European Central Bank's decision to pump $640 billion into banks could be a ''turning point.'' In a separate column, Floyd Norris predicted the central bank's action ''may be enough to stem the European crisis for at least a few years, and go a long way to recapitalizing banks in the process.''
Larry Ingrassia, the business editor, promises more ''analytical pieces about where things are headed,'' and I applaud that.
Natural gas: I wrote a couple of critical pieces in July about The Times's ''Drilling Down'' series, but as 2012 unfolds I see a problem with the newspaper's broader coverage of shale gas, which is becoming a major energy and environment story line.
The paper writes about shale gas on the business desk, the national desk and the metro desk. In some articles, the emphasis is on the huge economic potential; in others, the focus is on the environmental threat posed by the drilling process known as fracking. The coverage seems fragmented and at times contradictory. What's the big picture?
Dean Baquet, the managing editor, told me The Times ''could probably better coordinate on the issue'' in 2012 and should have an editor to ''make sure everybody knows what everybody else is doing.''
Drone wars and beyond: Kudos to The Times here. I urged the paper last year to press the Obama administration to reveal the legal rationale for targeted drone attacks, particularly in the case of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen killed in Yemen.
On Dec. 20, the newspaper sued to force the Justice Department to disclose its reasoning. This was a worthy step, demonstrating Times leadership and the indispensable role of a free press. And it comes at a time when technology is simultaneously transforming the secret conduct of war, not to mention the landscape where The Times must compete to survive.

ARREST IN HACKING SCANDAL
POINTS TO POSSIBLE COVER-UP
Scotland Yard's arrest of a former personal assistant to Rebekah Brooks, a former chief executive of the British newspaper arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, appears to reflect the investigators' intensifying focus on the possibility of a cover-up by executives, editors and others at the now-defunct News of the World. Page 5
RUSSIAN CHURCH WEIGHS IN
The Russian Orthodox Church continued what appeared to be a push to get authorities to address Russians' grievances with the political system, with Patriarch Kirill I, the leader of the church, saying in a televised interview that it would be ''a very bad sign'' if the country's leaders failed to heed recent protests over perceived electoral fraud. Page 6 
SOUTH KOREAN CRACKDOWN
South Korea's National Security Law was enacted in 1948 to fight Communism, but critics say it has been used as a weapon against political dissent and free speech. For years, international rights groups, including the United Nations Human Rights Commission, have urged South Korea to repeal the law. Page 6
NIGERIAN CHURCH ATTACKED
Members of a radical Muslim sect attacked a church in northeast Nigeria during a worship service, part of a series of assaults that killed at least 15 people, authorities said. The church shooting came as members the sect, Boko Haram, attacked a beauty salon and fought government forces as part of their sectarian battle against Nigeria's weak central government. Page 11
FIJI LIFTS MARTIAL LAW
Fiji's military rulers officially lifted a state of martial law that had been in place since 2009, setting the stage for public deliberations on a new constitution and a promised return to democratic elections within the next two years. Page 12

UNION DELAYS TRAINING
ON DEPORTATION RULES
In a new sign of the deep dissension over immigration, the union representing some 7,000 deportation officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, has so far not allowed its members to participate in a training focused on deporting immigrants convicted of crimes. Page 14
SENATE'S ROLE CHALLENGED
To many Republicans and some constitutional scholars, President Obama's decision to ignore a sitting Senate and sidestep the confirmation process for several appointees risked nothing short of an end to the Senate's role of providing advice and consent on presidential appointments. Page 19
CASINO BILL PUT TO THE TEST
As the Florida Legislature convenes for its annual two-month session, lawmakers will face the politically volatile task of redrawing the electoral map and devising new ways to plug a $2 billion deficit in the state budget. But it is the battle over whether to allow resort casinos into the state that has the state capital's adrenaline pumping. Page 22
THIEVES SEEK USED FRYER OIL
With a demand for biofuel rising, fryer oil now trades on a booming commodities market, commanding around 40 cents a pound, about four times what it sold for 10 years ago. That makes it a tempting target for thieves, especially in hard times. Page 25

SLOWED BY AGE AND INJURIES,
STEELERS STILL HAVE IRON GRIP
In a season in which the dominant story line was often the absence of defense, the Pittsburgh Steelers have allowed the fewest yards and points in the league. For the fifth time in 11 seasons the team has the top defense, an astonishing stranglehold on opposing offenses that have changed drastically in that time. Page 2
PRESSURE MOUNTS ON KICKERS
If the 2011 regular season in college football is any kind of harbinger, a game coming down to the kicker may not end well for one of the kickers. Field goal attempts missed and made have been decisive in several key college games in the past two seasons. Page 1
THIRD TIME THE CHARM?
Any quarterback drafted as early as No. 3 over all, as Atlanta's quarterback Matt Ryan was, arrives with the bar placed very high. He will attempt to get his first playoff win in three chances, when the Falcons play the Giants in the N.F.C.'s wild-card round. Page 3
PENN STATE'S NEW COACH
Penn State University introduced New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien as its new head football coach. O'Brien takes over amid the specter of the Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal and in the aftermath of a day of caustic verbal jabs from former Penn State players. Page 5

HEADLINE: Appointments Challenge Senate Role, Experts Say

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To many Republicans and some constitutional scholars, President Obama's decision last week to ignore a sitting Senate and sidestep the confirmation process for several appointees risked nothing short of an end to the Senate's role of providing advice and consent on presidential appointments.
Senate Republicans had been using procedural rules and filibusters to block or delay the confirmation of nearly 200 agency nominations, leaving vital positions vacant and neutralizing agencies they did not like. That compelled Mr. Obama to escalate matters further on Wednesday, making recess appointments even though the Senate was technically not in recess.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, began using pro forma sessions, lasting just seconds, in late 2007 to keep the Senate nominally in session and prevent President George W. Bush from making recess appointments. 
Republicans have responded with stalling tactics that have left 74 nominees pending consideration on the Senate floor and an additional 107 bottled up in committees, many of them for economic posts or to run initiatives that Republicans fiercely oppose.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama went where Mr. Bush had declined to go. He invoked his constitutional right to recess appointments to install four nominees -- the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray, and three members of the National Labor Relations Board -- effectively calling the pro forma Senate session illegitimate.
Republicans, lawyers and parliamentary experts say the move, if it survives potential legal challenges, could herald an end to the Senate's constitutionally guaranteed right to advice and consent. Eric Ueland, who was chief of staff to former Senator Bill Frist, said that using Mr. Obama's logic, presidents could make recess appointments when the Senate chamber closed for as little as a night or a weekend.
''If his position is ever upheld, it gives any president of any party at any time the undiluted power of naming any person to any position in the federal government,'' Mr. Ueland said.
The White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that such assertions were ''belied by the Constitution, precedent and history.''
''The Senate is functionally in recess,'' Ms. Ruemmler said. ''The Senate minority cannot by procedural trick and from an empty chamber prevent the president from performing his constitutional duties.''
The White House and Senate Democrats say the experiences of Mr. Obama's nominees had become intolerable. In the two years that Mr. Bush had to contend with a Democratic Senate, 740 of his 981 nominees for civilian positions were confirmed, a rate of 75 percent. During the 112th Congress, 285 of Mr. Obama's 503 civilian nominees have been confirmed, or 57 percent, according to Senate statistics.
In all, 18 Obama nominees have withdrawn their names after their nominations languished for months. For example, Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, could not get a vote to join the Federal Reserve Board, and Terry Garcia, a top official at the National Geographic Society, gave up on his nomination to be deputy commerce secretary.
Another nominee, Caitlin J. Halligan, spent more than 280 days awaiting a vote on her confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit before it fell to a filibuster.
People still awaiting Senate action include nominees to be under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, deputy commerce secretary, deputy secretary of housing and urban development, federal housing commissioner, head of the Corporation for National and Community Service and assistant attorney general for tax policy. Senate Republicans made clear that they would use the filibuster to prevent anyone from being confirmed to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unless the law that created it in 2010 was altered to dilute the director's power or increase Congressional control.
''The Republicans' goal here is not simply to object to people who have views they think are out of the mainstream, but to shut down parts of the government they don't like,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.
Republicans say the White House and Senate Democrats share the blame. Democratic committee leaders are responsible for the scores of nominees that have not gotten through their panels, said Don Stewart, a spokesman for the Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Mr. McConnell was prepared to clear a long list of presidential nominees before the holiday break if the president had offered his assurance that he would not ram through recess appointments, Mr. Stewart added. Mr. Obama did not.
But David S. Addington, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, said all of that was beside the point. The president, he said, violated constitutional law.
''I'm kind of surprised he did it, because more so than most presidents, this guy has a personal ability to assess the constitutional implications,'' Mr. Addington said, referring to Mr. Obama's experience as a teacher of constitutional law. ''It's flabbergasting and, to be honest, a little chilling.''
On Friday, eight Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and Orrin G. Hatch, his predecessor at that post, wrote a lengthy letter to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., demanding information from the department's Office of Legal Counsel regarding the decision making on the recess appointments. Spencer Bachus of Alabama, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote a similar letter to Mr. Holder requesting the legal justification for the president's move.
Mr. Obama's action was not without some precedent. In December 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt made more than 160 recess appointments in the seconds between the moment Congressional leaders gaveled close one session of Congress and gaveled open the next. President Harry S. Truman used the two days between sessions of the 80th Congress to make a recess appointment.
The Roosevelt example came up in the last months of the Bush White House when some administration lawyers were pressing Mr. Bush to disregard the pro forma sessions, which Senator Robert C. Byrd pioneered but Mr. Reid instituted.
Mr. Reid implemented the practice to block the appointment of Steven Bradbury as the permanent director of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel amid controversies surrounding his legal opinions on interrogation techniques. Mr. Bradbury has become an advocate of the move Mr. Obama made.
Mr. Reid has stayed silent on Mr. Obama's decision. Privately, Senate Democratic aides said he backed it as part of a broader effort by Mr. Obama to confront Republicans in Congress. One of the parliamentary minds behind the pro forma session said in an interview that Democrats knew from the beginning that it might be challenged.
The move will almost certainly face legal scrutiny.
John Elwood, a senior lawyer in the Bush administration, said that any business affected by a regulation under Mr. Cordray or a decision by the labor relations board could have legal standing to challenge the action as illegitimate, because the plaintiff could claim that it was directed by officials not lawfully appointed.
If the president had flouted the pro forma sessions to name someone to a less divisive position, like the head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which provides internal legal advice, virtually no one outside the administration would be affected by the move, Mr. Elwood said. Instead, Mr. Obama rolled the dice, setting off a legal process that could last years.
''It's a high-roller move,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions last Sunday about President Obama's decision to use his recess appointment power, despite the Senate's pro forma session, misidentified the federal court to which he nominated Caitlin J. Halligan, whose confirmation was filibustered. It is the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, not the Federal District Court in Washington.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Election Draws Eyes From Across Border

BYLINE: By JULIAN AGUILAR. 
jaguilar@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Texas economists are confident that the financial upheavals long associated with Mexican elections are a thing of the past. Still, they are closely watching what this summer's presidential contest means for the peso and, in turn, Texas' symbiotic business ties to Mexico.
Texas politicians are paying close attention, too -- to whether the trade, security and energy policies of President Felipe Calderon's successor will affect illegal immigration or the state's robust trade relationship with Mexico.
Three Texas customs districts, Laredo,El Paso and Houston, rank among Mexico's top four trading partners. Collectively, they accounted for roughly $235 billion in trade between Texas and Mexico from January to September 2011, according to United States Census data analyzed by WorldCity, which tracks global trade patterns. The figures show an increase over 2010 despite the American recession and unprecedented violence in Mexico because of warring drug cartels.
Gerardo Schwebel, the executive vice president of International Bank of Commerce's international division in Laredo, said the future of this booming trade relationship partly depends on what investors anticipate for the peso. Though Mr. Schwebel and other analysts speculate that Mexico will not see a major devaluation similar to what it experienced three presidential elections ago, when political, social and economic factors plunged the country into a financial crisis, he warned that its currency is still volatile. 
''The reason behind that is, the uncertainty of Europe and the U.S. economy have added pressures to the Mexican peso,'' Mr. Schwebel said. He added that the Mexican customer must constantly measure whether to make payments in dollars, or whether to wait and see if the peso gets weaker or stronger, depending on what the transaction is.
Major reforms carried out in Mexico since 1994, the last year the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., won the presidency, have prevented the peso from plummeting as it did that year.
''Today it's a completely different scenario in the sense that Mexico's central bank has very deep national reserves,'' said Roberto A. Coronado, an economist at the El Paso branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Mr. Coronado said that as of December, Mexico had $140 billion in foreign exchange reserves, plus a line of credit with the International Monetary Fund worth $72 billion.
''You're talking about access to more than $200 billion under their disposal in case they have to react to something,'' Mr. Coronado said.
That something could be the ongoing European debt crisis, a deepening recession in the United States -- or even a shift in which a new political party takes the helm.
The P.R.I.'s Enrique Pena Nieto, the former governor of the State of Mexico, is the presumed front-runner. The leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., will field Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Tabasco, who in 2006 lost the presidential election to Mr. Calderon. Mr. Calderon's own National Action Party, or P.A.N., is choosing from Santiago Creel, a Mexican senator and former minister of the interior; Josefina Vazquez Mota, a former member of Mexico's Chamber of Deputies; and Ernesto Cordero, the country's former finance minister.
Ms. Vazquez Mota, a former campaign manager for Mr. Calderon who is vying to be the country's first female president, will most likely be named the party's nominee in February.
Mr. Schwebel said it is important to Texas businesses that the winner maintain Mr. Calderon's economic policies and a consistent plan to combat organized crime, which has contributed to more than 50,000 homicides in Mexico in under six years.
''The North American economy is 25 percent of the global economy, and we want that to grow,'' he said. ''The P.R.I. and the P.A.N. and even the P.R.D. do not want to disrupt that as they try to set up their strategy in combating the wave of violence.''
Eric Olson, a senior associate at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., said that all of the candidates have vowed, in varying ways, to rein in the military's role in the drug war and to instead rely on civilian police forces.
But it is unclear how quickly that can happen, Mr. Olson said. The relatively small ranks of the federal police force and the inherent weaknesses of the local and state police forces -- and the government's limited ability to bolster them with honest officers -- could delay the shift.
''I think there's just bound to be a transition period, and the question is how soon that takes place,'' Mr. Olson said. ''My hunch is that it will be a slow process.''
Immigration rates, both legal and illegal, will depend on more than just violence in Mexico, experts said.
Demetrios Papademetriou, the president and co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, based in Washington, D.C., said that if the economic policy of a new administration dramatically improved the quality of life for Mexicans -- by taking on tough monopolies, for example, or providing energy incentives -- more Mexicans might be inspired to stay.
''That will make the middle class in Mexico perhaps a bit better off; therefore, they spend less money on basic services,'' he said. ''Then, presumably, over four or five or seven years, the pressure for immigration from Mexico will subside further.''
He said that this is especially likely if Mexico's economy continues to grow at a faster rate than the United States', which he said is only ''sputtering forward.''
Mr. Papademetriou does not think changes in American immigration policy will significantly hinge on who becomes the next Mexican president. He said the party that wins would most likely pursue the existing strategy of trying to protect the economic ties between the United States and Mexico from immigration trends.
''They will want to protect the interest of the Mexicans living in the United States,'' he said. ''Just like the P.A.N. or any other party in Mexico, the P.R.I. will be trying to make sure that they inoculate the broader economic relationship from being impacted too much by the migration situation.''
While Texas business and policy experts keep their eyes on Mexico's presidential contest, some Mexico City election officials are looking back at Texas, working overtime to try to increase turnout among Mexican expatriates living in the United States.
This presidential election is only the second in Mexican history in which expatriates can cast a ballot from abroad. The Federal Electoral Institute, or I.F.E., which has a separate site encouraging voting from abroad, estimates that the population of native-born Mexicans living in the United States reached 11.4 million in 2010. Those who are at least 18 are eligible to vote in the country's elections.
In 2006, the first year Mexico collected ballots from abroad, the I.F.E. received about 53,000 applications for placement on the foreign voters list and accepted about 41,000; 33,111 cast ballots.

HEADLINE: Through an Economic Lens, An Election Too Close to Call

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
''IT'S the economy, stupid'' may not be either party's official slogan in this year's presidential campaign. But it might as well be.
Will Barack Obama win re-election? Well, that depends mainly on the economy.
If the economy surges, he's likely to win. If it lurches into a recession, he will quite probably lose. And if it simply muddles along at a sluggish pace, more or less as it has been doing for months now, the election could easily be a photo finish.
Those are the latest projections of Ray C. Fair, the Yale economics professor who has been studying the economy's effect on American elections for decades.
His current calculations, which he shared with me last week, show President Obama with 50.17 percent of the vote, giving him a margin so small that it falls within the 2.5 percent ''standard error'' of the equations. ''That means it's too close to call,'' Professor Fair says. 
He doesn't know the identity of the Republican nominee, but no matter. It wouldn't effect his projections anyway, nor would the issues in the coming campaign. His calculations are based almost entirely on actual economic performance.
''It's the economy, stupid,'' the old James Carville line from the 1992 presidential campaign, is the title of the first chapter of Professor Fair's book, ''Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things,'' first published in 2002. A new edition is out, and it includes his preliminary thinking about the 2012 election.
''It's very difficult to defeat an incumbent president if the economy is reasonably strong,'' he said in an interview. And regardless of the personalities of the candidates, he has found that the strength of the economy -- and whether it is improving or worsening as the election approaches -- comes close to explaining the results of most presidential elections.
While his projections show Mr. Obama leading by a hair, they depend on a fairly sanguine economic forecast, which Professor Fair acknowledges is far from certain. The logic of his forecast is clear, though, and it has usually proved reasonably accurate. It is based on transparent economic models that have been extensively peer-reviewed.
On his Web site, fairmodel.econ.yale.edu, he maintains models of the economy and of its effects on presidential and Congressional elections. There are even do-it-yourself modules that let you plug in your own assumptions about the economy. The site will crunch those numbers for you and issue fresh predictions about the 2012 election.
In November 2010, when I wrote about Professor Fair's early projections for 2012, his equations showed President Obama winning by a healthy margin. That's because, at the time, his econometric projections were even more optimistic, showing annualized growth of per capita real gross domestic product of 3.69 percent for the first three quarters of 2012.
His current projections show annualized growth in that period of 3.02 percent. And they show only one strong quarter -- one with a growth rate above 3.2 percent -- in the president's first three years in office, compared with six such quarters in the earlier estimate.
That still puts President Obama ahead in November, according to the model, but with a margin of error big enough to decide a close election. That reduces the practical, if not the intellectual, usefulness of his forecasting.
One reason for this big margin of error is that the quadrennial history of American presidential elections provides too small of a sample for more precise statistical analysis. The other reason is that this type of analysis goes only so far.
''I'm not attempting to do the job of a political scientist,'' Professor Fair says. ''I'm just assuming that there's a historical regularity in the effect of the economy on how people vote, and I'm trying, through the use of econometrics, to estimate what that regularity is, and to use it to make a prediction.''
The data, going back to the election of 1916 -- won by Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic incumbent -- shows a ''fairly remarkable'' correlation between the economy and electoral results, he says. A pure economic analysis ''seems to explain a very great deal'' about politics, Professor Fair says.
It may, in fact, explain some difficulties that Republicans in Congress now face in positioning themselves for the election. Consider the last-minute decision to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits for just the first two months of 2012.
According to the Fair model, extending those provisions through the election would add roughly 0.9 percentage points to the G.D.P. growth rate, and would give the Obama administration at least one more strong quarter.
''Approving these measures would increase the probabilities of an Obama victory,'' he says. They would add about 1.6 percentage points to the president's vote tally in 2012, giving him 51.78 percent of the vote, according to Professor Fair's latest calculations. ''In a close election, it could make a critical difference.''
His research has provided the foundations for similar efforts by others, sometimes with different conclusions.
Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at IHS Global Insights, a Boston research firm, says IHS's projections, using proprietary methods and different economic variables, show the president facing a tough battle. Mr. Gault has a bleaker ''baseline'' forecast -- 1.25 percent per capita real income growth for the 12 months leading up to the election, and unemployment of 8.8 percent on Election Day. That would produce an apparent Republican victory, he says.
''Our model suggests that it will be very difficult for Mr. Obama to win,'' he says. A more ''optimistic scenario'' -- one with a 15 percent probability, in the IHS model -- shows the president with only 48 percent of the popular vote, making the election too close to call. A ''pessimistic scenario,'' with a recession in the United States most likely set off by shocks from Europe, gives the Republicans a landslide victory; the firm assigns a 30 percent probability to this outcome.
But Mr. Gault says the economic model explains only a portion of the vote -- with significant differences possible because of traditional political concerns, like the quality of the campaigns, where the candidates stand on all kinds of issues, and whether they have charisma and seem ''presidential.''
Still, the economy is certain to be a highly significant factor, even if economic conditions in the coming months are highly uncertain.
Using Professor Fair's model, I plugged in several forecasts. The consensus of the most recent Livingston Survey of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia calls for 2.1 percent annualized growth in the first half of the year. Using that figure for three quarters, the Fair model projects the president trailing slightly in the popular vote. Then I plugged in a figure of zero economic growth through the election. The president's total was lower but the election was still too close to call. Plug in a G.D.P. decline of 2 percent -- a recession -- and the model shows the president losing.
These calculations suggest the quandary faced by the opposition party. New measures that stimulate the economy could decide a close election. But if the Republicans are obviously obstructionist, they could take some blame for a weak economy. The equations may not capture this kind of political calculus.

HEADLINE: Romney Times Four

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Des Moines.

 BODY:
FOUR of Mitt Romney's five sons -- Tagg, 41; Matt, 40; Josh, 36; and Craig, 30 -- were sitting in a hotel room in Des Moines on the eve of the Iowa caucuses last week, debating which of them was most likely to carry the Romney mantle of politics and public service. The verdict was Mr. Romney's oldest son, Tagg, or maybe Josh. But that's where things got tricky.
''Someone needs to run for leader of the brothers,'' Matt joked.
''Arm-wrestle for it,'' Craig suggested. 
The banter was playful, but it hinted at a larger truth about their place in the campaign. Even in a year when the brothers were supposed to have receded from public view, particularly when compared with their father's campaign four years ago, they have become an essential part of what sells the Mitt Romney story.
They stump for him across the country as surrogates; they offer a square-jawed, Christmas-card-ready backdrop for him onstage; and they telling humanizing ''Dad'' stories, as well as recite his basic talking points. The Romney boys: charming, amusing and relentlessly on message.
''I think one thing we offer is a perspective on his character,'' Matt said.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney's sons were a major presence on the campaign trail. They crisscrossed Iowa in an RV nicknamed the Mitt Mobile and chronicled their G-rated escapades on their Five Brothers blog.
Tagg quit his job to hit the trail full time, and Josh made it to each of Iowa's 99 counties.
But in an age when complicated, messy families increasingly seem like the new normal, there was a sense four years ago that the Romney brothers were too strapping, too wholesome and too perfect somehow.
''I wish that were true,'' Tagg said. (In a teenage act that counts as rebellion in the Romney family, Tagg once borrowed his father's car without his permission after a church dance to get ice cream with some friends, and promptly nicked another car in the parking lot. It was an expensive dent that he worked all summer to pay off).
But is there a difference this time around?
''We've put on a lot of weight since 2008,'' Craig joked.
Turning serious, Josh talked about when their mother, Ann, was found to have multiple sclerosis in 1999.
''We have our struggles like everyone else,'' he said. ''We've been through some tough family things.''
The brothers are four years older now -- all are married and have children -- and Mr. Romney urged them to focus on their own lives rather than campaign for him. ''So we kind of took his advice and decided that we'd go against it,'' Matt said.
Though only Tagg was there when Mr. Romney declared his candidacy last June in Stratham, N.H., by the time their father had squeezed out an eight-vote victory Tuesday night in Iowa, four of the Republican candidate's five sons stood onstage behind him, a striking image of a beaming nuclear family that was picked up by Web sites and newspapers across the country.
Of course, the ability to show off good genes is not limited to the Romney family. One more difference from the 2008 campaign is that the Romney brothers now have a rival of sorts: the Huntsman girls and their playful, flirty Twitter feed, which has been prominent enough to spark profiles in The New York Times, The New Yorker and GQ.
Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s three oldest daughters (Liddy, Mary Anne and Abby) have used their Twitter account, which is glamorous and lighthearted, as a launching pad for viral videos and even to try to bait Mr. Romney's sons into some mischievous banter. (They abstained.)
WHEN he was considering a second presidential run, the analytical and data-driven Mr. Romney polled his sons for their input. They all saw the downsides -- the way it would thrust them and their families into the spotlight, the limited time they'd have with their father -- but they rallied around him once the decision was made.
Which is not to say that it has all been smooth sailing. Stumping for his father in New Hampshire, Matt repeated a joke about President Obama's birth certificate and promptly had to post an apology via Twitter. ''Definitely in the back of my mind I thought, 'I don't want to own that joke,' '' Matt said.
They see their role as supporting their father, whether that means offering encouragement backstage during debates or sharing personal anecdotes about him to counter the image that Mr. Romney is stiff and wooden.
''Everyone in the country gives him advice,'' Matt said of his father. ''We'd like to give him advice, too, but we just have to bite our tongue.'' Instead, Matt added, he and his brothers' ''most important role is showing him funny YouTube videos before debates.'' (Mr. Romney is partial to clips of the comedian Chris Farley, as well as an '80s video-dating montage.)
According to the brothers, who each tried to offer their own, more humble and self-deprecating moniker, Tagg is the ''smart one,'' Matt is the ''cool one,'' Josh is the ''dreamy one'' and Craig is the ''funny one.''
''I don't know how I got the funny one,'' Craig said.
''No, you're a funny little guy,'' Josh said with a nod, prompting Eric Fehrnstrom, an adviser to Mitt Romney who was monitoring the interview from the wings, to crack up.
(Ben Romney, 33, was the absent son, at least for this trip. A medical resident in radiology, Ben is also the most un-Romney Romney. He's the only brother with blond hair and is described as quiet and focused.)
Though the brothers frequently profess reluctance to speak with reporters, their stance seems somewhat feigned. ''I don't know how I ended up in a news conference here,'' Josh said as seven reporters surrounded him last week after a rally for his father in Des Moines. He then spent the next 10 minutes parrying questions, his hands clasped behind his back.
When an Italian television reporter asked if he could explain ''who your father is and why he should be president,'' Josh politely asked, ''In English or Italian?'' before mentioning Mr. Romney's private-sector experience and how that makes him best equipped to turn around the economy.
They have developed a set of habits and rituals to tolerate life on the campaign trail. The ultrafit brothers work out together, sometimes swimming in the hotel pool. On primary nights or after debates, they often split chocolate shakes with their parents as they await the returns.
The gold standard, Tagg said, is ''a chocolate malted shake from Dairy Queen.'' (When Tagg -- a Mormon who, like his parents and brothers, does not drink alcohol -- was asked on the afternoon of the Iowa caucuses about the family's Election Day traditions, he joked, ''We're going to all go get totally wasted,'' before adding, ''Uh, I probably shouldn't have said that.'')
Pranks are another favorite of Mr. Romney's sons. Traveling through Iowa on the campaign bus, Josh recently tried to duct-tape Tagg inside the bathroom. ''I was onto him quickly,'' said Tagg, who managed to elbow his way out before the door was sealed.
''Everyone is afraid to fall asleep on the bus right now, because everyone knows Josh has smelling salts, just waiting for someone to doze off,'' Craig said.
The brothers reject the notion that they're attractive, but evidence suggests otherwise. After a gaggle of girls who had called him a ''superstar'' walked away from Josh, he grinned. ''If only I were 17, this would be great,'' he said.
Though the sons say that they're only focused on helping their father win the presidency, politics may be in their future. In 2008, Josh considered a Congressional run in his home state, Utah, and Mr. Romney introduced him at his campaign headquarters in December by saying, ''He really should be the politician in the family, not me.''
Friends and aides, as well as Mr. Romney himself, say that Tagg, who now manages a hedge fund, also has the interest and the talent for public office.
When asked, Tagg and Josh played down their political prospects -- sounding an awful lot like true politicians.

HEADLINE: At G.O.P. Debate, Romeny Eludes Rivals' Attacks

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
GOFFSTOWN, N.H. -- A relaxed and self-assured Mitt Romney sailed above the fray at a crucial debate on Saturday night as his Republican rivals engaged in a spirited fight to determine which of them would emerge as his most formidable opponent when the party's nominating contest moves past New Hampshire.
Mr. Romney, who had been bracing for an onslaught of attacks, brushed aside a critique about job losses during his time buying and selling companies at his investment firm. He defended his record as Massachusetts governor with ease, fielding only occasional questions about the similarities between his state health care law and the national version championed by President Obama.
Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania painted himself as the one candidate on the stage with the credentials to provide a pure, conservative case against Mr. Obama. He warned Republicans that Mr. Romney's pedigree would make it more difficult to push back against the income equality argument that is a central theme of the president's re-election strategy. 
''I was not ever for an individual mandate. I wasn't for a top-down, government-run health care system. I wasn't for the big bank of Wall Street bailout, as Governor Romney was,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''We're looking for someone who can win this race, who can win this race on the economy and on the core issues of this election.''
Representative Ron Paul of Texas, who did not rule out a third-party run if he failed to win the Republican nomination, attacked Mr. Santorum and Newt Gingrich. Both of them, he said, had profited from promoting the agendas of corporations to their old colleagues in Congress.
''I mean, he became a high-powered lobbyist in Washington, D.C., and he has done quite well,'' Mr. Paul said of Mr. Santorum, who, like Mr. Gingrich, had corporate clients after leaving government but did not register as a lobbyist. ''We checked out Newt, on his income. I think we ought to find out how much money he has made from the lobbyists as well.''
In one of the most personal clashes of the evening, Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich fought over military service. Mr. Gingrich said he was married and had a child, so he did not join the military as a young man. Mr. Paul said that he, too, had children, and when he was drafted, ''I went.''
The candidates gathered on the campus of St. Anselm College, just outside Manchester, three days before the New Hampshire primary moves the Republican Party one step closer to selecting a nominee to challenge Mr. Obama. The evening unfolded with far more civility than many previous debates, with a battle for second place emerging as the storyline in a central moment of the campaign.
One especially pointed critique of Mr. Romney also came from Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, who was asked whether he agreed with an anti-Romney video being promoted by a ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Gingrich. The video claimed Mr. Romney destroyed jobs while at Bain Capital, the private equity firm he helped start.
While Mr. Gingrich said he had not seen the video, he said that he agreed, adding that Mr. Romney was ''enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers.''
In reply, Mr. Romney said that it was an attack he might expect to hear from Democrats and that his company on whole created 100,000 net jobs when he was there.
The debate, sponsored by ABC News and Yahoo, was to be followed Sunday morning by a special edition of NBC's ''Meet the Press'' with all of the candidates.
''Why even stop?'' Mr. Romney joked at a campaign stop. ''Why not just go right straight through?''
Mr. Romney, who holds a lead of about 20 points in several polls in New Hampshire, may have had the most to lose from the extended exposure. But despite the harsh criticism leading up to the debate, with his rivals making boastful promises to try to tear down the front-runner, he seemed to emerge largely unscathed and showed no signs of the agitation that he displayed throughout the fall.
He glided with ease through constitutional issues surrounding same-sex marriage, contraception and abortion, drawing laughter and applause when he suggested that those were not the most important matters of the day.
As the field narrowed to six after the Iowa caucuses, with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota dropping out, Mr. Santorum took his first turn at the center of the stage. He was also the subject of criticism, with Mr. Paul declaring: ''You're a big spender, that's all there is to it.''
A prolonged exchange broke out between Mr. Paul and Mr. Santorum, who are battling to be the leading alternative to Mr. Romney on Tuesday and beyond. At one point, a microphone on the debate stage echoed loudly, and Mr. Santorum tried to lighten the moment. ''They caught you not telling the truth, Ron,'' he said with a smile.
The deeper scrutiny of Mr. Santorum, following his strong showing in Iowa last week, clearly benefited Mr. Romney early in the debate. Mr. Romney stood comfortably above the fray, watching during a period of sharp squabbling as Mr. Paul attacked Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich, and Mr. Santorum attacked Mr. Paul.
Mr. Romney seemed more than happy to let them go, saying: ''I don't want to be critical of people on this stage.''
With three days left until the New Hampshire primary, time was quickly running short for some of the Republican candidates to make their case. Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who has been lagging in the polls and has staked his candidacy on the outcome here, passed on nearly every invitation to criticize the others.
He highlighted his experience creating jobs while he was governor of Utah, saying, ''It's important for people to look at our records.''
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who has bowed out of actively competing here, arrived on Saturday to try once again to resurrect his candidacy in advance of the Jan. 21 South Carolina primary. He was not called upon to speak until 15 minutes into the debate.
As he sought to make a mark, Mr. Perry went as far as to say that American troops should return to Iraq, calling the recent withdrawal ''a huge error for us.''
Mr. Gingrich, who has spent much of the last week complaining about attacks from other campaigns, had pledged to go aggressively after Mr. Romney. But he barely followed through, instead drawing applause, by criticizing the news media.
Early in the debate, Mr. Gingrich repeatedly referred to an article that he said appeared in The New York Times ''two days ago,'' about a company bought by Bain. During the time that Bain owned the company, it laid off hundreds of workers. But Mr. Gingrich appears to have misspoken; he was apparently referring to a Jan. 6 Reuters article.
At the 14th Republican debate of the primary season, the change in the dynamic was evident all evening. After getting only limited time during previous debates, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Paul took more questions and went after each other with new intensity.
''You're a big-government conservative,'' Mr. Paul told Mr. Santorum, referring to his votes for the No Child Left Behind Act during George W. Bush's presidency and Mr. Bush's Medicare prescription drug benefit. ''To say you're a conservative, I think it's a stretch, but you've convinced a lot of people of it.''
Mr. Santorum shot back: ''I think I've convinced a lot of people of it because I think my record is pretty good,'' adding, ''I'm not a libertarian, Ron, I agree with you. You vote against everything; I don't vote against everything.''
Through it all, Mr. Romney was silent for several minutes at a time. He turned from side to side and watched his fellow Republican candidates. When he did speak, he seemed eager to turn the conversation to a condemnation of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy.
''The president is trying to take responsibility for the economy,'' Mr. Romney said in response to a question about signs of improving job growth. ''It's like the rooster taking responsibility for the sunrise -- he didn't do it.''

HEADLINE: Paved, But Still Alive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN; ddradrawi

 BODY:
THERE are said to be at least 105 million and maybe as many as 2 billion parking spaces in the United States.
A third of them are in parking lots, those asphalt deserts that we claim to hate but that proliferate for our convenience. One study says we've built eight parking spots for every car in the country. Houston is said to have 30 of them per resident. In ''Rethinking a Lot,'' a new study of parking, due out in March, Eran Ben-Joseph, a professor of urban planning at M.I.T., points out that ''in some U.S. cities, parking lots cover more than a third of the land area, becoming the single most salient landscape feature of our built environment.''
Absent hard numbers Mr. Ben-Joseph settles on a compromise of 500 million parking spaces in the country, occupying some 3,590 square miles, or an area larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. If the correct number is 2 billion, we're talking about four times that: Connecticut and Vermont.
Either way it's a lot of pavement. 
As the critic Lewis Mumford wrote half a century ago, ''The right to have access to every building in the city by private motorcar in an age when everyone possesses such a vehicle is the right to destroy the city.'' Yet we continue to produce parking lots, in cities as well as in suburbs, in the same way we consume all those billions of plastic bottles of water and disposable diapers.
What to do?
For starters we ought to take these lots more seriously, architecturally. Many architects and urban planners don't. Beyond greener designs and the occasional celebrity-architect garage, we need to think more about these lots as public spaces, as part of the infrastructure of our streets and sidewalks, places for various activities that may change and evolve, because not all good architecture is permanent. Hundreds of lots already are taken over by farmers' markets, street-hockey games, teenage partiers and church services. We need to recognize and encourage diversity. This is the idea behind Parking Day, a global event, around since 2005, that invites anybody and everybody to transform metered lots. Each year participants have adapted hundreds of them in dozens of countries, setting up temporary health clinics and bike-repair shops, having seminars and weddings.
That's akin to the approach of an architecture and planning firm in Brooklyn called Interboro Partners. Several years ago it entered a competition in Los Angeles focused on dead shopping malls. Entrants picked malls they wanted to revive. Most contestants proposed erecting office parks or retirement homes or apartment buildings. Interboro took a different approach.
It chose the Dutchess County Mall in Fishkill, N.Y. Opened with fanfare in spring 1974 as another consumer paradise and symbol of automotive and suburban progress, it was built on the promising corner of a major highway interchange in the heart of a county poised for growth. But development ended up gravitating elsewhere, and by the early 1990s the mall was half-empty; by 1998 it was officially closed. To drivers passing it on Interstate 84 it looked like every other dead mall, floating in the usual asphalt sea of parking spaces.
But Interboro's partners saw something else there: life.
Of course suburban and urban lots are not all the same, and it's glib to say we should just buy fewer cars. Yes, we ought to wean ourselves from automobiles in favor of public transportation. We rely too much on cars because our public transit systems are often so abysmal. But cars aren't going away anytime soon, certainly not in the suburbs or in cities like Los Angeles, and we can't just wish away lots in which to park them. John Brinckerhoff Jackson, the landscape writer who died in 1996, years ago pleaded that the parking lot be treated like the city common, with its own community values.
But what does this entail? For big cities like New York it is high time to abandon outmoded zoning codes from the auto-boom days requiring specific ratios of parking spaces per housing unit, or per square foot of retail space. These rules about minimum parking spaces have driven up the costs of apartments for developers and residents, damaged the environment, diverted money that could have gone to mass transit and created a government-mandated cityscape that's largely unused. We keep adding to the glut of parking lots. Crain's recently reported on the largely empty garages at new buildings like Avalon Fort Greene, a 42-story luxury tower near downtown Brooklyn, and 80 DeKalb Avenue, up the block, both well occupied, both of which built hundreds of parking spaces to woo tenants. Garages near Yankee Stadium, built over the objections of Bronx neighbors appalled at losing parkland for yet more parking lots, turn out never to be more than 60 percent full, even on game days. The city has lost public space, the developers have lost a fortune.
The Pensacola Parking Syndrome is a term of the trade used to describe a city that tears down its old buildings to create parking spaces to entice more people downtown, until people no longer want to go there because it has become an empty lot. Cities should let the free market handle the construction of new parking spaces. People who buy or rent new homes can pay extra if they want someplace to park a car. Municipalities can instead cap the maximum number of lots or the ratio of spaces to dwellings and offices.
Back in 1973 Boston instituted a successful parking freeze in concert with the Environmental Protection Agency, an approach that Los Angeles attempted to follow until Congress blocked the tactic, bouncing the ball over to city courts. Since then Cambridge, Mass., has set its own limit on parking spaces. More cities could now do the same.
As for the perception that parking spots are hard to find, as if everyplace were Midtown Manhattan, the reality is that a space may not be open precisely when and where a driver wants it. But the journal Transportation Science has shown that drivers who parked at the first available spot and then walked to their destination on average saved considerable time (never mind savings in gasoline and anxiety) over those who cruised around until a ''better'' spot opened.
Driver behavior is revealing. We ignore the stripes and take shortcuts when lots are not full, but then are inclined to slow down and become more alert to pedestrians when we do so, a fact that led a Dutch traffic engineer to remove lights and other markings in the town of Drachten. Traffic accidents there declined. Various cities in northern Europe have followed suit, experimenting with removing traffic controls in areas shared by cars, pedestrians and cyclists -- creating lots that function, in effect, as public squares.
I recently called John Kaliski, who runs Urban Studio in Los Angeles, and asked him whether this approach might work in car-centric Southern California, and he said it could. ''But you would have to be rigorous about how you applied it,'' he cautioned. ''Liability is different in the United States than in Europe.'' He recalled the case of an elderly driver in 2003 who killed pedestrians as he plowed through a farmers' market in Santa Monica, prompting a slew of legal suits and new regulations.
It's a no-brainer to argue that lots should be greener. The biggest advancements in lot designs have involved porous surfaces, more trees for shade and storm-water collection facilities. In Turin, Italy, Renzo Piano transformed part of the area around Fiat's Lingotto factory by extending a grid of trees from the parking lot into the building's formerly barren courtyards, creating a canopy of soft shade and a ready metaphor: nature reclaiming the postindustrial landscape. At Dia:Beacon, the Minimalist museum up the Hudson River, the parking lot designed by the artist Robert Irwin in collaboration with the firm OpenOffice is one with the art inside, trees in rigorous ranks rising subtly toward the front door. It's an example not only of green design but also of treating parking lots the way people actually experience them: as the real entrance to a building.
But these are exceptions.
Which gets us back to Interboro and the parking lot of the Dutchess County Mall. By the late 1990s its developer had decided to land-bank the site, hoping its price would rise along with property values in the area. This meant that the mall and its lot had an absentee landlord.
But Interboro noticed that the parking lot was quietly being used as a depot and stop by bus lines. A hot dog truck had set up shop there. Patrons at a drive-through McDonald's ate in their parked cars. Truckers slept there overnight. The Fishkill flea market took over on weekends, and a graphic design firm and a couple of banks and a post-office processing center converted vacant mall stores into offices.
In short, said Daniel D'Oca, one of Interboro's partners, ''what looked dead wasn't, but you would have missed it if you just passed by it with a predisposed idea about sprawl.''
The firm wanted ''to be responsive to the ways people already used the space,'' elaborated Tobias Armborst, another partner, by making temporary interventions that ''enhanced its urbanity.'' The notion was that these interventions might open the door to various possible futures. Interboro proposed that the lot become, in effect, a laboratory for ''small, cheap, feasible experiments,'' is how Georgeen Theodore, a third Interboro partner, put it. ''We embraced the fact that it was functioning for Fishkill as a version of Jane Jacobs's sidewalk,'' she said. ''No one would disagree with permeable surfaces or solar panels. But it's not as obvious to see lots for what they are, as public spaces where diverse people meet.''
So the firm imagined installing fitness and day care centers, which the postal workers said they wanted, and turning part of the mall over to a nightclub, so that the parties already happening in the lot could move indoors. The lot would get a beer garden, a recycling facility, a used-car business, a hiking trail entrance where the lot abutted protected wilderness, and a summer stage that exploited, as a readymade band shell, the existing porte-cochere of the mall's defunct Jamesway.
''The point was to think of the whole lot not as a blight but as a space for architectural invention worth engaging with, warts and all,'' Ms. Theodore stressed.
In the end the developer didn't take up Interboro on its plan. But the scheme served its rhetorical purpose. Lots don't need to be dead zones. And the best architecture can be light on its feet.

HEADLINE: Paved, But Still Alive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
THERE are said to be at least 105 million and maybe as many as 2 billion parking spaces in the United States.
A third of them are in parking lots, those asphalt deserts that we claim to hate but that proliferate for our convenience. One study says we've built eight parking spots for every car in the country. Houston is said to have 30 of them per resident. In ''Rethinking a Lot,'' a new study of parking, due out in March, Eran Ben-Joseph, a professor of urban planning at M.I.T., points out that ''in some U.S. cities, parking lots cover more than a third of the land area, becoming the single most salient landscape feature of our built environment.''
Absent hard numbers Mr. Ben-Joseph settles on a compromise of 500 million parking spaces in the country, occupying some 3,590 square miles, or an area larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. If the correct number is 2 billion, we're talking about four times that: Connecticut and Vermont.
Either way it's a lot of pavement. 
As the critic Lewis Mumford wrote half a century ago, ''The right to have access to every building in the city by private motorcar in an age when everyone possesses such a vehicle is the right to destroy the city.'' Yet we continue to produce parking lots, in cities as well as in suburbs, in the same way we consume all those billions of plastic bottles of water and disposable diapers.
What to do?
For starters we ought to take these lots more seriously, architecturally. Many architects and urban planners don't. Beyond greener designs and the occasional celebrity-architect garage, we need to think more about these lots as public spaces, as part of the infrastructure of our streets and sidewalks, places for various activities that may change and evolve, because not all good architecture is permanent. Hundreds of lots already are taken over by farmers' markets, street-hockey games, teenage partiers and church services. We need to recognize and encourage diversity. This is the idea behind Parking Day, a global event, around since 2005, that invites anybody and everybody to transform metered lots. Each year participants have adapted hundreds of them in dozens of countries, setting up temporary health clinics and bike-repair shops, having seminars and weddings.
That's akin to the approach of an architecture and planning firm in Brooklyn called Interboro Partners. Several years ago it entered a competition in Los Angeles focused on dead shopping malls.

HEADLINE: Disruptions: Taxi Supply and Demand, Priced by the Mile

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: On New Year's Eve, a one-mile trip cost $135, and while customers were unhappy, the Uber car service company expects to keep dynamic pricing on big party holidays. 

 BODY:
2:59 p.m. | Updated Adding information about how and when Uber customers are notified of surge pricing. 
On New Year's Eve, Dan Whaley, a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco, got into a black Town Car and was driven one mile to a holiday party. The ride cost him $27. At the end of the night out, Mr. Whaley took a Town Car home from the party. This time, the exact same ride cost $135.
Mr. Whaley was using Uber, a service that allows people to order livery cabs through a smartphone application. On New Year's Eve, Uber, a start-up in the city, adopted a feature it called "surge pricing," which increases the price of rides as more people request them.
Although New Year's Eve was very profitable for Uber, customers were not happy. Many felt the pricing was exorbitant and they took to Twitter and the Web to complain. Some people said that at certain times in the evening, rides had spiked to as high as seven times the usual price, and they called it highway robbery. Uber's goal is to make the experience as simple as possible, so customers are not shown their fare until the end of the ride, when it is automatically charged to their credit card. While the app does not show the total fare in dollars when customers book a ride, Uber did show a "surge pricing" multiple to customers booking rides for New Year's Eve. 
Economists call this "dynamic pricing." It is deployed by only a small number of businesses, like hotels, airlines and car rental companies, which raise prices on weekends and holidays when demand surges.
So why do people accept this pricing from airlines and hotels but became irate with Uber?
"With regular day-to-day decisions, consumers like predictability and don't like to see prices change," said Dirk Bergemann, a professor of economics at Yale. "People are trained that there is a level of predictability with purchases. There will be a regular price for a bottle of ketchup and a relatively average price for a taxi."
Professor Bergemann said that as technology continually made it easier for companies to change prices in real time, businesses would try to do so. He said, however, that companies would have to be prepared for repercussions.
In 1999, Coca-Cola's chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, mused about vending machines that would raise prices for drinks as the temperature rose. The outcry from customers was a public relations nightmare, and the company denied it was testing such a product.
Amazon suffered a similar uproar in 2000 when it reportedly experimented with DVD prices.
But there is another way to think about it. "Sure it's about the regularity, but someone who is driving a car on a regular occurrence deals with dynamic pricing all the time: it's called gas prices," said Travis Kalanick, co-founder of Uber. "Because this is so new, it's going to take some time for folks to accept it. There's 70 years of conditioning around the fixed price of taxis."
Some consumers might argue that price increases are fine, but there is a ceiling, and when that is breached, it begins to look as if a company is taking advantage of its customer. Charging someone $135 to travel a mile on New Year's Eve could easily get lumped in that category - unless you are completely rational.
"If you're a pure economist and following the laws of supply and demand, the argument is that if someone is willing to pay a price, then it is not excessive," said Liran Einav, an associate economics professor at Stanford. "But that all depends on the type of long-term relationship you want to build with your customers."
You might think that a technology company shaking up the taxi industry would want to maintain relationships with its customers. But that's certainly not the lesson Uber learned.
"I don't think that the constantly changing car price is necessarily where we want to go," Mr. Kalanick said. "But on Halloween and New Year's, it's here to stay."
An earlier version of this column referred incompletely to Uber's practices. While the app does not display the final fare in dollars, customers who booked for New Year's Eve were shown a "surge pricing" multiple that applied for that night.

10:54 A.M. | Fact Check: Gingrich on E.P.A. Regulating Farm Dust
Mr. Gingrich, when asked about his proposal to replace the Environmental Protection Agency with a "solutions agency,'' cited an example of what he considers bureaucratic overreach by current regulators: controlling dust from farms in states like Iowa and Arizona. 
The E.P.A.'s supposed effort to regulate "farm dust'' has become something of an urban legend. Mr. Gingrich often says while campaigning that he learned of it from Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.
The E.P.A. itself has denied that it ever considered regulating farm dust. 
The agency has long had authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate "coarse particles,'' soot or dust that emerges mostly from smokestacks, automobiles and demolition sites and has been shown to contribute to heart disease and other health problems.
Although "farm dust" falls under the definition of coarse particles, the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, testified in March before the House Agriculture Committee that her agency did not plan to regulate dust on farms.
She said in a letter to the House in October that she would not change current standards for regulating particles. Nonetheless, Republicans in the House proposed the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act in November. In testimony, the E.P.A.'s chief air quality officer reaffirmed the agency's decision not to change existing standards, adding, "I am hopeful that this announcement ends the myth that the agency has plans to tighten regulation of 'farm dust.' ''
- 
10:33 A.M. | Fact Check: Santorum's Response to Gay Rights
Mr. Santorum delivered an anodyne response to a question on gay rights during the debate - an issue that has prompted him in the past to make some of his most provocative and controversial remarks.
Asked what would happen if his son told him he was gay, Mr. Santorum said, "I would love him as much as I did the second before he said it."
But Mr. Santorum has been asked that question before, and he gave a very different answer then. In a 2003 interview with GQ, he was asked what he would tell a son who admitted to having an attraction to men. He essentially said his son should remain celibate. 
"I would try to point out to them what is the right thing to do. And we have many temptations to do things we shouldn't do," he told the magazine. "It doesn't mean you have to submit."
Mr. Santorum added that all parents should help steer their children in a direction "that would lead them to a better and happier life."
Then, when pressed on whether he would still love his son, he replied, "It's all you can do." 
The GQ interview came after Mr. Santorum likened homosexuality to a host of illegal and devious acts.
He told The Associated Press in 2003, "If the Supreme Court says you have the right to consensual gay sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery, you have the right to anything."
- 
10:31 A.M. | Romney and Gingrich on the 'Super PAC' Battles
Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich appear to agree on one thing: the "super PAC" war will continue.
Mr. Romney refused to apologize for the torrent of negative ads that rained down on Mr. Gingrich's head in Iowa, but conceded, "Anything wrong I'm opposed to."
"I haven't seen them," he said, referring to the ads. "And as you know, under the law, I can't direct their ads."
But then he ticked off all the charges in the super PAC ads, saying that each one was true as far as he knows. He also slammed Mr. Gingrich for calling him a liar. 
Mr. Gingrich seemed incredulous: "You think my rhetoric was over the top, but your ads were totally reasonable?"
But asked by the moderator, David Gregory, whether they would both request that all the super PAC ads be taken down, neither assented.
"I'm taking his advice," Mr. Gingrich said, referring to Mr. Romney. "It takes broad shoulders to run."
That could be because Mr. Gingrich's super PAC just recently got a $5 million infusion from the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson.

10:23 A.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Job Creation in Massachusetts
Earlier in the debate, Mr. Romney said he had created more jobs in Massachusetts than President Obama has in the entire country. Since he did not provide figures, the basis for his claim is unclear. But in 2011, nearly two million jobs were added nationwide. During Mr. Romney's term as governor from 2003 to 2007, employment grew by about 60,000 jobs, or 15,000 a year on average, according to The Associated Press, which issued a fact-checking report when Mr. Romney boasted of his job-creation record during a debate in September.
- 
10:22 A.M. | McCain on Obama 
David Gregory dug up a quote from Senator John McCain in which he said people should not doubt President Obama's patriotism or his belief in what the founders of America wanted for the country.
He wanted to know whether the candidates agreed, but he didn't ask Mitt Romney, who has been endorsed by Mr. McCain.
Instead, he directed the question to Rick Perry, who didn't hesitate.
"We have a president that's a socialist," Mr. Perry said. "I don't think our founding fathers wanted to make our country as socialist county."
He added that Mr. Obama "talks about having a more powerful, more centralized, more consuming federal government."
It would have been interesting to hear from Mr. Romney, who repeatedly says that Mr. Obama is trying to move the country to a "European model" of economics.
- 
10:19 A.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Gay Rights
Mitt Romney, when asked about what he had done to advance gay rights, replied, "I don't discriminate," and recalled his appointment of a gay man to his cabinet as governor of Massachusetts.
His response about the appointment is accurate: Mr. Romney's secretary of transportation, Dan Grabauskas, is gay.
The first half of his response ("I don't discriminate") is the subject of a spirited debate. Mr. Romney has long argued that marriage, in the eyes of the law, should be defined as a union between a man and a woman. He aggressively fought the legalization of gay marriage in Massachusetts, and he opposes it nationally, by supporting the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
Many gay rights advocates argue that any politician, like Mr. Romney (and President Obama), who opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage is practicing a form of discrimination against gay men and women. Many who oppose same-sex marriage argue that since there are alternatives in place, like domestic partnerships and civil unions, which grant rights to gay couples in some states, denying them "marriage" is not discrimination.
- 
10:11 A.M. | Candidates Oppose Federal Heating Oil Assistance
Heating oil assistance is a big deal in New Hampshire, especially in winter.
But that didn't stop the Republican candidates from basically saying they opposed the federal program.
"What we don't need is to have a federal government saying we have to solve all the problems," said Mr. Romney, adding that he would send the program, and ones like it, to states to run.
Mr. Paul said federal subsidies for products like heating oil are "bad economic policies" and "economically, it does a lot of harm."
Mr. Gingrich said freeing up exploration for more sources of oil would lower the price of energy without the need for subsidies.
Will that play well in New Hampshire, where many people look to the federal government to help keep the price of heating oil down?
It has been - so far - a mild winter, so that may make the issue less of a potent problem for the candidates.
- 
10:11 A.M. | Gingrich and the E.P.A.
Newt Gingrich loves to attack the Environmental Protection Agency, and did so again today.
He called it "increasingly radical, increasingly imperious," and said, "This is an agency out of touch with reality that I believe is incorrigible."
- 
10:08 A.M. | Fact Check: Huntsman on Oil
Responding to a question about cuts in a program that helps low-income families pay for heating oil, Mr. Huntsman said many people were in need and the program should be supported until the nation moves to more diversified sources of energy and reduced imports of oil.
He went on to say that federal government policy "always favors one product - and that's oil." The "one-product monopoly," he said, should be broken up. Mr. Huntsman did not have an opportunity to fully explain what he meant, but it appeared that he was referring to government tax policies that have supported the oil industry for nearly 100 years through various subsidies and incentives, which today reach about $3.5 billion a year. President Obama has called for ending these tax breaks, but he has been opposed by the oil industry and by most Republicans in Congress.
Mr. Huntsman made no reference to federal tax breaks and other subsidies for other forms of energy, including coal, nuclear, solar, wind and ethanol, all of which have received billions of dollars in tax incentives over the past several decades. So while the oil industry has enjoyed favored treatment for years, so have most other forms of energy.
- 
10:02 A.M. | Candidates Respond to Question About Gay Rights
The candidates just had an interesting conversation about gay rights - one that was probably carefully watched in South Carolina, where social issues are important.
Asked about his support for gay rights, Mr. Romney said he did not discriminate. "In the appointments I made," he said, "a member of my cabinet was gay."
Confronted with his 1994 statement that he would "stand up" for gay rights in his party, Mr. Romney said he would not discriminate but did not support gay marriage. 
Asked when he had last stood up for gay rights, he said, "Right now."
Asked the same question, Mr. Santorum stressed that he supported "equal rights" for gays, but opposed changes to laws that would allow things like same-sex marriage. But he stressed that he disagreed in a respectful way with supporters of gay rights.
"We may not agree. That's why we leave it open to the public," Mr. Santorum said. 
Asked what would happen if his son came to him and said he was gay, Mr. Santorum said, "I would love him as much as I did the second before he said it."
- 
9:54 A.M. | Fact Check: Romney on Repealing Health Care Law
Mitt Romney repeated a claim he has made in past debates - repealing the Obama health care law would save money - that has been refuted by nonpartisan fact checkers and analyses like those of the Congressional Budget Office.
He said repealing the law would save $95 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that the health care law would reduce deficits by $210 billion in the first decade from fiscal year 2012 through 2021 given taxes, fees and health cost reductions mandated by the law. Similarly, the office reported that legislation passed last year by the House Republican majority to repeal the law would increase deficits by the same amount.
 While the budget office has declined to put an exact figure on projected savings of the health care law beyond the first decade, given the uncertainty of such long-range projections, it concluded that the savings would be in the range of half a percentage point of the nation's gross domestic product, a substantial amount. The Obama administration has projected that the savings in the second decade will exceed $1 trillion.
In November, the nonpartisan fact-checking group Politifact said of Mr. Romney's claim: "We rate his statement false."
- 
9:49 A.M. | Fact Check: Ron Paul on Spending Overseas
When Mr. Paul talks about ending overseas spending, he is referring to defense spending primarily, because that's where the vast bulk of overseas spending comes from. It is certainly not what it sounds like - foreign aid - since that is only 1 percent of federal spending.
- 
9:48 A.M. | Press Release From the Past
Rick Santorum is no fan of Mitt Romney. But as the Romney campaign was quick to remind reporters today, it was a bit different four years ago, when Mr. Santorum backed Mr. Romney. Reminded about his endorsement of Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum noted that his praise was "vis-a-vis John McCain," who was Mr. Romney's chief rival in 2008.
From Mr. Romney's campaign moments ago:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
PUB-DATE: February 1, 2008
FORMER U.S. SENATOR RICK SANTORUM (R-PA) 
ENDORSES GOVERNOR MITT ROMNEY
Boston, MA - Today, former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) announced his endorsement of Governor Mitt Romney. Senator Santorum served two terms in the United States Senate where he was also Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, the third-ranking member of the Republican leadership.
"In a few short days, Republicans from across this country will decide more than their party's nominee. They will decide the very future of our party and the conservative coalition that Ronald Reagan built. Conservatives can no longer afford to stand on the sidelines in this election, and Governor Romney is the candidate who will stand up for the conservative principles that we hold dear," said Senator Santorum. "Governor Romney has a deep understanding of the important issues confronting our country today, and he is the clear conservative candidate that can go into the general election with a united Republican party."
- 
9:46 A.M. | A Promise for Change in Washington 
Lots of "Kumbaya" optimism this morning about changing the way Washington works - an echo of President Obama's promise from 2008.
Despite their tough rhetoric about President Obama and Democrats in Congress, the Republican candidates are describing what they say will be an easy and effective working relationship in Washington.
Mr. Gingrich said Democrats and Republicans could work together "if people of good will, even if they're partisans, come together, work it out." He added, "It can be done with real leadership."
Mr. Romney echoed the same optimism.
"We can work together, Republicans and Democrats," said Mr. Romney, who routinely attacks Democrats as taking the country toward a European socialist government model. Despite big differences, he said, "we really do have areas of common interest."
Rick Santorum agreed, too, citing work he did with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, on welfare reform.
"We were able to compromise," he said.
- 
9:42 A.M. | Fact Check: Romney Running for President While Governor
Mr. Gingrich assailed Mr. Romney as a career politician who never stopped running for office - not even when he was governor of Massachusetts.
"You've been out of state for something like 200 days preparing to run for president," said Mr. Gingrich, referring to Mr. Romney's last year as Massachusetts governor, in 2006. "You didn't have the interlude of citizenship while you thought about what to do. You were running for president while you were governor. You were going all over the country."
Whatever Mr. Romney's state of mind at the time, the numbers are accurate: In 2006, Mr. Romney spent 212 days traveling outside Massachusetts, according to news reports, in what was widely regarded as the opening stage of his first campaign for president, which began the following year. He also spent his final year in office serving as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and spread millions of dollars to other Republican candidates through a political action committee, collecting chits for his expected run.
Mr. Romney's decision not to seek a second term as governor - unusual for a politician of his age at the time - was also seen as a signal of his intent to run for higher office.
Mr. Romney had previously run for United States Senate, in a 1994 race against Edward M. Kennedy. Mr. Romney lost.
- 
9:35 A.M. | Grover Norquist vs. Warren Buffett
After Mr. Gregory gave them the opportunity to choose between Warren Buffet and the antitax activist Grover Norquist, the candidates decided not to bite.
Mr. Romney declined, saying: "The answer for America is not to grow government, it is to shrink government. We've got to stop the extraordinary spending in this country."
Mr. Huntsman didn't answer either, telling Mr. Gregory, "We have to say so long to corporate loopholes."
- 
9:24 A.M. | Huntsman on Loyalty 
Jon M. Huntsman Jr. had something he wanted to get off his chest - 10 hours after last night's debate.
At that debate, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Huntsman for working as an ambassador in President Obama's administration.
"I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first," he said. "He criticized me while he was out raising money. I want to be very clear. I will always put my country first."
Mr. Romney refused to relent, saying, "I just think it's most likely that the person who should represent our party against President Obama is not someone who called him a remarkable leader."
Mr. Huntsman then had what may be his most quotable moment of the entire campaign.
"This country is divided because of statements like that," Mr. Huntsman said.
- 
9:17 A.M. | Romney on a Career in Politics 
Is Mitt Romney a politician? 
The former Massachusetts governor repeated his claim that he's not really a politician, but rather a businessman with only a passing interest in the political game.
And Newt Gingrich called him on it: "Can we drop a little bit of the pious baloney?" he said.
Mr. Gingrich charged that Mr. Romney had either been in office or running for office for decades, and said he should "be straight with voters" about his intentions.
- 
9:12 A.M. | A More Animated Debate
Where were these guys last night? 
Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum appear to have decided to be a lot tougher on Mr. Romney.
Prodded by Mr. Gregory, the moderator, Mr. Gingrich assailed Mr. Romney as someone who will have a tough time defeating President Obama.
Mr. Gingrich called Mr. Romney a "relatively timid Massachusetts moderate" and said, "There's a huge difference between a Reagan conservative and somebody who comes out of the Massachusetts culture."
He added, "The bigger the contrast, the bolder the ideas, the clearer the choice, the harder it is for that billion-dollar campaign to smear his way back into office."
Mr. Santorum chimed in, saying that Mr. Romney "bailed out" by not running for re-election as governor of Massachusetts.
"If it was that important, at least you could stand up," he said.
Mr. Romney was indignant, saying he is a "solid conservative" who cut taxes, balanced the state budget and left it with a rainy-day fund.
"We have to nominate a leader," he said.
- 
9:04 A.M. | And We're Off
The candidates are about to be introduced in Concord, N.H., by David Gregory, the host of "Meet the Press." Some of the questions will come from Facebook users, who have been sending questions in for days. You can also follow along on Facebook.
- 
8:45 A.M. | What to Watch
Here we go again. 
Less than 12 hours after finishing Saturday night's debate, the Republican candidates for president will face each other Sunday morning for one more opportunity to clash on national television.
The public and the pundits have hardly had any time to digest Saturday night's ABC News-Yahoo-WMUR debate. But the rapid-fire, Twitter-fueled conclusion seems to have been that Mitt Romney's rivals did not do enough to blunt his momentum in New Hampshire.
Which leads to the following questions:
1. Will Round 2 be nastier? 
Rick Santorum passed up several opportunities to hit Mr. Romney's record Saturday night. Mr. Santorum later protested that analysis, saying he felt as if he had, in fact, been pretty tough on Mr. Romney. But his aides said they wanted Mr. Santorum to spend more time looking presidential, not like an attack dog. Which way will he go this morning?
2. Will there be mistakes?
Let's face it - doing one debate is tough enough with a good night's sleep. Doing two back to back has got to be really tough on these candidates. If there's going to be a flub or gaffe, this might be the morning for one to happen.
3. Will the economy return? 
The debate on Saturday night veered away from the economy as the principal subject. Instead, the moderators focused more of the questions on social issues, foreign policy and broader questions about leadership. Will David Gregory, the primary moderator of this morning's debate, take it in a different direction?
4. Will they continue to spar over second place?
If the rivals to Mr. Romney think they cannot slow him down, they may conclude - as they seemed to on Saturday night - that they should fight over second place. That would lead to more clashes between Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum. Is this the last chance for one of them to try to move up to that spot?
5. Is there a breakout moment?
The two men who really need a breakout moment are Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Rick Perry. Both seemed to fade into the background a bit Saturday night, just when their campaigns needed something to get them noticed. Will they find that moment this morning?
6. Will anyone watch?
The debate is being broadcast on Sunday morning, not exactly prime time, especially for religious voters who might be at church. It's also being sponsored by NBC, and broadcast across the nation on MSNBC, not exactly the network of choice for many Republicans. (Local NBC stations are also carrying most of it.) So the question is how much impact it will have.
- 
8:24 A.M. | Kicking off the Sunday Morning Debate
The Republican candidates for president have gathered again Sunday morning for the second of two back-to-back debates leading up to the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
Stay tuned here for live updates, tweets and analysis of the best moments in real time. And then come back to The Caucus and to NYTimes.com for the latest coverage of the primary.

HEADLINE: Debate Fact Check: Net Jobs and Obama on Iran

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Gauging the accuracy of the candidates' claims in the New Hampshire debate. 

 BODY:
Job Creation
Mitt Romney's tenure at Bain Capital, a private equity firm, came under scrutiny at Saturday night's Republican debate, leading him to claim that he helped create 100,000 jobs, even when layoffs from downsized firms were factored in.
He has made the same claim in other places as well, telling Time magazine last month that the job creation figure was "net-net."
But the Romney campaign bases that 100,000 figure on the current employment of just three major companies that Bain Capital invested in during Mr. Romney's tenure: Staples, Sports Authority and Domino's Pizza.
In fact, documenting a "net" gain of 100,000 jobs - with layoffs at other companies included - is extremely difficult. Neither Bain Capital nor Mr. Romney is willing to disclose the number of layoffs at companies that Bain Capital has invested in.
At one such company, a medical diagnostics firm called Dade Behring, global employment grew over all during the years Bain was an investor in the 1990s, primarily from hiring abroad. But during that period, Dade's United States employment fell by more than 1,700 jobs, as Bain Capital oversaw corporate mergers and plant closings.
-- 
Iran Protests
Midway through the debate, Rick Santorum and Mr. Romney attacked President Obama for being "silent" when one million Iranian demonstrators took to the streets in 2009 to protest a flawed election.
It is true that some activists called on Mr. Obama to denounce Iranian authorities more forcefully for using violence against protesters. But Mr. Obama did, in fact, speak out repeatedly in support of Iranian demonstrators.
"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous," Mr. Obama said in June 2009. "And despite the government's efforts to keep the world from bearing witness to that violence, we see it, and we condemn it."
In December, he said: "For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights. Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality."
Government's Share
Mr. Romney stated that government consumes 37 percent of the economy's output, but that figure should be put in perspective considering that he is running to head the federal government. That 37 percent reflects the combined size of the federal, state and local governments.
The Congressional Budget Office has reported that federal government spending alone in 2010 was equivalent to 23.8 percent of the gross domestic product, and it forecast that the percentage would be the same when final figures are in for 2011.
Revenues coming in to the federal government are much lower - they are equal to just under 15 percent of the gross domestic product for 2010, according to the budget office, and just over 15 percent in 2011, it forecast.

HEADLINE: Fact Checking the Concord Debate

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Reporters take a closer look at some of the candidates' responses to debate questions. 

 BODY:
Santorum's Response to Question on Gay Rights
Mr. Santorum delivered an anodyne response to a question on gay rights during the debate - an issue that has prompted him in the past to make some of his most provocative and controversial remarks.
Asked what would happen if his son told him he was gay, Mr. Santorum said, "I would love him as much as I did the second before he said it."
But Mr. Santorum has been asked that question before, and he gave a very different answer then. In a 2003 interview with GQ, he was asked what he would tell a son who admitted to having an attraction to men. He essentially said his son should remain celibate.
"I would try to point out to them what is the right thing to do. And we have many temptations to do things we shouldn't do," he told the magazine. "It doesn't mean you have to submit."
Mr. Santorum added that all parents should help steer their children in a direction "that would lead them to a better and happier life."
Then, when pressed on whether he would still love his son, he replied, "It's all you can do."
The GQ interview came after Mr. Santorum likened homosexuality to a host of illegal and devious acts.
He told The Associated Press in 2003, "If the Supreme Court says you have the right to consensual gay sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery, you have the right to anything."
-- 
Romney's Claim That Gingrich Was Ousted as Speaker 
When Mr. Romney listed the criticisms of Mr. Gingrich mentioned in an ad by a pro-Romney super PAC, he mentioned that Mr. Gingrich had been ousted as Speaker. Mr. Gingrich, at the side of the screen, said, "That's not true."
Technically, Mr. Gingrich is right. He stepped down -- but only because who were furious with him for their unexpected losses in the 1998 mid-term elections and for his previous two years of tumultuous leadership.
It is perhaps more accurate to say that Mr. Gingrich was driven from office. He had no choice but to quit.
In two conference calls to House Republicans just days after the disastrous election, he said he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would leave Congress when his term expired the next January. He also called his fellow Republicans "cannibals" who had "blackmailed" him into quitting.
He issued a statement later that said: "The Republican conference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward."
-- 
Gingrich on E.P.A. Regulating Farm Dust
Mr. Gingrich, when asked about his proposal to replace the Environmental Protection Agency with a "solutions agency," cited an example of what he considers bureaucratic overreach by current regulators: controlling dust from farms in states like Iowa and Arizona.
The E.P.A.'s supposed effort to regulate "farm dust" has become something of an urban legend. Mr. Gingrich often says while campaigning that he learned of it from Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican.
The E.P.A. itself has denied that it ever considered regulating farm dust.
The agency has long had authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate "coarse particles," soot or dust that emerges mostly from smokestacks, automobiles and demolition sites and has been shown to contribute to heart disease and other health problems.
Although "farm dust" falls under the definition of coarse particles, the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, testified in March before the House Agriculture Committee that her agency did not plan to regulate dust on farms.
She said in a letter to the House in October that she would not change current standards for regulating particles. Nonetheless, Republicans in the House proposed the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act in November. In testimony, the E.P.A.'s chief air-quality officer reaffirmed the agency's decision not to change existing standards, adding, "I am hopeful that this announcement ends the myth that the agency has plans to tighten regulation of 'farm dust.' "
-- 
Romney on Job Creation in Massachusetts
Earlier in the debate, Mr. Romney said he had created more jobs in Massachusetts than President Obama had in the entire country. Since he did not provide figures, the basis for his claim is unclear. But in 2011, nearly two million jobs were added nationwide. During Mr. Romney's term as governor from 2003 to 2007, employment grew by about 60,000 jobs, or 15,000 a year on average, according to The Associated Press, which issued a fact-checking report when Mr. Romney boasted of his job-creation record during a debate in September.
-- 
Huntsman on Oil
Responding to a question about cuts in a program that helps low-income families pay for heating oil, Mr. Huntsman said many people were in need and the program should be supported until the nation moved to more diversified sources of energy and reduced imports of oil.
He went on to say that federal government policy "always favors one product -- and that's oil." The "one-product monopoly," he said, should be broken up. Mr. Huntsman did not have an opportunity to fully explain what he meant, but it appeared that he was referring to government tax policies that have supported the oil industry for nearly 100 years through various subsidies and incentives, which today reach about $3.5 billion a year. President Obama has called for ending these tax breaks, but he has been opposed by the oil industry and by most Republicans in Congress.
Mr. Huntsman made no reference to federal tax breaks and other subsidies for other forms of energy, including coal, nuclear, solar, wind and ethanol, all of which have received billions of dollars in tax incentives over the past several decades. So while the oil industry has enjoyed favored treatment for years, so have most other forms of energy.

Mitt Romney repeated a claim he has made in past debates -- repealing the Obama health care law would save money -- that has been refuted by nonpartisan fact checkers and analyses like those of the Congressional Budget Office.

While the budget office has declined to put an exact figure on projected savings of the health care law beyond the first decade, given the uncertainty of such long-range projections, it concluded that the savings would be in the range of half a percentage point of the nation's gross domestic product, a substantial amount. The Obama administration has projected that the savings in the second decade will exceed $1 trillion.
In November, the nonpartisan fact-checking group PolitiFact said of Mr. Romney's claim: "We rate his statement false."

Mr. Romney's decision not to seek a second term as governor -- unusual for a politician of his age at the time -- was also seen as a signal of his intent to run for higher office.
Mr. Romney had previously run for United States Senate, in a 1994 race against Edward M. Kennedy. Mr. Romney lost.

HEADLINE: Haiti Can Be Rich Again

BYLINE: By LAURENT DUBOIS and DEBORAH JENSON. 
Laurent Dubois, the author of ''Haiti: The Aftershocks of History,'' and Deborah Jenson, the author of ''Beyond the Slave Narrative,'' are co-directors of the Haiti Humanities Laboratory at Duke.

 BODY:
HAITI wasn't always the ''poorest nation in the Western hemisphere,'' though it's almost impossible to read about the country today without coming across that phrase. In the two years since the earthquake that devastated it, Haiti has experienced political conflict and its first ever cholera epidemic; hundreds of thousands of the displaced are still living in makeshift tents strewn like dusty flags by the sides of highways. It is easy to forget that, for most of the 19th century, Haiti was a site of agricultural innovation, productivity and economic success.
In the wake of the earthquake, many have talked about the need to lay foundations for a better future. To do that, Haiti should look to the past, and the system of small farms and the decentralized economy that once provided Haitians with dignity, autonomy and wealth. 
The slave revolution that ended with Haiti's creation in 1804 led to what the sociologist Jean Casimir dubbed a ''counter-plantation'' system. As slaves, the islanders had harvested and processed sugar cane, but fed themselves by cultivating their own tiny gardens, for which they developed sophisticated techniques of inter-cropping -- a kind of sustainable agriculture that involved planting a variety of crops close together. Once free, Haitians drew on that knowledge to raise livestock and grow fruits, root vegetables and even coffee for export to the global market. In establishing their own small farms, they forestalled any possibility of a return to the large plantations that had defined the days of slavery.
This system of agricultural self-reliance provided a better quality of life than that of African descendants anywhere else in the Americas. The country attracted many immigrants, including thousands of African-Americans. And though the United States government didn't officially recognize Haiti until 1862, American businessmen eagerly traded with the island nation.
Haiti's economy was decentralized, organized around 11 largely autonomous regions, each with its own port. There was plenty of conflict in the country, largely over control of the central government, and heavy taxes on exports, as well as the power of foreign merchants, sapped the profits of farmers. Yet the regional economies thrived, and a decentralized political and military system assured many Haitians a great deal of control over their destiny.
In the 20th century, however, this system came under increasing pressure. Outsiders, along with many in the Haitian elite, saw small farms as a barrier to progress. When the United States occupied Haiti, from 1915 to 1934, it worked to centralize the economy in Port-au-Prince. It pushed through a re-writing of the Haitian Constitution to allow foreigners to own land, which the country's founders had banned for fear of re-enslavement, and worked to replace small farms with large plantations owned by foreign corporations. Many farmers saw their land expropriated.
In the teens, when the countryside erupted in a revolt against the occupation and the use of forced labor to build roads, the United States created a newly centralized gendarmerie to suppress the insurrection. Violence and economic decline in the countryside forced many Haitians to flee to the cities or to plantations in neighboring Cuba and the Dominican Republic. In the years since, the countryside has continued to experience environmental and economic degradation as well as exodus, while the big cities, especially Port-au-Prince, have become overcrowded. Today, about half of Haiti's food is imported.
The flow of ideas and money to Haiti that followed the earthquake provides an opportunity to restore the system of small farms that was a pillar of Haitian society after independence. Michel Martelly, Haiti's new president, has talked of the need to decentralize the economy, and nongovernmental organizations have begun projects to help farmers. But far more can be done.
Municipal governments should construct properly equipped marketplaces for the women who sell rural produce. The Haitian state should develop trade policies aimed at protecting the agricultural sector, and take the lead in fixing roads and ports, confronting deforestation and improving systems of water management. Foreign organizations working in the country can help simply by making it a policy to buy food and other goods from local producers.
The return on the investment in the rural economy would be self-reliance, the alleviation of dangerous overcrowding in cities and, most important, a path toward ending Haiti's now chronic problems of malnutrition and food insecurity. As Haitians look to rebuild in 2012, the best blueprints will come from their own proud and vibrant history.

HEADLINE: Iran Trumpets Nuclear Ability At a 2nd Plant

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Iran's top nuclear official announced this weekend that the country was on the verge of starting production at its second major uranium enrichment site, in a defiant declaration that its nuclear program would continue despite new international sanctions restricting its oil revenue.
The announcement, made through official news media reports, came after a week of escalating confrontations between Washington and Tehran, including a threat that Iran would respond with military force if the United States tried to send an aircraft carrier strike group back into the Strait of Hormuz.
The imminent opening of the enrichment site -- the Fordo plant, near the city of Qum -- confronts the United States and its allies with difficult choices about how far to go to limit Iran's nuclear abilities. The new facility is buried deep underground on a well-defended military site and is considered far more resistant to airstrikes than the existing enrichment site at Natanz, limiting what Israeli officials, in particular, consider an important deterrent to Iran's nuclear aims. 
When the existence of the Qum facility was first disclosed by President Obama and his counterparts in France and Britain in the fall of 2009, American officials expressed doubts that Iran would ever go forward with the facility. But once it goes into operation, the chances of disabling it, in the words of one former top Israeli official, ''diminish very dramatically.''
The declaration that the facility was nearly ready came in an interview on Saturday with Fereydoon Abbasi, who was made the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization shortly after surviving an assassination attempt in 2010. The official news agency Mehr quoted him as saying, ''The Fordo site near Qum would soon be opened and become operational.'' Iranian newspapers reported the development on Sunday.
While Iran has often exaggerated its abilities, nuclear experts say this claim is plausible. In December, inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that during a visit to the plant they saw the finishing touches put on enrichment centrifuges and said they expected the facility to be operating soon.
Iran says its nuclear program is critical to its national security -- not because it is seeking weapons, but because it wants an alternative energy source to oil and is seeking to refuel a reactor that makes medical isotopes.
Four years of sanctions have deeply hurt Iran's economy, but have not changed its nuclear strategy. But the new American sanctions, along with an oil embargo under discussion in Europe, aim to undercut the government by squeezing its most important source of revenue: oil sales. In response, Iran has clearly signaled that the sanctions have only hardened its determination to proceed. On Sunday, for instance, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began a highly publicized series of visits to South American leaders that have been critical of the United States, starting with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
More troublingly, Iran threatened early last week to close off shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, an action that analysts say could send global oil prices soaring. Iran conducted military exercises in the waterway, and then said it would use force to bar any re-entry of the United States aircraft carrier John C. Stennis and its escort ships.
While American officials and outside experts have dismissed the threat as hyperbole, and say they have every intention of patrolling the area with a carrier, there is broad concern that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Navy could harass oil tankers passing through the narrow strait or lay mines that could create significant risks to shipping.
The opening of the plant does not significantly affect estimates of how long it could take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon, if that is its true intention. The new facility has been inspected regularly, and unless the Iranians barred inspectors or managed to deceive them, any effort to produce uranium at bomb-grade levels would most likely be detected. American officials have estimated that they would have six months to a year to react, if needed, before the enrichment was completed.
But should it come to that, the Fordo plant site itself would greatly complicate any military action. Satellite photographs show it is surrounded by antiaircraft guns, and the mountainous setting was designed to make a bombing campaign nearly impossible. Mr. Abbasi said Saturday that the plant would house a new generation of centrifuges -- the machines that spin at supersonic speeds to enrich the purity of uranium -- though inspectors largely saw older, far less efficient models at the plant.
''No one has a full sense of the Iranian production plan there,'' said one diplomat who has studied the few details Iran has shared about the plant. ''And I think that's the point.''
Already Iran has produced enough fuel to manufacture about four weapons, but only if the fuel goes through further enrichment, nuclear experts say. Some of the fuel at Fordo, Mr. Abbasi said, would be enriched to 20 percent purity for use in a research reactor in Tehran; because of the oddities about how uranium is enriched, those batches would be the easiest to convert for use in weapons.
It is that ability that has Israel most concerned. So Israeli officials were relieved in December when Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, speaking at a conference in Washington, strongly suggested that the United States was determined to stop not only a weapon, but the ability to produce one.
But on Sunday, appearing on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' Mr. Panetta was less specific about how close to the line Iran would be allowed to go. Sanctions and separate embargoes against Iran were ''working to put pressure on them, to make them understand that they cannot continue to do what they're doing,'' Mr. Panetta said, in comments that were taped before Mr. Abbasi's announcement. ''Are they trying to develop a nuclear weapon? No. But we know that they're trying to develop a nuclear capability. And that's what concerns us. And our red line to Iran is: do not develop a nuclear weapon. That's a red line for us.''
In saying that the United States did not have any evidence that Iran was seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, Mr. Panetta was hewing closely to the conclusions the often fractious American intelligence agencies agreed upon in 2007 and again in 2010. Two National Intelligence Estimates, designed to reflect the consensus of the intelligence community, concluded that Iranian leaders had made no political decision yet to build an actual weapon. Instead, they described a series of steps that would take Iran right up to that line -- and position it to assemble a weapon fairly quickly if a decision to do so were made.
When asked on ''Face the Nation'' about the how difficult it would be to take out Iran's nuclear ability in a military strike, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said: ''Well, I would rather not discuss the degree of difficulty and in any way encourage them to read anything into that. But I will say that my responsibility is to encourage the right degree of planning, to understand the risks associated with any kind of military option, in some cases to position assets, to provide those options in a timely fashion. And all those activities are going on.''

HEADLINE: Disruptions: Supply and Demand, And a Costly Ride

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON. 
Email: bilton@nytimes.com

 BODY:
2:59 p.m. Updated Adding information about how and when Uber customers are notified of surge pricing.
On New Year's Eve, Dan Whaley, a tech entrepreneur in San Francisco, got into a black Town Car and was driven one mile to a holiday party. The ride cost him $27. At the end of the night out, Mr. Whaley took a Town Car home from the party. This time, the exact same ride cost $135.
Mr. Whaley was using Uber, a service that allows people to order livery cabs through a smartphone application. On New Year's Eve, Uber, a start-up in the city, adopted a feature it called ''surge pricing,'' which increases the price of rides as more people request them. 
Although New Year's Eve was very profitable for Uber, customers were not happy. Many felt the pricing was exorbitant and they took to Twitter and the Web to complain. Some people said that at certain times in the evening, rides had spiked to as high as seven times the usual price, and they called it highway robbery. Uber's goal is to make the experience as simple as possible, so customers are not shown their fare until the end of the ride, when it is automatically charged to their credit card. While the app does not show the total fare in dollars when customers book a ride, Uber did show a ''surge pricing'' multiple to customers booking rides for New Year's Eve.
Economists call this ''dynamic pricing.'' It is deployed by only a small number of businesses, like hotels, airlines and car rental companies, which raise prices on weekends and holidays when demand surges.
So why do people accept this pricing from airlines and hotels but became irate with Uber?
''With regular day-to-day decisions, consumers like predictability and don't like to see prices change,'' said Dirk Bergemann, a professor of economics at Yale. ''People are trained that there is a level of predictability with purchases. There will be a regular price for a bottle of ketchup and a relatively average price for a taxi.''
Professor Bergemann said that as technology continually made it easier for companies to change prices in real time, businesses would try to do so. He said, however, that companies would have to be prepared for repercussions.
In 1999, Coca-Cola's chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, mused about vending machines that would raise prices for drinks as the temperature rose. The outcry from customers was a public relations nightmare, and the company denied it was testing such a product.
Amazon suffered a similar uproar in 2000 when it reportedly experimented with DVD prices.
But there is another way to think about it. ''Sure it's about the regularity, but someone who is driving a car on a regular occurrence deals with dynamic pricing all the time: it's called gas prices,'' said Travis Kalanick, co-founder of Uber. ''Because this is so new, it's going to take some time for folks to accept it. There's 70 years of conditioning around the fixed price of taxis.''
Some consumers might argue that price increases are fine, but there is a ceiling, and when that is breached, it begins to look as if a company is taking advantage of its customer. Charging someone $135 to travel a mile on New Year's Eve could easily get lumped in that category - unless you are completely rational.
''If you're a pure economist and following the laws of supply and demand, the argument is that if someone is willing to pay a price, then it is not excessive,'' said Liran Einav, an associate economics professor at Stanford. ''But that all depends on the type of long-term relationship you want to build with your customers.''
You might think that a technology company shaking up the taxi industry would want to maintain relationships with its customers. But that's certainly not the lesson Uber learned.
''I don't think that the constantly changing car price is necessarily where we want to go,'' Mr. Kalanick said. ''But on Halloween and New Year's, it's here to stay.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 11, 2012

 CORRECTION:
The Disruptions column on Monday, about so-called dynamic pricing, which raises prices when demand is highest, referred incompletely to the practices of Uber, a company that allows people to reserve car service through a smartphone app. While the app does not show the total fare in dollars when customers book a ride, Uber did show a ''surge pricing'' multiple to customers booking rides for New Year's Eve. It is not the case that Uber's customers were never informed of the pricing policy for that night.

HEADLINE: Financial Ruin Of Immigrants Tied to Broker

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK; Vijai Singh contributed reporting.Vijai Singh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For years, a self-made real estate magnate named Edul Ahmad personified the collective dreams of Richmond Hill, Queens, which is populated by many immigrants from Guyana, in South America. Mr. Ahmad drove a yellow Lamborghini, sponsored a cricketteam and held white-glove parties at a lavish banquet hall that he owned.
At a prominent intersection near the border of Richmond Hill and South Ozone Park, his smiling face looked down from a large billboard that promoted his real estate services. Many residents responded, taking out high-risk mortgages that they were told they could readily afford.
In July, it all came crashing down. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Ahmad, charging him with masterminding a $50 million mortgage fraud that seemed to exemplify a nationwide phenomenon of celebrated immigrant brokers who were accused of preying on their own. 
Now, scores, if not hundreds, of Guyanese immigrants are facing financial ruin because of loans said to have been arranged by Mr. Ahmad, and the repercussions from the case have extended from Queens to Washington to Guyana.
Mr. Ahmad is currently engaged in intensive plea-bargain negotiations with federal prosecutors, according to court documents, but it appears that the impact of the loans will endure for years. Richmond Hill has been hit harder by the foreclosure crisis than most other neighborhoods in the city, officials and analysts said.
Mr. Ahmad's case has also ensnared two politicians whom he considered friends: United States Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Queens Democrat, and John L. Sampson of Brooklyn, the Democratic leader of the State Senate.
A House ethics panel is investigating Mr. Meeks for failing to disclose that he received $40,000 from Mr. Ahmad. Mr. Sampson worked as Mr. Ahmad's lawyer and was disciplined by the New York secretary of state for notarizing a document for Mr. Ahmad without a license.
Guyana is a small nation bordering Venezuela where the largest ethnic group is of Indian descent. After Mr. Ahmad's arrest, the ruling party in Guyana had to explain why his contact information appeared on a flier promoting a fund-raising dinner with the president at the time, Bharrat Jagdeo; the party said Mr. Ahmad was a friend of Mr. Jagdeo's, but not a campaign donor.
Mr. Ahmad, 44, is charged with luring buyers into subprime mortgages, inflating the values of their properties and concealing his involvement by using straw buyers, like his wife and the Guyanese-born captain of the United States cricket team, Steve Massiah.
Mr. Ahmad pleaded not guilty and posted $2.5 million in bail in July. Reached by telephone recently, he would not comment.
Since 2009, more foreclosures have been filed in Queens than in any other borough, according to the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project. Five of the hardest hit ZIP codes in Queens are within a 15-minute drive of the office of Mr. Ahmad, who community leaders say once held about 75 percent of local real estate listings.
Paban Saha and Syed Husain, friends and former business partners, said they contacted him in 2006 after seeing his newspaper advertisements. They said he earned their confidence at their first meeting, when they watched him write a check to a charity.
''He set up an atmosphere where you forgot about everything,'' Mr. Husain, 56, said.
Mr. Ahmad and one of his brokers offered Mr. Husain and Mr. Saha a three-family house for $880,000 but warned of another bid, Mr. Husain said. Mr. Ahmad demanded that they close within a week, insisting they use his lawyer, his appraiser and his mortgage officer, who pushed to finance 95 percent of their home at a 12.5 percent rate, Mr. Saha and Mr. Husain said.
Within two years, their finances were devastated, they said. The property was on the brink of foreclosure, the souvenir store that their families owned together went bankrupt, and they depleted savings they had accumulated since emigrating from Bangladesh in the 1990s.
''You can only imagine two households trying to keep one property afloat,'' said Mr. Husain, who has filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Ahmad. ''It sucked everything dry.''
Some Guyanese people, describing their foreclosures linked to Mr. Ahmad's services, said they were so terrified by his powerful ties that they did not want their names publicized. One man said that at times he felt suicidal.
''I don't even trust myself to make decisions anymore,'' he said. ''I've lost everything.''
Housing experts say these cases have cropped up in immigrant enclaves across the United States, often because immigrants can be too trusting of business leaders from their own communities who hold themselves up as examples of classic American success stories.
In September, a Bolivian-born woman became the third member of her family in San Francisco to be charged with defrauding Latino immigrants in a multimillion-dollar mortgage scheme.
Los Angeles's Thai community was victimized, community leaders said, by a prominent loan officer who cheated so many immigrants that after he came under scrutiny, he fled to Thailand.
Mr. Ahmad worked as a police detective in Guyana before joining a Guyanese immigration wave to New York City in the early 1980s. A private portion of his Facebook profile, accessible by more than 250 of his friends on the Web site, states that he earned degrees from Baruch College in Manhattan. However, the college has no record of him.
Even today, after the arrest of Mr. Ahmad and at least 12 Guyanese real estate workers, most of whom were accused of running similar but smaller-scale schemes, there are more than 30 real estate businesses on the main thoroughfare, Liberty Avenue.
Mr. Ahmad created a public brand, plastering his photo in advertisements in ethnic newspapers and buying television infomercials. Residents flocked to him.
''It's personal,'' said Paul Sanders, a Guyanese journalist who covers the community. ''Ed was one of us.''
When Mr. Ahmad opened a new office, the police blocked traffic as about 300 people, including Representative Meeks and Senator Sampson, attended a ceremony and listened to a calypso singer offer a tribute: ''Ed Ahmad! Ed Ahmad! That dynamite businessman. Ed Ahmad! Ed Ahmad! A sexy, handsome young man.''
As he accumulated wealth -- one former friend said he was worth at least $20 million in liquid assets -- he poured money into charitable and other causes, including the mosque where he prays. He also raised money for politicians like Mr. Meeks and Mr. Sampson.
''Ed used to go around saying he's befriended politicians, and if he's ever caught, they'll help him get off,'' said Chuck Mohan, who is the president of a Guyanese civic group in Queens and a friend of Mr. Sampson's.
Mr. Meeks has said the $40,000 that he received from Mr. Ahmad was a loan, which he paid back, he said, three years after he received it, after the F.B.I. began questioning Mr. Ahmad. Mr. Meeks's office did not respond to a phone message.
At one point, Mr. Sampson used a staff member to aid in his legal representation of Mr. Ahmad, potentially violating ethics laws, according to state records. Asked for comment, Mr. Sampson's office would say only that he and Mr. Ahmad remained friends.
In Queens, many people who once jockeyed for Mr. Ahmad's attention, like radio and television talk show hosts, are keeping their distance. But his defenders questioned why the government was prosecuting immigrant brokers even as it bailed out banks.
''We are innocent victims of the economic frenzy and implosion that America is going through,'' said Kawal Totaram, a real estate lawyer and friend of Mr. Ahmad's.
Some housing advocates disagreed that Mr. Ahmad was in trouble because of forces outside his control. Mamta Gurung, a manager at Chhaya, a Queens-based housing organization that caters to South Asians, said half of her foreclosure clients were Guyanese, including some who had loans from Mr. Ahmad.
She said most of her clients could not identify their mortgage documents. Some could not spell their names. ''It's quite scary,'' she said.
Mr. Saha and Mr. Husain, who took the 12.5 percent loan arranged by Mr. Ahmad, said their lives remained in turmoil. They have been unable to start a new business because of a lack of capital, Mr. Husain said, and Mr. Husain's three children are supporting him financially.
That, Mr. Husain said, is not how life should turn out.
''When you purchase a property, you think, 'This is it!' '' he said. Instead, he said, he felt overwhelmed by ''depression and anger issues, and hopelessness.''

HEADLINE: Ford Turns to the Midsize Car to Challenge Japan

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- It's rare for an auto company to undertake a total makeover of one of its best-selling models, from the styling to the seats to the selection of engines.
But that's exactly what the Ford Motor Company did with its new Fusion sedan, to be introduced Monday at the annual Detroit auto show.
The current Fusion ranked third in sales among all cars in the United States last year. Yet virtually everything was changed on the version that goes on sale later this year -- even how the ''blue oval'' Ford badge was embedded into the hood of the car.
That attention to detail surprised even William Clay Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman. ''At first, I thought the blue oval was off-center or something,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview. ''But it's actually quite beautiful.'' 
The new look is just one aspect of Ford's all-out bid to gain share in the competitive midsize car segment dominated in recent decades by the Japanese automakers. To further differentiate the Fusion, the company will offer four engine options, including a plug-in hybrid it promotes as the most fuel-efficient family sedan in the world.
The revamped Fusion underscores just how hard Detroit's automakers are pushing to solidify their turnarounds with improved passenger cars. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler accounted for 60 percent of trucks and S.U.V.'s sold in the United States in 2011 and make most of their profits from bigger vehicles. But they still have only about one-third of the car market.
That could change if their Detroit show models attract new customers. Besides Ford's Fusion, G.M. will reveal a new small Cadillac, as well as its own contender in the midsize market, the restyled Chevrolet Malibu. Chrysler plans to show the compact Dodge Dart, which is built off of a vehicle platform developed by Fiat, its Italian parent company.
With Toyota and Honda struggling to recover from last year's earthquake-related supply disruptions, the conditions are ripe for the American companies.
''With the Japanese in a bit of a bind, the time is now for Detroit to conquest new customers,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with the consulting firm Auto Trends.
Both G.M. and Ford have made big gains in the small-car market with new products like the Chevrolet Cruze and Ford Focus, part of their effort to meet new fuel standards as well as attract people to showrooms. Now they are focusing on the midsize segment, long the stronghold of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
The Camry was still the top seller in the segment last year, followed by the Nissan Altima and the Fusion. But models from the Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia are steadily gaining share, and the German carmaker Volkswagen is gearing up for more production of its midsize entries.
Honda plans to show a concept version of a new Accord at the Detroit show. But most of the attention will center on the Fusion, which promises to shatter the old Detroit stereotype of bland, middle-of-the-road passenger cars.
The Fusion is the latest Ford car to be overhauled for sale in a variety of global markets, following the Focus and the subcompact Fiesta. Development of the new Fusion began four years ago, just when Ford and the other Detroit companies were spiraling into financial crises which led G.M. and Chrysler into government-sponsored bankruptcies.
At the time, Ford was determined to invest heavily in new, fuel-efficient cars despite the company's mounting losses. ''Even in the dark days, we decided to keep investing,'' Mr. Ford said.
Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, urged the design and engineering team to reinvent the Fusion rather than simply update it. Traditionally, the Detroit companies often settled for incremental improvements, particularly on the design side.
They were hardly alone in that regard. Toyota, for example, had stellar success with the Camry year after year without changing its basic styling. ''Detroit looked at the competition and saw that the plain, white-bread look was what worked,'' said Mr. Phillippi.
Yet the Ford team was urged by management to wipe the slate clean for the new Fusion. It was not an easy call. ''You can start with a clean sheet of paper, and still screw it up,'' Mr. Ford said.
The exterior design staff was headed by Chris Hamilton, a 43-year-old Briton who had spent most of his career in Europe. His team interviewed consumers from the United States, Europe, China and Australia to get ideas.
''We didn't look at the midsize car as just a boring segment,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''We looked at it as an opportunity to create a beautiful product.''
What they ended up with was a muscular-looking, four-door sedan that stands apart from the midsize crowd. And with its trapezoidal grille, elongated headlamps, and sculptured trunk lid, the new Fusion looks nothing like the current model.
During a preview of the car at Ford's design studio, Mr. Hamilton stressed the changes, both big and small. Chrome accents on the body panels are slimmer than before, and side mirrors are mounted on the doors to allow for larger windows. The roof was stretched and sloped to create a sleeker silhouette. And instead of attaching a standard-issue blue oval badge onto the hood, a slightly smaller emblem was designed and integrated into the sheet metal.
''The proportions are everything,'' Mr. Hamilton said. ''We want this car to look expensive, even if it isn't.''
Ford has not announced any prices for the new Fusion, except to say they will be comparable to the current model, which ranges from about $20,000 to $30,000.
There are more changes in the interior of the car, like lighter-weight seats and an unusual center console supported by pillars rather than layers of hard plastic. In addition to a voice-activated communications and navigation system, the Fusion also has sensors that detect when the car gets too close to other vehicles or is straying into other lanes of traffic.
Ford will offer two, four-liter engines in the Fusion that can achieve 37 miles a gallon in highway driving. It also has a hybrid gas-electric model, and the first plug-in hybrid available in the midsize segment. While it has not yet been rated by federal regulators, Ford expects the plug-in to deliver the electrified-vehicle equivalent of more than 100 miles a gallon.
Its striking new design will attract potential buyers, but the technology and fuel-efficiency are critical to the Fusion's success in the long-run, said James D. Farley Jr., Ford's head of sales and marketing.
''The family sedan is still the heart and soul of the American garage,'' Mr. Farley said. ''The design is so evocative that it invites customers to look beyond the surface to our quality and our fuel economy.''

HEADLINE: With Work Scarce in Athens, Greeks Go Back to the Land

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO; Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CHIOS, Greece -- Nikos Gavalas and Alexandra Tricha, both 31 and trained as agriculturalists, were frustrated working on poorly paying, short-term contracts in Athens, where jobs are scarce and the cost of living is high. So last year, they decided to start a new project: growing edible snails for export.
As Greece's blighted economy plunges further into the abyss, the couple are joining with an exodus of Greeks who are fleeing to the countryside and looking to the nation's rich rural past as a guide to the future. They acknowledge that it is a peculiar undertaking, with more manual labor than they, as college graduates, ever imagined doing. But in a country starved by austerity even as it teeters on the brink of default, it seemed as good a gamble as any.
Mr. Gavalas and Ms. Tricha chose to move back to his native Chios, an Aegean island closer to Izmir, Turkey, than to Athens. They set up their boutique farm using $50,000 from their families' life savings. That investment has yet to pay off; they will have their first harvest later this year. But the couple are confident about their decision. 
''When I call my friends and relatives in Athens, they tell me there's no hope, everything is going from bad to worse,'' Ms. Tricha said on a recent afternoon, as she walked through her greenhouse, where thousands of snails lumbered along on rows of damp wooden boards. ''So I think our choice was good.''
Unemployment in Greece is now 18 percent, rising to 35 percent for young people between the ages of 15 and 29 -- up from 12 percent and 24 percent, respectively, in late 2010. But the agricultural sector has been one of the few to show gains since the crisis hit, adding 32,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 -- most of them taken by Greeks, not migrant workers from abroad, according to a study released this fall by the Pan-Hellenic Confederation of Agricultural Associations.
''The biggest increase is in middle-aged people between 45 and 65 years old,'' said Yannis Tsiforos, the director of the confederation. ''This shows us that they had a different sort of employment in the past.''
In Greece, as elsewhere in the Mediterranean, most families have traditionally invested heavily in real estate and land, which are seen as far more stable than financial investments, and it is common for even low-income Greeks to have inherited family property. Increasingly, as the hard times bite deeper, many Greeks are deciding or being forced to fall back on that last line of defense.
Enrollment in agricultural schools is also on the rise. Panos Kanellis, the president of the American Farm School in Salonika, which was founded in 1904 and offers kindergarten through high school as well as continuing education in sustainable agriculture, said applications tripled in the past two years and enrollment in classes like cheesemaking and winemaking has been rising.
Mr. Kanellis says that young people frequently come to him and say: ''I have two acres from my grandfather in such-and-such a place. Can I do something with it?''
A growing number of Greeks are asking themselves that question, and some are deciding they can. ''I think a lot of people will do this,'' Ms. Tricha said. ''In big cities, there's no future for them. For young people, the only choice is for them to go to the countryside or to go abroad.''
If the refugees from the cities are expecting an easy or idyllic existence in the countryside, they are quickly disabused of such notions. In 2006, Vassilis Ballas and his wife, Roula Boura, both 36, left their jobs in Athens, where he worked in content management at a Web site and she in marketing, to move to Chios, where his grandparents were from.
That was before the financial crisis, but they wanted a change and decided to try their luck cultivating mastic trees, which grow only in southern Chios and produce an aniselike resin that is harvested and crystallized to produce mastic liquor, foodstuffs, candles and soap.
''It was a personal decision,'' Mr. Ballas said. ''We were thinking of moving out of Athens, and a friend told us, 'My grandmother produces 100 kilos of mastic going out on her own with a donkey,' '' or about 220 pounds, Mr. Ballas recalled, a crop for which a producer can earn around $40 a pound wholesale. But the couple found that mastic cultivation was much more difficult than they supposed. So while they still have 400 mastic trees, they have broadened into mastic-related ecotourism to make ends meet.
Such undertakings -- which on Chios includes a fledgling wine cooperative, Ariousios, which is working to resuscitate an ancient grape varietal, Chiotiko krassero -- indicate that there is money to be made in agriculture and tourism.
Some young Greeks are returning not to the land but to the sea, joining another venerable Greek industry. Since 2008, the number of applications to maritime schools across Greece has quadrupled to nearly 7,000, according to the Naval Ministry.
Yannis Menis, 27, a Chios native, said he had a promising career ahead of him as a nuclear physicist. But just shy of his Ph.D., he could not afford to continue his studies and decided to follow in his father's footsteps as a ship engineer, responsible for ship maintenance.
Mr. Menis started maritime school in Chios in September. ''My family opposed my wish to enroll; they were asking me, 'Did you study all those years for nothing?' '' he said. ''I didn't tell anyone on board about my scientific past,'' he added. ''Everywhere in Greece it's a disadvantage to be overqualified now.''
At a troubled moment when the debt crisis has eroded the country's recent economic gains -- perhaps irrevocably -- there is much debate about whether a return to the land or the sea is a step forward or backward.
Ms. Tricha knows where she stands. ''My parents were from the countryside. They were farmers when they were young. I studied to avoid becoming a farmer. They were teachers. And then their daughter studied and then went back to being a farmer,'' she said. Nevertheless, she added, ''for me it's like going forward, because I think we neglected the land.''
Yiannis Makridakis, 40, a Greek novelist whose work touches on themes of tradition and regionalism, represents a different strain of refugee, with a more political tinge. He said he moved from Athens to Chios in 2010 as an act of defiance against a global financial system he found unsustainable. He bought property with a well and grows his own vegetables.
''I came to the conclusion that I want to live this insignificant life of mine as one human being among others,'' Mr. Makridakis said on a sunny afternoon, looking down from his balcony on the rooftops of his village, Volissos, and the blue sea below. ''According to the old ways, where people work to secure their basic needs.''
Others find the trend discouraging. In the walled medieval village of Mesta, Georgia Poumpoura, 73, stood under a grape arbor outside her small stone house and chatted with friends. She said she divides her time between Athens, where she raised her family, and Mesta, where she grew up in poverty and where her monthly pension, which has been cut by the government's austerity plan, stretches further.
''I have three sons,'' she said. ''One is a civil engineer, one an electrical engineer, another a mechanical engineer. All three are unemployed. They're having a hard time in Athens. Here we manage to make ends meet, but we spend less,'' she said of herself and her husband, who is also retired.
But she said she would be disappointed if her sons returned to Chios. ''I worked so hard to make my children and grandchildren go to college,'' she said. ''I don't want them to come back. It would be a waste of all that effort.''
Beyond the numbers, the impulse to return to Greece's rural roots itself represents a telling new tendency since the onset of the crisis -- a turning inward, a quiet kind of national pride in response to the overall gloom. Dimitris Kaloupis, who left his job as a construction worker 20 years ago during the boom years and now is a full-time farmer in Volissos, raises his own animals and vegetables and runs a local tavern. He said he thought Greece could handle this crisis, as it had many others.
''We invented civilization, and we'll take it back,'' Mr. Kaloupis said over a lunch of stewed lamb that he raised himself. If the Greek economy really plummets beyond repair, ''I will take the rock in my hand and squeeze it, and from the water that comes out of it, I'll make pilaf to feed my daughter. We'll manage.''

HEADLINE: Go East, Young Man

BYLINE: By JONATHAN LEVINE. 
Jonathan Levine is a lecturer in American studies and English at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

 BODY:
Beijing
NOT long ago, I was stuck in a dead-end job near Greenwich, Conn. I was in my early 20s, overeducated with a series of non-performing degrees from New York University and Columbia, and frustrated. When I saw the Occupy Wall Street protesters on TV, fed up with the economic status quo in the United States, I saw myself. 
Or rather, I saw my old self, before I figured a way out.
To the occupiers and their sympathizers, I say vote -- not with the ballot, but with your feet. Now that your encampment has disbanded, don't just leave Zuccotti Park: leave America.
For China. At least, that's what I did. It was the best decision I ever made.
In February of last year, I moved to Beijing, having landed a job teaching American culture and English at Tsinghua University. While I was not a global neophyte, I had never set foot in Asia. China had 1.3 billion people, and I didn't know any of them.
But now, after living almost a year here, I feel that China is my second home. My work is fulfilling and my workload is manageable enough to give me time to travel. I have found friends among China's large expatriate community, my colleagues and, of course, my eager students. The food is outstanding and caters to both the gastronomically meek and the profoundly adventurous.
Most of all, my experiences here have been enriched by the Chinese people themselves. Their patience, courtesy and hospitality leave me in no hurry to return home anytime soon.
And guess what? I'm not so special.
China wants you. Job prospects are abundant. The effects of the Great Recession of 2008 may be felt in the United States for years, but they barely scratched China. Demand for native English speakers is white-hot. ChinaJob.com, TheBeijnger.com and Dave's ESL Cafe are just a few of the places where you can search for work.
There are problems here, of course. China is a nation that unapologetically rejects Western democracy -- and yet I am surprised to find that Chinese citizens and the news media have as much freedom as they do. For my money, CCTV News English, a channel offered by China's major state television broadcaster, is more fair and balanced than Fox News.
Pollution is bad. Beijing, like much of China, is often enveloped in what local residents euphemistically call ''mist.'' But there are nice days, too, more than you might think.
Many critics have rightly pointed out the shocking failures of the Chinese food safety system -- the most famous being the tainted-baby-formula scandal of 2008. But what you may not know is that China meted out swift justice in that case to the perpetrators. That is more than can be said for the handling of many corporations in the United States that have harmed their consumers and remain unpunished.
We live in grim times, but fortune favors the bold. So if you are reading this from some occupied encampment, a soul-crushing cubicle, your parents' basement or anywhere else in America really, maybe you should consider paying me a visit.
I'll buy you a duck.

8 P.M. (Sho2) THE KING'S SPEECH (2010) Colin Firth, left, in an Oscar-winning role, portrays Albert Frederick Arthur George, or Bertie, as his family called him, the shy second son of George V of Britain (Michael Gambon) in this film from Tom Hooper. Geoffrey Rush is Lionel Logue, the speech therapist who helps him conquer his debilitating stutter. And Helena Bonham Carter is Elizabeth, Bertie's wife and staunch support system, who can't quite stomach Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), the American divorcee who derails Bertie's older brother, David (Guy Pearce), from his position as Edward VIII. ''It isn't exactly 'Pygmalion,' not least because Mr. Hooper has no intention of satirizing the caste system that is one of this movie's biggest draws,'' Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times, said of the film, which earned Mr. Hooper an Oscar as best director. ''Each character has his moments, instances when Bertie the closed book tentatively opens and Logue's arrogance gets away from him, but both are too decent, too banal and the film too ingratiating to resonate deeply.'' In the end, she added, ''like many entertainments of this pop-historical type, 'The King's Speech' wears history lightly no matter how heavy the crown.'' The film also received Academy Awards for best picture and original screenplay (David Seidler). 
8 P.M. (ABC) THE BACHELOR Ben Flajnik, a 29-year-old winemaker from Sonoma, Calif., takes the 18 remaining bachelorettes on an exploration of his hometown vineyards.

In the premiere of ''Mobster Confessions,'' at 10, Andrew DiDonato describes how, as a young street thug in New York, he was seduced by the power and protection of the Gambino crime family, only to be forced to choose between being hunted by the mob or working with the authorities to bring it down. At 10:30 John Veasey tells about his stint as a hit man in Philadelphia and how he testified against his own mafia family members after they tried to kill him.
9:30 P.M. (E!) SCOUTED TO STARDOM A look at how Justin Bieber, Will Smith, Cameron Diaz, Selita Ebanks and Jewel evolved from unknowns to celebrities after being spotted by scouts while doing the things ordinary people do.

HEADLINE: Job Creation and Our Energy Choices

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Where the Real Jobs Are'' (editorial, Jan. 2):
TransCanada has been constructing and operating natural gas and oil pipelines for more than 60 years. We know what it takes to build multimillion-dollar pieces of infrastructure -- the amount of equipment, the materials and the number of workers.
The $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline is the largest infrastructure project planned in the United States right now. It will create 20,000 jobs: 13,000 in construction, 7,000 in manufacturing. 
Construction of the 1,600-mile pipeline is broken down into 17 pipeline spreads, or sections, with 500 workers per spread -- that's 8,500 workers.
Keystone XL also needs 30 pump stations, each requiring 100 workers -- that's 3,000 jobs. Add in another 600 jobs that will be needed for the six construction camps and tank construction at Cushing, Okla.
A project of such magnitude needs construction and management and inspection oversight -- the 1,000 workers here brings the overall Keystone XL total to more than 13,000 direct, on-site jobs. These are new, real American jobs -- not person-hours; there is no double counting here.
The $6 billion Keystone pipeline that has safely delivered more than 160 million barrels of oil to the Midwest since the summer of 2010 created 9,000 construction jobs. This is a reality that our opponents cannot ignore.
The Keystone XL project is also expected to create 7,000 manufacturing jobs involving companies like Welspun, Cameron, Siemens and dozens of others. Based on all of this practical, factual data, the employment benefits of Keystone XL are very clear.
ROBERT JONES JAMES MILLAR Calgary, Alberta, Jan. 3, 2012
Mr. Jones is vice president of Keystone Pipeline System. Mr. Millar is manager of corporate communications and media relations for TransCanada.
To the Editor:
You say in your editorial that President Obama should reject construction of the Keystone XL pipeline because ''this is precisely the moment for him to argue the case for alternative fuel sources and clean energy jobs.'' Such an argument is a false choice.
Opportunities for more efficient buildings and wind and nuclear energy address electricity needs, not transportation needs that depend on oil. Thus, they will have virtually no effect on our dangerous foreign oil addiction.
I am lead author of the bipartisan language requiring President Obama to act on Keystone XL in 60 days. Your editorial is wrong in asserting that there is not enough time for a decision. The three-year environmental impact analysis has been completed, and strong environmental requirements are built into the legislation.
The Times is correct that ''American voters are smart enough to see through the ridiculous pipeline gambit.'' A recent Rasmussen poll indicated that voters favored the pipeline by 53 percent to 29 percent, with only 17 percent undecided, showing a strong understanding of the issues involved.
RICHARD G. LUGAR Washington, Jan. 4, 2012
The writer is a Republican senator from Indiana.
To the Editor:
The problem with your editorial about the Canadian pipeline is the same one that is paralyzing politics all over the country. It takes an uncompromising position on one side of an issue and ignores the reality of the situation we face.
The development of new energy sources is a solid and sensible plan. Oil and other current fuel sources are finite. Environmentalists are also right to be concerned about the extraction of oil in light of the spill in the Gulf.
But to ignore the fact that this country runs on oil and coal and will continue to do so for many years to come until alternate energy sources can be developed in an affordable way and on a mass scale is just plain foolish.
Tapping into friendly Canadian and domestic oil sources and going full steam ahead in developing alternate fuel sources make economic and political sense. Why can't we accomplish both?
TONY LaMANTIA
Chicago, Jan. 2, 2012
To the Editor:
Your editorial about the Keystone XL pipeline project is right on the mark. Oil is a sunset industry with little future and no lasting job growth. President Obama understands that the high-paying American jobs of the future are in alternative technologies, but again seems to lack the courage to really stand up for what he knows to be the better policy.
In 2008, I became an Obama supporter when he courageously refused to sign on to the proposal of a gas tax holiday, a gimmick supported by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and John McCain. He should likewise reject this latest misguided energy policy.

HEADLINE: Just the Ticket

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
THE beginning of a new year is a time for resolutions, and Hillary Clinton's admirers are already busily, lovingly resolving on her behalf. On one sideline, her friends tell me that after a few years of hyperactive globetrotting what she really needs is to put her feet up and dictate another volume of her memoirs while nagging Chelsea to deliver grandchildren. (''She's tired; she needs some time off,'' her husband told ABC.) At the other extreme, a couple of Democratic consultants, Patrick Caddell and Douglas Schoen, propose to draft her right now as the 2012 Democratic presidential candidate, whether she likes it or not. (''Not only is Mrs. Clinton better positioned to win in 2012 than Mr. Obama, but she is better positioned to govern if she does,'' they wrote in The Wall Street Journal.) Other helpful devotees have noticed that Brown University is looking for a new president, or have imagined her creating a clone of the Clinton Global Initiative focused on empowering women. Or maybe Ruth Bader Ginsburg will decide to put her feet up, opening a seat on the Supreme Court.
The right choice is none of the above. 
Hillary Clinton is 64 years old, with a Calvinist work ethic, the stamina of an Olympian, an E.Q. to match her I.Q., and the political instincts of a Clinton. She has an impressive empathic ability -- invaluable in politics or statecraft -- to imagine how the world looks to an ally or adversary. She listens, and she learns from her mistakes. She was a perfectly plausible president four years ago, and that was before she demonstrated her gifts as a diplomatic snake-charmer. (Never mind Pakistan and Libya, I'm talking about the Obama White House.) She is, says Gallup, the most admired woman in America for the 10th year in a row, laps ahead of, in order, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, Sarah Palin and Condoleezza Rice; her approval rating of 64 percent is the highest of any political figure in the country.
So it's too early to hang up the big ambition. And a lot of us would be deeply disappointed in her if she did. This would be none of our business if she had taken the off-ramp after her time as first lady. (Nobody is thinking very hard about what's next for Laura Bush.) But she moved on to the Senate, to a near-miss presidential campaign, and to a credible term as secretary of state. She raised our expectations.
The proposal to draft her in place of President Obama this year is preposterous. It exaggerates his vulnerability and discounts Hillary's loyalty. But the idea that she should replace Joe Biden as Obama's running mate in 2012 is something else. It has been kicking around on the blogs for more than a year without getting any traction, mainly because it has been authoritatively, emphatically dismissed by Hillary, Biden and Team Obama.
It's time to take it seriously.
I know the arguments against this scenario, and we'll get to those. But the arguments in favor are as simple as one-two-three. One: it does more to guarantee Obama's re-election than anything else the Democrats can do. Two: it improves the chances that, come next January, he will not be a lame duck with a gridlocked Congress but a rejuvenated president with a mandate and a Congress that may be a little less forbidding. Three: it makes Hillary the party's heir apparent in 2016. If she sits out politics for the next four years, other Democrats (yes, Governor Cuomo, we see your hand up) will fill the void.
She would bring to this year's campaign a missing warmth and some of the voltage that has dissipated as Obama moved from campaigning to governing. What excites is not just the prospect of having a woman a heartbeat -- and four years -- away from the presidency, although she certainly embodies the aspirations of many women. It's the possibility that the first woman at the top would have qualifications so manifest that her first-ness was a secondary consideration.
The biggest obstacle to this scenario is, of course, President Obama, reinforced by the people around him. The Obamas have long regarded the Clintons as representing the tawdry side of politics: the deal-cutting, the calculating, the endless schmoozing, the permanent campaign -- in short, the things that this professorial president could have used more of in his first term. The Clintons -- Bill, at least -- have tended to see Obama as politically naive, steeped in youthful arrogance, a loner, happier to be right than successful. The mistrust may have abated a little, as Hillary has proved herself the most faithful of allies. And Bill has been a pretty disciplined defender of this administration, though his endorsements tend to come with a helping of paternalistic (and public) advice. But the Obamas and Clintons remain a marriage of convenience.
The Obama inner circle believes the president doesn't need Hillary to win a second term. Just now, when the Republican field looks like a bug-spattered windshield and the most likely nominee strikes many in his own party as an empty suit, that confidence is understandable. But Democrats should not get too cocky. Mitt Romney, as I've argued before, has a case to make to voters and the resources to make it. In Iowa, exploiting the Supreme Court's laissez-faire ruling on campaign spending, he brought down Newt Gingrich with an ''independent'' attack machine of considerable firepower.
Moreover, even if Obama can win without Hillary, there's a lot to be said for running up the score. If she can do in 2012 what Obama did in 2008 -- animate that feeling of historic possibility -- the pair can lift some House and Senate candidates along with them. One reason Republicans did so well in the 2010 Congressional elections is that they overcame the gender gap and carried women voters 51 to 49. Those voters will flock back to Hillary, the more so if the Republican ticket is locked into a culture-war agenda. So, by the way, will Hispanic voters, securing such endangered states as Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado.
Vice President Clinton would be a formidable asset in governing as well as campaigning, both as a political calculator and as an emissary to Capitol Hill. She has, to put it mildly, an ability to navigate the world of powerful, problematic men.
In the event that Obama has the good sense (or, if the economy fails to perk up, the sense of desperation) to offer her the vice president's slot, some of her closest friends will implore her to decline. They will tell her that it means tarnishing her reputation by playing the second's traditional role of campaign attack dog. But that needn't be the case. Like Romney, the Democrats can outsource to a super-PAC the wet work that used to be the job of the running mate, letting Hillary stick to the high road. And whatever her friends say, there's no way the dutiful Methodist schoolgirl would turn down an I-need-you from the president.
THAT leaves the delicate question of ditching Joe Biden. He is not a dazzling campaigner, and -- five years Hillary's senior -- he is not Obama's successor. But he is a loyal and accomplished public servant who deserves to be treated with honor.
A political scientist I know proposes the following choreography: In the late winter or early spring, Hillary steps down as secretary of state to rest and write that book. The president assigns Biden -- the former chairman of Senate Foreign Relations -- to add State to his portfolio, making him the most powerful vice president in history. Come the party convention in September, Obama swallows his considerable pride and invites a refreshed Hillary to join the ticket. Biden keeps State. The musicians play ''Happy Days Are Here Again'' as if they really mean it.
Of course, this is more exciting if it's a surprise, and now I've spoiled it. Sorry. But not as sorry as I'll be if -- as I fear -- it's just a fantasy.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Vows to Reject Arbitration in Exxon Case

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) -- President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday that Venezuela would not recognize a ruling by a World Bank panel in a multibillion-dollar arbitration case with the Exxon Mobil Corporation. 
Exxon took Venezuela to the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, seeking as much as $12 billion in compensation after Mr. Chavez ordered the nationalization of the Cerro Negro oil project in 2007.
''I tell you now, we will not recognize any decision'' by the center, Mr. Chavez said during a televised speech. He has repeatedly accused the United States oil major of using unfair deals in the past to ''rob'' Venezuela, an OPEC member, of its resources.
''They are trying the impossible: to get us to pay them,'' he said. ''We are not going to pay them anything.''
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Chavez was also referring to about 20 other cases that Venezuela faces before the World Bank's arbitration panel that were prompted by a wave of state takeovers in recent years.
They include separate multibillion-dollar proceedings brought by ConocoPhillips, another major American oil company.
Last week, an arbitration panel with the International Chamber of Commerce awarded Exxon $908 million in a separate case related to the Cerro Negro nationalization.
On Saturday, the Venezuelan oil minister, Rafael Ramirez, said he did not expect a verdict in Exxon's World Bank case until the end of this year. Exxon said arguments were scheduled to start in February.
Both cases have been closely watched by the industry for precedents in future disputes between companies and oil-producing countries, which have increasingly sought a greater share of revenue as prices soar and reserves become tougher to find.
For years, Venezuela's socialist leader has accused foreign oil companies of plundering the nation's reserves, but he has maintained close ties with many of them.
Some lawyers said the decision by the International Chamber of Commerce covered only a commercial dispute between Exxon and Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company, over earnings Exxon lost as a result of the takeover.
By contrast, the World Bank case is over compensation for Exxon's assets, and specialists say it could yield a larger award.
The government has insisted Exxon receive only slightly more than the $750 million it said it invested in the project, but Venezuela said in September it had offered to settle for $1 billion.
For years, Mr. Chavez has confronted oil companies with tax increases and contract changes aimed at increasing revenue from the industry to pay for state-led antipoverty programs.
Venezuela's push to increase control over its oil industry has been followed by similar efforts in other oil-producing nations. Critics say it has scared investors away from Venezuela and left crude production stagnant.
But some oil companies have remained eager to invest in Venezuela's Orinoco extra heavy oil belt, which is considered one of the world's largest mostly untapped reserves of crude.
Chevron of the United States and Repsol of Spain signed deals in 2010 for new multibillion-dollar projects there.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Slow Recovery

 BODY:
The Interim Haiti Recovery Commission was one of Haiti's great hopes after the earthquake, a Haitian-led international partnership that would finally summon the money, will and organizational intelligence to build the country back better than before. But if you visit the commission's Web site today, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Jan. 12 disaster, this is what you see:
''Please kindly note that the mandate of the I.H.R.C. expired on October 21, 2011. Pending a decision of the Haitian Parliament regarding the future of the institution, a team is currently dealing with day-to-day business. The (re)submission of project proposals remains closed until further notice.'' 
President Michel Martelly has so far failed to get Parliament's approval to extend the mandate.
Led by former President Bill Clinton and Jean-Max Bellerive, Haiti's former prime minister, the commission was given an 18-month mission to oversee an ambitious array of rebuilding projects. It took too long to get organized and former President Rene Preval was more of a hindrance than a partner. A list of approved projects fills 256 pages, though few are finished or fully financed.
Still, Haitians have seen real progress in the last two years. About half of the 10 million cubic feet of quake debris has been removed from Port-au-Prince and other areas. More people have access to clean water in the capital than before the quake. With investment from a Korean garment maker, an industrial park is being built in the northeast, with the promise of 20,000 jobs.
The commission still has a critical role to play, organizing projects, bolstering accountability and transparency, and working to give international donors the confidence to follow through on their pledges. Only about half of the $4.6 billion promised for 2010 and 2011 has been received and spent.
A United Nations analysis showed that while many nations have been generous, particularly the United States, Brazil, Canada, Spain and France, almost all the money has gone to nongovernmental organizations and private contractors. To build Haitian capacity, that will have to change, and the commission can help -- by giving guidance to Haiti's ministries and monitoring their efforts.
President Martelly is a more engaged leader than his predecessor. In the fall, he announced a plan to house 30,000 residents of six tent cities with rental subsidies and new construction. More than a half-million Haitians remain in camps and it is not clear if he will take on powerful landowners to free up the land needed for rebuilding. He needs to abandon his focus on building an army. What Haiti needs is a professional, accountable police force.
Other governments and institutions are pressing on. Last month the World Bank approved a $255 million plan to build houses, train teachers and feed schoolchildren. The grant includes $50 million in agricultural projects. A nongovernmental organization, Partners in Health, plans to open a teaching hospital in the countryside. The Inter-American Development Bank has gathered about $150 million in a five-year, $500 million plan that will build and repair hundreds of schools and train thousands of teachers to bring free public education to all Haitian schoolchildren.
The Haitian government badly needs a national strategy for creating permanent housing and jobs, to resettle people out of Port-au-Prince. The coming year should be one in which Haitians begin to take control of their rebuilding, with continued outside help.

HEADLINE: PAC Ads to Hit Romney's Role At Equity Firm

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Thanks to a $5 million donation from a wealthy casino owner, a group supporting Newt Gingrich plans to place advertisements in South Carolina this week attacking Mitt Romney as a predatory capitalist who destroyed jobs and communities, a full-scale Republican assault on Mr. Romney's business background.
The advertisements, a counterpunch to a campaign waged against Mr. Gingrich by a group backing Mr. Romney, will be built on excerpts from a scathing movie about Bain Capital, the private equity firm Mr. Romney once ran. The movie, financed by a Republican operative opposed to Mr. Romney, includes emotional interviews with people who lost jobs at companies that Bain bought and later sold.
''We had to load up the U-Haul because we done lost our home,'' one woman says. 
Democrats have signaled that they intend to make Mr. Romney's history at Bain a central part of their case against him if he wins the Republican nomination. But Bain has also emerged as an issue in the Republican primary, despite the party's free market stance and business-friendly policies, reflecting the depth of public anger about the economy. At an appearance here on Sunday, Mr. Gingrich suggested that Bain's approach was to carry out ''clever legal ways to loot a company.''
But the planned advertisements appear to be intended to elevate the subject to a new level as Mr. Gingrich and the other Republican contenders begin to run out of time to slow Mr. Romney' s progress toward the nomination. They are the latest example of how ''super PACs'' are carrying out attacks in sync with their preferred candidates and in the process helping to reshape the presidential race. Super PACs can raise unlimited amounts of money but are barred from coordinating with the campaigns they are supporting.
The Bain-centered campaign strikes at the heart of Mr. Romney's argument for his qualifications as president -- that as a successful executive in the private sector, he learned how to create jobs -- and advances an argument that President Obama's re-election campaign has signaled it will employ aggressively against Mr. Romney.
''His business success comes from raiding and destroying businesses -- putting people out of work, stealing their health care,'' said Rick Tyler, a senior adviser to the pro-Gingrich super PAC, Winning Our Future, which recently bought the film, ''King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town,'' after groups backing two other Republican candidates passed up opportunities to use it.
The movie scenes and the influx of money that enable the pro-Gingrich group to run the advertising campaign have ''all the makings of a game-changer,'' Mr. Tyler said.
Winning Our Future got the money for the campaign from Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino owner in Las Vegas who has long supported Mr. Gingrich.
The group said it would spend $1 million initially on radio and TV advertisements starting Wednesday in South Carolina, where the campaign will move after New Hampshire. Mr. Gingrich, who held the lead in the polls in South Carolina last month before falling back, attributes his fade there and earlier in Iowa, where he finished fourth in the caucuses last week, to a deluge of attack advertisements from a super PAC supporting Mr. Romney, Restore Our Future.
When Mr. Gingrich accused Mr. Romney at a debate on Saturday in New Hampshire of following a ''Wall Street model'' where ''you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers,'' Mr. Romney retorted that he had helped create 100,000 jobs, citing successes like Staples.
''It's puzzling to see Speaker Gingrich and his supporters continue their attacks on free enterprise,'' said a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, Andrea Saul. ''This is the type of criticism we've come to expect from President Obama and his left-wing allies at Moveon.org.''
The film's producer, Barry Bennett, a former consultant to a super PAC that supports Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, said he came up with the idea himself.
Mr. Bennett said he had bought an ''opposition research book'' on Mr. Romney compiled by the staff of a Republican rival during the 2008 campaign and had found its contents ''stunning.''
''David Axelrod,'' he said, referring to Mr. Obama's strategist, ''is going to have a heyday with this, and Republicans need to know this story before we nominate this guy.''
He said he had commissioned Jason Killian Meath, an advertising executive and freelance filmmaker, to direct the movie. Mr. Meath worked on the Romney campaign in 2008 as an associate of Stuart Stevens, who is Mr. Romney's strategist.
Mr. Bennett said he paid the film's entire cost, $40,000, from his own pocket; it was never an official project of the pro-Perry group, Make Us Great Again. He said had he never showed it to the pro-Perry group, which he left in October.
But people with knowledge of the film's provenance said that officials at Make Us Great Again were shown an early portion of the film, and had told Mr. Bennett that they had no interest in using it or paying for it.
In a statement, Scott Rials, the executive director, said: ''Make Us Great Again had nothing to do with this video in any way. Period. Barry Bennett worked with us during the startup phase of the super PAC, but we are now working on different projects.''
Mr. Bennett also shopped the film to a super PAC supporting another candidate, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. But officials with the group, Our Destiny, also passed on the film, according to a person with ties to the group.
''We made the decision that that was just not the kind of campaign we wanted to participate in,'' said the person, who asked for anonymity to describe private negotiations.
Mr. Tyler, a former long-time aide to Mr. Gingrich who helped set up the super PAC supporting him, disagreed. ''I'm a capitalist, I'm a conservative,'' he said. ''I've spent a lot of time defending free enterprise from a biblical perspective.''
But Bain Capital, he said, did not fit the model of responsible corporate citizenship. ''If this is free enterprise, then conservatives should have nothing to do with it,'' he said. ''It is predatory paper-shuffling. Mitt Romney was engaged in the engineered destruction of free enterprise.''
The full 28-minute movie, which the group plans to post online, cuts back and forth between images of Mr. Romney's ''$12 million California beach house'' and men and women describing the pain of losing jobs.
A man in a Vietnam veterans hat says: ''Who am I? I'm Bob Safford. Mitt Romney and those guys, they don't care who I am.''
In news clips in the film, Mr. Romney is jeered at for calling corporations ''people'' and explains that capitalism is ''creative destruction.''
Mr. Adelson's $5 million contribution instantly makes Winning Our Future a major player on the political landscape.
A supporter of conservative causes, including the Republican Jewish Coalition, Mr. Adelson is especially close to Mr. Gingrich, a kinship that stretches back to the former speaker's days in the House and has evolved into a relationship that is as much personal as political, according to people who know both men.
Mr. Gingrich, who has vowed to run a positive campaign, has said he will tell supporters not to donate to any group that runs negative advertisements on his behalf. Mr. Tyler said the Romney campaign might find the commercials negative. ''But I think voters will find them instructive and positive and help them make a decision,'' he said.

 BODY:
THE OBAMAS
By Jodi Kantor
Illustrated. 359 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $29.99.
On the evening of Jan. 12 last year, Michelle Obama sat in the front row of a packed memorial service and fixed her eyes on her husband as he took the stage.
The Obamas were at the University of Arizona in Tucson to honor the six people who were killed in shootings that had left Representative Gabrielle Giffords fighting for her life. Jodi Kantor describes Mrs. Obama's reaction as the president spoke:
''She was following every word, nodding a little, her eyes flickering with his words.'' When President Obama described Ms. Giffords opening her eyes for the first time, ''Michelle closed her own eyes briefly, pantomiming her husband's speech a little, showing the relief her husband was expressing. She did that sometimes, acting out the words he was saying during his speeches, as if she could give them some of her animation and help propel his message across.''
By the end of the speech, Ms. Kantor writes: ''The expression on Michelle's face was one of deep satisfaction. He had given the kind of speech she knew he could give. The look on her face said: this is the president I wanted you to be.'' 
Cue the groans. What kind of journalist presumes to know Michelle Obama's mind?
In lesser hands ''The Obamas'' would be an act of astonishing overreach, but Ms. Kantor, who covered the Obamas for The New York Times during the 2008 presidential campaign, and is currently a Washington correspondent for the paper, has earned the voice of authority. A meticulous reporter, Ms. Kantor is attuned to the nuance of small gestures, the import of unspoken truths. She knows that every strong marriage, including the one now in the White House, has its complexities and its disappointments. Ms. Kantor also -- and this is a key -- has a high regard for women, which is why hers is the first book about the Obama presidency to give Michelle Obama her due. In the process we learn a great deal about the talented and introverted loner who married her, and how his wife has influenced him as a president.
''The Obamas'' is full of gossipy tidbits that fuel a narrative about their marriage and how it has shaped the presidency. Public glimpses of their intimacy portray a genuine bond forged by an ambitious man and his equally driven wife. He can be arrogant and self-absorbed, but he strives for her approval. She is his champion and critic, and a fierce guardian of their mutual mission.
Ms. Kantor retires wooden stereotypes of the political wife as a prop or a problem and instead explores what it means to be a modern first lady, one with her own opinions and an expectation that she will be heard. The book offers concrete examples of how Mrs. Obama, even as she wrestled with self-doubt, bolstered her husband as only a wife can and kept him grounded in ways that had nothing to do with the tired story of her ordering him to pick up his dirty socks.
She helped him recalibrate when his public approval rating tanked, urging him to alter wonky speeches with personal stories that could close the distance between cool-headed him and a suffering public. She also was the driving force behind an eventual staff shake-up that led to the departure of senior advisers after Scott Brown won Senator Edward M. Kennedy's seat in Massachusetts. Mr. Brown's victory cost the Democrats their supermajority, and Mrs. Obama was furious with the president, and his staff, whom she saw as insular and disorganized, and failing to prepare for the worst possible outcomes.
''She feels as if our rudder isn't set right,'' Mr. Obama told aides. Eventually he agreed.
''This was Michelle's most profound influence on the Obama presidency,'' Ms. Kantor writes, ''the sense of purpose she shared with her husband, the force of her worldview, her passionate beliefs about access, opportunity, and fairness; her readiness to do what was unpopular and pay political costs. Every day, he met with advisers who emphasized the practical realities of Washington, who reminded him of poll numbers; he spent his nights with Michelle, who talked about moral imperatives, aides said, who reminded him again and again that they were there to do good, to avoid being distracted by political noise, to be bold.''
Sometimes they were too much alike. They shared a disdain for Congress, which crippled Mr. Obama's ability to broker deals. They clung to old friendships, which further isolated them in a town they already distrusted. They also shared a relentless belief that the president was misunderstood and underappreciated by the people he serves. As the wife of a United States senator, I know this to be a common and all-too-toxic affliction in political families. No good comes of it.
In the immediate days after the 2008 election neither the press nor the president-elect's staff knew that Mrs. Obama was so apprehensive about moving to Washington that she considered staying behind in Chicago until her daughters finished the school year. When Mr. Obama was elected to the Senate in 2004, Mrs. Obama refused to move her family to the capital to join him. She had little faith in politics as a way to improve lives, and she wanted to insulate her young children from the surreal world of Washington.
I first learned of this in 2006, when Senator Obama was in Ohio campaigning in the Senate race of my husband, Sherrod Brown. When Mr. Obama heard that I too had refused to move to Washington, he sought me out backstage. ''You've got to meet my wife,'' he said, smiling. ''She feels about Washington the way you do.'' In 2008 I met Mrs. Obama twice and interviewed her once by phone. I have not spoken to her since the 2008 election.
In 2007, after initial reluctance, she gave Mr. Obama her blessing to run for president. The ensuing campaign reinforced her misgivings about political life. She felt stung by negative coverage of her and ill-served at times by an unsupportive staff. She changed her mind about staying in Chicago after Mr. Obama made it clear he needed her, and the girls. Thus began the public transformation of Michelle Obama.
Mrs. Obama struggled with her changed role -- in the world at large but also in her family. It was impossible to take her girls to school, or sometimes even attend their soccer matches, without embarrassing them with the accompanying ruckus. She also felt new limitations in her marriage -- imposed, not by the president, but by his presidency. An accomplished professional, smart and wickedly funny, she was used to being Mr. Obama's partner. Now his day was scheduled in five-minute increments, and she was abruptly recast as his helpmate.
She resisted the ceremonial duties expected of first ladies. She loathed the stuffy annual lunches with Congressional spouses, agreeing to attend one only if they joined her the day before to volunteer at a Washington-area food bank. Her good intentions were derailed by media coverage that focused on the $515 sneakers she wore to load groceries.
Clothing had become her ''compensatory pleasure'' for dutifully enduring the public demands of her husband's political career, Ms. Kantor writes. ''If I have to go, I'm getting a new dress out of it,'' she told neighbors.
Now perhaps the most prominent black woman in America, she felt pressure to counter negative stereotypes by telegraphing images of elegance and self-confidence. Instead, she became America's first fashionista during tough economic times for the country.
Her new image set off repeated bouts of apoplexy among some White House staff members, who weighed in on her choices, albeit indirectly, creating a climate of tension. Ms. Kantor describes a blowup in August 2010 between the White House press secretary at the time, Robert Gibbs, and the Obamas' close friend and adviser, Valerie Jarrett, in which he screamed an expletive at her. In a condescending tone Ms. Jarrett said, ''The first lady would not believe you're speaking this way.'' His response was to curse the first lady too.
Over time the Obamas grew into their new jobs. In the process, Ms. Kantor writes, they have traded roles: ''She had entered with her expectations low and then exceeded them; he had entered on top of the world, and had been descending to earth ever since.''
Perhaps they have reached an agreement that, for now, Washington is their town too.

HEADLINE: Republicans Versus Reproductive Rights

 BODY:
In Iowa, the Republican presidential contenders tried to outdo one another in attacking reproductive rights as they sought the support of caucusgoers from the religious right. In New Hampshire, where voters are less socially conservative, the candidates have focused more on economic issues. 
But the message from Iowa was crystal clear: Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman Jr., Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry all stand ready to restrict a woman's right to make her own childbearing decisions and deny essential health care to millions of women.
The Republican field is united in its determination to overturn Roe v. Wade; to appoint Supreme Court justices supportive of that goal; and to end government payments to Planned Parenthood for family planning services, cancer screening and other vital health services provided to low-income women. The candidates also want to reinstate the global gag rule that barred family planning groups abroad receiving federal money from even talking about abortion.
There are a few differences among the candidates. Only Mr. Gingrich has called for punishing judges who make abortion rulings not to his liking. Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman refused to sign the Susan B. Anthony pledge to appoint antiabortion cabinet members, among other things. Mr. Huntsman opposed the ''personhood'' initiative in Mississippi that would have given human fertilized eggs the legal rights and protections that apply to people, and outlawed abortion as well as some of the most widely used forms of contraception and in vitro fertilization. Mississippi voters resoundingly rejected the measure in November as going too far.
Mr. Romney denied supporting the measure once it was defeated. But before the vote, in an interview with Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and a Fox News personality, he created a different impression. When asked whether as Massachusetts governor he would have supported a constitutional amendment establishing that life begins at conception, he said, ''Absolutely.''
This fall, the Republican nominee probably will not be trumpeting this extreme agenda in trying to appeal to moderate women voters, a key constituency in the general election. But voters should not be fooled. The assault on women's reproductive health is a central part of the Republican agenda. It is not too early for Democrats to point that out.

HEADLINE: Changing the State of Play

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
There was a time when each of the Big Three nightly newscasts on American television tended to open with the same story -- the latest campaign speech, a new government study or perhaps a big snowstorm. That time is gone.
Influenced by cable and the Internet, the nightly newscasts are shaking up conventions that stretch back 50 years, seeking to distinguish themselves by picking different stories and placing them in different orders.
On any given night, one might lead with the Republican campaign, another with extreme weather and the third with an exclusive interview.
''The three evening newscasts have become more different from one another than at any time I can remember,'' said Bill Wheatley, who worked at NBC News for 30 years and now teaches at Columbia. 
The differences provide a stark illustration of the state of the news media -- much more fragmented than ever, but also arguably more creative.
Viewers these days ''make their own choices,'' said Ben Sherwood, the president of ABC News. ''They pick what matters most to them, and we are trying to be adaptive and responsive to those sweeping changes.''
In the mornings, too, the networks are highlighting their differences. On Monday, CBS, which has been stuck in last place for decades, will introduce a new morning show featuring Charlie Rose that promises more hard news than NBC and ABC and no cooking segments or couch chitchat.
Steve Capus of NBC, the longest-serving of the three current network news chiefs, called the ''different tacks'' taken by the networks in the last year a positive development. ''What is going to rule the day, in this age, is unique content,'' he said.
On some days, the differences at 6:30 p.m. are substantive; on a Thursday in December, CBS led with Iran's capture of a United States drone surveillance aircraft, NBC opened with an investigation into the mishandling of soldiers' remains, and ABC with the mysterious shooting of a police officer at Virginia Tech.
On other days, they are stylistic; on Tuesday, as the Iowa caucus commenced, ABC led with a piece on Rick Santorum's surge, CBS led with a news-making interview of Newt Gingrich, and NBC with a recap of the day's campaigning.
There are differences in tone, as well. Scott Pelley of CBS evokes anchors of yesteryear while ABC's Diane Sawyer radiates empathy for her subjects. These are ''eye of the beholder'' factors, as Brian Williams of NBC put it. ''We are different people,'' he said, ''so naturally we all bring a different 'voice' to our on-air writing and our delivery style.''
The main public TV nightly newscast, ''PBS NewsHour,'' also differs from the three commercial newscasts; it tends to have more coverage about government and international events and much less about crime and disasters, according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism, an arm of the Pew Research Center that studies the nation's news output.
For decades, there were only ''marginal differences'' among NBC, ABC and CBS, said Tom Rosenstiel, who directs the project. ''When one tried something new that viewers apparently liked, the others would assimilate it.''
Now, instead, they are counterprogramming. The biggest changes are apparent on CBS and ABC, which have long trailed NBC in the news ratings.
ABC's new push to humanize the news and CBS's heavily promoted emphasis on hard news may make NBC News the Goldilocks news division -- not too hot, not too cold, just right.
Then again, some people have different tastes.
''I think it's a great sign of the times that everybody's not in lockstep on the first story every night,'' Ms. Sawyer said. Her staff members, she said, start each day by discussing ''the questions that we think people at home are going to be asking.''
Some staff members at ABC's competitors privately criticize ''World News'' for bending too far toward human interest stories; on Wednesday, for instance, the broadcast talked about the tax code by highlighting a California union's ad that compares the millionaire Kim Kardashian's tax bill to that of a middle-class Californian.
Is that hard news or soft? ABC would say that question is outdated.
''We don't believe in black and white distinctions; we believe in relevance as a unifying idea in the choices we make,'' said Mr. Sherwood, who soon after taking charge of ABC News about a year ago read ''Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd,'' a book by Prof. Youngme Moon of Harvard Business School.
Although ABC's morning and evening shows tend to spend less time covering international news than NBC or CBS, Mr. Sherwood can point to any number of examples of ABC's excelling overseas; Ms. Sawyer was the only one of the three anchors to travel to Japan after the earthquake and tsunami there last year.
''The strategy of doing the same thing with subtle differences -- that's how you end up in the commodity world,'' he said.
As at ABC, the bosses at CBS are new. Last winter, when Jeff Fager, the producer of ''60 Minutes,'' was made chairman of CBS News, he told staff members that he wanted the division to be known for hard news and original reporting. Although mired in third place in the mornings and evenings, the network attracts a huge audience each week for ''60 Minutes,'' and it is trying to replicate that success across the workweek.
In 2011, Mr. Rosenstiel's researchers found that the ''CBS Evening News'' gave more time to two top stories, the economy and the Middle East, than ''NBC Nightly News'' or ABC's ''World News,'' and a bit less time on what the researchers called lifestyle stories and disaster stories.
Mr. Fager said: ''I think way too much of the time, news had become, 'Boy, they had that, why didn't we have that?' And then, at the end of the day, the three evening newscasts looked exactly the same. We're not doing that.''
To that point, the television sets labeled ''NBC,'' ''ABC'' and ''CNN'' in the ''CBS Evening News'' studio were turned off when Mr. Pelley succeeded Katie Couric on the newscast in June.
''They haven't been turned on in six months,'' Mr. Pelley said in his office overlooking the studio. ''In fact, we should probably find a better use for them.''
Some of CBS's competitors call that attitude willful blindness; CBS calls it a clear strategy to differentiate itself. The network had little success when Ms. Couric tinkered with the ''CBS Evening News'' format five years ago. But this time ''they seem to be making some progress,'' Mr. Wheatley, the former NBC executive, said of CBS, while noting that viewing habits are slow to change.
They are indeed. But in the TV season that ended in September, after nine consecutive years of slow declines, the three networks' evening newscasts all posted ratings gains for the first time since 2002, giving each reason to believe in its strategies.
Mr. Capus of NBC said, ''We're defying the trends of network television.''

HEADLINE: Japan, Reconsidered

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not good, but not as bad as advertised. 

 BODY:
A number of readers have asked me for an evaluation of Eamonn Fingleton's article about Japan. Is Japan doing as well as he says?
Well, no -- but his point about the overstatement of Japan's decline is right.
Fingleton's essay basically throws everything he can think of against the wall, in the hope that some of it sticks. And this detracts from the story. No, current account surpluses aren't necessarily a sign of success. No, you shouldn't take the shadowstats stuff seriously. And so on.
The real Japan issue is that a lot of its slow growth has to do with demography. According to OECD numbers, in 1990 there were 86 million Japanese between the ages of 15 and 64; by 2007, that was down to 83 million. Meanwhile, the US working-age population rose from 164 million to 202 million.
What do you find if you look not at GDP per capita, but GDP per working-age resident? I've taken the BLS data on GDP and the OECD data on population 15-64, and gotten this picture of the ratio of Japanese output per potential worker to US output per potential worker:
By the way, I stop at 2007 so that the response to the financial crisis doesn't blur the picture.
What you see is that 1990-2000 really was a lost decade: Japanese output per potential worker fell a lot relative to the United States, when in the past it had been steadily rising. However, Japan made up most though not all of the lost ground after 2000. 
I think you can make the case that Japan should have been doing better in 2007. And even if you think that 2007 was where it "should" be, it spent a long time operating below potential. But Fingleton is right in this: the data don't match the picture of relentless decline that is so widely held.
And Japan did go through all this period without anything like the suffering, the human disaster, that America is experiencing.
I've been saying for a while that when people ask whether we might respond to our crisis as badly as Japan did, they're way behind the curve. We are, in fact, doing worse than Japan ever did.

HEADLINE: Building an Archive From the Rubble

BYLINE: DAVID GONZALEZ


HIGHLIGHT: Larry Racioppo's bosses didn't want pretty pictures -- they wanted to show how bad the city's housing stock was. He delivered, documenting how the city's housing agency rebuilt entire neighborhoods. 

 BODY:
In 1989, Larry Racioppo got his first regular job in years: taking pictures showing New York City at its worst. He spent his days stepping through dank basement crack dens and apartments that were as burned-out as their inhabitants. On rooftops, spent shell casings littered the tar like fallen leaves. At street level, entire neighborhoods had been reduced to empty lots.
Mr. Racioppo was a carpenter-turned-photographer who knew his way around construction, a camera and the city, knowledge that served him well during a 22-year career as photographer for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. It was his job to show how bad things were at a time when Mayor Edward I. Koch had shepherded an unprecedented and ambitious plan to renovate the city's huge portfolio of dilapidated buildings seized from bankrupt, indifferent or criminally negligent landlords.
"It was the era after the Bronx was burning, and how the city responded to that in an effort to make a dent," said Mr. Racioppo, who retired last September. "We had to be able to photograph what was really there, and not to sugarcoat anything. The commissioners never told me to hide anything. If there were bad conditions, they wanted to be able to change that. If conditions were horrible, they could get resources allocated. So my photographs were a wonderful tool."
His archive documents a city that remade itself during a decade of furious rebuilding. It starts with buildings in the South Bronx where graffiti-covered lobbies had rows of broken mailboxes, and includes crack houses in Brooklyn where a scrawled warning told addicts to spend only 10 minutes smoking. But the arc of his narrative revisits many of the same locations and shows them as renovated spaces unrecognizable from their previous squalor.
Mr. Racioppo, 64, was born in Brooklyn and had attended Fordham University for three years when he left in 1968 to work with impoverished teenagers as a Vista volunteer in the Santa Clara Valley in California. While there, he took a liking to photography after borrowing a friend's camera, and when he was set to return home, he bought a used Nikon Rangefinder.
"I bought it by weight," he said. "It seemed more solid than other cameras, so I figured it must be better."
In New York, he drove a cab, took a photo class and rented a storefront space in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, which he turned into a darkroom.
"You don't have to go to art school for four years," he said. "You just had to pay attention to what you were doing."
Like many other artists, he took on the usual jobs to support his passion - cabby, bartender and carpenter, working for a construction firm started by some sculptors who had studied at Cooper Union. In 1989, a friend told him about the city photographer job. He applied and was hired, though he thought he would stay only a brief while.
Trooping through neighborhoods known for their destruction and danger, Mr. Racioppo found himself at ease.
"Some of these places reminded me of my Vista work," he said. "I never held being poor against anybody. In any building, all it takes is one or two bad families with serious problems to make it bad for everybody. But I was not surprised to find they had really good people. You had working families who had to live there because they couldn't afford anything else."
His pictures bear that out. A living room in the Bronx is modestly decorated, even though the walls have been stripped of plaster to expose a latticework of worn wood. A bedroom shows mold creeping along a wall, right above a painting of a guardian angel ushering two children across a rickety bridge.
His later images show the result of straightforward renovations and also illustrate how the city found creative ways to rebuild entire blocks with tidy town houses made affordable through tax breaks, innovative construction and low-cost mortgages.
What he thought would be a brief stay not only turned into a career, but it reinvigorated his artistic life. His travels through the city spurred him on to do several new series, including one on abandoned theaters, schools and other spaces and another on religious imagery on the street. His work earned him a Guggenheim fellowship in 1997, though he kept his day job.
His photographs of a remade city have been exhibited in museums and have been used to remind more recent city hires how much New York has changed.
"A lot of young people ask, 'What was so bad? Why was it such a problem?'" he said. "They came here in 2005 when brownstones in Harlem were easily going for more than a million dollars. People don't remember when you couldn't give those places away 20 years ago."
He remembers -- which is also why he worries.
"Anyone uncomfortable with change shouldn't live in New York," he said. "You have to appreciate the ongoing state of flux. Unfortunately, there is an incredible distancing between the rich and the poor, and it's getting worse. Working people are again veering towards being poor."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: For the Win!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Do your employees offer dissenting viewpoints? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: We Did It!
We did it! Our $15.22 trillion national debt is now officially equal to our annual gross domestic product! But Paul Krugman says national debt doesn't matter as much as we think because "... nations with stable, responsible governments - that is, governments that are willing to impose modestly higher taxes when the situation warrants it - have historically been able to live with much higher levels of debt than today's conventional wisdom would lead you to believe." Here are 10 more reasons not to worry about our public debt. Are you feeling better? Neither is Peter Treadway. Menzie Chinn and Jeffry Frieden believe that whipping up inflation could solve our debt problems. The Fed decides to disclose interest rate targets. Doug Short provides this chart showing the effects of the Fed's recent interventions on the stock market.
The Economy: Promising Trends
The Labor Department reports 200,000 new jobs. Business Insider says there's an invisible force that is saving the economy. Tim Duy is still cautious, and Bill Vincent says we'll need a stiff upper lip. But Jared Sleeper says that manufacturing is set to outperform this year. Matt Yglesias says that economic recovery is right around the corner. SurePayroll's monthly Small Business Scorecard shows a "promising trend of small business owners expressing optimism about the economy." Intuit's Small Business Employment Index finds that business employment is growing at a 3.3 percent annual rate. And Vistage members believe that in three years, the United States will be the world's most improved economy. More proof: Dunkin' Donuts plans to double its American locations! Dave Barry is just glad 2011 is over: "This was a year in which the cast members of 'Jersey Shore' went to Italy and then - in an inexcusable lapse of border security - were allowed to return"
The Data: Manufacturing and Construction Tick Up 
The ISM manufacturing index (pdf) rises significantly, and construction spending increases. Scott Grannis says, "The good news, in other words, is that we have probably seen the end of the bad news in the housing and construction sectors." Grubb & Ellis predicts a year of slow but continued growth for commercial real estate. In retail, same store sales are up 3.4 percent. A last-minute flood of December buyers puts automakers on track for increased sales, but most automakers expect slower growth in 2012. These 11 items will cost more this year. Barry Ritholtz has cool graphics that show small-business failure rates. Jobless claims are at a three-and-a-half-year low. Kodak may be preparing for chapter 11. Here are the top economists of 2011.
Technology: For the Win!
Daniel Little is amazed by information technology and new human capabilities. I'm amazed that there's now a Steve Jobs action figure (and Apple's not happy about it). A New York City ferry service introduces a smartphone-based ticketing system. During the three months ending in November, 91.4 million people in the United States owned smartphones, up 8 percent from the preceding three-month period. Heather Clancy reports that mobile phones help a small health care provider improve efficiency. Paul Gill offers a great list of instant messaging jargon for 2012. (Do you know what FTW stands for?) Expect ultrabooks to dominate the PC landscape this year.
Boss of the Week: Michael Oster of Eos Energy Storage
This battery developer "claims to have solved key problems holding back a battery technology that could revolutionize grid energy storage. If the company is right, its zinc-air batteries will be able to store energy for half the cost of additional generation from natural gas - the method currently used to meet peak power demands."
Marketing: Are You on Google Plus?
Here are 10 free ways to promote your company online. Heidi Cohen creates the only 2012 marketing checklist you will need. This graphic explains what women buy. Pamela Vaughan lists 17 silly ways to miss lead-generation opportunities, but nothing's sillier than watching Snoop on "The Price Is Right." Google Plus sees huge growth in membership, and Chris Brogan says small businesses had better be on it. Sean McGinnis offers five tips to improve sales in 2012, including finding mentors: "Schedule a monthly sit-down with them and review your records and activity with them. Be honest and ask their advice with sticking points."
Marketing 2: Do You Need 25 Hammers?
Larry Downes says Best Buy is gradually going out of business. The check-in service Foursquare hopes to mine the data it collects on millions of consumers and merchants. A Kinect-based tracking system gathers data on shoppers' interactions with the products on retail shelves. The Girl Scouts introduce a new cookie. Michael Koploy gives advice on how to differentiate your store from online merchants, including, "Rethink the store inventory and layout": "Do retailers really need to sell 25 types of hammers? In fact, retailers may not need much inventory at all." If she had to shop, Neely Steinberg wouldn't mind a few men coming along on the trip.
Ideas: To Tebow or Not to Tebow?
Geoff Vincent explains how not to overpay your salespeople. Kelly Clay offers seven ways to make more money this month. Here's how to hide your next $1.7 billion fraud. If you're thinking that a book might promote your business, there may be fewer bookstores interested in selling it. A typewriter repairman keeps busy. Stephen Shapiro explains how Oprah nearly killed his business. Jason Keith asks if small-business owners need Tim Tebow-like optimism. Karl Walinskas says we should all be doing the Tebow: "The Tebowing process of falling to one knee in prayer or thanks, the self-effacing pep talks in the huddle, and the poise under strain are the body language not of hope but of belief. When belief is followed by action, it becomes conviction, and that is infectious and hard to stop." And fear not: even if you're a middle-age pot smoker, you won't forget these great ideas!
Around the Country: The Greatest Map Ever
The Small Business Administration is seeking nominations for its small-business awards. A coaching firm introduces an online course to help businesses maximize return on investment when participating in a business expo or trade show. Entrepreneur magazine's growth conference is this week. Here's the greatest map of the United States you'll ever see. An income tax cut is the top priority for Kansas businesses. A paperless bathroom may be another priority.
Around the World: Drowning in a Sea of Giants
Greece's I.R.S. goes on strike. Global growth slows to 3.9 percent, and Goldman Sachs says the world economy will continue to slow in 2012. Joseph Hogue says that once again everything hinges on China. Iran's death spiral continues. Apparently, Russian small businesses are drowning in a sea of giants. Swedes convert a former church into a center for entrepreneurship. And Americans make up half the world's 1 percent.
Your Finances: Putting Your Network to Work
The average successful start-up raises $25.3 million and sells for $196.8 million (but the average guy would not try this with a ceiling fan). An angel investor offers a potpourri of start-up stuff from 2011. Catherine Clifford lists her top sources for small-business financing this year. Eric Jackson offers six tips for raising capital in 2012, including putting your network to work: "Successful entrepreneurs make sure their contacts know what they're working on and ask for help when they need it. Besides investors whom you know directly, ask your contacts for introductions." Small-business lending is at a four-year high.
Red Tape Update: 53 Tax Breaks Expired!
The Wall Street Journal offers its view of the 2012 regulatory landscape. New research weakens the case for small-business tax relief, and 53 tax breaks expired on Jan. 1. Diana Ransom reports that small-business health care is still on hold. Ina Steiner asks if we know what to do with I.R.S. Form 1099K. Scientists figure out how to skip time (this grandma probably wanted to skip this visit).
The Week's Bests
Reason to Quote Tennyson. Jill Scalisi explains how starting a company is like falling in love: "You can make incredible connections with people you would never dream you would meet; they can then introduce you to more people; crazier is all of these people are now pulling for you and want to help you succeed; unbelievable opportunities can present themselves out of nowhere; and luck comes in so many shapes and sizes you forget what it actually looks like. ... ''Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.' - Tennyson."
Lessons Learned. Michael Martin shares some lessons he learned running a small business in 2011, including: "New does not necessarily equal worthwhile. In the tech world, we all love the speed at which things change. The impulse is to try as many new products and services as we can, because who knows what the next game-changer will be? And therein lies the problem. It could be anything, and there are new things coming at you every day. You can't try them all, and the attempt is a waste of your time. I think a better approach is to let the community try them out for you and join in when a winner seems to be emerging."
Way to Be Unsuccessful. Eric Jackson lists seven habits of spectacularly unsuccessful executives, including: "They ruthlessly eliminate anyone who isn't completely behind them. C.E.O.'s who think their job is to instill belief in their vision also think that it is their job to get everyone to buy into it. ... The problem with this approach is that it's both unnecessary and destructive. C.E.O.'s don't need to have everyone unanimously endorse their vision to have it carried out successfully. In fact, by eliminating all dissenting and contrasting viewpoints, destructive C.E.O.'s cut themselves off from their best chance of seeing and correcting problems as they arise."

HEADLINE: Very Serious Scare Tactics

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Apocalypse now, or soon, or something. 

 BODY:
As part of a longer-term project, I've been looking into the why and how of the dominance of austerity rhetoric over most of the past two years. One aspect is the rapturous glee with which policymakers seized on the theory of expansionary austerity, without waiting to see how well it would stand up under scrutiny (and the answer was, not well at all). 
Another aspect, however, is the willingness of Very Serious People to invoke apocalyptic visions based on nothing but their gut feelings -- gut feelings that people with actual money on the line didn't share. Here's Erskine Bowles, on March 8, 2011, warning about an imminent debt crisis: 
This problem is going to happen, like the former chairman of the Fed said or Moody's said, this is a problem we're going to have to face up to. It may be two years, you know, maybe a little less, maybe a little more, but if our bankers over there in Asia begin to believe that we're not going to be solid on our debt, that we're not going to be able to meet our obligations, just stop and think for a minute what happens if they just stop buying our debt.
What happens to interest rates and what happens to the U.S. economy? The markets will absolutely devastate us if we don't step up to this problem. The problem is real, the solutions are painful and we have to act.
Alan Simpson then weighed in and declared that it would be less than two years -- presumably based on his deep knowledge of markets and debt history, which he somehow acquired without anyone noticing.
Now, maybe Bowles and Simpson will be proved right, although I very much doubt it. But what I do know is that come March 2013, with interest rates still very low and no hint of a debt crisis, they will still be considered Very Serious. False warnings of doom only matter if they come from the wrong people, advocating the wrong things.

HEADLINE: A Boom in Starter Capital for Hedge Funds

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: A number of big financial firms have been seeding emerging hedge funds as investors look for ways to tap newer managers, who often attain their biggest gains in their early years. 

 BODY:
There is a seeding frenzy in the hedge fund industry.
As the industry's returns have been disappointing, big investors need somewhere to park their money -- and handing development capital to emerging hedge funds has become a strategy of choice.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced a partnership with Financial Risk Management, a fund of funds with about two decades of experience, to create a platform for seed investments. Also on Monday, IMQubator, a seeding fund backed by the Dutch pension giant APG, announced a partnership with Hong Kong-based Synergy Fund Management, a fund of funds that will assist in the selection of Asian hedge fund managers for the seeder. 
In the last year alone, firms like Blackstone and Goldman Sachs have raised billions of dollars to provide starter capital to hedge funds. Others that have raised money include veteran seeder Reservoir Capital Group and smaller players like NewAlpha Asset Management. 
The frenzy is driven primarily by two things. First, it is tough to raise money for small managers. Some investors are still craving the safety of size after the 2008 financial crisis. On top of that, with a changing investor base, there is a question of scale. The typical hedge fund investor is no longer the nimble family office, which can allocate small amounts of capital to whatever hedge fund strikes its fancy. The big investors like pensions and endowments that dominate the landscape require hedge funds large enough to accept rich initial investments (as high as hundreds of millions of dollars).
Second, investors themselves are looking for ways to access the returns of newer managers, particularly given how poorly the broader industry has performed. (While there were big standouts this year -- notably the Chicago-based hedge fund company Citadel -- the industry actually underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in 2011). Research shows that hedge fund managers often score their biggest gains in their early years, so seeding arrangements allow investors to tap that vein of performance without counting too much on a single manager. 
Seeders are awash in talent as Wall Street gives up some of their star traders to comply with the Volcker rule, which prohibits proprietary trading. And with bank profitability under fire, dissatisfied employees are searching for bigger pay days.
The dislocation can mean big money for seeders. With an seed investment of, say, $200 million, a fund at Blackstone gets an ownership stake in the general partnership of an upstart hedge fund. That means they get a chunk of whatever profit the hedge fund makes after shelling out the money investors (limited partners) are owed. It also means that if the hedge fund grows, so too do the profits of the seeder.
Of course, the hedge fund could also blow up. While many seeders would argue that the idea of owning a basket of small managers enables you to protect against blow ups, one advantage of large managers is that they have withstood the test of time. Talent in any industry -- whether sports or finance -- is tough to pick, and pedigreed managers throw in the towel up all the time.
It is too early to tell whether this fad will pay out. Historically, managers like Reservoir have done exceptionally well with investments in highly regarded funds like Anchorage Capital Group, a credit hedge fund with roughly $10 billion under management. The head of Reservoir, Daniel Stern, previously provided seed capital to industry titan Och-Ziff Capital Management, a publicly traded hedge fund with nearly $30 billion under management.

HEADLINE: Conviction of Former Refco Lawyer Is Overturned

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A federal appeals court reversed the conviction of Joseph Collins, a former outside lawyer to Refco, the collapsed brokerage firm. A retrial could be complicated by the death of a crucial witness, Santo Maggio. 

 BODY:
7:33 p.m. | Updated 
A federal appeals court on Monday reversed the conviction of Joseph P. Collins, a former outside lawyer to Refco, the collapsed brokerage firm, ruling that the trial court judge had improper discussions with a juror outside the presence of Mr. Collins's lawyers.
Mr. Collins was found guilty in July 2009 of assisting Refco's senior executives with defrauding its shareholders of $2.4 billion. He was sentenced to seven years in prison, but has been free on bail pending the outcome of his appeal.
A three-judge panel for the United States Court Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned Mr. Collins's conviction and ruled that he was entitled to a new trial.
 "After this long fight, we are very gratified by the Court of Appeals decision," said William Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. Collins.
The spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment on whether it would retry the case.
A retrial of Mr. Collins could be complicated by the death of Santo C. Maggio. The former president of Refco's capital markets unit, Mr. Maggio died last week at the age of 60. Scott Hershman, his former lawyer, confirmed his death.
Mr. Maggio, known as Sandy, was the government's key cooperating witness in the Refco case. He testified in the trials of Mr. Collins and Tone N. Grant, a former senior Refco executive. He also wore a wire to help ensnare Phillip R. Bennett, Refco's chief executive who pleaded guilty to hiding about $430 million in bad debt from the company's auditors and investors. Mr. Grant and Mr. Bennett are both in prison. In exchange for his cooperation, Mr. Maggio was not sentenced to any prison time.
Though it was a scandal from the middle of last decade and before the financial crisis, the Refco case continues to linger.
The New York brokerage firm, which facilitated trades in commodities and futures contracts, collapsed in October 2005 after disclosing Mr. Bennett's fraud. Much of Refco's assets were acquired in bankruptcy by the Man Group, which later spun off the business and renamed it MF Global. Late last year, MF Global filed for bankruptcy.
The Refco case has also haunted Mr. Collins, a former corporate lawyer at Mayer Brown, a large Chicago-based firm. He was charged in 2007 with helping Refco's executives manipulate its balance and hide losses from its investors. It was an unusual white-collar prosecution, as outside corporate lawyers are rarely indicted alongside their clients in accounting fraud cases.
A jury convicted Mr. Collins on five of the 14 securities fraud counts against him. But during deliberations, the foreman sent the judge, Robert P. Patterson, a note that one juror had tried to barter his vote and was refusing to deliberate. Another juror sent a note that the same juror had threatened to cut off his finger.
Judge Patterson interviewed the problematic juror and emphasized the importance of resolving the case outside the presence of Mr. Collins's lawyers.
"This sequence of events deprived Mr. Collins of his right to be present at every stage of the trial," wrote Judge Denny Chin in the opinion. The right to be present at every trial stage is rooted in the Constitution, including the Fifth Amendment "due process" clause.
"We cannot say with fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the district court's errors in this case," said Judge Chin.
If the United States attorney in Manhattan decides to retry Mr. Collins, the government could try to have Mr. Maggio's testimony from the first trial read into the record, say legal experts.
Mr. Maggio, who pleaded guilty to participating in the Refco fraud, testified during Mr. Collins's 2010 trial, walking the jury through what he said was the company's complex accounting fraud scheme.
Federal prosecutors also asked Mr. Maggio about his new life since his Wall Street career. He said that he lived in Naples, Fla., and ran a fishing charter business called Starting Over Charters. The name of the company was not, as many had suspected, a reference to his post-Refco life.
Mr. Maggio explained to the jury that "Starting Over" was what he named his boat when he was divorced in 1982.
"My ex-wife also bought a boat and called it 'Free Again,'" he added.

HEADLINE: Economic Toll of Diabetes Begins Early

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: Diabetes may be more than a hazard to health. A new study shows that young adults with the disease have lower lifetime earnings and fewer job prospects than their peers. 

 BODY:
Diabetes may be more than a hazard to health. A new study shows that young adults with the disease have lower lifetime earnings and fewer job prospects than their peers.
The new research helps quantify the nonmedical costs of a burdensome disease that afflicts nearly 10 percent of Americans. The study did not distinguish between Type 2 diabetes, which is closely linked to obesity and inactivity and is by far the most common form of the disease, and Type 1, sometimes called juvenile diabetes, which may be linked to immune, genetic and environmental factors. But both types of diabetes are on the rise in young people: About 215,000 Americans younger than 20 have Type 1 or Type 2 disease. 
The study, which tracked 15,000 people over a period of 14 years, from high school through their early 30s, found that people with diabetes could expect $160,000 less in earnings over the course of their lifetimes compared with those without the disease. They had lower rates of finishing high school and were less likely to move on to college than young adults who were not diabetic. By age 30, a person with diabetes is 10 percent less likely to have a job, in part because of reduced education.
The findings, published in the journal Health Affairs, "are important because they reflect that diabetics may be having some negative consequences pretty early on in the course of life," said Dr. Michael Richards, a physician and doctoral candidate in the department of health policy and administration at Yale and an author of the study. They "also beg the question of what the underlying influences that are driving these associations may be."
One driving force, Dr. Richards suspects, may be the difficulty in balancing school or job demands with the management of a chronic disease. Employers may also be less likely to hire someone with diabetes because they fear they will take more sick days or be less productive or more of an insurance burden than other workers. People with diabetes themselves may also be reluctant to seek out better-paying jobs for fear of losing health benefits, a phenomenon known as job lock. 
"Diabetes could also affect the incentives for people in terms of how much schooling they want to acquire, and it could also change incentives for employers who might expect larger medical spending for their diabetic employees," Dr. Richards said. "Probing further into these potential mechanisms is going to be a goal of future work."
Earlier studies have shown that chronic disease and other aspects of a person's health can pose barriers in the job market. The overweight and obese, for example, face job discrimination and often earn less than their thinner counterparts. And researchers have previously shown that diabetes can hamper productivity and hurt employment prospects among older Americans. But Dr. Richards and his colleagues wanted to work backward to see if a similar pattern might occur with younger patients.
They found that high school students with diabetes had a dropout rate 6 percent greater than that of their peers, and were 10 percent less likely than others to find a job when looking for employment. The study controlled and adjusted for the effect of being overweight, a factor in Type 2 diabetes, as well as other family, environmental and demographic factors -- and diabetes was still shown to have a direct and independent effect.
The researchers were surprised to find that diabetes also had an intergenerational effect. Young people in the study, regardless of whether they had diabetes, were 6 percent less likely to attend college if they had a parent with the disease. One explanation is that parents with diabetes might have fewer financial resources and less time and energy to devote to their children because of the encumbrance of managing the disease, Dr. Richards said. "It's a novel and intriguing finding," he said, "and if it is indeed a real phenomenon, then it suggests that the societal burden of diabetes has perhaps been underestimated."

HEADLINE: 2012 BMW 3 Series: The Bavarian Sport Sedan Drops Cylinders and Gains Speed

BYLINE: LAWRENCE ULRICH


HIGHLIGHT: The standard-bearer for compact-sedan performance has grown wider and wedgier, as well as quicker and more efficient. 

 BODY:
What is it? Need we ask? America's most popular Bimmer, beloved of freshly minted lawyers, gets its official world premiere in Detroit. (It was previewed online in October.)
Is it real? At the 2011 Detroit auto show, Mercedes-Benz announced that a 4-cylinder engine would return to the C-Class. BMW is falling in line behind its archrival, with the first four-banger in a 3 Series since the forgettable 318ti hatchback of the '90s. This is the sixth generation of the sport sedan that BMW introduced to America as a 1977 model.
What they said: The bread-and-butter sedan arrives in showrooms this winter, with all-wheel-drive and ActiveHybrid versions appearing in the fall. Those awaiting further spinoffs must sit tight. "A new coupe and convertible are a ways away," a BMW spokesman, Thomas Plucinsky, said in an interview last week. "We may see them toward the end of 2013." Mr. Plucinsky confirmed that BMW would continue to offer a 3 Series wagon in America, to be unveiled this year.
What they didn't say: The 3 Series represents a major test and a modest risk for BMW, with a new turbocharged 4-cylinder engine replacing the venerable in-line 6 in the basic 328i model. Will buyers embrace a premium German sedan with 4-cylinder power? And can BMW get electric steering right on this go-round, after many critics judged the 5 Series' electric rack as lacking in road feel?
What makes it tick? Fortunately, that new 2-liter, 240-horsepower TwinPower engine chops nearly a second from the previous 328i's 0-to-60 time, making the sprint in 5.9 seconds, BMW says. A new 8-speed automatic transmission helps raise estimated fuel economy to a class-killing 24 miles a gallon in the city, 36 on the highway. The 335i, meanwhile, retains the outgoing model's turbocharged in-line 6.
How much, how soon? Mr. Plucinsky said that shoppers would see the new 3 in late February, starting at $35,795 for the 328i and $43,295 for the 335i, before delivery charge.
How's it look? Darwin would approve of the 3's evolution: a bit larger, lighter and roomier than before. Consumers will most likely focus first on the new cabin, which includes the Driving Dynamics performance controls from the 5 , 6 and 7 Series, that reflects BMW's decision to finally put luxury on a par with performance.

HEADLINE: Little Engines of Creativity, Spinning Freely in the Motor City

BYLINE: MARY M. CHAPMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The car business's unpredictable fortunes have led some Detroiters to imagine a future for their city in which other forms of creativity, and industry, can flourish. 

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Navigating tables laden with lentil burgers and smoked wild salmon B.L.T.'s, Sharon Robinson escorted a guest toward paintings hanging on the high walls of the Cass Cafe, a venerable gathering place near Wayne State University popular with students, poets and visual artists. The cafe is about three miles from Cobo Center, the site of the North American International Auto Show, where press previews officially begin on Monday.
"It's one of the bonuses of coming here, all this great stuff," Ms. Robinson, 32, a Detroit poet and habitue of the cafe, said of the dozens of paintings by local and nationally known artists for sale on the walls. "They've been rotating them for years, but it seems like what's been going on the last year or two, all the artsy folks around, more people have been paying them attention."
Detroit will always be entwined with its automotive heritage, and after a few years in the abyss, the primary industry of the Motor City is looking up. Sales last year were at their highest levels since 2008, and analysts project an even more robust 2012.
The renewed fortunes of the big three automakers is a welcome story here, but a funny thing happened on the way through the recession. The region, which had long suffered the vagaries of a cyclical industry, was forced to rethink its identity and, yes, its dependence on an industry that, despite the improved near-term outlook, is hardly out of the weeds.
Skepticism toward an enduring automotive rebound has fomented a kind of can-do, post-industrial attitude here that embraces Detroit's lineage and also separates from it. Young people, many from the suburbs, see opportunity in Detroit's transition and are moving into affordable loft spaces, opening small businesses and generally contributing to a vision, not altogether cohesive, of a city that isn't so dependent on one income stream.
"A lot of people feel like the auto industry is something that we don't think about anymore," said Amy Kaherl, facilitator for Detroit Soup, a two-year-old organization run by volunteers that uses entrance fees from monthly dinners to finance creative projects in and around Detroit. "People in this community are looking for something else, not for the next industry that's going to save the city, but working toward a lot of sustainable things that can build this community up."
"We saw a need to encourage people to try things that they've always wanted to try, on a smaller scale," Ms. Kaherl said in a telephone interview.
There are also new-business incubators like Paper Street, based in suburban Ferndale, which leases office space in a building and offers classes ranging from photography to business. "We get more creative types rather than those from traditional automotive businesses," Andy Didorosi, the company's founder, said in an interview. "But whoever has a viable idea can get space with us. The idea is to get here, then go on to big things."
Jacques Driscoll and his wife, Christine, spent years in San Diego before arriving here two years ago. They are opening a restaurant called Green Dot Stables, after the original owners' equestrian involvement, near the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit. "We came here for a wedding and started talking about all the potential here, all the affordability and the growing cultural community, then how we wanted to live here," Mr. Driscoll, 30, said.
Gerald Dixon has been at the vanguard of the city's growing creative class. For nearly a decade, in black-lighted basement gigs in the city's historic Boston-Edison district, which once sheltered many of Detroit's auto barons, including Henry Ford, his events have included spoken-word marathons, photo exhibits and a steady stream of concerts.
"We all know that it used to be you could go to the factory if you couldn't find anything else," said Mr. Dixon, who is in his late 40s. "Now, all that's changed. Not only can we not get those jobs, a lot of us can't get any job. So people come here and to places all over the city as outlets for whatever they're feeling. Positive outlets. And some of us have been able to make a living at it."
Two years ago, James Feagin IV lost his job as an economic and community development coordinator for a nonprofit. A chance encounter with an artist resulted in Mr. Feagin leading the marketing and strategic management efforts of BeloZro Visual Energy, a painting and graphic design collective, out of Mr. Feagin's downtown loft.
"My peers and I see opportunity in everything. We know that there aren't so many traditional jobs left, so we've got to figure out new ways to make money," Mr. Feagin, 30, said. "When I got laid off, if there was anything less practical than going to work in the auto industry, it was trying to sell original art. But we're doing it, in new ways."
Emily Linn, 34, said that the city's growing sense of community would triumph over any future automotive downturn. She is a co-owner of City Bird, a popular boutique near Wayne State. "The community and other business owners, we support each other more than ever," she said.
Yet for all these green shoots of urban bohemia, Detroit is still more lunch bucket than Freitag tote. The Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, a nonprofit group that works to attract new businesses to the city, initiated a diversification effort aimed at automotive suppliers and nonauto industries like aerospace.
"We have made the decision to look at clusters that are poised for growth and expansion," Malinda Jensen, the group's director of business development, said in a telephone interview. "We know the auto cluster has changed, but it's not forgotten. That's part of our roots and that's not going anywhere." 
Recognizing Detroit's need to diversify while supporting the auto industry, the Detroit Regional Chamber last week announced the Michigan Automotive Program, which is intended to involve automotive industry representatives in its economic development activities, said Sandy Baruah, the chamber's president and chief executive. "We also want to make sure that we develop that talent to run factories of today and tomorrow," he said. 
And with companies like LG Chem and A123 Systems coming to the area to produce lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, the auto industry has acted as a springboard to lure advanced technology firms to the state.
Mr. Feagin, the manager at BeloZro Visual Energy, says an unwitting convergence of old and new is occurring in the city, and within the confines of Cobo Center. "When you look at it, the auto show is one big art show, and every new car an art project, but on a world stage," he said.
"And that legacy is cool, isn't it? We can build upon that."
An earlier version of this post misidentified Sandy Baruah of the Detroit Regional Chamber. He is a man, and his title is president and chief executive, not chief operating officer.

HEADLINE: Chevy Code 130R: A Muscle-Car Concept for the Millennial Set

BYLINE: TIM MORAN


HIGHLIGHT: General Motors says that its target buyer for the 130R wants rear-wheel drive and four seats -- and presumably, an interior. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Monday, Jan. 9: Chevrolet Code 130R concept.
What is it? A rear-drive, four-passenger coupe intended for the highly prized yet mercurial millennial buyer.
Is it real? The concept is no lightly veiled production coupe. In fact, there is no interior. G.M. says the eventual inside bits will be crowd-sourced at kiosks at auto shows and various other events where target buyers might congregate.
What they said: The Code 130R is a "pure, functional muscle car with no retro feel," said Marc Reuss, president of General Motors North America.
What they didn't say: The Gen-Y buyers G.M. is targeting aren't necessarily accustomed to rear-wheel drive, and it's difficult to envision much muscle coming from the 1.4-liter Ecotec 4-cylinder engine.
What makes it tick? A 150-horsepower turbocharged 4-cylinder engine transmits power through a 6-speed automatic transmission and adds G.M.'s eAssist suite of efficiency features for an overall estimated fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon. A 6-speed stick would be offered, too, presuming the millennial buyer would still be interested in the dark art of manually changing gears.
How much, how soon? Chevrolet did not disclose any production intent, but as Scion and other brands with youth-oriented models know, high content has to go hand-in-hand with reasonable pricing. As such, the 130R would be priced below $25,000, Chevrolet said.
How's it look? G.M. surveyed 9,000 young consumers, who told designers that they wanted four-passenger coupes, but they also wanted muscle-car looks. The Code 130R has the long hood and flared fenders of a rear-drive muscle car, but G.M.'s insistence on the moustachelike body-color bar across the grille is more suggestive of Spark-Sonic economy, not snorting quarter-miler remorselessness.

HEADLINE: Acura RDX Hunts Redemption in Detroit

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The second generation of the relatively unloved crossover was unveiled in what Acura called "prototype" form. 

 BODY:
Introduced on Monday: 2013 Acura RDX.
What is it? Shown in what Acura called prototype form, this is the second generation of Acura's response to the Lexus RX, BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLK. Honda, Acura's parent, has a long history of showing production-ready vehicles at this show and calling them prototypes. Exhibit A: the all-but-VIN-stamped Civic of the 2011 show.
Is it real? Check your nearest Acura showroom in a few months to see how real it is.
What they said: "Quieter, roomier and more comfortable, the all-new RDX will offer the styling, power and quality appointments that you expect in a luxury S.U.V.," said Vicki Poponi, Acura's vice president for product planning, at the press conference.
What they didn't say: With its heavy all-wheel-drive system, unloved turbocharged 4-cylinder engine and unimpressive performance, the first-generation RDX was no hit.
What makes it tick? The next RDX will get its kicks from a V-6. Expect 273 horsepower, 33 more than the old engine, and fuel economy in front-wheel-drive configuration of 20 m.p.g. city, 28 highway. A new, lightweight all-wheel-drive system is also offered. Unlike the turbo 4, the normally aspirated V-6 should run on regular unleaded.
How much, how soon? Pricing will be determined closer to its introduction in the spring. The outgoing model was priced in the $33,000-$38,000 range.
How's it look? Is it enough to say that some of the more egregiously ugly features of the first generation model have been mercifully toned down?

HEADLINE: Just Try Harder

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Exhorting people to work harder is not enough, and blaming them for failure is not productive, an economist writes; what is needed is effective incentives. 

 BODY:
"We try harder" proved a famously effective advertising slogan. Effort is important. Good incentives can elicit greater effort.
But incentives sometimes backfire. And too much emphasis on them can lead to the presumption that all our failures result primarily from lack of willpower.
One commenter on my last blog post asserted that the economy would recover if middle-class people "would work harder, spend less, kill their televisions, stop drinking alcohol, stop eating sugary fat foods, exercise an hour a day and stop letting their rotten little brats run wild." Good suggestions, in my opinion, but not substitutes for better economic policies.
In "The World Is Flat," Thomas Friedman often sounds like a football coach, exhorting Americans to be more competitive. He tells his daughters, "Girls, finish your homework - people in China and India are starving for your jobs." Again, good advice, but I doubt it will end the offshoring of American manufacturing employment.
Do people work harder if their pay is linked to specific measures of performance? Sometimes. But the psychologist Paul Marciano summarizes a number of reasons that carrots and sticks often fail, including the resentment workers feel when their performance has been mismeasured.

The debate over performance pay for teachers raises fears that it will overemphasize standardized test scores or undermine collaboration among teachers, hurting students more than helping them.
As the compelling "Freakonomics" documentary shows, experimental efforts to improve student performance by paying them for high grades have shown only small positive effects so far. Some of the most poignant moments in the film capture a student who says he will try harder but fails.
Many experimental studies have offered people financial incentives to stay on a diet and lose weight. Incentives tend to work in the short run, but most people regain the weight they have lost. In a recent New York Times article, Tara Parker-Pope persuasively asserts that willpower is not their primary problem: physiological changes make significant permanent weight loss extremely difficult to achieve.
Why not stigmatize fat people anyway, if that might help them lose weight? Likewise, why not blame poor people for their own poverty and the unemployed for their own joblessness? Even if they don't deserve the blame, it could help them try harder.
The economists Roland Benebou and Jean Tirole come close to making this argument when they assert that a delusional belief that people always get what they deserve can be economically advantageous because it will motivate greater effort.
But as Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb pointed out long ago in "The Hidden Injuries of Class," blaming people for every aspect of their own failure can demoralize and demotivate them. That kind of blame also discourages efforts to collaborate with others to make changes that no individual can achieve alone.
If we simply assume that the world is just, then there's no need to change it.
Good incentives should encourage people not just to try harder but also to try smarter; to improve their social environment rather than their just their own psyche.
Some fascinating research shows how "commitment contracts" enable people to specify rewards or punishments for meeting (or not meeting) their goals, and to recruit friends or others as enforcers.
Ian Ayres, a law professor who developed this concept in his recent book "Carrots and Sticks," takes it well beyond mere self-improvement. A commentary he recently wrote with the economist Aaron Edlin, on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, makes a strong case for a public commitment to tax - and thereby discourage - further increases in income inequality, on the grounds that it undermines democracy.
I believe that inequality also undermines effort, by making it more difficult for those at the bottom to move up. Americans now enjoy less economic mobility than their counterparts in other affluent countries.
Improving economic fairness -- now there's a problem economists should try harder to solve.

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Increasing leadership skills key to growth, academics say. 

 BODY:
Companies in India and elsewhere in Asia are increasingly sending managers to Western business schools to "groom future leaders," Miki Tanikawa writes in the International Herald Tribune. 
While companies in Asia's emerging markets are growing fast, they are constrained by lack of leadership skills, academics say. "That kind of growth is not just kept up by innate leadership capacity that is available in the company or in the economy," said Krishna G. Palepu, senior associate dean for international development at Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "There aren't enough business schools of high quality to train people fast enough to feed this machine." Read more »

HEADLINE: The New Scapegoats of Europe

BYLINE: SARAH WILDMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The root cause of the problem between Jews and Muslims in Europe isn't the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is the failure of European states to integrate Muslims. 

 BODY:
One afternoon in November, Oceane Sluijzer, a 13-year-old Belgian Jewish girl, was beaten up after soccer practice by a group of schoolmates. Her tormenters, girls of Moroccan descent, called her a "dirty Jew" and told her to "go back to her own country." 
Two weeks later, the U.S. ambassador to Belgium mentioned the beating in a speech about the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. Howard Gutman, himself a Jew, saw Oceane's plight as symptomatic of a larger problem: Jews and Muslims in Europe are caught in a proxy war that mirrors events in the Middle East, especially between Israel and the Palestinians. 
"[E]very new settlement announced in Israel, every rocket shot over a border or suicide bomber on a bus, and every retaliatory military strike exacerbates the problem and provides a setback here in Europe for those fighting hatred and bigotry," Gutman said. 
He's right: Politics in the Middle East refract into tensions between Jews and Muslims in Europe. Violence against Jews on the Continent tends to increase when violence rises between Israelis and Palestinians, for example. The National Consultative Commission on Human Rights counted 815 acts of anti-Semitic violence in France in 2009, compared with 459 the year before, and found that the uptick was a response to Operation Cast Lead, Israel's bloody incursion into Gaza in early 2009. 
But while incidents in the Middle East are relevant, the root cause of the problem between Jews and Muslims in Europe isn't simply the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; it is primarily the failure of European states to integrate immigrants, Muslims in particular. 
Governments throughout Europe have struggled for the last half-century to expand their notion of citizenship. Muslims who came from North Africa and Turkey as workers in the 1960s and early 1970s were expected to go home eventually. But they stayed and built families in Europe. Today, their children and grandchildren are still defined as second- and third-generation immigrants rather than as Belgian, French or German. 
This is partly because many Europeans cannot quite imagine how Islam and a secular European identity might co-exist. It is also because the once-marginal anti-Muslim ideas of the far right have become more mainstream; Muslims have replaced Jews as the scapegoats of Europe. If Muslims in Europe so thoroughly identify with the Palestinian cause today - posters at rallies for the right to wear the hijab often call for a free Palestine - it is partly because a weak Palestine subs in for their own maligned population. 
And so while Gutman's diagnosis of the problem rings true, his fix for it is misguided. In that speech in late November, he said that the solution to tensions between Jews and Muslims in Europe "is in the hands of Israel, the Palestinians and Arab neighbors in the Middle East." 
In fact, the real answer lies much closer to home: according to a position-paper by the Brookings Institution, if Muslim communities in Europe felt less marginalization and had more economic opportunities, they would resort less to misdirected violence. Although attacks on Jews are scary and hard to explain away, there is no broad and systematic anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe, neither among Muslims nor among the rest of the population. This is not 1936.
The key to helping Belgians understand the attack on Oceane is not to sit down with Benjamin Netanyahu. It is to sit down with the girls who punched her and find out how to make them feel welcome in Belgium.

HEADLINE: Paying the Cost of Security in Iraq

BYLINE: TODD ROSENFIELD


HIGHLIGHT: A veteran of the Iraq war recalls the brutal violence and what it took to ensure the safety of American soldiers. 

 BODY:
In 2008, I returned home from Iraq, having served a year tour as a civil affairs sergeant attached to the 82nd Airborne. Back home for over three years now, I have had time to reflect on the war and my role in it, and to search for meaning amid the chaos and destruction of those days. My deployment, during what came to be known as the surge, was quite different than what I had hoped or expected it would be. 
I had previously served in the Army Reserves while a college student, during peacetime. After 9/11, and specifically the week of Pat Tillman's death in 2004, I decided to re-enlist. I had had a good job working for a medical company in the Boston area, but felt I needed to do something more. I thought that my civilian work experience, and desire to serve my country, would make me a perfect fit for civil affairs, a special unit that tries to alleviate suffering by building essential services and infrastructure in war zones. 
Before I deployed in 2007, most of my training involved learning about things like opening schools, restoring hospitals and restarting electrical service. At that time, casualties were reaching record levels and the United States military wanted to shift control of the government back to the Iraqis. I thought I would play a role in doing just that. 
But once we hit the ground, it was another world. During my first week in country, my team was sent on a mission to a local health clinic where United States Army medical staff provided medication, food and other essential supplies to civilians. The neighborhood was in a Shiite enclave in West Baghdad. It had been a hot spot of attacks, and we needed to "win hearts and minds." After the operation, less than half a mile from the health clinic, my patrol came under attack, first with a roadside bomb and then with small-arms fire from militia hidden nearby. 
We all made it back to base, leaving the ambush site littered with dead attackers. The idea of being ambushed so close to the health clinic, and the fact that we were attacked in an area usually crowded with civilians, made it clear to us that not only Iraqi civilians but also the military - which had deserted a nearby checkpoint - were probably complicit in the ambush. 
Numerous other missions had the same outcome. We would rush in to protect fellow soldiers who had been attacked, only to find crowds chanting anti-American slogans and taunting us in the streets, or children hurling rocks at us as we tried to deliver food and medical supplies to communities.
These attacks occurred despite our best efforts to buy support from local leaders. Indeed, we regularly employed a strategy very different from what I had been taught in training. It was known as nonlethal targeting, and it went something like this: rather than killing or capturing potential insurgent leaders, we tried to buy them off. 
My team would routinely pay tens of thousands of dollars a month to various sheiks and warlords. This was supposed to ensure that their tribes did not attack American forces in our area. It was nothing more than protection money. It often worked. But when the money dried up, the blood began to spill again.
I would regularly carry in excess of $50,000 in my cargo-pants pockets to be handed over to sheiks and warlords. To provide a "cover story," we always said it was for some community improvement program, picking up trash or painting sidewalks and so forth. 
But the real story is that the sheiks and warlords would skim half or more of the money for themselves, and, in exchange, provide their tribal support to assure our patrols were not attacked. Cash for safety was the formula. 
In the many times I met with those sheiks and warlords, who I knew were wanted in connection with attacks on American forces, and the dozens upon dozens of times I handed over money to keep paying them off, the mantra I kept repeating to myself was that I was somehow, in some way, helping to keep a soldier from getting killed.
This mantra was, sadly, all we had to cleave to, because the killing and maiming simply did not stop. In our last week alone, there were two separate bomb attacks, one within earshot, which killed four more of our soldiers. These four soldiers were from the 101st Airborne, which was the unit I was attached to during the last months of my tour. Two thousand seven was to become the deadliest year for United States forces in Iraq. As an Army buddy once told me, "We went there to win their hearts and minds, and we ended up losing ours." 
In all this, my team and fellow soldiers performed exceedingly well. We were tasked with nearly impossible missions, and asked to serve our country amid sheer lunacy and brutality that I would not wish on anyone. I am proud of these soldiers, and of the work we accomplished despite the odds. These soldiers are the best of our country, our sons and our daughters. They deserve support, recognition and praise for doing exactly what our elected officials asked of them. But I wonder sometimes whether those elected officials learned anything from the war. Do any of them now ask themselves whether they were too reflexive in supporting the war? Do any of them regret not having a clear sense of what victory in Iraq should have looked like, or how we might have achieved it? 
Since returning home, I have had time to reflect upon the war and its repercussions. I have learned that the nation's focus shifts quickly, and that many people are now mostly concerned with the tough economy. The best place I can put my time and energy is helping fellow veterans. I have volunteered with the Veterans of Foreign Wars as a service officer for the last three years, assisting veterans to obtain health care, disability compensation and other benefits. This is now the most important mission for me.

HEADLINE: Biomass and Electricity, Part One

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: A company harnesses biofuel from landfills to generate electricity with minimal releases of methane, a long-lasting heat-trapping gas. 

 BODY:
 Burning natural gas releases less heat-trapping carbon dioxide than burning coal does because it has only about half as much carbon per unit of energy. But it can exacerbate global warming if it escapes unburned into the atmosphere as methane; in a century, a methane molecule will trap as much heat as 21 carbon dioxide molecules would. 
 The easy solution is simply to burn the methane. But some sources emit methane at concentrations too low to burn. What then?
 And even when the concentration is high enough for conventional burning, burning methane creates temperatures high enough to break up nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere and marry them to oxygen, creating nitrogen oxides, a precursor of smog. 
 FlexEnergy, a company in Irvine, Calif., has developed a new way to use gas at low methane concentrations, a process it has been trying out on landfill gas at Fort Benning in Georgia.
The landfill produces methane at a concentration of 20 percent, too low for conventional combustion. (The Pentagon is under orders to reduce its carbon footprint.) Later this year FlexEnergy plans to open a commercial-scale system at the Santiago Canyon landfill in Orange County, Calif.

The company doesn't really burn the gas; it consumes it in slow motion. While a typical power plant burns a methane molecule in a thousandth of a second, give or take, FlexEnergy takes its time, combining it with oxygen to make heat in a tenth of a second or a hundredth of a second. 
Instead of burning the fuel, "I like to use the phrase, we chemically cook it,'' said Joseph Perry, the company's chief executive. "People who are used to burning things, it takes them a while to get their head around what we're doing.''
The process runs at a relatively low temperature, 1,750 degrees Fahrenheit, far too low for nitrogen oxides to form. It destroys other stray but troublesome pollutants that may be present in the landfill gas, like volatile organics, and it produces electricity. And company executives say that it does so at low concentrations of methane, 1.5 percent. (Ordinary pipeline gas is about 80 percent methane.)
The electricity output is small, 250 kilowatts. (A big commercial power plant is about 2,000 times larger.) But some landfills could support eight or so such units, company executives say. And in the case of the Orange County landfill, pipeline gas could potentially be added to make the mixture rich enough to burn, reducing gas consumption and displacing some fossil fuel burning at a power plant somewhere else on the grid. 
FlexEnergy will invest about $9 million in the plant at the Santiago Canyon landfill. 
 The process is not as efficient at converting pipeline gas into electricity as a big generator would be, but company executives say it can be highly effective in places where both electricity and hot water are needed, because the waste heat can be reused.
 And in California, the system is viewed as having one other virtue: it qualifies as renewable energy. The state has a 33 percent renewable energy portfolio standard, but relying on the wind and sun has its limits because those sources produce on their own schedule, independent of human control. FlexEnergy's system could be modulated to compensate for fluctuations in wind or sun. 
On Tuesday, I'll describe an entirely different route for making electricity from renewable biomass.

HEADLINE: Oil Sands Foes Are Foes of Canada, Minister Says

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Denouncing opponents of the Keystone XL project, Canada's environment minister says they are financed from abroad. 

 BODY:
In an unusual open letter released on Monday, Canada's natural resources minister charged that "environmental and other radical groups" used "funding from foreign special interest groups to undermine Canada's national economic interest."
The remarks by the minister, Joe Oliver, apparently refer to donations from charitable foundations based in the United States. His sharply worded letter appeared the day before an independent review panel was to begin hearings on a proposed pipeline to carry production from Alberta's controversial oil sands project to Canada's west coast for tanker shipment to Asia.
That project, the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline, is widely seen as the energy industry's contingency plan if the Obama administration ultimately turns down the Keystone XL pipeline, a project to move oil sands production from Alberta to the Gulf Coast.
Keystone XL has attracted fierce opposition from groups in both Canada and the United States that object to the environmental record of the oil sands projects, which are big emitters of greenhouse gases.
A week before the release of Mr. Oliver's open letter, a small pro-oil-sands group with ties to the governing Conservatives started a campaign to bar any Canadian groups that receive any foreign financing from taking part in the Northern Gateway review, which is expected to field comments from about 4,300 witnesses.

"They attract jet-setting celebrities with some of the largest personal carbon footprints in the world to lecture Canadians not to develop our natural resources," Mr. Oliver wrote of Canadian environmentalists. "Finally, if all other avenues have failed, they will take a quintessential American approach: sue everyone and anyone to delay the project even further."
In his letter, Mr. Oliver declared that Canada's regulatory system was "broken" and suggested that reviews could be done in a "quicker and more streamlined fashion."
His letter does not outline suggestions for how that can be achieved, and his office did not respond to requests for comment. But representatives of several Canadian environmental groups said they believed that the government planned to severely restrict public input on environmental assessments.
"There are signals that they plan to do this in ways which would really hinder the public's ability to have a democratic voice," said Jessica Clogg of the group West Coast Environmental Law.
"I'm really stunned because we've had a very productive relationship with this government on other issues," said Rick Smith, the executive director of Environmental Defence. "The idea of labeling penny ante, in budget terms, environmental groups as Goliaths to the oil industry's David is frankly going to strike most Canadians as ridiculous."
Mr. Smith and Ms. Clogg both said that grants from American foundations accounted for less than 10 percent of their budgets and were solicited only after their groups had determined their priorities.
But last week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper also suggested that foreign interests were taking over Canada's regulatory process.
"Growing concern has been expressed to me about the use of foreign money to really overload the public consultation phase of regulatory hearings just for the purpose of slowing down the process," he told reporters.
Ethical Oil, a group that has promoted oils sands production as superior to other oil because of Canada's human rights record, started a campaign last week asking Mr. Oliver to ban non-Canadian, foreign organizations and Canadian groups that accept money from outside Canada from taking part in the Northern Gateway review.
"Foreigners and their foreign hired hands should butt out," said Kathryn Marshall, a spokeswoman for Ethical Oil.
While most Canadian environmental groups are charities and must disclose the sources of their funds, Ethical Oil does not. Ms. Marshall said that the group accepted money from only Canadians and Canadian companies, although she declined to directly say if that included Canadian corporations controlled by foreign entities. Many of the large energy companies active in the oil sands are foreign-owned or -controlled.
"You can look up the definition of a Canadian company," she said.

HEADLINE: What's in a Name? At C.E.S., Oftentimes, It's Shenzhen

BYLINE: SAM GROBART


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the roster of exhibitors at C.E.S. reveals more than 200 companies that not only hail from the Chinese city Shenzhen, but include the city's name in their own. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - This year's International Consumer Electronics Show, which opens here Tuesday, will include, according to the show's producer, more than 2,700 exhibitors. Many of the usual players will be in attendance, including name brands like Canon, Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, LG.
And, of course, Shenzhen LikkPower Electronics Factory. As well as Shenzhen Fancy Package & Manufactory, Shenzhen Desire Power Technology and Shenzhen Inasmile Technology.
Not to mention Shenzhen Pusite Exactitude Mould, which should not be confused with Shenzhen Yimingda Exactitude Tech (just as Shenzhen Wisdom Electronics is a different exhibitor from Shenzhen Wisdom Science and Technology).
In all, 244 exhibitors, nearly 10 percent of all the companies attending C.E.S., have the word "Shenzhen" in their name.
Why?
Shenzhen, a city in southern China of nearly 10.4 million people, is one of the great manufacturing hubs of Asia, if not the world. It has been a Special Economic Zone since 1980 and is a neighbor of Hong Kong. It's the fourth-largest port in China and home to better-known Chinese firms like Huawei, BYD and ZTE. Imagine a roaring, '50s-era Detroit, combined with Silicon Valley and just about every other manufacturing center in the United States, and you get an idea of what we're talking about here.
The sea of Shenzhens you encounter when perusing the "S" section of the show's exhibitor directory points to the apparent Chinese naming convention of placing the name of the company's city before the distinguishing name of the company. Perhaps as many American tech companies would be as conspicuous if all their names started with "Palo Alto."
Numbers are one thing, but floor space is another: Most of the exhibitors from Shenzhen will have booths the size of an office cubicle (or will have, literally, an office cubicle) and will be in places in the convention hall one might call "Siberia," except that one can take a train to Siberia. 
At least half of the 244 exhibitors from Shenzhen could very likely fit in Sony's booth space alone. But China's large-and-still-growing role in the manufacture, design and engineering of the tech we use most likely means that some small exhibitors will grow larger in coming years, and new Shenzhen firms will be added to future exhibitor directories.
And with the departure of the mega-exhibitor Microsoft after this year, there will certainly be room for more.

HEADLINE: Where Is Europe?

BYLINE: FRANK JACOBS


HIGHLIGHT: As both a concept and a continent, the area known as Europe has shifted over time. 

 BODY:
Where is Europe? You might as well ask: What is Europe? For it is a concept as well as a continent, and the borders of both oscillate wildly. For the ancient Persians, it was that small stepping stone separating them from Greece. In the Middle Ages, it became virtually synonymous with Christendom. A relatively recent and generally unaccepted theory sees Europe spanning half the globe, from Iceland to the Bering Strait, nearly touching Alaska.
Take the most common present-day usage of the term "Europe," shorthand for (and synonymous with) the European Union. The external borders of this supranational project are well-defined, and in some cases well-defended. But they remain movable, having consistently shifted outward over the last half century. From a core of six founding members in the continent's west [1], this "Europe" has expanded to comprise 27 states, as far east as Cyprus.
That still leaves quite some wriggle room between concept and continent, which by some estimates [2] includes as many as 51 countries. For those in between, the difference is clear and uncontested. Even non-European Union members like Switzerland and Croatia, close to the continent's geographic core, will readily admit that they're outside "Europe" (but only if you include the quotation marks). The interesting difference is that the Swiss overall are happy to remain outside, while the Croats generally can't wait for July 2013, when they're slated to join the Union.
This gap in Euro-euphoria is a symptom of a curious kaleidoscopic quality of this supranational "Europe": Everybody is looking at the same thing, but everybody sees something different. For the Swiss, who have a long history of non-alignment (and a shorter one of being confidently rich), joining "Europe" would entail few benefits. By contrast, for the non-"European" remainder on the Balkans [3], similarly encircled by member states, joining would be almost more of a moral vindication than an economic relief. Like the countries of the former Eastern Bloc before them, membership would confirm their Europeanness.
As a frequent visitor to the Balkans recently put it to me: "In the Croats' own eyes, they are the last bastion of Europe against the barbarians, the first of which are the Serbs. The Serbs too view themselves as Europe's ultimate bulwark, against the Albanians." And so on.
What's interesting is that such kaleidoscopic assessments of what is and isn't Europe exist within the Union, too. But instead of positive images, the E.U. kaleidoscope refracts nothing but horrors. Here, "Europe" has become the convenient scapegoat for anything too unpopular, expensive or painful to be defended by the individual member states. "We don't like it either," they can tell their electorates, "but Europe is making us do it." Europe, long the defining inclusive quality uniting people from Spain to Finland, is now, ironically, the oppressive other.
This "Europe" is a misassembled, headless monster, owing less to Charlemagne than to Frankenstein. It stalks the bureaucratic labyrinth of Brussels, beying for tribute from the peoples of Europe. But this modern minotaur is also a petty, powerless bureaucrat, issuing directives on the correct curvature of cucumbers [4], but unable to save the euro from collapsing.
To the British, "Europe" and "the Continent" are increasingly one and the same, and they find increasing consolation in their splendid isolation from it. Strictly geographically speaking, they're not wrong. A continent may be defined as a large, contiguous land mass, sans the islands off its coast. Of course, the choice of terminology is suggested more by the rise of anti-E.U. sentiment in Britain rather than by concerns for geographic rectitude. An equally acceptable definition of a continent does include so-called continental islands [5] - situated on the continental shelf, as Britain and Ireland are. An even broader definition includes islands off the shelf (so to speak), if they are geographically and culturally proximate. Cyprus, Malta and Iceland are all considered European because of historical, political and cultural links, even though none of them is entirely located on Europe's continental shelf.
Yet if we leave the islands out of the equation for a moment, most of Europe's borders are self-evident. They are the waters that border it on three sides: the Arctic Sea to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean and Black Seas to the south. Ah, but then the ultimate problem becomes painfully clear: Where to draw Europe's eastern border? And does it even have one?
Let's return to our earlier definition: A continent is a large, contiguous land mass. And not half of one. Many geographers see what we call the European continent as a mere peninsula of a gigantic continent of Eurasia, spanning halfway across the world, from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Bering Strait. There is no good reason to divide that continent in two. No good geographic reason.
For, etymologically, "Eurasia" might well be a union of opposites. Some linguists suggest that Europe and Asia derive from words in Phoenician and Assyrian for "sunset" and "sunrise" respectively, similar to the Latin concepts of "occidens" and "oriens," or simply our "west" and "east."
In fact, in its earliest incarnation, Europe was merely that bit of land on the continent that the Persians had to cross to get from the Hellespont [6] to Greece proper. Ironically, 25 centuries later, the perception of that region has totally reversed. Greece is now firmly part of Europe (both the concept and the continent), while that former Persian stepping stone is now known as Turkish Thrace [7]. Its existence embarrasses those who would deny Turkey E.U. membership on the basis that it is "not a European state." It is. And what's more: based on ancient history, Turkey (or at least this part of it) can claim to be the original Europe.
Turkey's detractors have another Europe in mind. This one took shape in the early Middle Ages, as "Europe" became a constituent third of the world in simplified ecclesiastical geography, together with Africa and Asia converging on Jerusalem - the center of the world. From the 13th century onward, encroachment by the Tartars (in Russia) and the Turks (in Anatolia) shifted the definition to a more spiritual one: Europe came to be identified with Christendom - specifically, western Christendom.
In this definition, Europe ended where Turkey began, even when Turkey extended deep into the continent proper. When the Turks controlled large parts of the Balkans, those areas were considered to be beyond Europe [8], the eastern edge of which was the border between the Austrian and Ottoman Empires.
To be fair, this viewpoint wasn't absolute. As their power declined, the Ottomans were pushed out of almost all of Europe. This allowed the classical definition to prevail, placing the border at the narrow waterway that connects the Mediterranean and Black Seas [9]. It remains there to this day - with only Turkish Thrace remaining as a reminder that "Europe" may stop where continents divide, but also where empires collide.
The northern border with Asia posed a different problem for geographers because, as knowledge of and self-consciousness in that part of the world increased, it turned out that "Europe" was not connected to Asia via a narrow isthmus, but rather via the widening expanse of Russia. The problem being that any definition of Europe will divide Russia in two. The question is thus: How much of Russia is European? Or, even: How European is Russia?
As seen from the west, the earliest answer always seemed to be, not much, or not at all. The French minister Sully (1560-1641), when dreaming up his "Grand Design" [10] for a "Very Christian Council of Europe," objected to Russia's inclusion in his scheme: "[T]here scarce remains any conformity among us with them; besides they belong to Asia as much as to Europe. We may indeed almost consider them as a barbarous country, and place them in the same class with Turkey." [11]
Sully's opinion sounds awfully modern. For centuries, the urge was to include Moscow and its lands within the European continent, even though doing so made for some rather arbitrary-seeming distinctions. In the Renaissance, geographers solved the problem of Europe's eastern border by being creative: Ortelius, in his "Theatrum Orbis Terrarum" (1570), started from the ancient border, the river Don (even though it was less impressive than its semi-mythical pendant, the Tanais), then drawing a straight line north towards the White Sea, near the city of Archangel.
By the end of the 17th century, the eastern border of Europe had shifted, following the courses of the rivers Don, Volga and Kama, and then leaping in a straight line across the northern Ural Mountains to join the river Ob north into the Arctic Ocean.
This border, championed by the geographer Philipp Cluver, made the Gulf of Ob, at 600 miles the world's longest estuary, the border between Europe and Asia. Had this extension of Europe east of the Urals persisted, the northernmost part of Europe would now be the tip of the Yamal Peninsula [12], poking 400 miles into the Arctic and home to Russia's largest remaining reindeer herds (and largest remaining natural gas reserves).
Those reindeer might have benefited from the media attention that being threatened in "Europe's northernmost wilderness" might have brought. But alas for them: The Ob as Europe's northeastern border became obsolete by the late 18th century.
The reason for this was the expansive growth of the Russian state east- and southward, so that geographers felt annoyed by the fact that Russia in its entirety could no longer be treated under the header "Europe." One solution was to discard "Muscovy" entirely from Europe, another to extend the borders of Europe to keep up, somewhat, with Russian expansion. To be fair, the Russians themselves considered Europe to be elsewhere, hence the mission of of St. Petersburg, founded in 1703, to be a "window on Europe."
The ultimate compromise between "Russia in" and "Russia out" was found when western geographers became aware of the mountain range the Russians themselves called Kameny Poyas ("Stony Girdle"). The Swedish military geographer Philip Johan von Strahlenberg, after years of captivity gave him the benefit of close observation of the Russian geography, proposed these Ural Mountains as the new European border in 1730. The Strahlenberg border soon found acceptance throughout Europe - and Russia itself.
Strahlenberg's southern bend back via the Volga to the Don (always the Don) was more controversial. Many geographers chose, where the Ural Mountains ended, to follow the Ural River south to the Caspian Sea.
By the early 19th century, Conrad Malte-Brun and other French geographers had successfully promoted the Caucasus Mountains, connecting the Caspian to the Black Sea, as the southern border of Europe.
This is still considered the most conventional border for the continent of Europe. But the Urals-Ural-Caspian-Caucasus border was (and is) by no means a generally accepted convention. Several geographers have, over the centuries, tried to place Europe's eastern boundary well beyond the Urals - one notable example being the 18th-century German botanist Johann Georg Gmelin, who proposed the Yenisey River, running from the Mongolian border to the Arctic Ocean near the 70th meridian east, or about 2,000 miles east of Moscow.
The most expansive vision of Europe was one of many expounded by the founder of the Pan-European Union, the Austrian count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, in 1935. It solved the problem of finding an adequate geographical boundary to Europe by substituting a political one - all of the Soviet Union would be considered part of Europe. Asia would be to its south. That would have made European cities out of Vladivostok and Irkutsk, but also Samarkand and Dushanbe.
During the cold war, however, the opposite tendency triumphed more often: All of the Soviet Union, including Vilnius, Riga and other cities that today lie within the European Union, were excluded from Europe entirely. At times even the Soviet satellite states in the Warsaw Pact were left out as well, so much had "Europe" come to be synonymous with "the West" and its associated political values.
Today, of course, the border of Europe is rebounding, thanks to the expansive semi-state run out of Brussels. Indeed, if Turkey ever does join the E.U. - and while its prospects look dim today, who knows what a decade or two will bring - it will push the border of Europe further east than anyone but a few daydreaming geographers had ever imagined: from the volcanic shores of Iceland to the mountainous frontier that divides Turkey from Iran.
[1] By signing the Treaty of Rome (1957), the three Benelux countries, Italy and - most crucially - the former archenemies France and (West) Germany constituted the European Economic Community, which would later become the European Union.
[2] That's a maximalist figure, including countries partly or wholly outside the accepted geographic borders of Europe, and thus often excluded: Russia, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and one country well within most geographic definitions of Europe, but still not recognized by many as a sovereign state: Kosovo.
[3] Of the former Yugoslav countries, only tiny Slovenia has joined (in 2004). Albania, never a part of Yugoslavia, is also still in the E.U. antechamber.

HEADLINE: Mercedes E300 BlueTec Hybrid: A Star German Midfielder, On Loan to Detroit

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: Mercedes has not committed to bringing the diesel hybrid, which reportedly achieves 56 miles per gallon, to the United States. 

 BODY:
Shown on Monday, Jan. 9: Mercedes-Benz E300 BlueTec Hybrid.
What is it? An E-Class sedan with a diesel-electric hybrid powertrain. It was presented along with the E400 Hybrid, a gasoline-electric hybrid.
Is it real? There's nothing conceptual about the German brand's first diesel-hybrid sedan, although Daimler, the parent of Mercedes, has not confirmed its prospects for sale outside of Europe.
What they said: In a news release, Mercedes-Benz called its new fuel-frugal E-Class "the most economical luxury sedan in the world," but the world in which Mercedes states such things does not include the United States, at least for the time being. The automaker says the sedan is capable of going 100 kilometers on 4.2 liters of diesel fuel, working out to 56 miles per gallon. Top speed is said to be 150 miles per hour, and the automaker estimates a zero-to-60 acceleration time of 7.5 seconds. 
What they didn't say: While the gasoline-electric E400 Hybrid is a definite for American showrooms later this year, Mercedes is being coy about the future, or lack thereof, of the E300 hybrid in the United States. But given the availability of various BlueTec diesels at American dealerships, as well as the automaker's substantial investment in making these powertrains meet federal emissions requirements, Mercedes would be missing an opportunity to be the only major automaker offering a diesel-electric powertrain in the United States. There's also the matter of Mercedes showing the BlueTec Hybrid in Detroit, not Frankfurt.
What makes it tick? A 201-horsepower 4-cylinder diesel engine is coupled with a 27-horsepower electric motor and lithium-ion battery. A stop-start function and regenerative braking also contribute to the car's fuel efficiency. The electric motor is contained within the 7-speed transmission's torque converter. Mercedes describes this powertrain configuration as a "modular concept," meaning that it can readily be adapted to other vehicles in its stable. 
How much, how soon? In this segment, fuel economy seldom translates to purchasing economy. But given the premium tags affixed to diesels and hybrids, the price of a premium diesel hybrid might well elicit gasps. 
How's it look? Every bit as reserved and precise as the gas-burner on which it was based.

HEADLINE: 'Toxic Stress' Can Harm Children for Life

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: The lack of a comforting, stable, protective adult presence in early childhood can lead to lifelong problems. 

 BODY:
In his column Sunday, Nicholas D. Kristof points to a newpolicy statementfrom the American Academy of Pediatrics based on an increasing wealth of scientific research: "toxic stress" in infancy or early childhood can "disrupt the architecture of the developing brain, thereby influencing behavioral, educational, economic and health outcomes decades and generations later."
This is not the stress that results from parents on overload, at least not in the ordinary sense. "The essence of toxic stress is the absence of buffers needed to return the physiologic stress response to baseline." In other words, it's not the natural stresses of childhood that pose a problem. Every baby or small child will be hungry or frightened at some moment. It's the lack of a comforting, stable, protective, adult presence to help a child recover that changes things. 
Millions of children (including, because of the circumstances of her birth and first years, one of mine) face many things differently, from small wounds and setbacks to larger issues, because comfort and help weren't always - or ever - there in early childhood. In the United States, this is a preventable problem. Most parents want to be there for their children. Many things that get in their way - from untreated depression to the lack of quality caregivers for working families to poor pre- and postnatal care - are things that a relatively affluent society can help with, if we let ourselves. 
But as Mr. Kristof points out, we tend to talk ourselves out of the kinds of proactive programs parents, and their children, need. Liberals can argue that a home visitation program like the Nurse-Family Partnership, which sends nurses into the homes of pregnant "poor, vulnerable women," patronizes; conservatives can argue that it rewards the behavior that led to becoming poor, vulnerable and pregnant in the first place. When the social programs that give rise to such conflict fall prey to budget cuts, and young, vulnerable mothers fall short without help, the cycle of poverty is allowed to perpetuate itself. 
As a Western nation, we have many luxuries available. One should surely be the ability to raise a nation of children without "toxic stress." When the Childfund International Alliance asked children in 44 countries what they worried most about when it came to staying safe and healthy every day, children across Asia, Africa and South America first named disease and illness. They feared getting sick without hospitals or the money to pay doctors. The children of the United States feared the bogeyman: criminals and bad people were named more often than anything else. But if we can't find a way, amid our relative plenty, to help our nation's youngest and most vulnerable, then we - and our policies and our fears and our votes and our failures - are the ones to be feared.

HEADLINE: More Health Clinics Pop Up Inside Retailers

BYLINE: BRUCE JAPSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The number of medical clinics inside retail stores is expected to boom, in part because of incentives under the new federal health care law. Chains like Safeway and Walmart already have big expansion plans. 

 BODY:
The growth of health clinics inside retail stores rebounded in 2011 and is poised for a "second spring" this year, driven by well-capitalized retailers and grocers, according to a new report.
The number of retail clinics jumped 11.2 percent to 1,355 in 2011 after slow growth in 2010 and 2009, according to a report by Thomas Charland, chief executive of Merchant Medicine, which tracks the growth of retail medical care services. The number of retail clinics rose only 3 percent in 2010 and had flat growth in 2009 when the financial crisis and the related poor real estate market caused some smaller operators to close their doors. This followed several years of rapid growth.
New entrants from the supermarket industry like Safeway are starting to expand rapidly. Walmart is also hoping to become a serious player in the clinic business, seeking proposals from established medical care companies instead of the start-ups it tried working with a few years ago.
"This is definitely big players lining up to take advantage of the growth in people wanting more convenient health care," Mr. Charland said in an interview Monday. "Before, we had a lot of smaller players just go away. We are going to see a bunch of new things start to happen."
CVS Caremark's MinuteClinic subsidiary already has partnerships with at least a half-dozen major health care systems, including the Cleveland Clinic and the Henry Ford Health System. Walgreen has a partnership with Ochsner Health System in New Orleans and is open to partnerships with individual hospitals and doctors across the country, the company has said. 
 "You are starting to see a newfound cooperation in the marketplace between retailers and their local hospital systems and physician groups," Mr. Charland said. "Physician resistance is slowly melting away." 
Under the health care law signed by President Obama two years ago, there are financial incentives for a more coordinated approach. Insurance companies have programs that reward health care providers if they can prove that their services improve the quality of care and save money through so-called accountable care organizations that are forming between providers and health plans. 
A trip to a clinic, which is typically staffed by an advanced-degree nurse known as a nurse practitioner, is generally less expensive for an insurer or employer than a visit to the doctor's office. The clinics treat routine maladies like pink eye, ear infections or strep throat.
 "Once accountable care organizations start to be a major deal in 2014, the health care industry is no longer going to be counting patient visits but looking to get people the right care," Mr. Charland said. "It's going to be about cost, quality, outcomes, and they are going to be measuring everything." 
In 2014, federal health legislation is scheduled to bring broader coverage to more than 30 million Americans, and retailers are looking to win over those customers once they have the ability to pay for medical care.
The chief executive of CVS Caremark, Larry J. Merlo, has said that the drugstore chain, which has 650 MinuteClinics, plans to add 100 new clinics per year through 2015 and that the expansion is directly related to the expansion of medical coverage under the new health law. 
"We announced plans to open 500 clinics over the next five years," Mr. Merlo said on the company's third-quarter earnings call last week. "We believe our plans to double our clinic count over the next several years will position us well to play an important role in providing care to the 32 million newly insured beginning in 2014. The MinuteClinic also continues to enhance its role as a collaborator in developing integrated health networks and accountable care organizations."

HEADLINE: Debating Taxes and the Family

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Family-friendly tax reform and its conservative critics. 

 BODY:
I've praised Rick Santorum's tentative steps toward a pro-family tax agenda. Others on the right are less impressed. First, Kimberly Strassel in the Wall Street Journal:
And so at the heart of the Santorum agenda are policies designed to give special handouts to the working class, simply because they are the working class-and even then only to segments of this group. That's behind Mr. Santorum's zero corporate tax on manufacturers, which benefits only Americans working in manufacturing. (Job at Wal-Mart? No soup for you!) It's behind his plan to triple the child tax credit, which benefits only Americans fortunate enough to have a child. (Stalled love life? No soup for you, either!) Call it preferential populism.
Then, James Poulos in the Daily Caller:
GOP strategists and analysts are persuaded that defeating Barack Obama and securing a durable majority requires "winning the working class" - an impossible task, they say, in lieu of outright redistributive subsidies, packaged and sold as moral imperatives in an age of decay.
Does America deserve a working class - or a middle class - if it is dependent for its existence on the federal government? Few wish to ask, and fewer wish to answer.
Er, I'll answer. Families who either benefited from an expanded personal deduction for children or applied an expanded tax credit against their income and payroll taxes would no more be "dependent for [their] existence on the federal government" than an investor who benefited from the differential treatment that the tax code gives to income from capital gains, or a business that benefited from a reduction in the corporate tax rate, or an heir who benefited from the abolition of the estate tax. The argument for a more family-friendly tax code is not an argument for "outright redistributive subsidies"; it's an argument for cutting taxes on a form of investment in this country's future that standard tax-cutting proposals tend to leave overtaxed. (It would, admittedly, end up taking a number of working and middle-class Americans off the tax rolls during the period when they're raising children. But the current right-wing anxiety about taking people off the tax rolls is not only unwarranted but deeply unconservative as well.)
Meanwhile, Strassel's claim that a more family-friendly tax code would benefit "only Americans fortunate enough to have a child" falls into the trap (common to analysts on the right and left alike) of treating children as a kind of consumption good, rather than as American citizens with interests of their own. Unlike the manufacturing sector, the family is not a particular zone of the economy that employs a particular swath of the population and influences everyone else only indirectly. It is the place where , save for the orphaned and abandoned, spends the first 18-odd years of their life. A tax cut for families, then, doesn't just benefit the minority of Americans who happen to be raising children at any given time. Because every adult begins life as a child, it benefits almost every American born and raised after the tax cut goes into effect. In the most literal sense, it's a tax cut on future generations, designed to supply a modest counterweight to the existing tax-and-entitlement system's persistent bias against childrearing. And I only wish that Poulos were correct that many "G.O.P. strategists and analysts" (as opposed to a few eccentrics like Ramesh Ponnuru, Rick Santorum and myself) were persuaded of its merits.

Wall Street Braces for Dismal 4th Quarter | For most Wall Street bankers, 2011 was a year best forgotten. Investors will soon find out just how bad the year was for the country's biggest financial institutions.
In recent days, analysts have been lowering their fourth-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America. Analysts are also bracing for lower earnings from JPMorgan Chase, which on Friday is to be the first of the Wall Street banks to report results.
"It's likely 2011 will be the worst year for revenue growth for the banks since 1938, and so far 2012 isn't feeling much better," said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities and the author of the recently published book "Exile on Wall Street: One Analyst's Fight to Save the Big Banks from Themselves." "The industry simply grew too fast over the past two decades and now it's downshifting. This process will take time, but the hit to revenue is happening now." DealBook »

HEADLINE: Ford Adds Plug-In Hybrid to Fusion Arsenal

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The redesigned midsize sedan is said by Ford to achieve class-leading fuel economy, with a new plug-in model said to achieve the equivalent of 100 m.p.g. or better in purely electric mode. 

 BODY:
10:25 a.m. | Updated 
Introduced on Monday, Jan. 9: 2013 Ford Fusion.
What is it? The redesigned Fusion is Ford's all-in bet in a hypercompetitive midsize class. With Camrys, Malibus, Accords, Passats and Sonatas all striving to strike an optimal -- if not terribly stirring -- balance of fuel economy, sound driving dynamics and premium features at a reasonable price, it's a huge challenge by any measure.
Is it real? The Fusion, which will carry the Mondeo name in Europe and Asia, is a critical component of the so-called One Ford strategy. It's every bit the global car that the Fiesta, Focus and C-Max are, and it carries big expectations.
What they said: Discussing the wide-ranging Fusion line-up, Ford chief executive Alan R. Mulally predicted a coming shift in market tastes. "The majority of people near-term are going to hybrids. They're just so flexible," Mr. Mulally said at the automaker's press conference here Monday morning. He added that Ford would build gas-only, hybrid and plug-in Fusions on the same production line, giving it the flexibility to build whichever versions that were in demand. 
What they didn't say: This is a mainstream car, designed to sell in the hundreds of thousands every year against formidable competitors. Consequently, Ford will get a huge benefit if the Fusion is a blockbuster. But it would be a serious blow to the automaker if the car failed to gain traction with buyers.
What makes it tick? The front-wheel-drive Fusion, assembled at Ford's plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, offers a fistful of powertrains, though Ford is only offering estimated output figures for each. The standard engine, a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder, is projected to generate 170 horsepower. Optional engines include a 179-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder and a 237-horsepower turbocharged 2-liter 4-cylinder EcoBoost. The 2-liter is only available to customers who opt for the all-wheel-drive sedan.
The base model is offered with a 6-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.6-liter EcoBoost can be specified with either the auto or a 6-speed manual. The all-wheel-drive model receives a continuously variable automatic.
With lithium-ion batteries replacing the outgoing model's nickel-metal hydride units, Ford is promising class-leading fuel economy from the Fusion Hybrid, with an estimated E.P.A. rating of 47 miles a gallon in city and 44 m.p.g. in highway driving. But the real efficiency showcase is the Fusion Energi, a plug-in hybrid said to be capable of returning the equivalent of 100 m.p.g. or higher when operating solely under electric power. A non-EcoBoost 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine supplements the electric motor. Ford did not reveal specifications for the Energi's battery pack or motor, or what the car's estimated purely electric range would be.
How much, how soon? The gas models and hybrid will arrive in the summer, with the Energi scheduled to arrive in showrooms this fall. Although prices haven't been released, for the Fusion to be competitive, it would be expected to fall in the $21,000-$28,000 realm -- the Energi being the wild card, which would probably list for over $30,000.
How's it look? The design manages to be clean and uncluttered while projecting a strong personality. Buyers put off by the previous-generation car's slatted chrome bars on the grille should be pleased by the new, slightly trapezoidal treatment, evocative of the Focus Electric and the Evos concept shown at the Frankfurt auto show last September.

HEADLINE: Why NRIs Are Also NVIs (Non Voting Indians)

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: Cumbersome process makes it hard for India's 10 million overseas citizens to vote. 

 BODY:
On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reminded his country's 10 million non-resident citizens that they can vote in elections under a law passed in 2010. 
But it's far from clear whether many overseas Indians will bother to exercise their franchise as five Indian states get ready to go to the polls starting later this month. The Times of India reported on Monday that just one non-resident citizen - a man living in Oman -- voted in last year's state elections. 
While Mr. Singh's remarks could encourage a few more people to register to vote for the upcoming elections, many Indians living abroad are likely to find the process too cumbersome. 
According to the Election Commission, overseas Indians wishing to register to vote have to fill out a form, have it certified by an Indian foreign service officer in the country where they live, and send the form and other documents to the voter registration offices closest to their official residence in India. Moreover, to actually vote, these overseas citizens must then return to that place of residence, in India and go to the polls personally. Only a few government employees are allowed to cast absentee ballots. 
It is unlikely that many natives of Kerala working on construction sites in the Middle East or Punjabi taxi drivers in New York could afford to leave their jobs and come to India just to vote. Richer Indian immigrants like software programmers, doctors and corporate executives would find it easier to afford a trip home, but are probably even less likely to do so given that voter turnout is generally poor among the middle and upper classes even within India.
Leaving aside voting rights for overseas Indians, much needs to be done to make it easier for the far larger group of Indians who migrate from one state to another to exercise their democratic franchise. There are about 100 million temporary domestic migrants in India, according to one study.
During the 2009 national election, I met a small group of college students from Orissa who were in Mumbai for internships. On voting day in south Mumbai they were walking near Churchgate station whiling away the holiday afternoon when I approached them to ask whether they had voted and for whom. 
All said they had not voted, because there was no way for them to submit an absentee ballot either from Mumbai or the city where their college was located. They would have to return to their home towns, which was too expensive. Moreover, they did not think that they could the time off from their internships - or their classes had they been in session then -- to make that journey during the election.
The Indian Election Commission says that members of the armed forces, those on election duty and a handful of other migrants can vote by mail or through a proxy, but the service is not available to the vast majority of people who move for economic reasons like farm workers who move from Bihar to Punjab or taxi drivers from Uttar Pradesh who ply the roads of Mumbai. 
Those who move within the country, of course, can register in the city to which they have moved. But to do so they must show an official proof of residence in their new city, which many Indians, especially poor migrants, are not able to because they have no property or lease in their name.
For many Indian migrants, international and domestic, voting will probably remain a distant dream, at least for the time being.

HEADLINE: Salazar Signs Grand Canyon Mining Ban

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: The interior secretary says that jobs in tourism and outdoor recreation far outweigh the potential loss of employment from limiting mining in the region. 

 BODY:
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar formally signed a 20-year moratorium on new uranium and other hard rock mining claims on a million acres of federal lands around the Grand Canyon on Monday, saying it was a "serious and necessary step" to preserve the mile-deep canyon and the river that runs through it.
 The move, which has been opposed by the mining industry and a majority of Republican politicians in Arizona, comes after more than two years of study. It reverses a decision by the George W. Bush administration to allow new leasing in the buffer zone around the canyon.
 In remarks at the National Geographic Society, Mr. Salazar said that 25 million people in four states depend on the Colorado River watershed in and around the Grand Canyon for drinking and irrigation water. He said that more than four million people from around the world visit the area each year, contributing $3.5 billion to the economy. He said that jobs in tourism and outdoor recreation far outweigh the potential loss of employment from limiting mining in the region, a central argument of those who oppose the moratorium.

 Among the critics of Mr. Salazar's action was Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican. In a statement, she expressed disappointment with the decision.
 "This is yet another instance of the federal government engaging in excessive and unnecessary regulation, which is impeding the creation of jobs and economic growth," Ms. Brewer said. "The 20-year ban comes at the expense of hundreds of high-paying jobs and approximately $10 billion worth of activity for the Arizona economy."
 She said that uranium mining has taken place for years in the region with minimal impacts.
 The Interior Department said that as many as 11 uranium mines will be allowed to operate during the 20-year timeout on new claims. Without the moratorium, the agency said, there could be 30 uranium mines in the area over the next 20 years, including four that are currently approved but not yet open, with as many as six operating at one time.
 The withdrawal of the lands from new uranium and hard rock mining claims does not foreclose the possibility of other resource development in the area, including oil and gas leasing, geothermal leasing and mineral materials sales, the department said. Approximately 3,200 mining claims are currently in the withdrawal area.

HEADLINE: House Delegation Visits Latin American Countries

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: House Speaker John A. Boehner is leading a delegation to Brazil, Colombia and Mexico as the House prepares to take up energy and infrastructure legislation that is part of the Republican jobs agenda. 

 BODY:
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio announced Monday that he is leading a small delegation of lawmakers on a six-day trip to Central and South America this week.
Seven lawmakers are currently in Brazil, and they plan to visit Colombia and Mexico later in the week. The group consists of six Republicans, including Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and one Democrat, Dan Boren of Oklahoma, a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition.
"The mission of this visit is to help strengthen ties between the United States and our regional trading partners to support further economic activity that will help create new American jobs," Mr. Boehner said in a statement. "I look forward to discussing issues of mutual interest, whether it is jobs and the economy, energy, or trade, with leaders from these three nations."
Also traveling are Representatives Doc Hastings of Washington, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, John Kline of Minnesota, the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Devin Nunes of California, and Greg Walden of Oregon. 
The trip comes as the House plans to take up a component of the Republican jobs agenda, the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act, which G.O.P. leaders say will create more jobs in the United States by expanding domestic energy production and using those revenues to fund high-priority infrastructure projects like roads and bridges. The delegation will be "visiting with American energy producers forced to create jobs overseas by excessive Washington laws that keep most U.S. energy resources on federal lands under lock and key," Mr. Boehner said.
Also this week, a nine-member House delegation led by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, is traveling to the Middle East and Europe to address concerns about regional security and political unrest.

HEADLINE: Romney Firing Remarks Draw Criticism From Huntsman

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney joked about dismissing people as he comes under scrutiny for job losses connected to his time at a private equity firm. 

 BODY:
12:27 p.m. | Updated NASHUA, N.H. - Mitt Romney began an address to the Nashua Chamber of Commerce here on Monday by talking about how he started his consulting career "at the entry level," and wound down his speech talking about the need to be "able to fire" people or businesses when they provide bad service.
Answering a question about health care Monday morning, Mr. Romney said he would allow individuals to have their own insurance because it would provide the insurance company with an incentive to keep its clients healthy.
"It also means that if you don't like what they do, you can fire them," Mr. Romney said. "I like being able to fire people who provide services to me."
He added: "You know, if someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I want to say, 'You know, I'm going to get someone else to provide that service to me.'"
Mr. Romney was making a point that many Republicans agree with - that individuals should be able to have their own insurance, and choose the plan they want.
But the comment was immediately seized on by one of Mr. Romney's Republican opponents, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., as he spoke to supporters in Concord, N.H.
 
"It's become abundantly clear over the last couple of days what differentiates Governor Romney and me," he said. "I will always put my country first. It seems that Governor Romney believes in putting politics first. Governor Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs.
 
"It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that's a dangerous place to be," he said.
 
The comment comes as Mr. Romney has come under attack from Democrats and Republicans alike for his private equity career at Bain Capital and layoffs that resulted from the firm's restructuring of businesses.
The quip comes on the heels of another awkward comment Mr. Romney made, when he said Sunday that he had feared the "pink slip" several times in his private sector career.
"I know what it's like to worry whether you're going to get fired," Mr. Romney said Sunday, in Rochester, N.H. "There were a couple of times I wondered whether I was going to get a pink slip."
Perhaps in an attempt to explain his "pink slip" reference, Mr. Romney began his speech Monday by talking about how he had started his professional career from the ground floor. 
"I think some people imagine, by the way, that I just went directly to the top position in industry, and in business, that I started off as vice chairman or chairman or C.E.O. of Bain," he said. "You probably know I started off actually at the entry level, coming out of graduate school in business. First in the Boston Consulting Group. Worked there for a while and then was asked by some folks to go over and join Bain, which was a much smaller company at that point, maybe 25 or 35 professionals. And joined that firm again at the bottom level, and was able over the years to work my way up."
Saying he "learned some lessons along the way" and "saw some successes and some failures," Mr. Romney concluded: "Net-net, it was an extraordinary experience."

HEADLINE: For Santorum, Second Would Be a Dream

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum likes to lower expectations, which helped him in Iowa. 

 BODY:
SALEM, N.H. -- Rick Santorum said Monday that he could only imagine finishing second in the New Hampshire primary, given that the polls here have him in third or fourth place, bunched up with other Republican presidential candidates.
"Oh, gosh, in my dreams second place!" he said to a reporter who asked if coming in second would count as win.
"Given the fact that we're not running any media up here," he said, "and we've only really spent five days here campaigning, second place would be a dream come true."
Mr. Santorum likes to lower expectations. That helped him in Iowa, where he had been running at the back of the pack until finishing just eight votes behind Mitt Romney, who came in first.
Mr. Romney is way out in front in the polls in New Hampshire, his adopted home state -- he used to be governor of Massachusetts -- and so second place, whoever snares it, could be seen as a win.
In these final hours before the polls open Tuesday, Mr. Santorum has a packed schedule. It started with a 6:45 a.m. radio interview and ends with a rally in Manchester beginning at 7 p.m. before he concludes with a television interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News.
As he stood out on a playing field this frosty morning at a local college in Nashua, where about 100 people gathered to listen, Mr. Santorum focused on economic issues.
As he walked off the field, he was surrounded by a large knot of reporters and cameramen. He said in response to a question about Social Security that he would keep it solvent by means-testing to exclude wealthier citizens who could afford to pay their own way.
He also said he liked the idea of raising the age at which people would be eligible for Social Security, noting that 70 percent of people start receiving benefits at age 62 -- and they will live, on average, an additional 23 years.
"People will live and work and collect Social Security while you have people barely able to make ends meet," he said. "A better alternative is to focus Social Security benefits on those who need it."
He also told reporters in response to a question that he did not intend to attack Mr. Romney for investments he made that ended in job losses.
"I'm not making it a liability," Mr. Santorum said. "I believe in the private sector," he added, saying that he did not believe Mr. Romney invested in companies in order to put people out of business.
Later, at a town-hall-style meeting with about 100 people at an Elks Lodge here in Salem, Mr. Santorum again stuck to economics, but he was asked a number of questions on social issues.
One question was what he would do if one of his children were gay; Mr. Santorum has drawn fire in New Hampshire, especially from young people, for his opposition to same-sex marriage.
"My job is to love my child unconditionally," Mr. Santorum replied, "and I would love my child unconditionally."

HEADLINE: Huntsman Courts Independents in New Hampshire

BYLINE: ABBY GOODNOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: Huntsman moves up in the polls but appears with New Hampshire's primary a day away. 

 BODY:
CONCORD, N.H. - Fueled by momentum from his weekend debate performances and rising standing in the polls, Jon M. Huntsman Jr. hustled to independent voter strongholds around New Hampshire on Monday to make the case that he, not Mitt Romney, would be the most formidable Republican challenger to President Obama in November. 
Mr. Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, is taking increasingly strong swipes at Mr. Romney, from whom he hopes to siphon the votes of independents and moderate Republicans. At a stop in Concord, he appeared to relish referencing Mr. Romney's statement at a Nashua Chamber of Commerce breakfast earlier in the day that he liked "being able to fire people" whose performance disappointed him, although Mr. Romney was speaking more generally about businesses that provide bad service.
Before addressing supporters in downtown Concord in the late morning, Mr. Huntsman stopped and proclaimed to reporters: "Governor Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs."
He later added, "It may be that he's slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now, and that's a dangerous place to be."
In the latest release of the 7 News/Suffolk University tracking poll of likely voters in the state's Republican primary, 13 percent said they planned to vote for or leaned toward Mr. Huntsman, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Romney, 20 percent for Representative Ron Paul of Texas, and 11 percent for Newt Gingrich.
"It seems to me that every passing hour, today going into tomorrow, the expectations are changing," Mr. Huntsman told reporters at Concord's Eagle Square, where several dozen supporters waved signs and shouted, "Country first" - a reference to Mr. Huntsman's weekend clash with Mr. Romney over whether his work for the Obama administration, as ambassador to China, made him a poor choice to challenge the President in November. 
He refused, though, to predict whether he might place second in the primary or how he might fare after New Hampshire. 
"We've got to prove the point of electability here," he said. "Having established that, and I think we're going to find that tomorrow night, we can then move on to South Carolina."
To do well on Tuesday, Mr. Huntsman would need to draw support not only from independents but from registered Republicans, who in recent days have seemed, based on informal surveys, to be in short supply at his events.
Waiting for Mr. Huntsman at a bakery in Henniker on Wednesday morning, Henry Tiffany, an independent voter from Weare who has been supporting him since December, said he thought the wind at Mr. Huntsman's back would grow stronger in the final hours before Election Day because New Hampshire voters savor bucking conventional wisdom. 
"The political establishment, whoever that may be, is saying Romney is the man," said Mr. Tiffany, a small business owner. "And they've been saying it so long. But everybody forgets that Hillary was the woman, it was Hillary, Hillary, Hillary, and then suddenly it was Barack Obama. And I think we're having something of the same situation here."
Mr. Tiffany said he had supported Mr. Obama in 2008 but was disappointed in his handling of domestic issues. 
Eric Orff, an independent voter from Epsom who came to hear Mr. Huntsman speak in Concord, said he admired Mr. Huntsman's willingness to work with both Republicans and Democrats but predicted he would place behind Mr. Romney and probably behind Mr. Paul. 
"I'll give him a solid third and maybe he can creep up to second," Mr. Orff said. "That's not all bad."

HEADLINE: Lew to Replace Daley as White House Chief of Staff

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Jack Lew, currently the director of the Office of Management and Budget, will replace William M. Daley as President Obama's chief of staff. 

 BODY:
10:14 p.m. | Updated The full report of this article is available here.
President Obama announced on Monday that William M. Daley, the White House chief of staff, was stepping down, after a frustrating year in which Mr. Daley struggled to find his footing in a ferociously partisan Washington. He will be replaced by Jacob J. Lew, the budget director.
Mr. Obama, who recruited Mr. Daley a year ago, announced the departure at 3 p.m. in the State Dining Room. It is the most significant shakeup yet in the Obama White House, which has prided itself on a lack of internal drama, with a tightly knit circle of senior advisers playing a dominant role.
"Obviously this was not easy news to hear," Mr. Obama said, adding that he had asked Mr. Daley to reconsider his decision to go home to Chicago, but that "the pull of the hometown we both love, a city that's been synonymous with the Daley family for generations, was too great."
Mr. Daley submitted his resignation to Mr. Obama last week, a senior administration official said, having discussed his future with his wife over the Christmas holiday and concluding that this was the right time to leave. "It's been a pretty frenetic year," the official said. "He felt like it was a propitious time."
His successor, Mr. Lew, known as Jack, is a well-regarded veteran of the White House budget office, State Department and Wall Street. With his long experience on Capitol Hill, officials said he would be able to forge better ties to Congress.
"Jack has had one of the other most difficult jobs in Washington," Mr. Obama said. "Jack's economic advice has been invaluable and he has my complete trust, both because of his mastery of the numbers, but because of the values behind those numbers."
Mr. Daley, an affable former banker who is the son and brother of legendary Chicago mayors, proved to be an awkward fit on the Obama team. Recruited largely for his deal-making skills and ties to the business world, he failed to help his boss strike a huge budget deal with Republicans in the House.
After that failed negotiation, which led to months of acrimony between the White House and Congress, some of Mr. Daley's duties were transferred to Pete Rouse, a low-profile former Congressional aide with closer ties to the president.
The news of Mr. Daley's departure was first reported by the Tribune Company newspaper chain.
That Mr. Daley was frustrated by Washington was no secret. In October, he told a Chicago TV station that he planned to leave the White House in January 2013, at the end of Mr. Obama's first term. It was not clear what precipitated his decision to leave now.
During his tenure, Mr. Daley had come under criticism for not adequately cultivating leaders in Congress. Some Democrats bridled when he publicly criticized Democrats, as well as Republicans, for being responsible for the gridlock in Washington.
 An e-mail alert about this story imprecisely said that the Daley departure was first reported by The Los Angeles Times. The news was first reported by a Tribune newspaper chain journalist who writes for the Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and other Tribune-owned newspapers.

HEADLINE: Why Bain Attacks Could Stick to Romney

BYLINE: MATT BAI


HIGHLIGHT: An assault on Mitt Romney's record at Bain Capital takes his central rationale as a candidate and turns it into a bludgeoning tool. 

 BODY:
You've tried shredding his record, mocking his ideology, assailing his truthfulness. It's come to not very much. So if you're Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum or Jon Huntsman or Ron Paul, how, exactly, do you stop Mitt Romney
The answer is: You probably don't, or at least not in any mortal way. But in this thing about Bain Capital and the factories it closed, Mr. Romney's rivals might just have found something he needs to worry about, now and in November.
Like it or not, and most of us don't, there is a real craft to negative campaigning. For an allegation to do real damage, it has to confirm some narrative about a candidate that voters already fear. And it's always more effective to undermine the strength of a candidate than it is to underscore a known weakness.
Liberals trying to un-elect George W. Bush in 2004 published entire indictments enumerating his crimes against the English language. None of it amounted to much, because most voters had long since decided that Mr. Bush wasn't fit for Mensa, and they didn't especially care.
But conservative attacks on John Kerry's war record were devastating, precisely because they went directly to the core of his argument. Not only did the "swift-boating" of Mr. Kerry cast doubt on his heroism in Vietnam, but it also added to lingering doubts about his constancy, suggesting that he would change his story when the circumstances demanded it. 
To this point, the attacks lobbed at Mr. Romney have been disparate and not terribly persuasive. Like a man hurling whatever stone he can find lying around, Mr. Gingrich has assailed Mr. Romney for lying about negative ads, for changing positions more often than a yogi, for being too moderate. The problem with all of these lines of attack is that they don't tell anyone anything new.
No Republican who's voting for Mr. Romney is doing so because they think he's a granite-spined social conservative who never wavers in his convictions. Romney voters like him because they think he's the guy who knows how to create jobs, and because supposedly he can win over enough independent voters to unseat President Obama.
(The ads that Mr. Romney's allies ran against Mr. Gingrich in Iowa, on the other hand, proved eviscerating because they annihilated his confrontational persona. The video of the former speaker sharing that couch with Nancy Pelosi couldn't have been more disturbing to conservatives had it been the grainy tape from some convenience store, showing Mr. Gingrich with a hoodie and pistol.)
This Bain stuff, however, the 27-minute video and the accompanying ad campaign in South Carolina, is something else. The basic gist, in case you missed it, is that Mr. Romney's private equity firm routinely made money by buying struggling companies and shuttering their plants - including one in Gaffney, S.C., where more than a hundred steel workers were reportedly laid off.
The attack could prove sticky, for three reasons. First, it takes Mr. Romney's central rationale as a candidate and turns it into a bludgeoning tool. Mr. Romney, after all, is the guy who knows all about turnarounds, which is why we're supposed to hire him as our c.e.o. Every day he is forced to defend his business record, as opposed to his stance on abortion or gun control, is a bad day for Mitt Romney.
Second, it casts doubt on Mr. Romney's aura of electability. Most independent voters may not be ready to take up signs and occupy the local park, but neither are they feeling especially warmly toward Wall Street speculators and bonus-gobbling chief executives at the moment, and the Bain narrative casts Mr. Romney in exactly this light.
And third, the Bain line of attack, more than anything else brandished against Mr. Romney to this point, might bring to the surface an instinctive concern that he's emotively challenged. I heard some version of this a lot when I visited conservative activists and operatives in South Carolina a few weeks ago - that Mr. Romney seemed plastic and programmed, an impression that could only be exacerbated by the idea that he was laying people off and sleeping just fine.
For all these reasons, you can potentially see the darker side of private equity becoming for Mr. Romney, either in coming primaries or in the fall election, what the morally ambiguous side of soldiering became for Mr. Kerry in 2004. Namely: a means of discrediting his central argument for the White House, and an issue that could all too easily, and unfairly, come to define his essential character.
If Mr. Romney's rivals stick around and press this case effectively, they may yet keep this primary season alive for several more weeks. If Mr. Romney can't find a way to quickly blunt the attack, he may be answering for it long after that.

HEADLINE: As Rivals Blast Romney, Santorum Offers Milder Criticism

BYLINE: KATHERINE Q. SEEYLE


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum refuses to mention Mitt Romney by name, raising speculation about his motives. 

 BODY:
SOMERSWORTH, N.H. - Rick Santorum spent his final full day of campaigning in New Hampshire by soft-pedaling his criticism of Mitt Romney, who is ahead in the polls. 
While much of the Republican pack was blasting Mr. Romney as a heartless, leveraged buyout executive during his years at Bain Capital, Mr. Santorum declined to do so.
Rather, Mr. Santorum repeated his milder criticism that Mr. Romney was not a true conservative. But Mr. Santorum did not mention his rival by name, giving rise to speculation that Mr. Santorum might be angling for the vice-presidential spot on a Romney ticket.
At Mary Ann's Diner in Derry, N.H., Mr. Santorum was asked if he thought Mr. Romney was a conservative. "I think he is on some issues, but we are looking for someone who can make a strong contrast, not someone who is maybe good on one or two issues." He said the party needed someone who could "energize the conservative base."
Mr. Santorum appears to be running in the bottom half of the six-man field here, and his crowds are somewhat smaller than when he arrived in New Hampshire on Wednesday after losing in the Iowa caucuses to Mr. Romney by just eight votes. He spent much of the day lowering expectations for a strong finish in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
"I would be ecstatic with second place," he told reporters outside the diner. "Are you kidding me? Oh my goodness. Look, Ron Paul has run here about 17 times. To do as well as him, I'm not sure that's possible, but if we do, it would be a huge win for us." 
He has not bought television time here because it was too late, but he has invested heavily in air time in South Carolina, where he appears to be a stronger contender.
Over the weekend, Mr. Santorum had voiced concerns that Mr. Romney was a mere "manager" rather than an inspirational figure who would bring real change to the country.
But by Monday, he had dialed it back, perhaps determining that there was little to be gained if he did more than try to cast him as a moderate, which is a long-running criticism of Mr. Romney.
In Derry, when a reporter asked him whether he or Mr. Romney was more electable, Mr. Santorum said Mr. Romney had run three times and lost twice, adding, "He's run as a liberal, a moderate and a conservative."
Later, at a town-hall-style meeting here in Somersworth, he went out of his way not to use Mr. Romney's name but said there was "someone in this race" who supported government-sponsored health care and someone who would be "an easy push-over for the next big liberal idea to get government control over your lives."
He told a couple of hundred people crammed into an American Legion hall here that The Wall Street Journal had said his economic plan was better than the one offered by the unnamed Mr. Romney, whom he alluded to by saying: "I'm trying to think of that guy's name, who's leading in the polls, that guy."
He made another indirect reference to Mr. Romney when he told the crowd that he relied on what was in his heart and head to guide his campaign. He said he would not hire a pollster and in fact mocked the candidate who wanted to find "where the wind is blowing."
By not criticizing Mr. Romney by name, Mr. Santorum denies Democrats a video to turn against Mr. Romney if he wins the nomination and picks Mr. Santorum as his running mate.

HIGHLIGHT: Melinda Gates, just back from a trip to Bangladesh, along with Nicholas Kristof, answer readers' questions about the developing world. 

 BODY:
Q.
How can a "small" person without a lot of financial resources help the women of the world? What can each of us do to reach out to the women in Africa, Haiti, South America and the Far East? I feel so helpless and it really hurts. --JEANIE, New York City 
A.
MELINDA: That's a great question, Jeanie. I believe that each of us can do important and meaningful work to make the world a better place. It's not about the money. It's about using whatever resources you have at your fingertips to try to improve the world. 
I think that real giving starts with caring about others and wanting to learn more. I encourage everyone to become a student of the causes they care about. And if you are interested in learning about what you can do to help women in developing countries lead healthy and productive lives, you can go to the websites of organizations such as UNICEF, UN Women, CARE, and Save the Children that support programs focused on women. At Nothing But Nets you can purchase a bed net for just $10 to protect a mother and her children from getting malaria. 
One thing that touches me the most when I travel is the fact that so many of the women I meet don't have a voice-not in their government, often not even in their own household. They want to be able to deliver their babies in a clinic or get their children immunized, but there is no place for them to be heard. They go to incredible lengths to take care of their children, like the group of women I met with today who were at the clinic learning about health and nutrition. This is something they will do for five days a week for five months, to make sure their children are properly fed, thanks to a program put together by the Foundation. 
By supporting programs like this, we in the developed world can use our voices to demand that those women have the same basic health services we do. 
This is the reason why I've started using Twitter and Facebook to share stories and communicate with people who are making a difference-as well as those who are eager to make a difference. I'm a big believer in the power of social networks, whether they are local networks of women working together to improve newborn health in rural Bangladesh, or online networks. Use your own network to spread the word about challenges that these women face or successful organizations that you learn about so others can also become engaged. 
A.
NICK: Two suggestions for Jeanie's good question. First, you don't have to be wealthy to make a difference. Even modest donations do make a difference. For less than $1 a day, for example, you can sponsor a child through PLAN USA (I have a PLAN child in Dominican Republic, whom I visited a few years ago). Or you can browse Kiva.org or GlobalGiving.org and probably find a better use for $25 than you could find at the mall.
But even if you don't have $25 to spare, there are other steps you can take - such as lobbying for good programs, or for change in bad ones. The CARE action network, for example, suggests who to send emails or letters to on humanitarian causes. Many other organizations have similar online campaigns. You can even introduce your child to freerice.com and, through educational game play there, support food donations. So sure it helps to be a billionaire, and Jeanie is unlikely to affect as many people as Melinda. But I'll bet that Jeanie or anyone else can affect one or two people or more in ways that are transformative. If you see a girl who can go to school, for example, because someone has paid her school fees through Camfed, and who as a result now has an entirely different future - well, that's the most gratifying feeling in the world.
Q.
I'd like to thank the Gates, and I would like to ask how they factor in the unintended consequences which may result from their work. For example, earlier efforts to use vaccinations and other means to reduce child mortality were extremely successful in the Third World, but the consequence was very rapid and substantial population growth. I'm not suggesting that saving lives is bad; it is the most noble act a person can perform. My question is how does the Gates Foundation estimate the results of their programs, and do you plan additional efforts to ensure that the results of your work, such as population growth, are effectively managed as well? Thank you. --MARSHALL GOLDBERG 
A.
MELINDA: This is a question that we think a lot about. The foundation is data-driven in everything we do, from making grants to estimating and evaluating their impact. For example, here in Bangladesh, we are funding several research studies to better understand which viruses and bacteria cause the most cases of pneumonia. Only by generating solid data will we be able to make well-informed decisions. And, of course, we need to know if our work is having impact. Measurement and evaluation is built into every single grant so we can analyze the results of programs that we fund.
I want to share with you something that surprised Bill and me when we first started learning about global health. Like many people, we thought that if you made advancements in global health, rapid population growth would result. But, in fact, the opposite is true. When the health of a population improves, family size starts to decrease and population goes down. If a mother knows that her children are going to make it through to adulthood, she will have fewer children. She will have an easier time feeding those children and sending them to school. Life for her family starts to get better by every measure.
But in order for this to happen, family planning is critical. More than 215 million women want to use modern contraceptives but don't have access. That's a crime. We need to make sure that every woman is able to choose how many children she wants to have and when she wants to have them. 
A.
NICK: People often push back at me when I talk about saving lives and say, in effect: That's a canard. In fact, it's increasingly understood that one reason people have large families is because they expect some children to die. If they can be assured that their children will live, they'll have fewer kids (after a lag). That's why birth rates are already dropping in poor countries. Indians, for example, now have just 2.6 babies - down from almost 6 in 1950. Bangladeshis average just 2.3 babies. 
The bottom line is this: the way to deal with population pressures is to support family planning, not to let children die of disease.
Q.
I attended a talk once with the British economist Benny Dembitzer. He thinks that too much money is spent on the fight against malaria and other diseases, believing that a child may be saved from malaria today but could die from diptheria tomorrow. Instead, he'd rather see that money spend on primary education. As a molecular biologist, I think that the fight against insect transmitted diseases can be won, but I can understand the argument. Do you think that a point might be reached at which we have to say: Enough's enough. Let's give everyone bed nets and we can fight malaria through bringing people out of poverty? --ROBERT JONES
A.
MELINDA: I hear that question a lot, and I don't think it is either or. We have to do both. It is incredibly important not only to invest in health, but also to invest in efforts that stimulate economic growth, expand access to opportunity, and help the poor raise themselves out of poverty. Take agriculture, for example. We invest in agriculture because we believe that if smallholder farmers, the majority of whom are women, had access to better information and higher yielding and more resilient crops, they could better feed their families, earn higher incomes, and become self-sufficient.
On the health front, we've learned that in addition to causing some children to die, infectious diseases take a massive toll on those who get sick but survive. For instance, some studies have shown that children who suffer from cerebral malaria have more trouble paying attention and remembering information. The same holds for children suffering from diarrhea and for those who are undernourished, especially newborns and infants. Over 80 percent of calories in the first year of a baby's life goes towards brain development. If that energy is used instead to fight malaria or diarrhea, the brain may not develop properly. And then children can't live up to their full potential, no matter how good a primary education they receive. Good health is fundamental to breaking the cycle of poverty. 
Just this morning, I met a beautiful little girl named Shrabonti in Mirpur, a slum in the Northwest of Dhaka, while visiting a study site exploring the link between intestinal infections, nutrition, and cognitive development. Shrabonti, who shares her name with the rainy season, looked fairly normal, until I realized that she was already 20 months old. She only weighed 19lbs, the size and weight of a healthy nine-month-old. Shrabonti had already been sick 27 times in her short life, including seven bouts of diarrhea. I was left thinking-life shouldn't be so hard for her. How do we make sure that all children like Shrabonti have the greatest chance of living up to their full potential? 
A.
NICK: Should American presidents focus on the economy or on national security? Obviously, the answer is both. We have many priorities and we're fated to juggle them all. In the same way, combating malaria is important not only to save lives but also to promote economic development - but education is also critically important to build skills and transform economies and societies. So I agree with Melinda that we don't have the luxury of picking and choosing a single target; to make a difference, we have to be jugglers.
That said, I think Robert is right that we have to scrutinize the challenges and figure out where we can be more cost-effective. One of the things that the development community has gotten better at doing is introducing metrics and rigor to see what kinds of interventions get the most bang for the buck. I do think that the evidence is pretty good that work in both education and public health tend to be highly cost-effective, and also are mutually supportive. Deworm kids and give them bed nets, and they'll miss less school. And as they become better educated, they'll become more concerned with their own health and will have fewer children whose health they'll take better care of. We're already seeing this virtuous cycle in action right now, which is why Africa is economically the fastest growing part of the world today.

HEADLINE: Ground Game Determines Candidates' Strength

BYLINE: NATE SILVER and MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Since 1984, when primary polling became widespread, the candidates with the three highest volatility scores have been Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Herman Cain, all of whom ran this year. 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - The 2012 primary campaign has been by far the most volatile on record, with one candidate after another surging to the front of the pack and then falling back again.
Although this might seem self-evident, it can also be quantified. The Times's FiveThirtyEight blog has developed a measure of poll volatility that calculates how much a candidate's polling shifted month to month, above and beyond random variance. Since 1984, when primary polling became widespread, the candidates with the three highest volatility scores have been Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Herman Cain, all of whom ran this year.
But there are also two candidates who have been clear exceptions. Support for Mitt Romney and Ron Paul has remained remarkably stable. They also happen to be the favorites in Tuesday's New Hampshire primary.
What might explain their ability to avoid the swings of their rivals?
In part, it relates to an old-fashioned form of politics: the ground game. Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul have built the best field operations in New Hampshire and other early-voting states, many Republicans say.

Mr. Romney's campaign office on Elm Street here is a hive of activity. On Saturday, more than 100 staff members and volunteers packed the premises, bounding around and leaving a tower of pizza boxes in their wake.
Mr. Paul's office, although not as well staffed, operates with military-like discipline. Visitors' names and phone numbers are promptly entered into a database. Doors are kept closed, and a "liberty bell" rings every time a caller converts a supporter from another campaign. It rang five times in our 20 minutes there.
But Mr. Romney and Mr. Paul are more than the exception than the rule, Republicans say. Other Republican field operations fall well short of historical New Hampshire standards, by several measures.
Rick Perry's office is just a mile down the road from Mr. Romney's, occupying much of the ground floor of a 12-story building. But it seems to exist in a parallel universe in which the primary has been called off. On Sunday, the office was run by a single mid-level staff member, whose voice echoed throughout the room. Everyone else was out knocking on doors, he said.
Mr. Gingrich's office was marginally better off. There was little evidence of organization; we roamed for five minutes before one of the dozen volunteers greeted us.
Operations like these suggest that campaigning in New Hampshire has undergone a paradigm shift: from a ground war, dominated by door-knocking and phone calls, to an air war, in which the candidate's fortunes are determined by paid and free media. Retail politics still exist - Jon M. Huntsman Jr. alone has conducted more than 160 events throughout the state - but the campaigns often leave little trace once the candidate is gone.
Mr. Romney's Elm Street office, and Mr. Paul's in Concord, are impressive partly by comparison: they are their candidates' only field offices in the state, but they still give each man a comparative advantage because no Republican campaign has more than two field offices here.
At this point in 2008, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama each had 16 field offices here, while John Edwards had 19, giving them a constant presence in small towns. In 2004, Wesley Clark's middling campaign had 11 field offices, and Howard Dean's had so many volunteers it opened two offices in Manchester alone.
Even Mr. Romney, who likes to run a tight ship, has scaled back to one office this year, from two offices four years ago.
"This has never happened before," said Ray Buckley, chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. "You would go to Claremont and there would be five or six offices," Mr. Buckley said, referring to a small city in central New Hampshire.
Stephen Duprey, the Republican National Committeeman for New Hampshire, agreed that this year was an anomaly, because most candidates had not opened offices outside of Manchester.
Some of the difference reflects strategic choices. New Hampshire is a small state. And phone calls can be placed from anywhere, using a script.
But much of the shift boils down to money. In a stagnant economy and facing increasing competition from "super PACs," campaigns have failed to raise much of it.
"It just costs a lot," said Tim Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Huntsman. "Obama, Hillary, Edwards had a ton of money to spend."
Mr. Cain and Mr. Gingrich, with little money to spend, relied on media-driven swings in momentum, leaving themselves vulnerable when it reversed course.
Mr. Perry's campaign took in more cash, but chose to fight by air. It spent the most money on advertising in Iowa, but had only middling rates of success contacting voters directly, leaving it with no reservoir of good will after he struggled in the debates.
"After the debates, I walked into the Cracker Barrel store in Hopkinton, which is one of those quintessential country stores where people are talking politics," Mr. Duprey recalled. "Rick Perry didn't have anyone there saying, 'You know, he's really good, he just had a bad night.'"

HEADLINE: Ronald Reagan Versus Saul Alinsky

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: At a New Hampshire campaign event, Newt Gingrich calls himself a "Reagan conservative," and the president a "Saul Alinsky radical." 

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. - During the Q & A portion of a town hall event this morning at Public Service New Hampshire (the state's largest electric utility), Newt Gingrich said the 2012 election was really about young people. It's young people, especially, who have to worry about a nuclear Iran, and young people who have the most to lose if the economy doesn't recover.
This was ironic, since Mr. Gingrich's prepared remarks were a backward look to the Reagan era, when these young people were not merely pre-pubescent, but pre-verbal.
Mr. Gingrich said "Reagan" so many times I lost count, but it must have been upwards of 25. He repeatedly referred to himself as a "Reagan conservative" and distinguished himself from Mitt Romney, a "Massachusetts moderate." In keeping with the 1980s theme, he also likened Barack Obama to Jimmy Carter, and referred to the president as a "Saul Alinsky radical." Then Mr. Gingrich outlined a truly radical agenda.

If elected president, Mr. Gingrich promised a 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, a 0 percent capital gains tax, the permanent abolition of the "death tax," (known to liberals as the tax that prevents the United States from having a permanent aristocracy) and a new optional flat tax for individuals. Having given this assist to the wealthy, he would repeal "Obamacare," repeal Dodd-Frank, repeal Sarbanes-Oxley, and replace the Environmental Protection Agency with an "Environmental Solutions Agency," which as I understand it would take its orders from businessmen who have no stake in preserving the environment, and a pretty sizeable one in exploiting it. The author of "A Contract with the Earth" called all this "basic Reaganism."
After the event I chatted with a P.S.N.H. employee, Tim Boisvert, who said Mr. Gingrich had been "very on message" and who liked the repeated references to our 40th president: "It doesn't get better than Ron Reagan," he said.
He did admit some confusion as to what Mr. Gingrich had meant by calling Mr. Obama a "Saul Alinsky radical," which is understandable. To explain the supposed affinity between the president and the author of "Rules for Radicals," Mr. Gingrich simply caricatured Mr. Obama as someone who wants to indenture the American people to the government, instead of having the government serve the people.
Mr. Alinsky endorsed no such plan, but he did worry that a middle class frustrated "over their impotence" would turn to the right, "making them ripe for the plucking by some guy on horseback promising a return to the vanished verities of yesterday."

PERSON: Ed Jenkins 

HEADLINE: Ed Jenkins of Georgia, 78; Served in Congress 16 Years

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Ed Jenkins, an amiable, soft-spoken representative from Georgia who nonetheless confronted one of the most prominent figures involved in the Iran-contra affair during a Congressional investigation in 1987, died on Jan. 1 in Atlanta. He was 78.
His former press secretary, Jackie Sosby, confirmed the death. 
Mr. Jenkins, who liked to describe himself as country lawyer from Jasper, Ga., a small town north of Atlanta, was a tax-code expert who in his 16 years in Congress, from 1977 to 1993, led efforts to protect the Southern textile industry. A conservative Democrat, he was known for negotiating out of the limelight.
But in July 1987, during the Iran-contra hearings, he drew considerable attention when he confronted Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, a National Security Council aide involved in organizing secret arms sales to Iran. Proceeds from the sales were funneled to the contras, the right-wing militia seeking to overturn the Marxist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
At one point Mr. Jenkins wondered why Colonel North, while negotiating with Iranian officials, had made false pledges that would ''obviously come back to haunt us very quickly'' -- among them that the United States would defend Iran in case of attack by the Soviet Union. The colonel replied that he thought the pledges were ''fuzzy enough'' that once the United States and Iran opened relations, the Iranians would not take them seriously.
With rising indignation, Mr. Jenkins criticized the secret fund. ''There is not a single official elected by the people of this great nation that had any knowledge of that,'' he declared, then asked if that was correct. ''That is current knowledge,'' Colonel North responded.
The Iran-contra affair led to the conviction of nearly a dozen people involved in the case, including Colonel North, whose conviction was later overturned on appeal. In 1992, President George Bush pardoned six leading Iran-contra figures.
After the hearings, Mr. Jenkins returned to his primary interest, the intricacies of the tax system. In 1989, as a majority member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he pulled together six conservative Democrats and all 13 Republicans on the panel to approve a bill to cut the top tax rate on capital gains. The House passed the bill, much to the consternation of the Ways and Means chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who called it a gift to ''the super-rich.'' The Senate later rejected the bill.
As a frequent champion of the South's textile industry, he wrote the Textile and Apparel Trade Enforcement Act of 1985, which would have rolled back textile imports from other countries by as much as 40 percent.
''There are small communities that are almost totally dependent on this industry for their entire livelihood,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''If the industry falls, the entire economic base of the town falls.''
The bill passed both houses but was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan, who was concerned that other nations would retaliate.
As a conservative Southerner, Mr. Jenkins was often out of step with the House Democratic caucus. In 1989, he was soundly defeated by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri in a bid for majority leader.
Edgar Lanier Jenkins was born in Young Harris, Ga., on Jan. 4, 1933, one of six children of Charlie and Evia Jenkins. After graduating from Young Harris College, he served in the Coast Guard, then received a law degree from the University of Georgia. He became an aide to Representative Phil M. Landrum and succeeded him in Congress (and on the Ways and Means Committee).
Mr. Jenkins is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Jo Thomasson; two daughters, Janice Anderson and Amy Dotson; two brothers, Charles and Kenneth; three sisters, Marilyn Thomasson, Ella Battle and Patti Chambers; and two grandsons.
