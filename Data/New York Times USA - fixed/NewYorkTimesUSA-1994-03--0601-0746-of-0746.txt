HEADLINE: All We Need Are More Manufacturing Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"World's Big Economies Turn to the Jobs Issue," on the Group of Seven conference in Detroit (Business Day, March 14), refuses to confront the root cause of so much unemployment and so many low-paying jobs, particularly in the United States: the loss of manufacturing jobs. No mention is made of the more than three million United States manufacturing jobs lost since 1979. 
 The article gives the United States a pat on the back for creating 35 million jobs between 1973 and 1991, yet acknowledges that real wages in the United States have fallen in the last decade. A recent study by Stephen Rose of the National Commission for Employment Policy shows that 44 percent of the country's population fell prey to real income declines in the 1980's.
The loss of higher-paying manufacturing jobs, combined with the effects of the lower average wages paid by the service sector -- where most of those 35 million new jobs are found -- is the primary cause of the decline in our standard of living.
Twenty-five million people have become jobless in the Group of Seven countries as manufacturing has been shifted to the third world, and the International Labor Organization of the United Nations predicts that 35 million people will be out of work in the world's industrialized countries by the end of this year.
The industrial production growth rate in developing countries has increased an average of 4.6 percent a year since 1989, but only 0.1 percent a year in the richer countries. In East Asia, the poverty rate has decreased from 33 percent to 10 percent, but in the United States it has risen beyond 14 percent.
As Kevin Phillips explained in "Boiling Point," the loss of manufacturing jobs and the decline of the middle class in America are all too reminiscent of what happened in the 18th-century Netherlands and in Britain after World War I. Their textile manufacturing, shipbuilding and other industries were allowed to slip away, replaced by an excessive preoccupation with finance that led to economic and social polarization.
We are witnessing the same thing in the United States as the gap between rich and poor widens.
Are we to sit by and watch history repeat itself? Our people need more manufacturing jobs, not more service jobs or more jobs lost to imports, if we are to prosper as individuals and as a nation.

Treasury Prices Drop Amid Unsettling News

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury bond yields rose sharply yesterday and prices fell as traders and investors sold during a day when they were buffeted from all sides by continuing nagging concerns about inflation, developments in the Whitewater affair involving President Clinton and the the assassination of Mexico's leading presidential candidate.
 While short-term rates managed to hold their ground, the rise in long-term rates wiped out all the gains made after the Federal Reserve announced Tuesday that it would push up its short-term interest rate target slightly. David Munro, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said that while most of yesterday's headlines were noneconomic, "they did revive the general anxiety of the market." 
In late trading yesterday, the 30-year bond fell 20/32 percentage point, to 9110/32 for a yield of 6.95 percent, up from 6.89 percent on Wednesday and back to its level on Monday before the Fed raised short-term rates.
 
Bills Are Mixed
 Shorter-maturity bills were mixed as the rate for a three-month issue fell 2 basis points, to 3.42 percent, while a one-year issue rose 2 basis points, to 4.13 percent, and a six-month issue was unchanged at 3.77 percent. Shorter-term issues are often a haven for investors when the market outlook is unclear because they are much less volatile.
 James C. Hale, fixed-income analyst for MMS International, a Wall Street research firm, said the market had been vulnerable to selling pressures since the Fed's first rise in short-term interest rates Feb. 4. And it appeared yesterday that investors, after a day or two of feeling reassured after the Fed's second interest rate increase, were now just focusing on future rate increases by the central bank, which most market participants expect will continue until the Fed is satisfied that inflation or the expectations of inflation are reduced.
 Traders also said selling was touched off by the assassination in Mexico. Traders said banks holding Brady bonds, created by commercial banks in 1989 when they restructured Mexican loans, saw these bonds get pummeled in trading. And to offset their losses some banks may have decided to sell United States Government securities.
 The uneasiness ahead of President Clinton's news conference last night was intensified when Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, announced plans to disclose new documents about Whitewater. Noting that Mr. Leach had made statements like this before, Mr. Hale said "the fear is that it may uncover something the market doesn't already know. And with the current trend of the market bearish in nature, any news is magnified." Precious Metals
 Other factors helping to set the negative tone of trading in bonds included jumps in precious metals prices, a common occurrence when there is an international crisis. Traders said gold and silver surged, causing some investors who follow gold as a measure of inflationary pressures to grow concerned.
 Analysts reported no reaction to yesterday's initial weekly jobless claims number of 340,000 in the latest week, compared with a revised 345,000 for the prior week.
 One trader said the jobless data had no impact. Adding that the market is still focused on the fallout from the Federal Reserve's recent tightening of rates on Tuesday by allowing the Federal funds target to rise 25 basis points, to 3 1/2 percent.
 Announcements on Wednesday of prime rate increases to 6 1/4 percent from 6 percent by Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank, Bank of New York, Banc One Indianapolis and Norwest Bank of Minnesota did not help the market's early trading yesterday; investors remained uncertain about the economy and what they expected would be a series of rate increases by the Fed to stave off future inflation.

HEADLINE: Election Aide May Succeed Slain Mexican

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 25

 BODY:
With their long-ruling party still anguishing over the murder of its presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, Government officials said today that the American-trained economist who ran Mr. Colosio's campaign had emerged as the favorite to succeed him.
The selection of the campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, 42, would send a clear signal of continuity with the policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
 Like Mr. Colosio, who was shot to death during a rally on Wednesday in the northern border city of Tijuana, Mr. Zedillo is an unabashed protege of Mr. Salinas. He has played an important role in both the economic and social changes undertaken by the Salinas administration.
 
No Firm Decision Yet
 As Mr. Colosio was buried in the dusty town of Magdalena where he grew up near Mexico's border with the United States, party officials said no firm decisions had yet been made about how or when a substitute would be chosen. The party has not lost a presidential election since it was formed in 1929, and despite a series of recent setbacks Mr. Colosio had been leading in the polls.
Because the Mexican financial markets proved surprisingly resilient today after opening for the first time since the assassination, the officials said it was more likely that a decision or its announcement might be delayed until after next week's Easter holidays. The Government has also yet to disclose whether it will seek a constitutional change to allow serving officials a chance at the candidacy.
Although such a move would expand the pool of potential successors to include members of the Cabinet, officials said Mr. Zedillo already seemed to have wider backing than the other possible candidates within President Salinas's inner circle.
"Zedillo definitely seems to be the one who has the greatest level of acceptance," said one official, who like others said he would speak about the issue only on the condition of anonymity.
Political tensions remained high today as investigators, including a special prosecutor, struggled to determine the motive of the man accused of killing Mr. Colosio, a 23-year-old industrial mechanic named Mario Aburto Martinez.
In a communique, leaders of the peasant rebel army that rose up against the Government on Jan. 1 in the southern state of Chiapas accused hard-line officials of having plotted Mr. Colosio's murder as part of strategy to block democratic reforms in Mexico.
Presidential succession has long been one of the mysteries of Mexican politics even under normal circumstances, and uncertainties about the process have multiplied now.
Government officials and political analysts predicted that, as in the past, Mr. Salinas would decide on the candidate. They said, however, that he would likely have to consult more closely than before with crucial supporters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in order to keep it together.
In Mr. Zedillo, a serious, soft-spoken technocrat with both a master's degree and a doctorate in economics from Yale University, the 45-year-old President may have his best hope of preserving the coalition that he and Mr. Colosio assembled.
 
Third Among Also-Rans
 Mr. Zedillo himself was mentioned as a candidate for the presidential nomination finally handed to Mr. Colosio. But Mr. Zedillo was generally seen to have run third among the also-rans, behind former Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico City and Finance Minister Pedro Aspe.
Although Mr. Zedillo has generally been seen as one of the most able officials in the Government -- he took over Mr. Salinas's old job as Secretary of Planning and Budget at the age of 36 and then oversaw ambitious reforms in the public schools as the Secretary of Education -- he had virtually no experience in electoral politics before being named to run Mr. Colosio's campaign.
With the political situation still unstable, some officials and analysts said Mr. Zedillo's reputation as a hard-boiled manager with a limited political touch could undermine his chances.
Should old-guard party leaders lobby hard against Mr. Zedillo, they said, it is not clear whether Mr. Salinas would be prepared to override them. There has also been criticism of Mr. Zedillo from Colosio supporters who blamed the manager when the campaign faltered after the Chiapas uprising.
Still, several officials argued that there were stronger cases to be made against other candidates for the nomination of the party, which is known as the PRI, its Spanish acronym.
Mr. Camacho, who rocked the party earlier this month by suggesting that he might try to capitalize on his brief success as Mr. Salinas's negotiator with the rebels in Chiapas and challenge Mr. Colosio as an opposition presidential candidate, appeared entirely out of the running today.
He had announced one day before Mr. Colosio's death that he would not seek the presidency, and he repeated that position on Thursday. Whatever hopes he might have guarded seemed to evaporate even before he spoke, though, when dozens of Colosio supporters angrily booed him outside the Mexico City funeral parlor where he went to pay respects to his former aide.
Unlike Mr. Camacho, Mr. Aspe, the Secretary of Finance and Budget, proved his loyalty to the party by quickly and warmly endorsing Mr. Colosio when he was chosen as the candidate last November.
But Mr. Aspe, along with Mines and Energy Secretary Emilio Lozoya Thalmann and Tourism Secretary Jesus Silva Herzog, two other Cabinet officials said to be on the PRI's short list of possible candidates, would have had to resign his post six months before the vote in order to meet one of the constitutional requirements.
Were the restriction upheld, officials said it would appear to leave the president of the ruling party, Fernando Ortiz Arana, as Mr. Zedillo's only clear competitor. Yet Mr. Ortiz, 49, has relatively little experience as an administrator in Government and faces a traditional bias against candidates who come from the party hierarchy.
Indeed, as Mr. Colosio was laid to rest at noon in Magdalena, he seemed to have been a far easier choice for Mr. Salinas than the one he faces now.

HEADLINE: Stocks Fall Sharply as Rates Jump

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates shot above 7 percent yesterday, while a sharp selloff in the stock market capped an eight-week decline that has wiped out most of the strong gains made earlier this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average, after falling 46.36 points yesterday, posted its steepest weekly drop since November 1991. And the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to its highest level in 10 months. 
 The American economy, too healthy for its own good, and the Federal Reserve Board, too cautious for the good of the bond market, were the main culprits for the selloff, traders said. But the Whitewater affair and how it might affect President Clinton, as well as worsening relations with a heavily armed North Korea, added to the market anxiety.
 
 
Reversing the Clock?
 Next week, Wall Street may go even further backward in time, as stock prices approach levels not seen since November, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was below 458, and bond yields are near where they were last May, when the 30-year bond was at 7.05 percent.
Yesterday, the long bond's yield rose to 7.01 percent, from 6.95 percent the day before. [Page 45.]
Kathleen M. Camilli, chief economist for Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., a financial consulting firm, said, "The next stopping point in the short term for the 30-year bond will be 7 1/8, and might well reach 7 1/4."
The Federal Reserve Board is largely to blame, she said, for failing to convince the markets that the Fed is a vigilant enough fighter of inflation, despite two increases in its short-term interest rate target this year, with the last one coming this week. The Fed, which pushed its target rate up to 3 1/2 percent Wednesday, will have to raise interest rates higher and faster, by another half a percentage point at least by mid-May, Ms. Camilli said.
 
A Reason to Stay Out
 "Institutional investors just don't want to get involved if they know that yields are going to go even higher," she said. "Bonds for the short term are going to drag down stocks as a result."
For other Wall Street analysts, the reaction of traders, especially in the bond market, was puzzling. Easton Ragsdale, chief quantitative analyst for Kidder, Peabody, said: "I don't know what the bond people are looking for when they ask for higher rates. What is it they are worried about? Where are the production bottlenecks that lead to inflation?"
Mr. Ragsdale continues to estimate that by the end of the year the S.& P. 500 will be up 9 to 10 percent, the return on bonds will be somewhat below that and the return on cash will be below 4 percent.
But right now, that all seems far away. Yesterday, the Dow industrials fell 46.36 points, to 3,774.73. The Dow is now up only half a percent on the year, well below the 6 percent surge achieved before the Federal Reserve made its first move to raise interest rates, on Feb. 4.
The broader S.& P. 500 fell 3.77 points yesterday, to 460.58. After rising by 3.3 percent this year, the S.& P. is now down 1.26 percent for the year. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index declined 3.23 points, to 783.45. At its 1994 high, it was also up more than 3 percent on the year but it is now up just eight-tenths of a percent.
For the week, the Dow lost nearly 121 points and the S.& P. 500 more than 10 points.
 
Negative Numbers
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.67 points yesterday, to 256.29, on volume of 249.7 million shares, a below-normal day. Declining stocks outnumbered those advancing, 1,198 to 860. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.23 points, to 468.43.
For Wall Street professionals, the clock turned back shortly before 3:30 P.M. yesterday. The market's three main indexes all dropped sharply simultaneously, and the last of the first-quarter gains, at least for the market as a whole, disappeared. Both stock and bond traders pulled back from buying many issues, causing stock prices to fall more and bond yields to rise.
The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond surged past 7 percent, and settled at 7.01 percent. The Dow industrials drifted below 3,800 and then fell another 25 points.
Of the 30 component stocks in the Dow average, 27 declined, with 8 falling a point or more. The largest drops were in so-called cyclical stocks, the shares of companies thought to benefit most from a recovering economy. Thus I.B.M. fell 2 3/8, to 54; Aluminum Company of America fell 2, to 76 1/4, and Goodyear fell 1 5/8, to 41 3/4.
In the S.& P. 500, auto makers like Chrysler, computer companies like Compaq and semiconductor companies like Motorola were especially hurt.
 
Dislike for a Deal
 Novell was again the most active stock, as it was most of the week. With 7.1 million shares trading, Novell shares fell 1/8, to 19 1/4. Its plan to acquire Wordperfect, another software company, has been sharply criticized by Wall Street analysts.
Media Vision, which adds light and sound effects to personal computers, was also actively traded, at 3.5 million shares. Its price fell 1/4, to 10 3/4, continuing a plunge that has taken it down from 26 1/8 on Tuesday. On Thursday, the company predicted a large first-quarter loss because of delays in shipments.
Media Vision's competitors also saw sharp price declines. Creative Technology, which makes somewhat similar products, saw its shares fall 3 3/8, to 22 1/4, on volume of 3.1 million shares. Wall Street analysts lowered their assessments of Creative Technology.
One of the least affected stock markets yesterday was the one most widely predicted to be hammered: the leading index on the Bolsa in Mexico dropped 22.79 points, or just 0.9 percent, to 2,520.78.
Some analysts had predicted a 15 percent plunge on the first day of trading after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the candidate who was thought likely to win Mexico's presidential election on Aug. 21. The American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, often used by American investors as a proxy for the entire Bolsa, even rose 2 3/8, to 62 1/2, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts attributed the relatively calm Mexican trading to a $6 billion credit line extended by the United States to Mexico. The Mexican Government thus had a large supply of dollars with which to support the peso and insure the easy purchase and sale of Mexican securities.
In Tokyo, Japanese stocks fell sharply amid investor concerns over tensions on the Korean peninsula. The Nikkei average of 225 issues dropped 201.42 points, or 1.01 percent, to 19,836.48 in moderate trading. For the week, the Nikkei lost 632.97 points.

HEADLINE: White House Curbs Access To Security Council's Data

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration today extended to National Security Council documents the same broad protection from public scrutiny that is reserved for White House papers.
The action means that, effective immediately, the security council's records will no longer be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. It also allows the council to share with the White House the right to decide without court oversight which records it will preserve for the National Archives. 
 Administration lawyers insisted this afternoon that an appellate court ruling had left them no option but to take the sweeping step to protect the kinds of security council documents that have never been made public.
At the same time, the White House made public a memorandum from President Clinton instructing the council to find ways to insure that appropriate records can still be made available.
In the memo, Mr. Clinton expressed "strong support" for the past policy of permitting public access to certain records, and Administration legal officials insisted that the President would have preferred to leave the current procedures in place.
But they acknowledged that any new system providing access to National Security Council documents would not allow citizens whose requests for information are denied to appeal the decisions in court, as they can under the Freedom of Information Act.
The White House and the N.S.C. have operated in close tandem since the council was established in 1947 to provide advice and assistance to the President in national security matters. By statute, the President heads the council, whose staff is directed by his national security adviser. Most of the 150 members of that staff work in the Old Executive Office Building next door to the White House.
But the security council also operates much like other Government agencies in coordinating policies, and it has implicitly acknowledged its dual role until now by allowing a certain portion of its documents to receive the same scrutiny required for those maintained by the Defense Department and other agencies.
The Administration signaled an end to that practice today in a legal brief filed as part of a continuing struggle over a 1989 lawsuit, Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President. By claiming for the first time that the council's sole role was to advise and assist the President, it asserted for the N.S.C. a status reserved to the White House Office and the Council of Economic Advisers.
The Justice Department did not make a copy of the brief available tonight, but legal officials in the Administration who outlined its contents said it had been filed in Federal District Court.
The officials said a ruling in the case by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last summer had forced them to choose between a legal position that would protect all its documents and one that would protect none of them.
But Tom Blanton, the executive director of the National Security Archive, the main plaintiff in the case, called that position "absurd" and noted that neither the Reagan nor the Bush Administrations had taken the position before in five years of litigation on the case.
"They're playing King Solomon with the baby here," Mr. Blanton said this afternoon. "There's a line to be drawn, and this stance just ducks that issue."
Whether the Administration can maintain its stance could depend on the outcome of the suit, which is before Judge Charles R. Richey of the United States District Court here. But even the Administration's decision to adopt it could prove particularly sensitive for Mr. Clinton, because he has pledged to do away with excessive secrecy within the Government and adopt unprecedented standards of openness.
At a briefing for several reporters this afternoon, Administration legal officials insisted that they would have preferred to leave the current system untouched. But they said they could not have risked surrendering the control that the security council has had over documents showing work being done for the President by his advisers.
 
Council's Role at Issue
 At issue is whether the N.S.C.'s job is indeed solely to advise and assist the President, a designation that would make it exempt from the Freedom of Information Act and Federal Records Act. By allowing some of its records to fall under those laws until now, the security council has implicitly acknowledged that it in fact plays two distinct roles, including one in which it operates as a regular Government agency.
But with the assertion included in the documents filed tonight in Federal Court, the Administration unilaterally declared the council exempt from both statutes.
In his memorandum, Mr. Clinton directed Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and William Itoh, the N.S.C.'s executive secretary, to "establish procedures" to guarantee public access to appropriate records of the council.
Because the Freedom of Information Act already provides for protection of classified records and those providing advice to the President, Scott Armstrong, the founder of the National Security Archive, said tonight that the White House had no appropriate need to seek further protection.
"The only category the extra step protects is illegal and improper action," Mr. Armstrong said.

HEADLINE: Senate, Along Party Lines, Passes $1.5 Trillion Budget

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
The Senate approved a $1.51 trillion budget today that would lock most of President Clinton's economic priorities into place for 1995 but would also curtail his long-range spending plans by $26 billion.
The Democrats muscled the measure through on a vote of 57 to 40, mostly along party lines. Senate negotiators will now have to reach a compromise with the House, which approved a similar budget two weeks ago. 
 The action was as symbolic as it was substantive. The measure does set broad spending limits for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. But the important decisions, like which agencies and programs grow and which shrivel or vanish, will be made by committees this summer and approved or rejected late in the year.
Moreover, the $26 billion in additional cuts is but a tiny fraction of the $8.5 trillion that the spending outlined through 1999. And of that $26 billion, only $1.6 billion would be cut from the next fiscal year's $1.51 trillion budget.
That spending total, up from $1.48 trillion for 1994, equals about $6,000 for every American.
As Mr. Clinton proposed last month, the Senate version would slow Pentagon spending and put extra dollars into Head Start, road work and other programs to further economic growth. The expanding economy plus savings enacted last year would allow the budget to squeeze next year's deficit to $173.5 billion, the lowest since 1989.
But the $26 billion in cuts over five years amounts to a budgetary twist that the White House and many lawmakers found sour: some conservatives worried the cuts would ultimately hit defense, while liberals fretted that social programs would suffer.
 
Most Vulnerable Citizens
 "We'll see cuts in programs that are most important to those citizens who are most vulnerable, those citizens with the least amount of economic resources and the least amount of political clout," said Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota.
The cuts were inserted a week ago by Republicans and deficit-conscious Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, despite hard lobbying by the Administration and top Democrats.
With elections a little more than seven months away, Democratic leaders were never able to muster enough votes to restore the money. But they hope to put some of it back during talks with the House, which did not approve the extra reductions.
Republicans spent much of the week's debate mocking the budget because it lacked any new cuts in the deficit beyond the tax increases and spending slashes imposed last year. They offered several plans containing deeper spending cuts and tax cuts but were defeated at every turn.
They also noted that the red ink was expected to resume growing at the end of the decade. And they said that despite Mr. Clinton's insistence otherwise, his plan to reshape the health care system would not reduce spending for Medicare and other programs.
"I see this resolution as a simple continuation of the budget adopted last year, that refused to control entitlement spending and promised that the deficit would be controlled through health care reform," said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
Senators Domenici and Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, scored a victory today in a battle they have fought for years over controlling benefit programs, the biggest and fastest growing part of the budget.
By a unanimous voice vote, the Senate approved nonbinding language saying that after Congress approves legislation revamping health care it should limit the growth of benefit programs.
The budget would also hold defense spending to $270.7 billion, about $8 billion less than this year, reduce spending for foreign aid, science and space and agriculture, increase spending for education, health and anti-crime programs, and provide more than Mr. Clinton had sought for AIDS patients, mass transit systems and rural loans.
The vote was along party lines except for Republican Senators Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, who sided with the Democrats. Senators William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, and Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, did not vote.

HEADLINE: Western Lands, Except U.S., Ban Export of Hazardous Waste

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 25

 BODY:
With the United States dissenting, most Western industrialized countries agreed today to ban the export of poisonous or hazardous industrial wastes and residues to the developing world, the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The action was a significant tightening of the existing international rules governing waste disposal, but experts said that it remained unclear whether governments will be able to enforce them effectively. 
 The United States, objecting to a total ban, lobbied hard against the measure at talks in Geneva, saying companies in Western industrialized countries should be allowed to continue sending certain materials, like scrap metals, for recycling in other parts of the world if the governments concerned agreed. The United States also objected to a ban on the ability of developing countries to trade hazardous materials among themselves.
At first, Germany, Canada and Australia supported the United States in its reservations but they eventually went along with the total ban.
Today's action bans sending hazardous wastes produced in any of the 24 Western industrialized countries that belong to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, except the United States, for final disposal in a nonmember country of that organization. It takes effect immediately.
But exporting wastes for "recycling or recovery" from the 24 Western industrialized countries, which is believed to account for about 90 percent of all such waste sales, will only become illegal after Dec. 31, 1997.
The agreement was reached at the end of a five-day meeting of industrialized and developing countries that have signed or ratified the so-called 1989 Basel Convention on toxic waste disposal.
That treaty, which 64 countries have now ratified, originally only required Western industrialized countries to get advance consent from a developing or East European country's government before sending industrial waste there for disposal or treatment.
The United States is the only member of the 24-member group of Western industralized countries that has not yet ratified the Basel Convention.
The Clinton Administration has sent legislation to Congress to bring American waste disposal legislation into line with Basel Convention rules and permit ratification by effectively banning hazardous waste exports to countries other than Canada, which belongs to the group of Western industralized countries, and Mexico, which joins the organization next year.
But it is unclear whether today's revision of the convention to include an outright ban on all waste sales outside the Western industrial world will make it easier or more difficult to obtain Congressional ratification.
Today's agreement represents a victory for environmental groups and for many developing countries who have argued that much of the waste sent to the third world is disposed of dangerously or not properly recycled, thus creating a growing hazard to public health and increasing environmental pollution.
The environmental organization Greenpeace called the agreement "a striking victory for global environmental justice" but said that America's "credibility as an environmental leader had been diminished" by its opposition to the ban.

HEADLINE: Strip Clubs Putting On a Suit and Tie

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DENVER, March 25

 BODY:
Inside a gleaming downtown restaurant, a sales executive in a power tie and Italian loafers dined on pasta salad and iced tea, a cellular phone resting on the table, as he luxuriated in the gentrified ambiance of one of the dozens of "gentlemen's clubs" thriving around the country: the regal decor, the dignified clientele, the bartenders wearing black ties and, of course, the women wearing almost nothing.
"This is a classy place," the 30-year-old sales executive, Dean B. Hale, said later, as he waited for a valet to fetch his car outside the Diamond Cabaret. He had spent an hour or so on a Friday afternoon with business associates watching topless women and, he said, hashing out the details of "a high-dollar transaction," a business deal that must have taken a pause as women in slinky dresses snuggled on the laps of the men and blew in their ears. 
 Such places would have once been called "strip joints." But that was when the stereotypical customer was a beer guzzler with a tattoo on his arm and a Harley parked outside. The "gentlemen's clubs," which reject the term "topless" as too plebeian, attract customers whose economic status has conferred on these parlors a new degree of social acceptability, even a masculine hipness.
 
Old-Style Exclusion Seen
 But to many women in the workplace, their existence represents little more than old-style exclusion, a throwback to the days when businessmen frequented male-only clubs, except these are more vulgar. "It's a very shrewd way of excluding women," said Robin Diamond, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, based in Washington.
In offices where male colleagues go off for a lunch hour of ogling, Ms. Diamond said, women are left with two choices: stay behind or go along and suffer the humiliation.
"Women aren't going to want to go," she added. "How can you be taken seriously when there is some woman up on stage taking off her clothes?"
Men who frequent the strip clubs typically dismiss the accusations of sexism, or delight in them. "You can't be politically correct all the time," Mr. Hale said. "And who'd want to be?"
 
Where Men Exert Control
 In an essay in Playboy magazine last year, the writer D. Keith Mano celebrated the upscale strip clubs as, at least in part, "an oblique response to the radical feminist agenda."
"I'd reckon that men have come to cherish a venue where the rules are understood up front," he wrote. "Where they can exert control: For $20, I can make any woman in this room take off her clothing. That's good to know. And if I admire her body, in look or in language, she will accept my male response and won't call a lawyer."
Whether it is driven by feminist backlash or simply by the large number of men unable to get close to a woman without sticking dollars into her G-string, fancy strip clubs are operating in almost every large city in America. Some 10 million customers spent $3 billion last year at such clubs, according to Gentlemen's Club Magazine, a trade publication in Phoenix.
A few of the fancier clubs opened in the mid-1980's, but dozens more have opened in the last few years, including Stringfellows on East 21st Street in Manhattan, between Park Avenue and Broadway. In some ways the new parlors recall the old Playboy clubs, but without the bunny costume.
Unlike the old 25-cent peepshow parlors, the new clubs are generally found not in seedy neighborhoods but in prosperous commercial districts. And they do not try to keep a low profile.
The Diamond Cabaret, for example, sits cater-corner to the genteel old Denver Athletic Club, just a short stroll from stylish Larimer Square. When it opened in 1991, local television news shows gave the club the kind of boosterish coverage a sleek new hotel might have received.
Clubs in other cities have met with the same reception. "We're no longer a place where people mind being seen anymore," said Brian Paul, manager of the Men's Club of Dallas, which has marble floors, French windows, Italian chandeliers and topless women writhing on tables.
"Without a doubt, the general public is taking a turn," Mr. Paul continued. "It's a whole new breed of clientele. It's not a bunch of guys with baseball caps and beers. It's a higher class of customer, men who have goals."
The new clubs are still dimly lighted, but there seems to be little smoking or hard drinking -- vices that have apparently become more socially unacceptable than paying women to undress.
 
Women Crawl to Customers
 A two-minute "table dance" usually runs about $20, and a customer can share lunch or a drink with a young woman. In some clubs, men sit around roped stages where women crawl from customer to customer, winking, purring and sometimes barking.
The women in the clubs do not generally draw a salary but work for tips from customers. Some earn $100,000 or more a year.
Lisa Lynn Hollis, 27, who works at the Dallas club, said she is studying for a degree in nursing, which she said would pay only about one-third her current salary. "But I'm getting older," she added, "and I want more out of life."
A stripper for nine years, she worked in several clubs that she said were less than upscale. Now, when she tells people she works at the fancy Men's Club, she said, she gets "a lot more respect."
"Our clientele is doctors and lawyers," she said. "You know, a lot of people can't afford to come here."
In some ways, the importance of education and affluence among customers at the strip clubs may seem a bit baffling, given that most of them come to stare at naked women, and presumably not to find somebody with whom they can discuss the current negotiations over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
But, like almost everywhere else, snob appeal apparently counts.
"This is all about class," said Bernard Beck, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. "It used to be said that cleanliness was next to godliness. Now it's prosperity; whatever the people with the money deem acceptable, it's acceptable.
"And these upscale clubs are saying to a certain class of people: 'Look, you can come and look at naked girls in a place that won't discredit you. We guarantee not to let anybody through that door who will look bad on your resume."
"It's like a fraternity," he added. "And then, when the doors are closed and all of us high-class guys are together, we can act like any skid row creep."

HEADLINE: Yields Jump; Long Bond Up to 7.01%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Investor concern that the economy is continuing to grow at a fast pace caused interest rates to surge yesterday, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond over 7 percent for the first time in 10 months.
The increased cost of borrowing is likely to be felt by consumers with credit cards and by those shopping for home mortgage loans, along with corporations venturing into the debt market to borrow cash. 
 Jack P. McIntyre, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "The fact that we're through an important level will do some psychological damage to bonds."
 
Mutual Fund Sales Expected
 In addition, he added, the breach of 7 percent exposes "the bond market to mutual fund investors who will now have to think long and hard about starting to withdraw some of that money out of bond mutual funds." He said, "If that happens, we could easily see bond yields move to 7.25 percent, sooner rather than later."
In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond dropped 23/32 , to 9019/32 , as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 7.01 percent, from 6.95 percent on Thursday, and its highest since May 21, 1993, when the yield was at 7.04 percent.
After rallying since the Federal Reserve's announcement Tuesday that it would raise its short-term interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point to 3 1/2 percent, short-term Treasury securities fell yesterday, pushing rates higher. The rate on the three-month bill was up 4 basis points, to 3.47 percent, while the six-month rate jumped to 3.79 percent from 3.77 percent.
Among the forces working against the bond market, Mr. McIntyre said, is the Commodity Research Bureau index, a closely watched inflation indicator, which is now at the highest level in three and a half years.
Analysts at MMS International said the relatively quiet market conditions yesterday morning allowed the rumor mill to crank up.
One rumor, widely discounted, was that the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury securities to prop up bond prices and keep the yield below 7 percent.
Without fresh data from which to draw conclusions, traders and investors cannot conclude yet that economic growth is slowing down from the quick pace at the end of last year. But next week will provide some of the data investors are looking for, with most of the attention focusing on the March employment numbers due out on Friday, when the bond market is to be closed in observance of Good Friday. However, bond futures will be traded in an abbreviated session. On Tuesday the Conference Board will release its March consumer confidence reading, and on Friday the University of Michigan releases its confidence measure to subscribers.
On Wednesday manufacturing shipments and orders data for February are due out, with another revision of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product highlighting Thursday.

HEADLINE: Fed Debated Only Size of Rate Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
When top Federal Reserve officials decided on Feb. 4 to raise short-term interest rates slightly, they debated not whether, but how high, to raise them, according to a summary of their meeting released this afternoon.
The nation's central bank raised the overnight rate for loans between banks -- the Federal funds rate -- by a quarter of a point on Feb. 4, to 3 1/4 percent, the smallest move possible. And the Fed raised it again on Tuesday, to 3 1/2 percent. 
The minutes from the meeting on Feb. 4 depict a committee surprisingly enthusiastic about raising rates. Some members of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee apparently wanted a large increase in February, the minutes show, and it was not clear that this week's increase would satisfy them.
Marc W. Wanshel, a veteran Fed watcher with J. P. Morgan, predicted after seeing the minutes that the Fed would raise rates at its next meeting, on May 17, and maybe sooner.
 
Others Probably Want More
 "The debate clearly at the time was between those who wanted a large move and those who wanted a small move," Mr. Wanshel said. "Since they got the minimum amount possible, you can assume there are others that wanted more."
The increases, coupled with signs of strong economic growth and the selling of bonds by large investment funds seeking to cover currency trading losses, have driven long-term interest rates to their highest levels since last summer.
The minutes say the committee believed that low interest rates were "highly stimulative" to the economy. "In the committee's discussion of policy for the inter-meeting period ahead, the members favored an adjustment toward a less accommodative policy stance, though views differed to some extent with regard to the amount of the adjustment," the minutes said.
The Fed can accommodate economic growth by paying cash to banks in exchange for Government bonds. This leaves the banks with more money to lend to companies and individuals, so interest rates stay low. In a less accommodative stance, it buys fewer bonds or actually sells some. This reduces bank reserve levels, pushing up short-term interest rates and slowing economic growth.
 
Concern Over Financial Markets
 The committee members compromised on Feb. 4 on a small increase partly because of concern that any increase at all might disrupt financial markets, particularly given that the raise would be the first in five years.
"In further discussion, all the members indicated that they could accept the proposed slight policy adjustment at this point, but many observed that additional firming probably would be desirable later," the minutes said.
Fed officials expressed concern on Feb. 4 that the economy was growing so fast that companies would soon be bidding up the prices of labor and goods, feeding inflation.
"A number of members emphasized that even with the substantial slowing that they anticipated in the rate of economic expansion from the very rapid growth in the fourth quarter, overall margins of slack in labor and product markets, already reduced to fairly modest levels, would shrink further in the quarters ahead with the clear possibility that various imbalances and added inflation would emerge in the absence of monetary tightening actions," the minutes of the meeting said.
Committee members were optimistic about the economy in 1994. "Members commented that the economy had entered the new year with appreciable forward momentum and that the expansion was likely to be sustained over the year ahead at a pace somewhat above the economy's long-run potential," the minutes said.

HEADLINE: A Seesaw for Mexican Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 25

 BODY:
Struggling to recover investor confidence and shake off signs of instability caused by the assassination of a presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the Mexican stock exchange reopened today, plunging more than 100 points in early trading before recovering somewhat and closing the hectic day down 22.8 points, or 0.9 percent.
The peso weakened substantially against the dollar, bumping the ceiling imposed by the Bank of Mexico, while Mexican stocks in New York recovered slightly from yesterday's losses. 
 For the wobbly Mexican economy, braced for the worst after the recent violence, even such negative outcomes were taken as symbols that the country's institutions were operating efficiently.
 
U.S. Extends Credit
 Analysts said Mexico's ability to withstand the shock of the assassination was aided by the strong helping hand extended late yesterday by President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. The United States extended a $6 billion line of credit to help Mexico defend the peso. Most international traders knew before yesterday that there was an agreement between the Federal Reserve and Mexico for a standing line of credit. But that line was significantly smaller than the offer made on Thursday, and the public nature of the announcement helped avert anxious speculation.
"Both international and Mexican investors have been very encouraged by the expressions of support from the United States," said Timothy Heyman, director general of the Mexico office for Baring Research.
Still, it was a rough day for the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, where a Mexican tricolor flag flew at half- staff outside the front entrance and crowds of reporters jostled with traders for space. The exchange opened today for the first time since the fatal attack on Mr. Colosio Wednesday night.
Of 98 issues traded, 55 declined, 17 gained and 26 remained unchanged. The leading stock, Telefonos de Mexico, series L, closed at 10.56 pesos, down 1.9 percent. Volume throughout the day was heavy, with a total of 101.8 million shares trading hands.
In New York, Telmex depository shares recovered a bit from yesterday's loss, closing at $62.50, up $2.375
Small investors on both sides of the border rushed to change pesos for dollars, but the demand for dollars was less than had been feared. The peso fell today to 29.77 cents from 30.08 cents where it stood at the close of the day Wednesday, before the assassination of Mr. Colosio.
The Government moved to defend the peso, offering $1.45 billion of dollar-denominated treasury bonds backed by Mexico's estimated $24 billion in reserves.
However, the Government's need to intervene was less than had been expected, given the political turmoil. Arturo Acevedo Aceves, director of analysis at Vector, a brokerage house in Mexico City, said the heaviest trading in the peso was by small investors in money exchanges, not by commercial holders of pesos, and that kept the volume down.
"We have observed very little intervention by the Bank of Mexico," he said. He explained that the band of exchange rates in which the peso is allowed to fluctuate was maintained "by the action of the free market," although by the end of the day the peso had brushed against the limits set by the authorities.
While the death of Mr. Colosio and the market insecurity brought new talk of a peso devaluation, analysts said such a move was unlikely before the election. They also pointed out that next Friday, April 1, new laws take effect making the Bank of Mexico largely independent of Government control, and that dealing with a devaluation would be the best way to mark that beginning.
Lawrence Goodman, senior vice president for emerging markets at Salomon Brothers, said the predictability of the current system, in which the peso is allowed to slide in value against the dollar within a certain expanding band, had had a positive impact on the markets. This was particularly so, he said, "for foreign investors in Mexico who have been reliant on the band to safeguard them from being burned by a sudden peso devaluation."
Tragic as Mr. Colosio's death is, analysts here were quick to point out that he was a candidate, not the president, and although considered likely to win in August because of his party's 65-year hold on power, he was not yet making the important decisions about the course of the Mexican economy.
Although a decision may be several days or a week off, there already are strong indications about Mr. Colosio's replacement as candidate. Investors particularly like Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who holds a doctorate in economics from Yale. Mr. Zedillo had been Mr. Colosio's campaign manager and was expected to serve as treasury secretary in a Colosio administration.
The economic team of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari worked hard after the killing to patch together a plan to defend the economy. Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella was at Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, until the early morning on Thursday, when it was announced that the stock exchange, all banks and all money exchanges would be closed.
The Government said it was declaring a day of mourning, but since schools and Government offices opened, the declaration was seen as a thinly disguised attempt to avert a market disaster.
But closing the Bolsa did little to prevent declines in Mexican stocks traded in New York.
There had been some talk about keeping the market closed today, but in the end it was opened, in part because of the weakness it would have signaled and also because next week the Bolsa will be closed on Good Friday.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Stabilizes, but Mood Is Still Shaky, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar stabilized yesterday after Thursday's sharp selloff.
"The deluge was yesterday," said Kevin Weir, vice president of institutional foreign exchange at ABN-AMRO Bank, referring to Thursday's trading. "Today we're just picking up after it." 
 But analysts said the market's sentiment toward the dollar remained shaky at best after a week in which it was buffeted by the assassination of Mexico's top presidential candidate, the Clinton Administration's problems with Whitewater and rising tensions on the Korean peninsula.
"The mood for the dollar has been damaged," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson.
Traders said President Clinton's effort to defuse the Whitewater issue in a news conference Thursday had done little to bolster the market's confidence. In addition, the slow pace of interest-rate reductions in Europe further limited investor enthusiasm for the dollar.
"The dollar was grossly overbought and many misinterpreted the speed by which the Germans would lower rates," said David Walker, senior manager at TD Securities Inc.
 While the Bundesbank of Germanyis widely expected to lower official interest rates, the pace of its cuts is expected to slow as a result of the recent pickup in monetary growth. The Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, pointed on Thursday to rapid growth in a key monetary gauge as a strong argument for caution in lowering interest rates.
Declining interest rates abroad tend to support the dollar by increasing the relative return on dollar-denominated securities.
The dollar finished at 1.6660 German marks in late New York trading, down slightly from 1.6675 on Thursday. But it edged up to 104.81 Japanese yen, from 104.70 on Thursday.
The market showed little impact from North Korea's decision to put more than 1.7 million troops on alert, a move that came in response to a growing dispute with the United States over nuclear proliferation.
The British pound was up to $1.4980 in late New York trading, from $1.4965 Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4175 Swiss francs, little changed from 1.4180; 5.7050 French francs, down from 5.7105; $1.3750 (Canadian), up from $1.3725, and 1,650 Italian lire, down from 1,655.

HEADLINE: Merchants Cling to Their Dying Mall

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 25

 BODY:
The Hi Ho Center in downtown Bridgeport is a mall on its deathbed.
Most of the 70 stores closed years ago, and the power company plans to shut off the electricity on April 4 to allow for the mall's conversion to a downtown community college. 
 But for Juan Santiago and a handful of other merchants, the Hi Ho is still their place of business, and they do not want to leave.
"If they would let me, I would stay here even if I'm the only one left," said Mr. Santiago, the owner of Lafayette Hair Styling. He insists that customers still come to his nine-chair barbershop in a mall that is cold, dirty and filled with debris.
"To me, this place is like home and we're still doing well -- look at all the customers," he said at midday a few days ago, pointing to five barbers cutting hair and a half-dozen people waiting. "I know I've got to go, but I'll have to take a small shop and that could hurt business."
Other merchants say they feel the same way.
"I'm in a terrible situation," said Raj Tala, the owner of Tony's News, a newsstand at the mall's entrance. "I don't want to leave, but they're making it so unbearable for me that I guess I have no choice. I feel like I've got a gun to my head. They're threatening to turn off the electricity, the city says it will move to condemn the leases, so what choice do I have?"
The mall, on 12 acres between Lafayette Boulevard and Broad Street, was chosen by the state in January 1993 for a $40 million project, including a new Housatonic Community-Technical College, a state police barracks and other state offices.
Mr. Tala, who also operates a newsstand in Milford, says he is bitter because he bought the business here for $70,000 five years ago, but never would have done so if he had any idea that the mall would be closed.
He insists that the mall's owners did not do all they could to make it successful. "They didn't know how to make it work or didn't want to make it work, but either way they didn't spend the money to make it work," Mr. Tala said. "Now, I'll get a little money from the city to leave, but I've got nowhere else to go."
 
Angry at Being Blamed
 But David S. D'Addario, president of Hi Ho Shopping Mall Ventures Inc., said he was angry that some merchants were blaming his company. His late father, F. Francis D'Addario, bought the mall for $25 million just weeks before his death in 1986.
"We did everything we could to make it work, but like other urban malls, the Hi Ho Center just wasn't making it and we could not justify high enough rents to keep it open as a mall any longer," said Mr. D'Addario. He said the mall's $3 million in back taxes and a $300,000 utility bill would be paid when the deal with the state, which will pay his company more than $6.8 million, is finished.
"People just weren't coming, businesses were leaving in droves and we couldn't attract new businesses," he said. "I think the people of this city should be happy that we found a creative use for the building that is going to be good for everybody."
Richard J. Tedder, director of management services for the State Department of Public Works, said the state was hoping to close a deal as soon as possible. He said 11 developers had submitted bids to construct the 170,000-square-foot college building, with 1,300 parking spaces.
 
Eviction Notice in December
 Michael Freimuth, director of the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development, said tenants were told in December that they would have to leave the mall by the end of February. He said the city had settled with most of the 16 remaining merchants late last year, with payments of $10,000 to $65,000 to cover relocation costs and leases.
"I believe we've been fair and we've been patient, but we can't waste any more time," he said. "This project is too important to the city."
But some mall merchants said they would stay as long as they could.
Mitchell Cho, manager of Sports Stuff, a men's clothing and footwear store that also sells sports caps and jackets, said that business was actually up 25 percent over last year.
 
Until Wrecking Ball Comes
 "We're going to stay as long as we can, until the wrecking ball comes crashing through the walls," said Mr. Cho. "We do such good business here, even without other stores in the mall, and they shouldn't be making us leave. They should be doing something to fix the mall up. It's total hogwash that stores in the downtown area can't do business."
As with the other mall businesses, Mr. Cho said the company that owns his store was negotiating with the city to relocate in the downtown area.
But some regular customers wondered where they would go. "I don't have a car and I can't afford the big shopping malls anyway," said one woman as she shopped in McCrory's, a discount store set to close in a few days. "I've been coming to this mall since it opened in the 60's. I can't believe they're taking away the only mall we have down here."

HEADLINE: Nissan Plans 80% Increase In Buying American Parts

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 25

 BODY:
Executives of the Nissan Motor Company said today that the company planned an 80 percent increase in its purchases of American-made automobile parts to $4.3 billion over the next five years.
Nissan is thus the first Japanese auto maker to announce goals for the purchases of American components to appease the United States. 
 But Washington might not be satisfied. Under the new plan, Nissan's purchases of American components would grow far more slowly than they have in the past, and also more slowly than the 20 percent annual rate that the Administration has been seeking. The purchase plans expected to be announced next week by Japan's four other big car makers will probably show a similar slowing of the pace.
Nissan's announcement came as Japan's Government was scrambling to finish by the end of this month a package of measures aimed at increasing imports of foreign products and lowering the nation's trade surplus. Japan hopes the proposals will lead to a resumption of the trade talks with the United States that collapsed last month when Japan balked at Washington's demand for targets.
Having the automobile companies establish their own business plans is seen as a way of answering Washington's request for quantifiable goals while allowing Japan's Government to maintain that it is not engaging in "managed trade." But it is no secret that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has prodded the companies into announcing the plans.
During President George Bush's visit here in January 1992, Japanese auto makers announced a goal of buying $19 billion in American parts by the fiscal year that ends in March1995, about twice the level of the year that ended in March 1991.
While Japan called that figure the amalgamation of private, voluntary business plans, Washington has regarded it as a Government commitment and in the recent talks pushed for an extension beyond 1995. Automobiles and parts account for the bulk of the United States' $60 billion trade deficit with Japan. The parts deficit alone is $10 billion.
This time, Japan is making elaborate efforts to make it appear that each company is acting on its own. The companies are announcing their plans on different days. And it is expected that they will announce goals for different years, to prevent the United States from adding the figures together to come up with a composite figure like the $19 billion.
Nissan's previously announced goal for the 1995 fiscal year was to buy $3.7 billion of American-made components. If it achieves that goal, it will mean that the purchases will have grown by about 160 percent in the three years since March 1992. Under the new plan, purchases would increase only 16 percent in the three years from fiscal 1995 to 1998.
Nissan officials said the plan announced today was the best it could do, given its dramatic production declines in Japan because of the economic slump and the rise of the yen. The company, Japan's second-largest car manufacturer after Toyota, is losing money, and its affiliated Japanese suppliers are retrenching.
Nissan said it intended to increase purchases of American parts for its United States factory to $3.4 billion in the 1998 fiscal year, from $1.95 billion in the year that ended last March.
 
Expanding All Imports
 The company did not officially announce its expected imports of American parts for the 1998 fiscal year. It said only that it intended to expand imports from all countries to $1.4 billion, an increase of 61 percent from the fiscal year 1993. Executives said privately that the import goal from the United States would be $900 million, up substantially from $440 million last year.
Over all, Japanese auto makers bought $13.6 billion of American parts in the year that ended in March 1993, a gain of 29 percent from the previous year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
To Get Legal Advice Without Overpaying, Handle Some of the Tasks Yourself

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks 

 BODY:
Whether you are buying a house, ending a marriage or drafting an estate plan, a lawyer's advice can be costly.
To keep a lid on legal fees, consider establishing a relationship with a general practitioner long before you need help, said Ralph Warner, a lawyer in Berkeley, Calif., and president of Nolo Press, a consumer information publisher. 
 The reason so many people needlessly overpay "is because they usually arrive in a panic" at a lawyer's office, Mr. Warner said. Without stopping to weigh the alternatives or to negotiate, they hand over a $1,000 retainer just to get started, he said. This money may not be refundable. New York's highest court last week oulawed most types of legal retainers that are not refundable, but it appears to be the first state to do so.
Like a general practitioner in medicine, a general lawyer can often provide an immediate -- and probably more economical -- referral to a specialist.
"As soon as you start treating your lawyer like a coach instead of a problem-solver, you'll save a lot of money," Mr. Warner said. That may mean tracking down records, making copies and handling other chores yourself.
Barbara Shea, a lawyer in Rowayton, Conn., charges about $175 an hour for a service she calls Court Coach. She might describe how to set up a corporation, present an argument in small-claims court or approach a landlord-tenant dispute.
Say a small-business owner wants to put a lien on the property of someone who has not paid a bill. "We will show you how to go to the land records and get copies of all the necessary documents," said Allison Reilly, a lawyer in Ms. Shea's office.
Even lawyers with more traditional practices may be willing to take a similar approach. "You can't imagine how much time we spend making the sort of phone calls the clients could easily do for themselves," said William Selsberg, a partner with the law firm of Selsberg & Grushkin in Stamford, Conn.
Any time a lawyer quotes a retainer or an hourly figure, it is worth asking how it might be trimmed. "Before you hand over $10,000 to get a judgment against someone, offer $2,000 just to get the action started," Ms. Reilly said.
Sometimes a little thing makes a big difference. To trim estate costs, ask lawyers to bill by the hour instead of charging a fee based on the percentage of assets, advised Alexander Bove, a trust and estate lawyer in Boston.
And always keep an eye on bills. Phyllis Sinrich, a public relations consultant in Stamford, said she had paid a nonitemized bill for $600 from a lawyer for a legal opinion about the rights to certain published material. When she received a second bill for $250, she lost her temper. "The issue was accountability," Ms. Sinrich said. "I wanted to know what they were doing for all those hours." The second bill was dropped.

If Questions Were Home Runs . . .

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 25

 BODY:
The meeting that was supposed to produce answers about the players still hoping to make the Yankees was not conclusive. At least publicly. Whatever George Steinbrenner and his army of stone-faced officials decided during a two-hour meeting today, if anything, remained behind the glass doors of a dining room at Fort Lauderdale Stadium.
In case there was doubt about its secret nature, a sign on the door read, "Closed." 
 With players sitting in the dugout or standing around as they waited to begin their pre-game preparations at 3:30 P.M. for tonight's game with the Mets, Manager Buck Showalter and the coaches were still not on the field because the meeting was in session. Steinbrenner could be seen through the doors doing most of the talking. About 20 minutes later, Steinbrenner emerged with General Manager Gene Michael, the adviser Reggie Jackson, the special assignment scout Dick Williams and the team's physician, Dr. Stuart Hershon.
 
'No Way, Boys'
 Asked by reporters to comment on the proceedings, Steinbrenner snapped, "No way, boys," adding an expletive.
Who will be the fifth starter? Who will fill the last three bullpen spots? Who is the shortstop? Which two position players will claim the last two roster spots? Are any trades imminent? Why else did an assistant general manager exit the meeting loaded down with media guides? Questions abounded, but there were no answers.
"I don't consider it odd at all," said Showalter, when asked about having several question marks 10 days before the season opener. "We're not going to be pushed into some time frame someone else thinks is right."
Michael avoided reporters and said: "I have nothing to tell you," and "It's private."
So the confusion continues. Excluding Yankees possibly being put on the disabled list, 19 players seem assured of being on the 25-man roster. Of those six remaining spots, four appeared to be reserved for pitchers. Despite the silence, here is a possible roster.
STARTING PITCHERS (5) Jimmy Key, Terry Mulholland, Jim Abbott, Melido Perez, Bob Ojeda. Ojeda's nifty spring numbers and Steinbrenner's backing of him will make it difficult for the Yanks not to choose him over Scott Kamieniecki. If Perez's right shoulder troubles him, Kamieniecki might be in the rotation.
RELIEVERS (6) Steve Howe, Xavier Hernandez, Bob Wickman, Sterling Hitchcock, Jeff Reardon, Scott Kamieniecki. Hitchcock and Reardon could be the winners, Kamieniecki could be a loser because he wants to start and Paul Gibson and Don Pall could be the biggest losers because they would be unemployed.
CATCHERS (3) Mike Stanley, Matt Nokes, Jim Leyritz. Unless the Yankees can trade Nokes and his $2.25 million contract, there will be no changes.
INFIELDERS (6) Don Mattingly, Pat Kelly, Randy Velarde, Mike Gallego, Wade Boggs, Dave Silvestri. Is Silvestri needed? If Bernie Williams opens the season on the disabled list, Silvestri could be demoted because the Yanks would probably keep both Gerald Williams and Daryl Boston for center. Velarde can also play outfield. Kevin Maas and Sam Horn might start at Class AAA.
OUTFIELDERS (5) Luis Polonia, Danny Tartabull, Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams, Gerald Williams. Gerald Williams seems to be the choice over Boston if Bernie Williams is ready. He has had a superior spring and, if the Yankees do not keep him in the majors, they will lose him because he is out of options.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 XAVIER HERNANDEZ has a sore right shoulder and was scratched for the second straight game, possibly complicating the bullpen situation even more. Hernandez, a potential closer, felt the pain after pitching against Florida on Monday. "Anytime you have a pitcher that you're counting on having problems, you're concerned with it," said Manager BUCK SHOWALTER. . . . Two memorable sights at Yankee camp today: The Hall of Fame hitter REGGIE JACKSON lecturing JIM ABBOTT on how to pitch on the inside to left-handed batters and the Hall of Fame pitcher HOYT WILHELM floating knuckleballs to an unlikely batter, GEORGE STEINBRENNER. . . . PAUL GIBSON has a sore left shoulder at the wrong time because his chances of securing a roster spot are already slim, and now he hasn't pitched since Monday.

An Inspired Cook With a Disability Starts a Business

 BODY:
Edith Quarles, 52, of Wyandanch, L.I., was diagnosed with lupus erythematosus in the 1970's and quit her job at the urging of her doctor. Mrs. Quarles and her husband have five children, and being unemployed not only created a financial hardhip, but left her longing for her previously active life. 
 Always known for her cooking, especially her sweet potato pie, she decided to try catering in 1989. State law required her to have a separate kitchen and a permit from the health department. With the help of the New York State Small Business Development Center, she put together a business plan, and sought out grants and loans. Today, her company supplies supermarket chains and restaurants with 2,000 sweet potato pies and 2,000 sweet potato breads each week.

HEADLINE: Bophuthatswana Created Nonracial State

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As two of the few Americans who have lived in Bophuthatswana, we find your characterization of the country in "A Homeland's Agony" (front page, March 13) as a "bastion of apartheid" and "apartheid homeland" as a gross distortion of reality. 
 No one denies South Africa designed the homelands as dumping grounds for its black populations. But Bophuthatswana's leaders seized independence from South Africa in December 1977 to escape apartheid and shape their own destiny. Upon independence, Bophuthatswana abolished apartheid and created southern Africa's first nonracial state.
The democratically elected President Lucas Mangope and his Government forged from virtually nothing one of Africa's most successful and dynamic economies. Where 300 previous years of white rule resulted in economic neglect, they built a respected educational system from day-care centers through university, with hundreds of schools; regional and national hospitals and clinics, and an agricultural infrastructure that permitted Bophuthatswana to export food when more developed neighbors could not.
The Government built a world-class national telecommunications system; two television stations and three radio stations that broke South Africa's airwaves monopoly; 12 retail and banking centers; three magnificent arts and cultural centers, and a national financial and industrial infrastructure that allowed residents to build, buy or rent close to half a million housing units.
Bophuthatswana's economy was built on mining; tourism through casino resorts and holiday hotels; overseas and South African investment, and a capitalism that bloomed black African entrepreneurs and managers on a large scale. Also, by establishing southern Africa's first all-race social security, unemployment insurance and pension systems, for which we both worked, Bophuthatswana's investment portfolio from this source alone rose to more than $1 billion.
Bophuthatswana's economic miracle was largely achieved with self-generated capital; South African foreign aid never amounted to more than 20 percent of the annual budget.
The economy drew two all-white South African towns on its borders -- Mafikeng and Thaba N'Chu -- to vote themselves out of apartheid South Africa and into Bophuthatswana's nonracial democracy.
Despite Nelson Mandela's promises in February 1993 that the African National Congress would not interfere in Bophuthatswana, its agents continually provoked the anger of the Tswanas at President Mangope's increasingly dictatorial and autocratic rule. In recent months, the A.N.C.'s recurrent threats to seize Bophuthatswana unilaterally after April's elections inflamed the fears of the Tswanas on job and pension losses.
Bophuthatswana created in the course of 16 years the economic opportunities and nonracial society that the new South Africa hopes to become. It will take at least 16 years for the A.N.C. to create in South Africa a fraction of what it helped destroy in a few days.

HEADLINE: Dying of Thirst: Reviving your skin.

BYLINE: By HAL RUBENSTEIN 

 BODY:
DIDN'T THINK IT MATTERED, did you? You washed, you dried and you were out. Your skin? It looked okay. You scrubbed. Used a clean blade. Even that nice after-shave balm you got for Christmas. What more did you have to do? Wear that gunk she wears? Eye creams? Sun block? You always wear a hat. Besides, you don't burn, you tan.
And then the mirror stopped saying, "Hey, kiddo." The media harangues about ozone layers, UVA rays, Retin-A and the dramatic rise in melanoma got to you. Your skin's flaking. Sometimes it's a little itchy. You burn. Face it. You're getting older. She is, too. But she's getting better. You? You're not so sure. 
 It's time.
"A man should treat his skin no differently than a woman treats hers," says Dr. Howard D. Sobel, clinical attending dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York City.
You hate hearing that. You're not alone, though you're not in as big a majority as you think. "Until a few years ago," states Pamela Baxter, vice president of marketing for Aramis, "you couldn't get men to talk about skin treatment. They immediately dismissed everything as greasy. Then the boomers turned 40, and they don't want to feel it or look it. Suddenly, they're receptive." So much so, that according to a 1991 Simmons Market Research Bureau report, 49.1 percent of men reported using hand and body lotion. For the other half, now absent-mindedly scratching, you can stave off prune season if you act now.
* Stop washing with bargain detergent soaps sold by fours. This is the only skin factory you're ever going to have, and like it or not, it's slowing production, so be extra nice to it. Glycerine soaps or impurity-cleansing clay soaps are better for the face. For the body, long hot showers and baths actually dehydrate. Keep them warm and short. Try a liquid body wash like Origins Skin Diver (you'll like it; it's black), or Kiehl's Castille Cleansers. Forget squeaky clean. That's for dishes.
* You can't go on without moisturizing anymore. Your skin doesn't produce the humectants it used to. You need help. You don't need gunk. Most men's hydrating products -- Aramis's Lab Series Instant Moisture Complex, Polo Sport Face & Body Sport Cream -- are either oil-free or low in oil. They're light, quickly absorbed and the savvy packaging comes in austere steel blue, gray, burled brown or black, for those squeamish about snoopage. If you're used to nothing on your skin, anything will seem a little too there at first, but you have to stop thinking that that tight just-used-Dial feeling is the ideal.
* Your top layer of dead skin now tends to clump and cling rather than flake off. Shaving exfoliates that part on the face, but the rest of you is covered in it. There are two ways to get rid of it. For the face, there are chemical exfoliators employing either of two equally fine acids (though they can cause irritation on sensitive skins): fruit-based alpha hydroxy (used in Origins Starting Over) or salicylic acid, derived from tree bark (the active ingredient in Clinique's Scruffing Lotion and mild restoratives like Clinique's Turnaround Lotion and Aramis's Lab Series Face Off). These preparations sluff off the useless layer, invigorate the face and allow new skin to breathe. Options for the body: mechanical scrub preparations, the ones containing bits of pumice, loofah (like Polo Sport Face & Body Soap), charcoal or dust from Abu Simbel, which use granulation to strip scaliness and help fight ingrown hairs. Use twice a week, and, if you can take it, after the crest of a sunburn, so you stop moisturizing dead skin. Keep the vigor in check. Let the soap do the work.
* Moisturizer is not just to get moisture in, but to keep it from getting out. Put lotion on as soon you're out of the shower -- once you pat dry, while skin is damp.
* You can't use the same moisturizer on your body as on your face. For example, your legs have no oil-producing sebaceous glands. Your body needs more outside assistance. Avoid heavy moisturizers with mineral oil. Having trouble getting used to even the lighter lotions? Give them a few minutes to sink in. In the meantime, shave, comb your hair, floss, dance around naked. Relax.
* Washing oily skin too much, or with harsh drying agents, won't necessarily help, because the body's clever oil glands react to negative feedback and kick into overdrive. What you should be looking for are products that balance PH levels, not Sahara-ize them.
* Loofah your elbows daily. Attack the soles of your feet with a pumice stone once a week if you're tired of them having the texture of beach glass. Then use products made specifically for callused areas, often containing Shea butter or avocado oil, like Kiehl's Intensive and Moisturizer Treatment.
* Don't need eye cream, huh? "Men actually need it more than women do," says Dr. Sobel. "Eyes are surrounded by the most tender skin. Women at least use makeup, usually with SPF factors. That's where lines come first." Refuse to use? Try getting rid of those hip little sunglasses. Get wraparounds. Dig out the aviators. And then: no sun, no stress, no smiling. There's always surgery.
* Hands are nature's way of saying "Gotcha." Moisturize them, too.
* Wearing a hat is of limited effectiveness. The sun is reflected by the water, the sand, even the sidewalk. Your face needs protection.
* Many tanning products say "waterproof" or "water resistant." And they are, provided you're a Norwegian vacationing along the North Sea in October. But as long as you're sweating on a beach, a tennis court or under the boardwalk, you should reapply any product every single hour. Don't, and you could resemble Jackson Pollock's later work.
* Still using baby oil? With iodine? Ever see bacon left in the pan too long? You're on your way. As for the boast that real men don't use sun screen, real men get skin cancer. Your move.
* Too long in the sun? You have about an hour to save yourself. Avoid the cool stuff in the blue jar and the spray that stings, Mommy. Take a lukewarm bath in something like Kiehl's Soluble Bath and Body Oil. Moisturize constantly. Go buy an aloe plant. Pray.
* If you do get sunburned, don't shave, don't scrub your face. Try a moisturizing mask. Stay indoors. Don't put on cologne. Borrow a caftan.
* Regardless of when you hit the beach, UVA rays are always present. Sun screens, even at SPF 35, do not sanction you staying in the sun all day. And whether they stave off melanoma is now being questioned. At midday: Have lunch, a nap, a stupid drink.
* Best for last. For clear, clean, healthy, younger skin, as much water as you drink is not enough.
* A skin-care regimen will add maybe 15 minutes to your day, tops. You finally have some place to put all that time you keep claiming you save with your new microwave. That's 15 minutes against looking a few years younger. You've made worse deals. H. R.

JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES
Volume One: Hopes Betrayed, 1883-1920
By Robert Skidelsky. Penguin, $15.95.
This biography examines the ethical philosophy as well as the intellectual brilliance of one of the world's greatest economists, giving full attention to his homosexuality and the guilt he felt over his British Government role during World War I. Selected as one of the best books of 1986 by the editors of the Book Review, it is a "brilliant achievement," Robert L. Heilbroner said here. 

 THE GARDEN NEXT DOOR
By Jose Donoso. Translated by Hardie St. Martin. Grove/Atlantic, $11.
The author, a Chilean who lived in Europe for 15 years, reflects on the moral and creative position of artists who have left an embattled homeland. In this novel, published in Spanish in 1981, an exiled, now failed writer finds a metaphor for his former happiness in the garden of a young neighbor in Madrid. Last year our reviewer, Toby Talbot, called the book a "brutally honest novel." Grove/Atlantic has also reissued Mr. Donoso's 1986 novel, CURFEW, translated by Alfred MacAdam ($12), which concentrates on the first 24 hours of a protest singer's return to Chile after 13 years in Paris. He attends the funeral of Pablo Neruda's widow, falls in love and confronts the bitter realities of life in a police state. The result is a "beautifully realized and deeply moving work," Suzanne Ruta said here in 1988.
BALKAN GHOSTS: A Journey Through History
By Robert D. Kaplan. Vintage Departures, $12.
The nationalist passions that have riven what used to be Yugoslavia go back to the days of the Ottoman conquest, argues the author. In this analysis, chosen one of the best books of 1993 by the editors of the Book Review, he explains the politics of the former nation and its neighbors Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania. Our reviewer, Istvan Deak, said, "Mr. Kaplan demonstrates his literary powers at their fullest." Writing in these pages, Mr. Kaplan himself praised THE FALL OF YUGOSLAVIA: The Third Balkan War, by Misha Glenny (Penguin, $10.95), which finds the roots of the current debacle in the Tito era as well, and in the corrupt Serbian and Croatian regimes that followed it. The book, now revised and updated, sorts out "all these passions in a clinically objective fashion," Mr. Kaplan said last year. Also available is A WITNESS TO GENOCIDE: The 1993 Pulitzer Prize-Winning Dispatches on the "Ethnic Cleansing" of Bosnia, by Roy Gutman (Lisa Drew/Macmillan, $12), a reporter's account of the unfolding tragedy.
STREETS OF LAREDO
By Larry McMurtry. Pocket Books, $6.99.
The characters from "Lonesome Dove" are back on the trail, as the former Texas Ranger Woodrow F. Call helps capture a notorious railroad bandit and murderer. Their adventure doesn't measure up to the original novel, Noel Perrin said here last year, but "Larry McMurtry remains a genius at dialogue."
SCREENING HISTORY
By Gore Vidal. Harvard University, $9.95.
Based on lectures the author delivered at Harvard University in 1991, this book includes reflections on politics (mostly pre-1950), culture (mainly movies) and life (primarily Mr. Vidal's own). The result is a "frothy, sometimes crusty, memory-filled meringue," Michael Kammen said here in 1992.
CHARMS FOR THE EASY LIFE
By Kaye Gibbons. Avon, $5.99.
This novel spans the first half of this century, exploring the lives of three generations of North Carolina women: Charlie Kate, a midwife and healer; Sophia, her practical daughter, and Margaret, Sophia's intellectually curious child and the book's narrator. Last year our reviewer, Stephen McCauley, praised the story's "moments of haunting and beautiful tenderness."
INNER CIRCLES
How America Changed the World: A Memoir
By Alexander M. Haig Jr. with Charles McCarry.
Warner, $14.99.
Mr. Haig discusses foreign policy from the cold war through the fighting in the Persian Gulf. In 1992 our reviewer, Alan Tonelson, said the book "contains some of the most perceptive and candid analyses of . . . major episodes in modern American foreign policy yet offered by any of the senior participants."
HOMELAND: The Crown Family Saga, 1890-1900
By John Jakes. Bantam, $6.99.
The first novel of a projected series, this is the story of how Pauli Kroner of Berlin becomes Paul Crown of Chicago, and how his experience in his adopted country mirrors the growth of turn-of-the-century America. The author "is, quite simply, a master of the ancient art of storytelling," Frank Wilson said here last year.
THE MAN WHO MADE IRELAND: The Life and Death of Michael Collins
By Tim Pat Coogan. Roberts Rinehart, $14.95.
The leader of the Irish revolution sat down at the peace table knowing that it would buy Ireland more independence -- and that it would also cost him his life. Last year our reviewer, Christopher Matthews, said, "Tim Pat Coogan's heroic account . . . reminds the reader that even a winning war carries an awful price tag."
YELLOW FLOWERS IN THE ANTIPODEAN ROOM
By Janet Frame. George Braziller, $11.95.
After he is mistakenly pronounced dead, a man cannot escape the horror and fascination his experience has for others. In 1969 our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, did not find the novel credible, but praised its "frequent striking passages of reflection." The publisher has also reissued Ms. Frame's 1970 novel, INTENSIVE CARE ($12.95), which "opens promisingly" with the story of the family of a World War I veteran, Julian Moynahan said here, but then heads bizarrely into an evocation of a nightmarish future.

SILENT DEPRESSION
The Fate of
the American Dream.
By Wallace C. Peterson.
317 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company.
$25. 
A PAINFUL contradiction runs through our daily economic news. The American economy is clearly expanding. More homes are being built. Factory production is rising. So are retail sales. And we are finally holding our own against Germany and Japan. Yet every week brings more layoffs and fresh evidence of stagnant incomes. And more families find themselves losing the trappings of the middle class or falling below the poverty line.
It is this decline that Wallace C. Peterson, a University of Nebraska economist, calls "Silent Depression." The hardship that he describes is hardly a new phenomenon, or a new theme. Four-fifths of the nation's population has suffered from stagnant incomes since 1973, and articles and books describing this phenomenon are accumulating fast.
What Mr. Peterson adds to the economic literature is an attempt to answer this question: How can so much hardship afflict Americans when their economy has been expanding for 16 of the last 20 years, and is clearly expanding now? He never quite gives a full answer -- no one has yet -- but along the way he offers valuable insights.
He notes, for example, that while the gap between the rich and the poor is wider today than at any time since World War II, it is not as lopsided as it was in 1929, when four-fifths of the population received less than half of all family income, and could not as consumers purchase enough goods to keep many companies in business -- and the country started its slide into the Great Depression. Today, the economy can keep on growing with the wealthiest 40 percent of the nation's families getting 68 percent of the income, even though 60 percent of the population is unhappily on the sidelines.
Can we sustain growth with so many people hurting financially? Perhaps. But for Mr. Peterson, a New Dealer, that is not the right question: the issue is ethics, not economics, and justice and fairness require greater equality of income and wealth. And Mr. Peterson devotes 80 pages to policy solutions, the main two being much more public spending and huge revisions in the Federal tax code.
The tax changes he proposes would bring Americans closer to one another in income and wealth, partly by taxing away most of the money that the wealthiest families pass on to the next generation. His proposed public spending -- to build high-speed railroad tracks, for example -- would result in more private investment (in this case, in railroad cars and engines). In his plan, the two together would generate jobs and, more important, a more efficient transportation system; output would grow, there would be more wealth to distribute among American workers and their incomes would rise again, for the first time since 1973.
Mr. Peterson's proposals aren't even on the horizon in today's policy discussions. But they were very much part of national discourse a generation ago, and Mr. Peterson brings them back to life with logic, succinctness and interesting statistical support. The solutions he offers might seem out of the question today, but they are essential historical background in the contemporary debate over ways to end the nation's silent depression.
WHERE Mr. Peterson fails is in eloquence. He writes in the tradition of a Michael Harrington, whose 1962 book, "The Other America: Poverty in the United States," prompted President John F. Kennedy to propose a war on poverty. "Silent Depression" is not going to be so effective, lacking as it does the vividness of Harrington's reporting, or much vividness at all.
Mr. Peterson is very good at laying out statistics in fairly easy-to-read prose, but his story is a dry one. A few suffering people make brief appearances, but they are woodenly drawn. That is a shame, for Mr. Peterson understands that hardship in America is more nuanced today than in the past. The gradations include, for example, the family forced to gradually give up vacations, restaurants, extra clothing -- all the trappings of middle-class life -- because the family income is no longer rising.
"Silent Depression" describes these gradations statistically, but with little of the vivid human detail that might mobilize relief.

HEADLINE: The Artists of South Africa: Separate, and Equal

BYLINE: By Andrew Solomon; Andrew Solomon writes frequently about art and is a regular contributor to this magazine.

 BODY:
AS YOU GO NORTH from Johannesburg, the landscape grows in scale and grandeur, and you begin to feel that you are incontrovertibly in Africa: the vague Europeanizing influence that is so powerful in Cape Town and half-successful in Johannesburg disappears. If this area is a hotbed of gross Afrikaans conservatism, that must be because it is so obvious here that you cannot shut out Africa with a high fence or a well-planted garden of foreign herbs and flowers -- and Africa, taken in its entirety, is not only beautiful, but also frightening to most whites.
The road from the town of Louis Trichardt to the Venda homeland climbs slowly into the gentle hills south of the Limpopo River. When you arrive in Venda itself, you are made quiet by it; an air of mystery and joy and of a dialogue of spirits dwells over Venda the same way an atmosphere of excitement and bustle and urban decay hangs over New York. 
 I had wanted to go to Venda for a long time. The first time I visited South Africa, two years ago, Johannesburg dealers had described Venda as the land of the innocents, where an authentic black culture still reigns, and I thought it might be the missing link that would make sense of my experience of South African urban black and white art. I was impressed then by how much urban artists of every race seemed to treat one another as equals, to respect and listen to and even like one another. They struck me, in general, as good people who wanted to make things right, but they operated at a terrible distance from one another. I wondered what a closer study of their lives and work would reveal about their country and its transformations. I thought I might find a cultural reflection of the political center mentioned so often in the American news.
Venda seemed a good place to start. Its people have been carving for a long time -- bowls, animals, little figures -- and the new Venda art connects to this tradition. Some works are inflated curios, some para-religious objects; some reflect a Western idea of art. The story of their integration into the South African art scene is a parable for the confused but touching cultural interaction that will be the basis of the "new" South Africa.
There are no real maps of Venda. The artists are not easy to find; most of them don't have electricity or indoor plumbing, much less a telephone. You just show up and they are usually at home, and usually glad to see you. I turned from the main road onto a dirt path beside a field of hemp and passed through a village of rondavel (round) huts, made of mud and dung. I was looking for Noria Mabasa, whom I found sitting outside her concrete house with some friends and relations. "Most of my things are in Johannesburg now," she said. "Too far away." But I found a few carvings, made from hollow trunks, of rings of people reaching out toward one another.
"It wasn't my choice to carve," she said. "I was sick. So sick, terribly sick." Mabasa shook and hunched over. "And I had a dream, and an old, old woman came to me, and I was afraid. She said I must make some figures from clay, for being well. So after this terrible dream I began to make figures, and I got well. Oh, I was so well again, with making these figures. And it lasted, oh, some years." She laughed.
"And then I was ill again. And again this terrible woman came to me in my dream and said I must not cut my hair. So each time as it was growing I began to get more strong, and I never will cut it again." Mabasa took off her hat to reveal a fibrous topiary of hair that had been neither cut nor combed. "And then this old woman came a third time and told me to carve, and that it was the last time -- if I carved, she would never be coming and bothering me again. And I was so afraid, and when she was gone I began to carve my dreams, to keep her away. Now when it is a strong dream, I am making carvings."
We walked together behind the house. Mabasa picked some mangoes, which we ate. "And now these people are coming from Johannesburg, and they take my carvings and sell them. I went to Johannesburg, too. Too many people! Terrible place."
I wanted to see the Ndou brothers, Goldwin and Owen. Mabasa said it was too difficult to explain where they were, and after some cajoling she agreed to come with me. Like Mabasa, Goldwin Ndou has earned some money, and he also has a "luxurious" concrete house. When we arrived, the mother of the Ndou brothers was standing outside. Tall, erect, dignified, she was bare-breasted and wore traditional clothes. When she saw us coming, she disappeared into her rondavel and emerged wearing the housecoat of a domestic servant.
For 14 years, Goldwin worked on the railway and lived in a township hostel. Then one day, in Venda, he cut down a mopani tree and saw the hard dark wood at its center. "I said to this little boy Owen, 'In Johannesburg they are selling some things from this wood for big money.' " Each made a carving, and they took them out to the road to sell, and Goldwin never returned to the railroad.
Owen was wearing a silk jacket and Italian-looking loafers the day I met him; 3,000 years of history seemed to lie between him and his mother. Unlike other Venda artists, Owen was pretty clued in on current South African politics, but he supported no one. "It's a good thing in Venda," he said, "not too much politics, and no one fighting for politics. No violence."
At Owen's house, I saw a painted wooden sculpture of an angel, wearing a dress Jean-Paul Gaultier could not have conceived of, her enormous breasts projecting from green accordion pleats. Another recent work is a six-foot-tall rabbit dressed in plus fours holding a golf club, called "Sport for a Gentleman." Owen has never seen a golfer, or plus fours. And why a rabbit?
We sat in Goldwin's house drinking beer, and listened to the international news, which came from the mouth of a six-foot-monkey radio he had made, until the sun set. Though the Ndou brothers' work, often inspired by their dreams, feels ritual in its strangeness, they are making it to sell and do not weep when a dealer comes and takes it away. They have fixed prices, can negotiate in a rational fashion, have even signed contracts.
The next day, I set out to find Albert Munyai. "Munyai? You must go down the hill and past the Zimbabwe Supermarket," said the woman I asked for directions. "You cross the river, and after the third hill you will see him, sitting in the middle of his orchard and singing."
When I got out of my car, Munyai jumped up and welcomed me as though I were a childhood friend. He was good-looking and muscular, wearing only a pair of shorts, his hair in tiny dreadlocks, his eyes sparkling. His wife sat nearby, sanding a big spoon like the ones from local curio shops. He was carving a giant wooden fish, driving the scales into its sides, and addressed as many comments to the fish as to me, more to it than to his wife.
"I have to make the sculpture," he said, "so the wood won't be burned. It's so beautiful, the wood. My God! I am saving this wood from the fire." I asked him about selling. "Oh, my dear," he said. "It makes me so sad that you ask me this question. My dear, it breaks my heart every time. When I sell this work and it goes away from here -- my God, it's so terrible. And these men coming for buying: this money talk is ugly talk."
Later, inside, while we were looking at his work, he said, "I cannot live with it. Thanks to God that these people come and take it away from me! It's too strong for me, too powerful. If I live with it all the time I am made weak by it." I wanted to see the work more clearly, but he hesitated to bring it out into the sun. "You don't know what it can do," he said.
My last day, I went down to Gazankulu to see Jackson Hlungwani, often identified as the greatest black artist in South Africa. Until two years ago, Hlungwani lived on top of a hill, among the great stone circles that mark the site of an ancient citadel. God came to Hlungwani and told him to live there, to make great carvings to His glory, and Hlungwani laid out a sacred ground filled with giant monuments. At the center was a crucifix, 20 feet high. Hlungwani became famous all over Venda and Gazankulu for his preaching and his life in "The New Jerusalem," and for his personal iconography; his strange four-eyed faces, as eerie and intimidating as the heads on Easter Island, seem alive, as though Hlungwani has let free something organic in the trees.
Five years ago, Ricky Burnett came up from the Newtown Gallery in Johannesburg and offered Hlungwani a retrospective. At the end of the retrospective, Hlungwani, excited by the adulation he had attracted, gave Burnett permission to sell everything. But when the great monuments from "The New Jerusalem" were sold, Hlungwani felt the spirit go out of him. Defeated and lost, he climbed down from his hill and left the stone citadel.
Hlungwani says he has been betrayed, and curses Burnett; Burnett says he has taken good care of Hlungwani and that if he didn't want to sell the work he shouldn't have offered it. In 1985 Burnett staged an exhibition called "Tributaries" that flew in the face of the received wisdom that there was no artistic activity in South Africa outside white circles. Featuring artists from Venda and elsewhere, the show began to break down the solid wall between black and white artistic experience. " 'Tributaries' was our Armory show," says William Kentridge, a white South African artist.
What went wrong with Hlungwani? Burnett wished to promulgate the work of this great artist, and by white standards, that's a fine thing to do; by black standards, not clearly so. Would it have been nobler for Burnett to keep Hlungwani's work a big secret? Non-black Africans in this situtation have only two options: they can be exploitative or patronizing. Burnett could have put Hlungwani's work into the open art market, or preserved it artificially within its context. There are no right solutions when these white and traditional black values touch, because they simply do not merge into a single system.
Most white people have two responses to Venda. On one hand, they look at these people living much the way black Africans lived thousands of years ago and wonder why there was never any of what the West would call progress -- why no one here came up with the Renaissance, built palaces, wrote philosophical treatises, developed new methods of land economy, made rockets and flew to the moon. These questions are not politically correct, but they are inevitable, because the "failure" of tribal Africans to do these things has defined white views of blacks.
On the other hand, when you are in Venda you are seduced by its beauty and apparent simplicity, and wonder why Western and Asian civilization bothered with progress at all. You cannot subscribe to the theory that no one there has ever flown to the moon because colonialism was disempowering. No one there is interested in flying to the moon, and, perhaps as a consequence, no one there could or would ever have developed the technology to do so. You tumble headlong into unfashionable questions about primitivism and the nobility of natural experience, which are paralyzing to whoever would build a multiracial society. What is Ricky Burnett to do? Whites in South Africa now invite blacks to the moon. It's meant generously, but it's an irrelevant offer. Or else they say, "Really, you'll be undone by space travel," and that's just obnoxious.
THE EXCEPTIONS, THE WHITES WHO understand, are also compromised. Many in Venda were first encouraged to make art by a sculptor named David Rossouw, whom I was to meet in Johannesburg. Rossouw is that authentic but elusive thing, a white African as much a part of Africa as any Xhosa or Zulu, and his own works -- fantastical weather vanes -- are fully engaged with the elements. He is much loved in Venda, where you sense his influence constantly. But he is not free of accusers; Jo-burg cynics say he made the work less "authentic" or less "black" and that he should never have tampered with the "innocent" people.
It's very fashionable in Johannesburg society to deplore Burnett for his treatment of Hlungwani. "The New Jerusalem" should have been preserved as a national monument. The art should be only for those willing to make the pilgrimage to see it. Hlungwani should be given a house, a car, a spa vacation. Poor Hlungwani, whose beautiful spiritual life has been destroyed by the greed of whites. I heard all of this. What I found was that Hlungwani's life was not destroyed. Black values in general are not so weak or so vulnerable, which is why they can neither be incorporated into an essentially white value system nor annihilated by a white hierarchy. "Ricky destroyed Jackson," people kept telling me as I planned my trip to Venda. But Hlungwani is a pretty powerful character. I found him very much intact, sitting outside in the shade between the legs of a giant devotional figure, carving a stack of angels. In a nearby hut there were several others working, and they came to interpret: talking to Hlungwani is like chatting with the Delphic oracle.
"I'm rebuilding the Garden of Eden. You go up that hill until you see God," he said, pointing, "and then you will find it just among the trees." I found Hlungwani's carving of God, an entire tree, vast, lying on its side, with dozens of eyes, several noses. Beyond it I found the garden, with more carvings.
"I have something for you, for your spirit," he said when I came back. He brought out two carvings. "This one is finished," he said, showing me an angel. "It's perfect. This one is not for you." He picked up the second one. "This one is not finished. I am giving it to you so you can finish it from your own spirit." I looked closely at the two angels. "Use your brain! Give him a face yourself! This angel is full of love! Tell the people in America all about it!"
 
The Bag Factory
A London-based patron opened the old Speedy Bag Factory to Johannesburg artists in mid-1991; it contains 19 studios now, occupied by black and white artists. On Fridays, they have lunch together. To many outsiders, this seems a miniature utopia, where racial barriers have been eliminated, but the gaps are painfully vivid if you look just a bit more closely.
The white artists at the Bag Factory are the trendiest crew in South Africa, a trendiness manifested in their clothes, mannerisms, reading material and racial attitudes. The most talented are Joachim Schonfeldt and Alan Alborough, though there is also impressive work from Kendell Geers, Wane Barker and Belinda Blignaut. Schonfeldt's "Curios and Authentic Works of Art" are subtle, funny and disconcertingly beautiful carvings, always made from the wood of blue gums; they confront the divides between art and craft, integrity and artifice, black and white.
Alborough works with boundaries, crossable and inviolable, and has done a particularly powerful series in which children's games become metaphors for social definition and exclusion. Geers, the most articulate of the crowd, is the bad boy of South African art; he deconstructs his society, sometimes very cleverly, sometimes apparently unaware that intellectual constructs already exhausted abroad cannot serve in South Africa as the basis for internationalism.
In Gazankulu in the late apartheid period, white liberals set up a program for local blacks to explore their heritage by learning basket weaving. Since the appropriate grasses did not grow locally and none of the local people knew how to weave baskets, the organizers had to import materials and teachers. No one observed that this area was rich in clay and that these people had a tradition of clay modeling. The basket weaving was absurd, in much the same way the sometime Eurocentricity of these white artists can be inept. It's not that they should have to work only on local topics, but simply that to ignore the clay and import grasses is so wasteful, and people from Gazankulu are never going to be as good at basket weaving as the people from the grasslands. Similarly, the work of these white Bag Factory artists is sometimes too sophisticated; they fail to realize that nothing is more provincial than to deny your own provincialism.
THE BLACK BAG FACTORY ARTISTS ARE mostly older, their works' meanings embedded in a different spectrum of cultural references. Several of the leading lights of the black art world are here: David Koloane, Durant Sihlali and Ezrom Legae, as well as younger artists like Sam Nhlengethwa and Pat Mautloa.
I remember getting tangled in a conversation two years ago with David Koloane and a white artist about how their work is related. "How did you become artists?" I asked. "I'd always liked to draw," said Koloane, "but I never knew you could do anything with this. When I was 16, Louis Maqhubela moved in across the street from me and said there were people called artists who did drawing and painting and nothing else. We decided we wanted to do that." The white artist said, "When I was 16, I was seated next to Andy Warhol at lunch, and he suggested I apply to the London art schools." Koloane, at 16, had never heard of art.
Looking at work by urban black artists, you have to consider that difference. To decide to make a work of art in an environment where art is not only unvalued but also frequently unknown is a bold and almost radical act. The distinctive and poetic styles of artists like Koloane and Sihlali reflect a courage and self-determination not relevant to the work of white artists. This does not make the black work better (in fact, it's often ingenuous), but it does make it different. You lose much of the value of these black artists' works if you try to look at them in the same context as the hyper-sophisticated installations of Kendell Geers.
"It's very politically correct," said Sam Nhlengethwa, "not to write the race of murder victims in the newspapers. But you can always tell -- from the names, the place of the murder, how much space it gets in the paper. It may be fashionable not to mention the race of the artist, but you can always tell the difference."
 
Pictures, Concepts And Beads
Five years ago, the South African National Gallery, in Cape Town, was a dead loss: pictures by Pierneef, the "great" Afrikaans painter, hung gloomily beside third-rate works by second-rate American and European artists. The new director, Marilyn Martin, strong, dynamic, opinionated, swept in like the west wind and changed all that.
When I went to the National Gallery I found, beyond the impressive permanent collection, a large installation by Malcolm Payne, built up with shopping carts, ancient and new ceramics, text and light projections. The piece was impressive but made no concessions to a population unacquainted with the discourse of contemporary art. In the room beyond, there was an exhibition called "Ezakwantu: Beadwork from the Eastern Cape"; in the corner sat two Xhosa bead workers, Virginia and Lucy, who beaded quietly all day unless asked a question through their translator.
Malcolm Payne compared this situation to the 19th-century European enthusiasm for putting Hottentots on show for the public. Martin insisted that Virginia and Lucy were at the gallery to demonstrate that this historical tradition continues to the present, a point made elsewhere simply by the inclusion of contemporary material. Martin had not asked a German Expressionist to sit all day and paint in the neighboring gallery, where there was a show of German Expressionism.
It is fashionable in South Africa to call craft "art," especially if it's very good craft. This is like calling very good chicken "veal." Very good craft is very good craft -- not less than art, but different. "We have freed ourselves of the shackles of such Eurocentric definitions," Marilyn Martin said in a bluntly P.C. manner -- though she holds to that most Eurocentric principle of the museum. In the gift shop at the National Gallery, you can buy Xhosa beadwork or postcards of other material in the museum. It is important to draw a distinction between the stuff that has to be copied because it is unique in its genius, and the stuff of which you can make more.
If you insist that art and craft are the same, you have to discuss them in the same terms, which reduces both. Some art is at its best in a museum, and some is at its best on a hill, and some is at its best being worn or carried back and forth to the fields, and some is at its best in the home of the artist who made it, or in the homes of his friends.
A painting called "The AIDS Doctors," by Alson Ntshangase, a relatively unknown artist, shows a doctor, a priest and a sangoma (a witch doctor) all ranged surrealistically around a patient lying in bed. How to make sense of the spirit and science, the black and white views of life and death? "I know exactly where I came from and who I am," Ntshangase said to me. He had walked over from his job as a handyman in a white-run Durban hotel, and was wearing overalls. "I grew up in Zululand and am a Zulu," he said, and showed me that underneath his uniform he wore a traditional Zulu loincloth. "Show one of my people a basket," he said, "and he will know at once whether the grasses have been well dyed. But show him a painting and" -- he looked across the room -- "that plastic shopping bag with the bird on it, and he will not be able to see why one image is better than the other."
 
Trips to the Townships
Classic white liberals open their homes to black friends; I spent many fine evenings at parties where the races seemed to mix completely comfortably. But only a tiny number of these white liberals are willing to cross the boundary in the other direction, to go into the townships. In effect, the whites have now welcomed the blacks to participate in their system of values, but have not yet considered giving up those values in favor of another set, and are touchingly bewildered when blacks fail to see this as a new equality. In the township of Mamelodi, outside Pretoria, an old woman told me: "We have always had one great advantage over the whites. We knew their houses inside and out. We did their scrubbing, their cooking, their shopping; we were the nannies who suckled their children. But they never came out here, and they didn't know a thing about us."
It's not an easy problem to address. The townships are scary; though the danger was exaggerated by the apartheid government, and though many whites have a fear disproportionate to the reality, township violence is unpredictable and people do get killed. You are never sure you are going to make it into the township on the day you plan to, because the person you are visiting may tell you it's a "bad day." You are dependent on this person's knowledge, connections and radar; sometimes the phone will ring and your host, without any real explanation, will say that you have to leave. You must overlook the danger to understand the other side. But when you do go, many people are glad. If you are in the township, people know that someone thought it was worth the trouble to bring you.
"I was excluded from many places during apartheid, and since," Durant Sihlali said as we sat in his house in Soweto. "And I am not so eager to include all the whites who say in their casual way that they want to come here. It's an effort, and distracting, for me to come into Johannesburg and pick someone up and think about his safety all the time, and protect him and entertain him and drive him home. I am not going to give my life over to doing it."
Sihlali speaks a beautiful, rich English. He grew up under apartheid, but he is educated, self-assured, even diffident. For years, he was engaged in commercial enterprise, painting scenes on seashells for tourists, but he simultaneously did a series of watercolors of township life. To a Western critic, these appear accomplished but outside the issues of contemporary art. But the work of South African black artists should be read from the standpoint of their frequent obsession with family, history and dreams. Sihlali's watercolors are documents of a history the government wished to suppress.
"My interest was not in beautiful things," Sihlali explained. "Nor are my paintings an expression of rage; I don't think that when you tell the truth you become angry. I painted against bulldozers as a mode of protest, and when I finished painting a house before they destroyed it, I felt that I had won."
Sihlali's work did well in Johannesburg galleries in the apartheid period. "People bought it for its decorative appeal," he said. "The perpetrators of injustice would buy my work and hang it on their white walls without ever noticing that it was telling the story of their cruelty."
When I went to Soweto with Sihlali, we looked through an enormously various collection of his own work. Whereas white artists in South Africa define a trademark style fairly quickly, black artists tend to be interested by the breadth of visual arts, and many of them have worked in every medium and style.
We left Jabulani -- "deepest Soweto," Sihlali calls it -- and went to see Vincent Baloyi, a sculptor, and Charles Nkosi, another artist, in the Chiawelo Extension section of Soweto. We sent some children off to get us beer and sat in the front room talking. We discussed Nkosi's strange and beautiful collages, and the work of other artists, and how much the black community needs to create and to feel pride in the act of creation. Art is the basis of a proud and almost sovereign dialogue that is rare and precious in the townships, that exceeds in its meanings anything you could adduce from the appearance of the work.
I traveled to the Durban township of Umlazi with Alois Cele, a painter and commercial artist who has in the last five years built up a trade in T-shirts, signs and billboard advertising. "They all come to me for their T-shirts and flags," he said. "I tell the guys from all the political groups, all of them, that I'll have the shirts on Wednesday around 4, and then I keep them waiting so they'll have to talk to each other. They sit there fuming, but they see each other as people, too. You can do everything through the art business."
Cele and I drove to Trevor Makoba's house. The Soweto artists may not have cared very much about the international art world, but they knew about it as a principle. Makoba, though he does oils and pastels on paper, is curiously unaware of the Western tradition altogether, unable to place or value his own pictures.
I knew that Makoba had been one of the featured artists in the South African exhibition at the 1993 Venice Biennale, and so I asked him about that. He showed me the allegorical picture that had been included, a piece of cheese in the shape of South Africa being nibbled by a black mouse on one side and a white mouse on the other. He said, a bit sadly, "I'm glad I have been in this exhibition. But I do wish they'd asked me first. I would have liked to talk to them about it." "No one asked you whether you wanted to be in Venice, representing South Africa?" I asked. "No," he said. "The first I heard of it was the week of the opening."
South Africa's invitation to the Biennale (after decades of exclusion) sat with government officials for ages before the rushed "democratic" selection of the artists. The government paid for bureaucrats to go to Venice but did not provide tickets for artists. Several white artists paid their own way, and the South Africans found, embarrassingly, that they had many white and no black artists in town. So the authorities quickly sent tickets to black artists. These were in most instances people who had never traveled across their own country, much less overseas. The committee sent a ticket to Jackson Hlungwani, who responded, "The radio is good but the message is bad," and declined to leave Gazankulu. Makoba made a valiant effort to organize himself for this travel, but even with the help of white friends couldn't get himself on a plane in time. "The clear implication," observed Sue Williamson, a Cape Town artist, "was this: You are not important; only the fruit of your labor is important. It's what the whites have been saying to the blacks since the start of apartheid."
Sam Nhlengethwa said: "People ask, 'How can you do such happy pieces out of the township?' In the townships, it's not just war. We have music, weddings, parties, even though people are dying in the next street. I try for a ratio in my art that reflects the reality: 30 percent violent pictures and 70 percent happy festive gatherings. The other day I woke up and walked out my door and almost fell over a corpse. But I went out as I was planning anyway. That's how my life is balanced."
Tyrone Appolis, a colored (mixed race) artist working in Cape Town, has a wonderful clarity of delivery and amazing egotistical panache, though his work flashes between inspiration and rubbish. "I am the prodigal son of the arts," he said to me, "with a hire-purchase degree in streetology. The biggest radicals tell their story through art. The world is lucky that Beethoven and Bob Marley weren't terrorists, because if they'd expressed themselves violently they would have blown up the world. The world is lucky with me, too, that I'm not a terrorist."
Teach all the terrorists to make art, educate them, and perhaps the township violence -- to so large an extent the outgrowth of people's inability to communicate -- would begin to wane. It's an idea of art pretty far from the installation work of the white Bag Factory artists.
I WENT TO THE COLORED CAPE TOWN township of Mitchell's Plain with Willie Bester, perhaps the most highly regarded urban black artist in South Africa at the moment. His work is powerful collage/assemblage pieces that juxtapose found materials from the township with painted images. One work has bits of barbed wire, a copy of the Government book categorizing the various races, snapshots of a racist attack that, according to official documents, never took place and a police officer's ammunition belt.
The whole colored population faces the most difficult situation right now, with neither the privilege of the whites nor the self-actualization of the black Africans, and many are trying to hold onto that slight privilege they enjoyed in the apartheid period. They have too much to turn destructive (like the black Africans) and too little to live well (like the whites). It's an incredibly confused population, fearful in two directions rather than one. "Mitchell's Complain," Bester's wife, Evelyn, jokingly called the township, which they would soon leave for a once whites-only neighborhood.
"When I was younger," Willie Bester said at one point, "I made art to please the white man, pretty things for them to hang in their houses. Now I am working for myself, doing work about the problems of the townships."
Well, it's complicated. Bester is working for himself, but most of his collectors are white. They are liberals who buy his work because it is good, but also because it helps alleviate their sense of responsibility. It's a sort of mea culpa activity. In the current climate, work by black artists in which they express their suffering is what white collectors want; you cannot please them with pictures of the Cape landscape.
There are only three really important galleries in South Africa, all white-owned with almost exclusively white clients, showing a lot of black work: The Goodman Gallery (oldest; the flagship), Everard Read Contemporary (hottest, newest, trendiest), and The Newtown Gallery (a bit unfocused just now). How is the nonwhite population to redress this monopoly of control?
Eighteen months ago Matsamelo Manaca declared his Soweto home a gallery. When I visited, I found his crew patiently explaining to visitors what art is; the visitors, though curious, were there more for the strangeness of the event than to understand the messages of the work. Linos Siwedi has set up shop as a dealer, but though he used to sell from Soweto he is now working through Johannesburg, because the blacks won't buy and the whites won't come in. He's a middleman, keeping track of what happens in the townships, getting the work into the public eye, setting up exhibitions in rented spaces. He even sets up private art tours of the township for rich visitors.
All of these people have trouble with the black artists who are not of the townships, who have moved out and have indulged in the concomitant intellectual metamorphosis. The wonderful painter Tony Nkotsi, for example, could easily show at galleries in New York or Cologne.
"It might as well be white art," I heard. Or else, "He'll go the same way as Helen" -- a reference to the painter Helen Sebidi, whose rather beautiful work has become terribly repetitive, in part, perhaps, because of the galaxy of prizes she's won from the white establishment. Both sides say her ability to integrate has incapacitated her. Everyone hates the patronizing phrase "township art," but urban black art in South Africa is defined -- by blacks and whites -- by its relationship to the isolating circumstances of black life under apartheid. It will take a long time for the work to shed the limitations this context has created; it will be impossible to shed them without losing much of the singular power that accompanies them.
 
White Liberals (And Others)
Apartheid fell largely because of economic realities, but the white liberals provided whatever white moral impetus there was in the transformations; and if some of them are hypocritical or simply lost, that is no reason to throw them out altogether. These days many people, striving to be neither exploitative nor patronizing, are almost as embarrassed by the label "liberal" as by the label "racist," and that is a shame; the liberals, though they may hate their moniker, are an impressive lot. Some of them negotiate that liberalism successfully in art; others divorce it from their production. "I live to help the struggle," said the very fine painter Andrew Verster, "but I paint what I like."
THAT SAID, THERE is no question that the inclusive policies of liberals have often been extreme and misguided. Robert Hodgins, the elder statesman of South African art, says, "We are now afflicted with a mingling of condescension and panic that has created a terrible Bantuphilia, which is in turn producing enormous publicity for a lot of very bad artists."
Wane Barker submitted a work in 1990 to a drawing competition under the pseudonym Andrew Moletsi, and it achieved some renown. He suggested that all white artists should work in this way to break down the existing barriers. Beezy Bailey took him at his word. Bailey's hyper-expressive, loosely conceptual, pink-and-orange-and-green work had some measure of success but never entered into the top echelon of the South African art debate. In 1991 he submitted work to the prestigious Cape Town Triennial. One piece went in as the work of Beezy Bailey, and three others he submitted as the work of Joyce Ntobe, a domestic worker. No one paid much attention to the Bailey work, but Ntobe was at once discovered, and her work was purchased by the South African National Gallery. It is the view of Bailey and other anti-liberal artists that the habit of buying black work because it is black does more in the long run to erode than to increase black self-esteem. The white liberal community was outraged at Bailey's ploy, but many black artists applauded his courage.
Throughout the 80's, the cultural boycott, set up by the ANC in exile and enforced by the United Nations, served to undermine the apartheid government's appearance of legitimacy. Under its terms, foreign artists, athletes and academicians were asked not to come to South Africa, and South Africans not to exhibit or compete abroad. Given the control the Nationalist Party maintained, this meant South African art and sports were cut off from the rest of the world. The cultural boycott helped speed the demise of apartheid, but the devastating effects of that isolation are inestimable.
"And yet the cultural boycott helped to cut the umbilical cord to the U.S. and Europe," Marilyn Martin says. "Of course, the boycott was cutting off our own noses at one level," says Sue Williamson. "But it did have the unsought positive effect of increasing our sense of South Africanness."
Black artists were already quite isolated, but the boycott shaped the work of several extraordinary white artists. Williamson, William Kent ridge, Penelope Siopis, Andries Botha and Malcolm Payne are the most impressive of the established generation of white artists.
Williamson does sophisticated work in which she confronts problematic local history: for her Biennale piece, for example, she took scraps from District 6 (a rich and diverse colored area that was destroyed because it was too good for a nonwhite population), encased them in Lucite and used these bricks to build a small house, a testimony to what was lost.
William Kentridge's work is poetic, lucid and eloquent, fully engaged with the situation of South Africa, but refreshingly free of the political self-consciousness that circumscribes the work of many others. Kentridge is currently producing a series of drawings that make up films (or films that require drawings). In the latest film, a complex dialogue between a white man and a black woman takes place in symbolic terms as they watch from their separate perspectives the creation of the landscape of the East Rand, an area east of Johannesburg that has been the site of extreme violence. Figures appear, are shot or killed and covered with newspapers, and then turn into hills or pools of water so that they become the stuff of which the landscape is made, so that this bleak terrain, so familiar to all South Africans, comes to be not simply a geological phenomenon, but the physical manifestation of an accrual of deaths. "My work has many polemics and no message; it is not to inspire people to save the country," he said.
Siopis's mesmerizing paintings and collage/assemblage pieces often address women's history and experience and the integrity of the female body. They are strangely overcrowded, full of faces and bodies pressed close together; the power of her work lies in its hidden quality of empathy as much as in its technical achievement and sophisticated intellectual base. She is both a rigorous thinker and the most humane artist in South Africa.
Andries Botha's sculptural constructions often express European ideas with African techniques. Many are put off by his manner of almost obscene intensity; but in fact, like many Afrikaners, though he is inept at the rhetoric of liberalism, he is adored by the blacks who have worked with him, and his work radiates conviction.
There is a thriving young crowd of non-liberals in Cape Town that forms a parallel group to the white Bag Factory artists in Johannesburg. This grouping includes Barend de Wet, Kate Gottkins and Beezy Bailey. Standing at a distance from them is Jane Alexander, whose large-scale models of displaced or homeless black men, built in plaster and then dressed in scrap clothing, are eerie, desolate and compellingly human.
"In the new South Africa, white artists will have to move into the background as part of affirmative action," Alexander commented, wistfully but not sadly. "It's inevitable that my work will go down to the storerooms, even if to you it looks sympathetic to black causes." What of the balance so many other artists were representing in their work? "A large part of the white population is trying to redress the inequalities as quickly as possible," she said, "because they want to get it over with."
 
Learning Curves
In South Africa there is no tradition, in either the black or white communities, of going to look at pictures. Art's audience is limited to its producers, but that number is not small because in the new South Africa, everyone is being encouraged to make art. In the country, rural outreach programs teach provincial men and women to work through their problems by expressing themselves artistically. Within the townships, there is a powerful influence exerted by the so-called art centers. These places, mostly set up under apartheid, provide a venue for township residents to make art and music, to dance. They keep people off the streets, teach them a cottage industry, let them discover themselves and their talents.
Throughout the apartheid period, art centers served a second function. It was, of course, illegal to organize political rallies or meetings in the townships, but it was not illegal to organize cultural evenings, and so the various political factions would organize arts events as a cover for their activities.
The Alex Art Center, at the edge of the Johannesburg township of Alexandra, was once funded by money from idealists abroad. But financing disappeared when Mandela was freed. No one at the center knew how to run it, so it's now virtually a shell. Katlehong is one of the most dangerous townships, and it is curiously moving to hear the real toughs at the Katlehong Art Center, scary guys with big guns, extolling the sense of peace they have when they are weaving, printmaking, carving and drawing. The sales they realize through the Center's gallery, outside the township, give them precious social freedom. The African Art Center, in Durban, provides similar focus to a less troubled area, while Jonathan Comerford's Hard Ground Print Studio in Cape Town draws in artists of every race and description. Comerford sets them up with high-grade printmaking equipment and helps them create salable work. "People weren't held accountable in the art centers and milked everything to death," he said. "I hold the artists here answerable so that they can run their own lives. I don't want to set up a system where they'll fall apart if something happens to me." Such views are fast replacing the liberal tendency toward paternalism.
But what stands as paternalism falls? There are now black and white students at the big universities. Before the mid-1970's there had been black art activity only at the Polly Street Center, and at the Swedish mission art school at Rorke's Drift. Bill Ainslie's Johannesburg Art Foundation is still the only fully integrated school of its kind; he set it up ten years ago as a teaching facility where black and white artists could mix, and today they mix there more equally than ever. In 1985 Ainslie, with David Koloane, also set up the Tupelo Workshops, where an artistic dialogue was established.
There are two independent art schools for blacks: Fuba, in Johannesburg, and Funda, in Soweto. "We get letters," Sydney Selepe, who runs Funda, told me, "from mothers who say, 'My son has failed at school, so please make him an artist.' " Charles Nkosi described trying to judge candidates who had never drawn anything except in school science classes. Though some students are very sophisticated, others arrive without ever having been to a gallery. "We ask about their dreams," Sidney Selepe explained. "In this way, we move forward."
 
A Joint Exhibition
I found myself, one rather cold night, in a small house in Johannesburg with a black artist named Paul Sekete. I had been asking him about exhibitions, shows, internationalism. "I think art should make people happy, not just show them what it's like to be happy," he said. "I want to make people happy. That's what we need from art." It was very late, and we were both tired.
"Can you make people happy?" I asked. Sekete reached out one hand and began to tickle me, and I started to laugh. "You see how easy it is?" he asked. We had been talking about a white conceptualist we both knew. "That stuff -- it's O.K., but it isn't art," he said. "Such a waste of time. Why do they keep doing it?"
A few days later, I saw the white artist -- and his excellent work -- and described my evening with Sekete. I got as far as recounting being tickled, and he interrupted me. "But that isn't art," he said irritably. "I thought you were here to write about the damned art scene, not to do more P.C. quasi-political reporting. If some guy tickled you in New York, would you write it up for an art magazine?"
It should be noted that each of them had given me an invitation to an exhibition where their work was being shown together, and had used that invitation to demonstrate the point, close to both their hearts, that the art world had no racial differences, that it was now united, that there was now a center in which all were the same.
But the fact that they were showing together did not mean that they wanted the same things out of art, any more than the fact that blacks and whites will be listed together in the population registers of the new South African Government means they will govern in commensurate ways or for reconcilable reasons. It's slow, frustrating progress from artistic tolerance to esthetic parity.

HEADLINE: ANDREW CUOMO

BYLINE: By Kevin Sack; Kevin Sack is chief of the Albany bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Stepping to the lectern in the ballroom of a Manhattan hotel, Andrew M. Cuomo begins to weave a metaphor as only a Cuomo can. He has just returned from Los Angeles, where he surveyed the destruction caused by the January earthquake, and now he is describing the scene to 800 listeners at a forum on homelessness.
Clearly he was stunned by the devastation, but as the Clinton Administration's homelessness czar he was struck even more by the Federal Government's lightning response. In a week's time, he says, emergency housing was found for 10,000 displaced victims. It has reinforced his cynicism about how little Washington has done to address a different kind of urban dislocation, one that occurred "not in one cloud of dust but unit by unit, brick by brick," with joblessness and deinstitutionalization and AIDS and crack and teen-age pregnancy all chipping slowly at the mortar. 
 "Look at that damage and tell me that there wasn't an earthquake, a silent earthquake perhaps, but just as insidious, just as violent and just as harmful," he says. "And this silent earthquake has not only torn buildings from their foundations but, with a power even greater it seems, has torn us one from another."
As he speaks, some listeners begin to whisper. "Sounds just like his father," one marvels to another. In fact, his voice has a higher pitch. But the undulating cadences, the elegance of language and, yes, the pedantic preachiness are eerily similar.
The reason that Government can respond to seismic earthquakes but not to social ones, Cuomo continues, has nothing to do with compassion fatigue, which some blame for a recent backlash against the homeless. Rather, it is that Americans have watched so many social programs fail over the years.
"It's not that the American people don't care," says Cuomo, who is 36 and an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "That's an insult to everything that the American people have been about. It's that they do care. And the problem is that they're afraid and they're frustrated that we're not making a difference.
"See, they know that in Los Angeles they can go in there and repair the freeways and they can rebuild the houses. But they're not sure that they can go into the South Bronx and restore all that has been lost over 20 years. And that has to be our challenge. We have to restore that hope."
To be a messenger of hope about homelessness in the Clinton Administration might seem a losing proposition. During the 1992 campaign, the issue did not fit neatly into Bill Clinton's plan to position himself as a New Democrat, and it does not often distract him from priorities like health care and welfare reform. But the low-profile issue of homelessness and the bureaucratic backwater of HUD suit Andrew Cuomo's purposes just fine. Riding the fame bestowed by his last name and that of his wife, Kerry, the 7th of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children, he has used his position to become the most prominent assistant secretary in Washington, a second-tier bureaucrat with top-tier star quality.
Born to politics, married to politics and congenitally ambitious, Cuomo's move from New York to Washington has given him a chance to make a break with his father for the first time in his life. After a varied career in which his successes were inevitably written off as a byproduct of his father's influence, Cuomo is ready to make his own mark.
"He's paid a price for his relationship with me," says Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for a fourth four-year term this year. "It's given him access and he's met people he might not have met, but I think it made it more difficult for him to carve out his own identity. The people who see him working in Washington are going to know that he's succeeding because he's Andrew."
The younger Cuomo tenses when asked to discuss the burdens and benefits of growing up as the Governor's eldest son and most trusted political adviser. As is his habit when placed on the defensive, he responds with a mixture of sarcasm and self-deprecation. "The greatest burden you carry being the son of Mario Cuomo," he begins, "is his nose. It was O.K. except for the constant child abuse and domestic violence. And, you know, when he used to wear those dresses late at night, I never understood that." Pressed for a serious response, he says, after a pause, "The older I get, the more people I meet, the more extraordinary I believe he is."
Cuomo is tall, with an athletic build, dark wavy hair, flaring nostrils and only a hint of the Governor's trademark baggy eyes. He and his wife, Kerry -- an earnest and attractive 34-year-old who directs a human rights foundation named for her father -- make a handsome couple. But both work too hard to spend much time on the Georgetown social circuit. A tongue-in-cheek ranking of Washington power couples by Time magazine last summer placed the Cuomos 12th: "Not much fun but great last names."
A THUD, CUOMO HAS staked a promising political career on his ability to institute a new Federal homelessness policy based on a concept he nurtured in New York as the founder of Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or HELP. It is the country's largest private provider of interim housing for the homeless. In essence, Cuomo believes that many of the homeless need more than homes; they also need an array of social services, from drug and alcohol treatment to mental health counseling and job training. In a report he wrote in 1992 as head of a homelessness commission for the Dinkins administration, Cuomo recommended that New York develop "a continuum of care" that would allow the homeless to progress gradually toward self-sufficiency. The commission proposed that the city stop expanding barrackslike shelters and invest instead in smaller transitional housing complexes. (The city is in the process of implementing elements of the plan.)
To criticism that his approach is paternalistic, Cuomo responds: "When it comes to homelessness, for too long we did not want to admit the truth, because to admit the truth could be seen as criticism of the subject, to blame the victim. But if you're putting a needle in your arm, yes, I'm going to try to influence your behavior. If you're sexually abusing your child, yes, I'm going to try to influence your behavior."
This year, as the chief author of a Federal homelessness report ordered by President Clinton, Cuomo put a new cover on his old ideas. Issued last month, the Federal plan vastly expands the traditional definition of homelessness to include not only those who live on the streets for long periods but also those who float in and out of homelessness because of sudden changes in health, employment or family circumstance. Although it was previously estimated that 600,000 Americans were homeless at any one time, Cuomo's report argues that seven million people were homeless at some point during the latter half of the 1980's and calls for major increases in HUD funds.
Conservatives reacted harshly, arguing that the expansion of the definition of homelessness is a tactic to justify more Government spending. "Guilty," Cuomo pleads. "I know this is not with the political wind. The political wind now is to bash the homeless. It's about getting them off the streets, getting them out of the parks, put them back into the mental institutions where they belong."
WHILE HE IS SCRUPULOUS ABOUT not overshadowing his boss, HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, Cuomo has managed to develop a constituency of his own at the White House. He helped sell Clinton on empowerment zones -- a $6 billion program that will try to lure businesses to the ghetto with a combination of tax incentives and new Federal spending on job training and social services. Cuomo's office now is assisting the White House in making politically sensitive selections of the cities that will receive the grants. Clinton has also appointed Cuomo to his welfare reform task force.
Cisneros and Cuomo have scored some early fiscal victories on the homelessness front. They won White House and Congressional approval for an increase in this year's homelessness budget, from $571 million to $823 million. For the next fiscal year, Clinton has proposed doubling spending to $1.6 billion. Both in the advocacy community and in the White House, Cuomo is credited with making the case for the increase.
"He's clearly seen as one of the stars of the Administration," says George Stephanopoulos, the President's senior policy adviser. "I think people here value him not only for his policy expertise but also for his ability to cut through the bureaucracy and for his political instincts."
CUOMO DID NOT ARRIVE in Washington with such a luminous reputation. Although he was highly regarded in New York for getting things done, he was also tagged as arrogant, inflexible and occasionally bullying. This is, after all, the same kid from Queens whose first political task, according to his father, was "putting my posters up and pulling the other guy's down."
Community activists and local politicians who opposed the location of his HELP projects often complained about his heavy-handedness. Many said they felt an implied threat that their opposition would be noted in Albany. Paul J. Feiner, a former Westchester County legislator who opposed the size of a HELP project, remembers being on the telephone around midnight when an operator broke in with an emergency call. It was Cuomo, calling to berate him on his position. Feiner recalls Cuomo in a subsequent conversation saying: "I'll ruin your career. I'll break every bone in your body."
Cuomo denies having made the midnight call or the threat. "It's sad that his mind would work in such a way," he says. "I think it's even ethnically disparaging."
In Washington, some advocates for the homeless, members of Congress and co-workers at HUD find Cuomo to be headstrong and resistant to outside opinion. But few are willing to take him on publicly. In one typical interview, a prominent homelessness lobbyist insisted on anonymity before saying he had been "amazed at the depth of the negative feelings" toward Cuomo. "He's considered arrogant, a guy who does his own thing, figures out what he wants and then makes it happen. He has keen political skills but wants to make sure Andrew looks good."
Nonetheless, the lobbyist doesn't discount Cuomo's effectiveness. "He's to be given a lot of credit for the increases in the homelessness budget. I think he's brought a face to the issue again." And top officials at HUD and the White House say Cuomo seems to have gone out of his way to compensate for his rough edges.
"You can almost see him giving political advice to himself," says one White House aide. "You can see this real dialogue with one side saying, 'I can do this all by myself,' and the other saying, 'No, you've got to be a team player.' "
Cisneros says that Cuomo "has really emerged as a very capable manager and a person who can be counted on" to handle HUD's most prominent issues. But, he adds, "Andrew sometimes works so hard to get things done that he ruffles feathers in the process."
Undoubtedly, part of Cuomo's appeal in Washington stems from his standing as the crown prince of Cuomolot. When he faced a Senate confirmation hearing last year along with three other assistant secretaries, it was Cuomo, not the others, who was invited to meet afterward with the chairman, Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan. And there was the night that Andrew and Kerry Cuomo, along with Tom Hanks, were invited to the White House for dinner and a screening of "Philadelphia." When a Wall Street Journal columnist wrote a flattering piece about Cuomo, Clinton dropped him a note of congratulations. Cuomo hung it on his office wall.
It is not every assistant secretary who can throw a cocktail party and attract Vice President Al Gore, Mack McLarty, David Gergen, George Stephanopoulos, Dee Dee Myers, Janet Reno, Robert Rubin, Robert Reich, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Carol Browner and Leon Panetta, as Andrew and Kerry Cuomo did last fall with a get-together to commemorate the empowerment zones legislation. Of course, it also is not every assistant secretary who can throw such a party at Hickory Hill, the 10-acre Kennedy estate in McLean, Va., where the Cuomos lived with Ethel Kennedy during their first year in Washington. As the guests nibbled on petits fours with the letters EZ spelled out in chocolate, Cuomo spoke about the father-in-law he never knew, portraying empowerment zones as a continuation of Robert Kennedy's war-on-poverty legacy.
Before meeting his future wife, Cuomo was not much of a Kennedy buff. Indeed, he helped his father lead the New York campaign for Jimmy Carter against her Uncle Ted in the 1980 Presidential primary. They met at a dinner party, fell quickly in love and were married on June 9, 1990 at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, where John F. Kennedy had been eulogized 27 years earlier.
The bachelor party, held at a Manhattan bar, included a goodly number of dashing young Kennedys, the Governor, Mayor Dinkins and an assortment of the political strategists, tabloid journalists and public relations men Cuomo had collected as friends. Donald Trump, in the throes of his own divorce, appeared on video to volunteer some marital advice: "Whatever you do, Andrew, don't ever, ever fool around."
While living at Hickory Hill, Cuomo apparently got along famously with his mother-in-law. The only friction was between his German shepherd, Cisco, and her Irish terrier, Rowser. One day, after a particularly nasty dogfight, Cuomo's secretary interrupted a meeting to tell him that Ethel Kennedy was on the phone. "She's at the veterinarian with Cisco and she's about to have him castrated," the secretary said. "She wants to know if you have any special instructions." Cisco was spared the knife and is no doubt relieved that his masters recently moved into a three-bedroom place of their own nearby.
LIKE BOBBY KENNEDY, WHO came to understand poverty on a visit to the Mississippi Delta, Cuomo had his epiphany with homelessness when he and his father toured New York City's bleak welfare hotels during the Governor's 1982 campaign. "The children were in a miserable condition," he recalls. "And it was all in our control. It wasn't a birth defect. It was something you could do something about."
After managing his father's campaign, Cuomo -- a graduate of Fordham University and Albany Law School -- served as a $1-a-year special assistant to the Governor. He left his father's administration to become a Manhattan prosecutor and then a corporate lawyer (his Jaguar bore the license plate AMC ESQ). But he soon attracted heavy press criticism for luring major clients who did substantial business with the state. When he founded HELP in 1986, his detractors said, it was because his rainmaking had become a liability for the Governor's re-election campaign that year, not to mention his own political prospects. Cuomo left his lucrative practice in 1988 to work fulltime at HELP.
There are now seven HELP transitional apartment complexes, most of them in the metropolitan New York area, housing nearly 4,000 people over a one-year period. Designed as way stations between the streets and permanent housing, they are usually less expensive to operate than welfare hotels. Residents spend between six and eight months receiving mandatory counseling and other social services. While there, they are assisted by HELP workers in finding homes of their own. About 95 percent of them remain self-sufficient, HELP officials say. That success rate is higher than might be expected, because HELP's clients -- almost exclusively families with children -- are generally very motivated to improve their lot.
On what his wife calls their "first date," Andrew Cuomo took her to East New York, one of the most devastated neighborhoods in Brooklyn, to see his first HELP housing complex. She remembers him constantly asking her how he could improve the place.
"It was striking to me that there was no sense of self-satisfaction," she says. "Mario gets incredible fulfillment out of study and literature and intellectual debate. Andrew gets fulfillment out of making things better. He leaves things better, faster, sleeker."
INDEED, IF MARIO IS A POET, Andrew is a mechanic. As a youngster, he repaired his mother's clothes dryer by taking it apart in the basement. He rebuilt cars and sold them for a profit. When his father began to run for office, Cuomo found that his mechanical skills transferred easily to politics and he became a master of polling, television buys and camera angles. When the Governor delivered his famous keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention, it was Andrew Cuomo who suggested introducing him with a film -- a device that dimmed the lights and quieted the crowd. At HELP, he used all the tools of campaigning -- direct mail, parades, photo ops with children -- to court the press and battle those who did not want his projects in their backyards.
At home and at HUD, Cuomo thrives on an almost militaristic devotion to strategy and detail. "Organization is like candy for Andrew, even his socks," says his brother Christopher, the youngest of the five Cuomo children. "He has plastic bins all over his house." Co-workers say that Cuomo starts each morning in the office by shining his black wing tips.
It is less clear now than it once was that Cuomo will follow his father into elective politics, although many friends do not rule out a race for mayor, governor or the United States Senate. Cuomo says he is content at HUD for the moment and has no burning desire to run.
"I could make a very good case that you can serve better without being in elective office," he says. "I don't have to do the fund raising. I don't have to do the campaigning. On the other hand, sometimes elective office can give you opportunities that appointed office doesn't."
And yet, for someone as action-oriented as Cuomo, the bureaucracy has its frustrations. "At HELP, there was a gratification in the obvious accomplishments," he says. "You worked for a year and then there was a building that wasn't there before. There also was a sense of enjoyment there because you dealt with people. This job in many ways is devoid of humanity. You don't see the people you serve."
But Cuomo believes that the Clinton Administration has a chance to make incremental progress and that small victories can help restore the public's faith that homelessness is a curable plague. "Once you prove that, you will see the pendulum swing very quickly, because there's a tremendous desire by the American people to believe that you can make a difference. They believe it is wrong to have homeless people on the street. You break that dam and you will drown in the political support that you have."

HEADLINE: BRAZIL'S EMEREGING NORTHEAST

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is head of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
FLYING three hours beyond the Caribbean, travelers from Miami cross the Equator and discover a parallel archipelago of beaches that is still largely unknown to North Americans -- a 2,000-mile arc of white sand, turquoise sea, coconut palms, tropical fruits, fresh seafood, historic monuments and a friendly, sensuous people.
This region, Brazil's Northeast, is such an overnight sensation among Europeans and Argentines that it is expected to displace Rio de Janeiro this year as Brazil's primary tourist destination. With weekly flights now linking Recife and Salvador with most major European capitals, the foreign tourist flow is expected to hit 1 million this year, up from 350,000 in 1992, according to a regional government tourism commission. 
 For American tourists who wrote off Brazil in the late 1980's because of street crime in Rio de Janeiro, those smaller cities offer a safer alternative. In fact, longtime Rio residents tend to let down their guard in the Northeast.
"I was so relaxed in the Northeast that I got mugged on my first day back in Rio," an American oil-company executive living in Rio said after a recent trip to Fortaleza, Maceio and Natal.
With tourism expected to be the Northeast's economic mainstay by the end of the decade, hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested to upgrade the region's hotels, resorts, marinas, sewage systems and roads. In a region where most coastal cities were founded before 1620, state governments are restoring the colonial centers of Sao Luis, Recife, Joao Pessoa and Salvador.
Since hotel investment has yet to catch up with demand, the best time to tour the region is during the eight-month off-season, from March to June and August to November. The off-season also offers fewer crowds and milder temperatures, generally in the 70's. In the afternoons, tropical downpours cut humidity and wash streets clean.
While some visitors may want to stay in one place, perhaps relaxing in a hammock strung between palm trees, others may want to hopscotch down Brazil's coast on the milk-run flights that link most of the region's eight coastal capitals, from Sao Luis in the north to Salvador in the south. In many visits to the Northeast over the last 18 years, I have developed two favorites: Fortaleza, a big beach city known for seafood and shopping, and Sao Luis, a delightful town for walking.
 
Fortaleza
For North Americans, the most convenient port of entry to Brazil's Northeast is Fortaleza -- a six-and-a-half-hour nonstop flight from Miami.
Throughout Brazil, Fortaleza is famous for its sunny skies -- typically a robin's-egg blue dotted with small cottony cloud tufts. Weather records show that this city averages 7.6 hours of daily sunshine year-round. Italians, the Old World's sun connoisseurs, are so impressed that they have started buying large numbers of vacation apartments here. Balmy weather is so consistent that one Argentine travel promoter recently offered free "sun insurance" for travelers to Fortaleza -- those who have two consecutive days of rain get their money back.
In a nation where social life revolves around sand, Brazilians flock to the Northeast for its beaches. The state of Ceara, of which Fortaleza is the capital, has 355 miles of beaches. In Fortaleza, a city of two million, only one urban beach, Praia do Futuro, is considered clean enough for swimming. So most visitors use Fortaleza as a base for shopping, sunbathing, dining and exploring beaches and other sites along the coast.
For the shopper, Fortaleza is now Brazil's second-largest fashion center after Rio. Hand-embroidered cotton lace -- blouses, placemats, tablecloths and bedspreads -- is a major attraction. A white linen and lace blouse can cost $25. A nine-foot-long lace tablecloth with 12 napkins costs $125. Combining clothes with culture, the Museu de Arte e Cultura Popular, a thick-walled former prison built in 1850, five blocks from the municipal theater (350 Avenida Senador Pompeu), holds a folk-art museum, a tourism information office and, in every cell, a boutique. In virtually every coastal capital of the Northeast, 18th- and 19th-century prisons have found new lives as handicrafts markets.
At dusk, lace and hammock vendors display their wares along Fortaleza's beach drive, Avenida Presidente Kennedy. The city's lowest prices can usually be found during the day at the Central Market on Rua General Benzeril. A brightly colored cotton hammock can be bought for $15. But because of their weight, the hammocks may best be bought at the end of a tour.
The distinctive and delightful food of Northeast Brazil features fresh fish or shrimp prepared according to styles that are an amalgam of African, Indian and Portuguese traditions. In Fortaleza, the best restaurants are away from the beach promenade with its heavy tourist traffic. A five-minute, $3 cab ride from Avenida Presidente Kennedy is Iracema Beach, a mildly bohemian ocean-front neighborhood. After dining on grilled oversized prawns and Chilean white wine on the flagstone terrace of Getty's (479 Rua dos Tabajaras), you may take a moonlight stroll along the promenade lined with cafes and dance clubs, usually hopping with forro, a locally popular accordion music.
On weekday afternoons a major attraction is to gather at Mucuripe Beach (about a 15-minute walk from Avenida Presidente Kennedy), where fishermen land their jangadas -- precarious rafts with triangular white cotton sails. Some of the day's catch ends up atop Mucuripe hill, a rocky outlook where about a dozen open-air restaurants and bars offer harbor views, ocean breezes and spectacular sunsets. At Tudo em Cima (107 Rua do Mirante), I started with cold beer and breaded crab claws, and then moved on to peixe na telha, a traditional dish of fish cooked and served on an orange roofing tile.
There is a good choice of hotels in Fortaleza, including the Caesar Park, the most elegant hotel I have found in the Northeast. An ocean-front high-rise that opened in 1993, the hotel has a decor that draws on local handicrafts and a restaurant that features the catch of the day. But with 3,000 hotel rooms, Fortaleza has hotels to match any budget.
Roaming 20 miles north of Fortaleza, travelers will encounter Cumbuco Beach. Here bathers can rent boards to surf down sand dunes or buggies to tour them (about $10 an hour with driver). About 15 miles farther north, in the fishing village of Pecem, is Taiba, another beach of huge dunes where visitors can explore rock grottoes at low tide. For the truly enterprising, an eight-hour, 177-mile bus ride will take visitors to Jericoacoara, a beach famous in Brazil for its wind-swept dunes and its wilderness atmosphere.
Road access to the southern beaches is easier. Fifteen miles from downtown beach hotels is Beach Park, modeled after a North American water park; it offers slides, fountains, swimming pools and access to a clean stretch of beach.
Good places for overnight trips are Morro Branco (50 miles), where dunes are tinted red, yellow, black and gray, and Canoa Quebrada (90 miles), a 10-mile stetch of reddish dunes and turquoise sea that has changed little since backpackers intruded on this pastoral fief of Potangi Indians in the 1970's.
 
Sao Luis
A 75-minute flight west of Fortaleza takes visitors to Sao Luis, a quiet city, well off the Northeast tourist track. Founded in 1612 by the French as St. Louis, this charming seaport of 700,000 people now bears the indelible stamp of 18th-century Portugal.
In the 18th century, Sao Luis rode a cotton and sugar boom to become the fourth-largest city in Portugal's far-flung empire. But the tides of commerce shifted elsewhere, leaving behind one of Latin America's most beguiling collections of colonial architecture.
In one of Brazil's largest historic preservation projects, architects have restored 250 buildings in the historic center, known as Reviver. Cars are banned from cobblestone streets. The crowns of mango trees graze the aged orange roofing tiles of colonial town houses. Preserved by strict height limitations, the Sao Luis skyline is still dominated by church towers. In Reviver, the soft glow of turn-of-the-century gas lamps lights facades sheathed in blue and white Portuguese tiles. Familiar to Brazilians as a stage set for soap operas and movies, the streets of Reviver are filled every evening with musicians playing reggae, folklore groups presenting Afro-Indian dances, and young people gathering at art exhibitions and theater presentations at the Odilo Costa arts center. The Teatro Arthur Azevedo (180 Rua do Sol), Brazil's second-oldest, was built in 1817 by merchants who copied its cylindrical lines from late-18th-century Italian opera houses. Its director, Fernando Bicudo, who reopened the theater in December after an $8 million restoration, wants to make it the center of a regional theater based on the Northeast's folklore.
The theater and other turn-of-the-century opera palaces dotted along the Northeast coast are points of civic pride and well worth visiting, for their architecture and for their concerts of Brazilian music. Fortaleza's Teatro Jose de Alencar, a 1910 Art Nouveau opera house reopened in 1991 after a $12 million restoration. Salvador's Teatro Castro Alves, a modern, 1958 building, reopened last year after a $10 million renovation.
WITH one of Brazil's largest black populations, Sao Luis also offers one of the nation's few museums dedicated to black history and culture, the Museu do Negro. In a former slave-market building, the museum displays implements from the slavery era and photographs and drums from Maranhao State's Afro-Brazilian religion, Tambor de Mina. Throughout this city, family-run restaurants called bases specialize in seafood -- shrimp pie, shrimp stew, and arroz-de-cuxa, a local dish concocted of rice, dried shrimp, sesame seed and vinegar . My favorite is Base da Lenoca, (181 Avenida Pedro II), which offers beautiful views of the city's bridges and the Palacio dos Leoes, the state governor's palace, an imposing neo-classical structure completed in 1776.
Between the palace and the cathedral is the Hotel Vila Rica, which blends into its historic surroundings and is near the old town. The city's major resort hotel is the Sofitel Quatro Rodas, which has a pool adjacent to the town's chic beach, Calhau.
A converted 19th-century textile factory, Ceprama, has found a second life as a light and airy handicrafts center. I bought colorful children's puppets made of cotton cloth and papier-mache for $3.50 apiece. For $8, the restaurant offered a plate of sururu fish and rice, washed down with juice freshly squeezed from a tropical fruit, cupuacu.
Beyond two clean and wide beaches, Calhau and Olho d'Agua, Sao Luis offers visitors two side trips, one to Alcantara, a Baroque 18th-century ghost town, the other to Barreirinhas and its vast park.
Alcantara lies 14 miles across Sao Marcos Bay from Sao Luis, an $8 one-way, one-hour ferry ride. A national historic monument, Alcantara evokes memories of lost fortunes and passing vanities. Town houses of a forgotten rural aristocracy line the cobblestone streets. Alcantara fell into decline after cotton prices collapsed and slavery was abolished in 1888. Today, three colonial houses are now inns, with restaurants serving reliable food. The Pousada do Mordomo Regio on the Rua Grande features a view of Sao Luis from its restaurant balcony.
For the more energetic, Barreirinhas, 230 miles east of Sao Luis is the gateway village to Lencois National Park, the largest park in the Northeast. This 600-square-mile reserve contains a hypnotizing landscape of beaches, rain-water lagoons and sand dunes.
Leaving the Northeast, many Americans carry home the sense that they are pioneers, exploring a new, untrammeled Caribbean. But, largely forgotten by time, an earlier generation of Americans laid the concrete foundations for today's tourism boom. During World War II, the United States Army Corps of Engineers modernized virtually all the airfields of Brazil's northeastern bulge -- Belem, Sao Luis, Fortaleza, Natal, Recife, Maceio and Salvador. Now international airports, several fields still retain a landscaping signature left by the Army Corps -- stands of bamboo planted by an access road to form a verdant, welcoming arch.
 
 
 
SUNNY SKIES AND RELAXED STYLE IN A REGION OF COASTAL COLONIAL CITIES
Getting There
 Varig has flights on Wednesdays from Miami to Fortaleza (the current lowest round-trip fare is $934) and on to Recife. Starting April 3, VASP will fly nonstop from Miami to Recife on Sundays.
Given Brazil's expensive domestic air fares, the best way to explore the Northeast is to buy a Brazil Air Pass before leaving the United States. Sold only outside of Brazil to foreigners, the pass entitles the holder to visit five cities on one airline during a 21-day period for $440. By contrast, the round-trip "economy" fare for Varig's two-hour flight between Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro is $881.
 
Guidebooks
 American guidebooks have been slow to catch up with the Northeast's travel boom. One exception is "Fielding's Brazil" (Morrow) by Pamela Bloom ($15). This guide, published last year, contains a detailed, 125-page section on the Northeast.
At the Fortaleza airport, don't let the taxi drivers rush you off before visiting the bookstore and state tourism office (Coditur). Two resources for Northeast tourism, both by the Quatro Rodas publishing group, are sold at the bookstore: "Guia de Praias," or "Beach Guide," ($11) contains satellite photos with annotations of Brazil's 5,000-mile-long Atlantic coastline. "Guia Brasil" ($15) is crammed with telephone numbers, hotel prices and restaurant addresses, and it has English-language keys to the international system of symbols.
The store also sells the pocket-sized version of the "Panrotas" guide ($4), which contains the latest domestic air schedules and can be a great help in flight planning.
 
Precautions
 Despite the relaxed nature of Brazil's Northeast, visitors should remember that they are in a poor nation plagued by vast disparities in income. To avoid thefts, valuables should not be displayed in public; leave them locked in a hotel room or safe.
Usually, a photocopy of your passport and a minimal amount of cash is all that a visitor will need to get around town or to the beach.
Cholera is present throughout Brazil's Northeast (as it is in Rio and elsewhere). Although no tourists are known to have had the disease, it is important to follow standard hygiene precautions for travel in underdeveloped countries: drink bottled water, wash your hands before eating, and avoid eating food sold in markets or by street vendors.

HEADLINE: Light Bulbs

 BODY:
To the Editor: As a dedicated reader-in-bed, I confirm Robert Packard's observation in "Reading in Bed: Europe Takes a Dim View" (Feb. 13) that European hotels in "some countries have refined their ways to torment readers."
My most notable success occurred under inauspicious circumstances, at the height of the cold war, when my wife, daughter and I ventured to travel "independently" into Leningrad (now again St. Petersburg) under the rigid control of the all-powerful Intourist. 
 We were assigned to the Hotel Astoria, which was so famous as the leading luxury hotel that Hitler scheduled his "victory banquet" there while awaiting the collapse of the city.
My daughter had a separate room, while my wife and I were given a luxurious high-ceilinged suite with a foyer, sitting room, bedroom with double bed, and bathroom with heated towel bars. Each of the four rooms had a ceiling fixture operated by a wall switch. In the sitting room, it was an elaborate chandelier. One lamp, which did not light, offered the only chance for reading in bed, so I dashed into the hall, where an imposing Russian hall monitor, whose responsibility it was to extract our room key from us whenever we ventured out, sat at an impressive desk. I managed to convey my need, whereupon she informed me in firm tones: "Tuesday is not the day for light bulbs."
After examining my options, I lifted one of the chairs onto the elegant sitting room table, and, while my wife steadied this edifice, climbed up to extract a light bulb from the chandelier. I inserted it into the lamp, and managed to provide a reading light, albeit a bit dim.
This and other misadventures under Intourist were among the many signals that the managed economy of the Soviet system would eventually collapse.

HEADLINE: Toting Up the Costs

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
THE cost of renovation varies within even the simplest category -- for example, skim coating a new wall with plaster and then painting it can triple the cost of just painting it; four-panel solid wood doors are at least twice as much as hollow-core doors.
Doing advance research so you can tell the contractor or craftsperson exactly what you want saves time, money and aggravation. 
 Following is a list of average costs for some common renovation tasks:
Refinishing old plaster walls having small cracks: With "skim coating" (covering the walls with a thin coat of new plaster), figure about $1,000 to $1,500 for an average size bedroom (200 square feet). This does not include painting, which can range from $750 to $1,500, depending on the painter. The cost rises if ceilings are so high that the painters need scaffolding.
Refinishing drab oak strip floors: About $2 per square foot.
Building in a wall of closets: If the apartment or house was built before World War II there is probably a dearth of closets. Often the best way is to dedicate an end wall in a bedroom, and run closets across the expanse. For a 12-foot wall of closets, using three solid wood doors, sheet rock and a plaster skim coat and installing closet poles, an overhead hat shelf and a bare light bulb, the cost can range from $3,000 to $4,000 -- and a great deal more for custom doors and elaborate fittings.
Installing new bathroom fixtures: For good quality white fixtures -- a standard height two-piece toilet, a pedestal sink and a five-foot cast-iron tub with chrome "economy" fixtures -- the total cost is $775. Fees for a licensed plumber vary, but expect to pay at least $1,000 to switch over, and don't forget to have the plumber figure in the cost of removing and disposing of the old fixtures.
Installing new kitchen cabinets: For a 10-foot wall of upper and lower cabinets, the price ranges from $600 for the cheapest white formica veneered chip board to $10,000 or more for custom bleached oak. Countertops can run from $7 a running foot 24 inches deep (for white laminate) to $110 a running foot of 3/4 inch, square-edged polished burgundy granite, not counting sink cutouts, backsplash or installation.
It's always wise for co-op or condominium residents to inquire whether board approval is necessary. At least in New York City, no building permit is required to replaster walls or paint or to replace existing bathroom fixtures or existing kitchen cabinets. But a building permit is necessary to construct a wall of closets -- and a separate permit is needed to install a light in the closet, according to a spokesman for the Buildings Department.

A NEW housing team taking shape at the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development is setting out to establish a different voice for housing policy.
But while the voice is different, the singers are using a familiar score. The effort to unburden itself of the thousands of units of formerly privately owned housing taken over through tax foreclosure has been the overriding task of the housing agency for 16 years. 
 In 1978 New York City speeded the takeover process and gave the housing agency the job of managing and disposing of foreclosed residential property. The city also abandoned the auction method of disposition, which was leading to reforeclosures -- in effect, revolving-door housing abandonment. Alternative methods were adopted, but they are much slower and more expensive.
Now Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has made divestiture the explicit primary goal of housing policy. Under Mayor David N. Dinkins -- at least until the final year of his administration -- the emphasis was on finishing the rehabilitation of vacant buildings and reselling occupied properties to nonprofits or tenant and community groups, which were given a "right of first refusal" before buildings could be offered to private owners.
"Mayor Giuliani's core philosophy is to put properties into the hands of the local entrepreneurs as opposed to central management," said Deborah C. Wright, the newly appointed Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development. "We want to target neighborhoods, to focus on what it takes to stabilize a whole block. No rational owner wants to take on just three or four of our exisiting occupied buildings."
The second priority is to step up efforts to help owners keep buildings from falling into tax foreclosure. "If we keep getting buildings in, we are going nowhere, even if we keep selling," Ms. Wright said.
As for new housing, she said: "New construction of mixed-income rentals are a question mark. There may not be the money there in the future to do it." Housing officials in the Dinkins administration proposed new rentals -- with an income limit for tenants of about $60,000 a year -- to balance the upsurge in low-income rentals as foreclosed housing is rehabilitated.
Since 1986, when Mayor Edward I. Koch launched a $5.1 billion, 10-year housing program, city government has made great progress in recycling most of the fully vacant properties, and many occupied buildings. But there remain about 4,000 occupied city-owned buildings, three-quarters of them, with about 30,000 apartments, under central city management. Most are in Harlem, East Harlem and the South Bronx, and in the Brownsville and East New York sections of Brooklyn.
Figures from the housing agency show that that there were almost as many foreclosed housing units under city management in 1993 as there were in 1983. The figures are 32,078 last June 30 compared with 31,756 10 years earlier. But the number has dropped since its high-water market of 39,600 in 1986.
THE city spends about $200 million a year to manage current inventory. Rent covers about a quarter of the total and most of the rest comes from Federal community-development block grants, probably making New York the only city in the country that uses its grants basically for management rather than rehabilitation or development.
The average household income in centrally managed buildings is only $6,500 a year. The average rent is $216 a month. Merely to operate buildings at a minimal level -- with no mortgage debt or taxes -- costs about $450 per two-bedroom apartment per month, housing officials say. Accordingly, even after the buildings have been rehabilitated at city expense, a rent or operating subsidy must be provided to the new owner.
Commissioner Wright has named William E. Spiller as First Deputy Commissioner of the housing agency. In the Dinkins administration he was deputy commissioner of the Office of Property Management, which manages foreclosed property. One of its branches, the Division of Alternative Management, supervises buildings put under temporary management by nonprofit, community or tenant groups as a preliminary to sale to them.
Under Mayor Koch, private owners also participated in the alternative management system, and ultimately acquired ownership of occupied buildings. That program -- known by the acronym POMP, for Private Ownership Management Program -- was halted by the Dinkins administration in its early days in response to objections by housing-advocacy groups to private ownership of low-income housing. Ending it probably slowed the pace of divestiture significantly.
In its latter days the Dinkins administration announced a new effort sell centrally managed buildings, initially saying that private owners would be invited to participate. But housing officials say nonprofit organizations were given first choice of buildings, a procedure that would no doubt have slowed the pace of rehabilitation once again.
Planning now to encourage private involvement, the new administration has restored $60 million that the Dinkins administration had planned to slice from the four-year budget for divestiture. Without private-sector sales, it is questionable whether that money would have been spent.
"Although the workload has dropped slowly, every year we get new units in, averaging about 3,000 a year while we're selling about 4,000," said Commissioner Spiller.
In the new sales effort, he said, builders will be allocated low-income tax credits that can be sold to investors as a means of raising equity for the purchase. Rents will be held to levels affordable to tenants. The four-year goal is 9,400 units.
Success depends in large part upon whether the city can put together large enough "packages" of nearby properties that as an entirety become economic to manage after rehabilitation, said Michael Schmelzer, president of Triax Realty Management, in Great Neck, L.I., which participated in the private ownership program and works as contractor for community groups as well. "They're right to try to get management out of city hands," he said.
Commissioner Wright said that "active assistance" to owners to slow foreclosures would include help in dealing with regulatory issues involving city agencies and an effort to establish an early warning system for buildings in trouble. "Right now we only catch them with the 7A program," she said, referring to court administration of buildings when judges take properties out of owners' hands because of poor building conditions.
ON other issues, Ms. Wright said she expected the Federal Government to take up the financing slack as the housing agency cuts back in funding for gut-rehabilitated housing with social-services assistance as permanent housing for dependent single adults.
This effort on behalf of homeless singles has been funded by the housing agency under the S.R.O. loan program. Housing officials have long contended that it is essentially a social-services program. The city has been supplying low-cost acquisition and construction financing, but it is expecting the Federal Government, in its new emphasis on financing programs for the homeless, to take up the slack.
"The Feds will double the funding for S.R.O.'s," Ms. Wright said.
Another city effort involving multifamily buildings is called the participation loan program, which supplements private mortgage loans with low-interest public loans to upgrade occupied, privately owned buildings. The financing will be held steady at $20 million a year, Commissioner Wright said.
And the financing for each of two new-homes programs -- one run by the New York Housing Partnership, a nonprofit intermediary working with private builders, and the other through churches in the Bronx and Brooklyn under the Nehemiah Plan -- also will remain steady.
The funding pace for two other large-scale housing production programs that advanced in the Dinkins administration -- Bradhurst in Harlem and Saratoga Square in Brooklyn, encompassing parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville, are to be slowed. But a new-construction mixed-income rental program that the Dinkins administration had considered putting in motion in for moderate-income neighborhoods "may not be there in the future," Ms. Wright said.
Funding for vacant-building renovations by community development corporations, working through the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, or LISC, is to be phased out entirely after 1995, Ms. Wright said, when the vacant buildings already in the pipeline are finished. Both LISC and the Enterprise Foundation are likely to participate in rehabilitations of centrally managed buildings.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Provident Loan Society;
High-Class Pawn Shops With Redeeming Qualities

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THERE are lots of trademark buildings that unify New York -- the limestone Carnegie Libraries, the Robert Moses park structures of the 1930's, the red-brick firehouses of the 1880's.
Another group, the gem-like branches of the Provident Loan Society, used to dot New York City neighborhoods but have been dwindling for the last 30 years. Now another one, the tiny branch at 153 East 60th Street, has closed but will not vanish entirely as an architect/restaurateur transforms it into a palace of Indian food. 
 Philanthropists who sought to provide an alternative to private pawn shops for people of modest means established the Provident Loan Society in 1894. A board of prominent New Yorkers raised $100,000 to capitalize the organization, which first operated out of the United Charities Building at 22d Street and what is now Park Avenue South.
Provident lent its initial capital in the first four months to applicants who, upon the pledge of jewelry, silver or other valuables, could receive instant cash at interest rates less than those commercial pawnbrokers charged. Some applicants were in sudden financial distress, but others were small tradesmen who would pawn a watch at the beginning of a week and take it back at the end of the week when receipts came in. It was all the same to Provident, which considered such business loans to be part of its public service.
Applicants could be sure that Provident would make every effort to help them reclaim their pledge, not sell it off in a rigged auction for the pawnbroker's windfall.
Although its main office, at the northwest corner of 25th Street and Park Avenue South, has the elegant air of a private bank, the early branch offices all affected a civic sense -- the defunct branches at East Houston and Essex Streets and at Lexington Avenue and 124th Street are equal parts small-town library and neighborhood bank.
By 1929 Provident had $44 million outstanding on 500,000 loans and 14 branches scattered over all the boroughs except Staten Island. Most of the buildings were designed by a firm founded in the mid-19th century by James Renwick and continued by his successors under various names. In 1930 Renwick, Aspinwall & Guard filed plans for the 15th branch office, at 153 East 60th Street.
By this time the prim classicism of the branches of the 1910's had been superseded by a clean-cut Art Deco. For this busy street, across from Bloomingdale's loading dock, the architects designed a restrained, one-bay, one-story building with a high, open room.
Inside, a large arched ceiling runs the length of the tunnel-like space, which had the usual banker's touches: marble wainscotting, bronze and glass teller's cages, thick glass writing counters and a vault at one end.
You'd never know you were in a hock shop, and that's just the way Provident -- always very concerned about the dignity of its customers -- wanted it. The New York Times reported that the typical loan at the time was $30 to $90.
The closings began in the 1960's and by 1990, when the 60th Street branch closed, there were only six, reduced by credit cards, extended bank lending and, generally, a more relaxed attitude about money in society.
NOW James P. Keville, executive vice president of Provident, says there is only $13 million in 40,000 outstanding loans, and the typical Provident branch is a quiet place where employees outnumber the customers.
Provident still has some of its older branches, but more of them either survive in other uses or have vanished altogether. The West Side branch at 159 West 72d Street was gutted in 1972 and is now a Janovic paint store.
The 60th Street building will not disappear, at least not entirely. Mohindra N. Kawlra, an architect, bought the building from Provident in December. With several partners, he will open an Indian restaurant in the space in August and is keeping much, but not all, of the old building. On the exterior he will break out the central window down to the ground and fill in the Provident Loan inscription, but otherwise keep the facade.
Inside, he is covering the Caen stone panels with mirrors and murals of the contributions of India to the world, with panels on spices, mathematics, plastic surgery, the Kama Sutra and other topics.
The old vault will be used as a wine bar. He bubbles with enthusiasm for the little building, and runs his hands appreciatively over bronze fittings and inch-thick glass.
With delight he ripped out a dropped ceiling installed by Provident in the 60's, exposing the original arched ceiling, stained-glass windows and other details lost for a generation.
"I saw a gold mine up there," he says. "We wouldn't find this anywhere else."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/1515 Broadway;
A Reversal of Fortune for a Once-Bankrupt Building

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
SOMETIMES, things work out exactly as planned. Sometimes, unforseen circumstances wreak havoc with everything. And sometimes, just sometimes, decisions are based on assumptions that turn out to be wrong -- and things work out right anyway.
That's a good synopsis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society's odyssey with 1515 Broadway, the 54-story building between 44th and 45th Streets officially known as One Astor Plaza. Equitable bought it with the highest of hopes during the real estate boom of the mid-80's, only to see those hopes dashed by the recession of the 90's. 
 "We were projecting gross income of $40 million in 1991, and we barely realized $15 million," said Timothy J. Welch, senior executive vice president of Equitable Real Estate Investment Management.
Now, as Viacom, by far its largest tenant, continues to grow apace, 1515's prospects are glowing once more. Last week a group of developers announced plans to convert the former Gulf & Western building on Columbus Circle, headquarters of Viacom's latest acquisition, Paramount Communications, into condominium apartments and, possibly, a hotel. Viacom is certain to fold at least part of Paramount into 1515 Broadway.
But between the expected good news of a decade ago and the actual good news of today, the building has gone through a bankruptcy, a nasty battle between Equitable and its partners and lenders, a stalled plan to redevelop the surrounding area, and a lagging economy that kept far less troubled buildings plagued with vacancies.
How Equitable exercised spin control on 1515 Broadway's problems is a survival tale that combines a dollop of good management with an even greater dollop of good luck.
In 1984, the $190 million that Equitable and Tishman Speyer Properties paid the Minskoff organization for 1515 Broadway seemed as sound an investment as a government bond. The 1.8 million square foot building, built in 1972, had huge floors and terrific views. The Times Square area seemd poised for redevelopment. Then-high-flying developers like Bruce Eichner and David Solomon were planning new skyscrapers that would spruce up the area even more.
Sure, 1515's rents averaged $8 a square foot, way below market; the lobby was shabby; the building was riddled with asbestos and needed fire sprinklers. But all that seemed manageable in the pre-crash 80's.
"Leases were rolling over, and we figured we could abate asbestos, install sprinklers and raise rents as space came available," Mr. Welch recalled.
For a time it looked like they would pull it off. In 1989 Viacom, then a much smaller entertainment company, signed a 20-year lease for about 440,000 square feet. Equitable figured Viacom was a harbinger of things to come; in fact, it was a one-shot deal.
"We didn't sign another lease for 14 months," Mr. Welch said.
Worse yet, long-time tenants were being acquired, and moving. Diamandis Communications moved out of 1515 when it merged with Hachette. Ted Bates Worldwide left when it merged with Backer & Spielvogel.
WITH vacant space mounting, the building was simply not generating enough cash to service debt. Nor could it pay for asbestos removal or tenant improvements, making it impossible to woo new tenants.
"Our projections showed that we would be tapped out by May of 1992," said Lisa J. Halpert, an Equitable Real Estate director.
In October 1990, Equitable put the partnership that owned the building into bankruptcy. Pandemonium broke loose. Tishman Speyer, which was against the bankruptcy, signed over its general partnership interests to Equitable shortly before the bankruptcy filing. But some 25 limited partners, who were not consulted about the bankruptcy, contended that Equitable had not tried hard enough to work out its debt. Its lead lender, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, was furious, too. It sued Equitable, claiming that the big insurance company had not met its obligations to keep the partnership solvent.
Mr. Welch insists that Equitable had no choice. "We just knew we couldn't service the debt and also get the building back into rentable condition," he said.
Acutally, throughout the legal ugliness, Equitable continued to maintain the building and provide services. And it redoubled efforts to retain existing tenants, and to get them to generate good word of mouth.
Frederick Atkins, a garment center factor, had a lease that was expiring in 1992. It wanted to expand onto a few more floors, and extend the lease for its existing space on an "as is" basis -- no tenant improvements, and thus a much lower rent. The problem: One condition of the bankruptcy was that Equitable had to install sprinkers and remove asbestos whenever it signed a new lease.
Equitable agreed to move Atkins to different floors at a fairly low rental. It let Atkins use the 49th floor as a temporary quarters for employees whose space was being rebuilt. When they moved into their new space, another floorful of Atkins people would camp out on 49 until their new offices were ready.
"I've got to say, the management cooperated with us 1,000 percent," said David Solomon (no relation to the developer), a broker who represented Atkins.
Other tenants also found the bankruptcy relatively painless.
"The conflict existed between partners and lenders, but the tenants were spared," recalled Michael R. Laginestra, an executive managing director at Edward S. Gordon who is Viacom's broker.
Word of the building's physical, if not fiscal, health got around. Brian S. Waterman, a managing director at Newmark Real Estate, put O'Brien-Kreitzberg, a construction management company, into 16,000 square feet during the height of the battle.
"Other tenants told us there was no downgrade in service, Equitable put tenant improvement money into an escrow account, so we weren't worried," Mr. Waterman said.
Equitable, the bank, and the partners settled out of court in the spring of 1991. Equitable took the building out of bankruptcy in December of that year.
Equitable has worked hard to buff 1515 Broadway's tarnished image. For example, for a time it provided cash upon lease signing to cover broker's commissions and tenant improvements, "so no one worried they wouldn't get paid," said Peter Riguardi, executive vice president of Koeppel Tener Riguardi, 1515's leasing agent.
But Equitable also has benefited from events beyond its control. Had the economy not collapsed when it did, 1515's new neighbors, 1540 Broadway on 45th Street and 1585 Broadway on 47th Street, might have been formidable competitors. Instead, they stood empty for several years. Now they are off the market, bought, respectively, by Bertelsmann and Morgan Stanley for their own uses.
And, just as it was hurt by the flagging economy, 1515 Broadway is being immeasurably helped by the reviving one.
O'Brien-Kreitzberg, for example, recently took an additional 8,000 square feet.
"They've gotten some tremendous contracts, and they really needed to expand," Mr. Waterman said.
Viacom, meanwhile, already has about 800,000 square feet. As it starts to digest Paramount, it is certain to take more.
Viacom's explosive growth delights Equitable executives, many of whom suspect that, had Viacom had a crystal ball in 1989, it might have scoffed at 1515 Broadway.
"We were an older building in Times Square, not exactly the kind of place a top tenant went back then," Ms. Halpert said. "Our good fortune was that they never expected to become this big."
ALL told, 1515 Broadway is thriving. It is nearly fully leased. Almost all its asbestos is gone. Mr. Riguardi says he's getting annual rents in the low $30's per square foot on low floors, in the high $30's for higher ones.
New tenants are moving in again. The Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation recently took 15,200 square feet. "We're paying $9 a square foot less than we would have paid elsewhere, and we really like the building," said Herbert M. Kaufman, the company's director of adminsitration.
Viacom, meanwhile, has taken over the seventh floor for a huge employee cafeteria, and Equitable recently created a new elevator "crossover" that lets every Viacom employee reach the cafeteria without changing elevator banks. There's talk that Viacom's name will soon go on the building's front. And Viacom already has specified certain floors that it will want when the existing tenants' leases fall due.
"We've killed a lot of deals because Viacom wanted the space," Mr. Riguardi said. Not bad for a building that not so long ago seemed about to die itself.

HEADLINE: A SENSE OF PLACE

BYLINE: By Glenn Collins 

 BODY:
ELECTRONIC potholes, information bottlenecks and data speed traps: these are the bulletins from the very first traffic report and road advisory for New Jersey travelers on the information highway.
Is this necessary? Certainly! More than a year ago, New Jersey Bell became the first telephone company to commit itself to link every customer within a single state to a fiber optic system. That should happen by the year 2010. 
 But long before that, you may need a "virtual" traffic advisory as much as the weather report: there is no technological reason why the superhighway can't reach every home in New Jersey within the next few years. Telephone lines can carry video transmissions; cable companies can arrange telephone calls, and voice, data and video services can even be provided without wires.
Welcome to the future!
Emergency Alert: A bulletin for all New Jersey data travelers traversing the state's major and minor information thoroughfares: beware potholes! Lingering roadbed damage from the long winter's informational overload is a severe problem in many branches and tributaries of the infopike.
Road crews are doing their best to repair these pesky craters in the data routes, but large potholes will continue to be a trial to the unwary!
Immediate Outlook: This week, users of the principal information thoroughfares should be prepared to experience light to moderate traffic at the tollbooths on the Garden State Infoparkway, with only typical but nevertheless infuriating minor data delays. Travelers should be advised that tokens will speed them on their way on this important but overcrowded data thoroughfare!
Thanks to the turnaround in the economy and the first signs of springlike weather, heavy traffic congestion may be expected this week at the state's electronic shopping malls, on-line education centers, information libraries and interactive gaming locations.
Speeder Advisory: Infostate highway police units will be operating more than 30 laser-gun speed traps this week on major and minor data routes, so be advised! Increased supervision has been necessary, according to state enforcement authorities, because life in the fast lane of the information highway is ever more dangerous.
Collisions may result in severe loss of data! Regulatory authorities assure the public that they are doing whatever they can to prevent fatalities on the intrastate routes.
Especially dangerous are traffic mishaps on interconnected databases, which may be slippery at a high rate of speed. Remember, an accident in the fast lane of a mainline digital fiber optic route can be every bit as devastating as a collision on an autobahn!
Since current high-speed lines permit speeds of 2.4 billion bits of information a second, speeding -- aficionados call it "virtual speeding" -- can be a very dangerous infraction! Remember, for those miscreants who have received tickets, virtual attendance is mandatory at all virtual court appearances, and virtual fines will be assessed by all virtual judges.
And, after sentencing, convicted drivers must realize that video visits to all correctional centers are mandatory, unless they have been plea-bargained down to a shorter period of virtual incarceration!
Note: Officials point out that luckily for public safety on many data routes, the volume of traffic is so great for so much of the day that visitors rarely travel at even half of the maximum speed limit.
Trouble Routes: Among the principal arteries expected to be jammed with data commuters this week are infostate routes that include the Turnpike, the Garden State and Routes 80 and 280. Severe congestion is also predicted for the notorious Route 1 between Trenton and New Brunswick.
No matter how total the congestion is, however, voyagers must avoid the tempting but fatal sin of double parking! Serious accidents may result from this practice, and double-parking fines are currently the highest they have ever been on the infostates.
Lane Closings: Dozens of "Computers Working" signs will be posted on data routes this week to permit long-overdue repairs on principal arteries of the infopike. In addition, lane closings will be conducted on hundreds of data bridges and transmission tunnels to permit access to repair crews. These closings are likely to produce bumper-to-bumper traffic and extreme congestion at on-ramps to the information highway.
State information officials say this work is necessary because decades of neglect have damaged the state's data infrastructure. After a time of little maintenance or expansion, many of the state's information highways are antiquated and deteriorating. Hundreds of repair projects will continue for the foreseeable future.
Especially dilapidated are the Garden State routes between academic and government research labs, telecommunications companies, broadcast television centers and other data-crunching institutions. Beyond this, state officials say, road capacity and congestion are reaching epic proportions. Many segments of the infopike have narrow lanes, soft shoulders and crumbling road surfaces, so that even a single breakdown can lead to a major information jam!
Roadblock Advisory: Expect intermittent congestion and temporary localized rubbernecking delays in some urban thoroughfares this week, as law-enforcement authorities set up roadblocks to monitor data theft. These blockages may not only raise frustrations among travelers but also contribute to air pollution and cause hours and hours of lost productivity. Look for these disruptions in data traffic to reduce the information highway experience to the stop-and-go annoyances of the pre-superhighway era.
Infrastructure Outlook: Travelers are likely to experience capacity and congestion problems for years to come on major inforoutes. The reason is that in many areas of the state the information highway is barely in place. Until construction can be completed, expect bouncy rides on unpaved electronic roadways, hair-raising near-collisions on two-lane info-blacktops and frequent unexplained delays.
Keep in mind: many current road maps for the information highway are out of date, depicting interstate construction that may not have been completed, or showing data routes currently blocked by construction.
Road Hogs: Travelers are advised to be on the alert for infotrucks, those behemoths of the informational arteries. These large vehicles carry more than 90 percent of the region's informational freight and account for about 7 percent of the data traveling between New Jersey and neighboring states.
With their smaller lanes, many of the area's older, narrower inforoads cannot accommodate newer, larger vehicles. Despite their large capacity for information storage, such vehicles are a major cause of traffic problems, since they tend to be road hogs.
The Good News: Even in information-poor areas of the state, the ultimate prognosis for superior infotravel will increase in coming years. If current levels of Federal, state, local and private financing can be maintained, officials estimate that about $10 billion will be spent on upgrading the state's informational arteries.
And many experts expect the level of Federal financing to remain constant. Why? Very simple: Vice President Al Gore claims to have been the one who coined the term "information superhighway."
Final Advisory: Drive safely, everyone, and remember: the data you save may be your own!

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Edgy, but Hopeful, in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE Hong Kong stock market was rocked Wednesday when Jardine Matheson Holdings, the British trading company, announced that it would quit the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by the end of the year. Share prices in Hong Kong plummeted -- but just briefly. By the end of the day, the blue-chip Hang Seng index had soared 5 percent.
The delisting of Jardine Matheson, a company deeply intertwined with the history of the British colony, in some sense symbolizes the transition in the stock market as Hong Kong approaches its 1997 reversion to Chinese rule. Increasingly, the market will reflect the fortunes of Hong Kong and China, not colonial Britain. 
 But the move of stock prices on Wednesday was also symbolic of the edginess and volatility of the market as the colony undergoes its transition.
There is considerable fear in business circles about the future under Chinese rule. Jardine's decision was essentially an effort to avoid Chinese regulation. But there is also hope of more prosperity as Hong Kong becomes even more tied to what is destined to become one of the world's great economies.
On Wednesday, and indeed all week, both factors came into play, and the market has been a roller coaster. On Friday, the Hang Seng index closed at 9,234.21, down 86.54.
The Hong Kong stock market has always been volatile. Analysts say this is because foreign institutional investors tend to flood in and out. In addition, there are many individual local investors who react quickly to each rumor or new perception, particularly those concerning China.
"This is quite an emotional stock market," said Kirk Sweeney, director of research in Southeast Asia for Lehman Brothers. "It doesn't take a heck of a lot to push this market in either direction."
But now, it is unclear which way the market will go. Last year, sparked by booming growth in China, the Hang Seng index soared more than 100 percent. The market reached its peak closing price of about 12,201 on Jan. 4 of this year. Since then, prices have fallen as investors have begun to fear that the market may become overheated. Some investors have been paying more attention to the risks in China that were ignored during the bull market of 1993.
High inflation could bring the economy there to a crash landing. There is worry about what will happen after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's elderly leader. And the chilly reception given Secretary of State Warren Christopher on his recent visit there sparked fears that the Clinton Administration might revoke the favorable tariffs China enjoys in exporting its goods to the United States.
The result has been a change in perception about China. "It's gone from being half full to half empty, and now the water is very dirty," said Keith Ferguson, chief regional economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Hong Kong. "China is now a big risk," he added. "It used to be a big positive factor. It's changed 180 degrees in two months. But nothing has changed in China."
The most recent fall of the Hang Seng index culminated last Monday when it plunged 5.1 percent to close at 8,667.03, which is 29 percent below the index's Jan. 4 peak. But on Tuesday, the market jumped 4 percent, followed by the big gain on Wednesday, which came despite the Jardine Matheson announcement.
Now, analysts are divided over whether another bull market has begun. Mr. Ferguson said he thinks there will be a rally in the next two months, but added that he sees a correction that will bring the market down again, although not below 7,000.
In addition to the possible problems in China, he said, South Korea and Taiwan are both entering high-growth phases, so their stock markets might offer more attractive returns to foreign investors in the short run.
There are other clouds hanging over the Hong Kong market besides China. Property prices in Hong Kong have soared, spurring fears of a real estate crash, although many analysts think this is unlikely.
The increase in short-term United States interest rates announced last Tuesday also put a damper on the Hong Kong market. Hong Kong pegs its currency to the dollar, so a rise of United States interest rates often requires a corresponding rise in Hong Kong interest rates, which can slow investment.
Mr. Sweeney of Lehman Brothers, however, thinks "valuations are now reasonable" and the market will head to about 11,000.
Timothy Moe, head of regional research for Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, is even more bullish, predicting the Hang Seng index will reach 14,000. Corporate earnings are still expected to grow 20 percent a year, and Hong Kong will be able to shake off the effects of United States interest rate increases, providing they remain small.
Mr. Moe said the delisting of Jardine Matheson will not spark an exodus of companies from the stock exchange. Jardine Matheson has been particularly active and outspoken in trying to avoid Chinese regulation, and even reincorporated in Bermuda in the 1980's. Another big British trading company, the Swire Group, has courted the Chinese and has invited Chinese investment in one of its prime subsidiaries, Cathay Pacific Airlines.
Mr. Moe said that despite possible short-term problems in China, no one doubts its long-term potential, and the positive effects that could have on the Hong Kong stock market. "The underlying economic attractions are more than enough to offset the uncertainty," he said.

HEADLINE: Can Boeing's New Baby Fly Financially?

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: EVERETT, Wash.

 BODY:
IN two weeks, tens of thousands of people will crowd onto a cavernous factory floor here, 25 miles north of Seattle, to watch the Boeing Company introduce its new wide-body jetliner, the 777.
What they will see on April 9 is a stunning physical and technological achievement. The 777, the largest twin-engine plane ever built, sports the biggest, most powerful aircraft engines ever made -- the housing around each is as wide as the fuselage of a 737 or 757. Designed entirely on computer screens and assembled without mockups, it is the first "paperless" jetliner. And because it has just two engines, and needs only two pilots, it should cost 25 percent less to operate than older models of the four-engine 747, which it is meant to eventually replace. Just 22 feet shorter than the 747, the new plane can carry up to 440 passengers, as many as some 747's. And while its range is now about 4,600 miles, that will go up to 7,250 miles before long, matching the 747. 
 In June, the 777 is expected to take off for the first time, beginning a rigorous year of flight testing. In May 1995, the first plane is scheduled to go into service, for United Airlines, which wants to use it almost immediately on its lucrative Chicago-to-Hawaii and Denver-to-Hawaii routes.
"This is what we wanted: the minimum number of engines, the minimum number of crew," said Gordon A. McKinzie, United's liaison with Boeing for the project.
But will the plane be able to fly financially?
Boeing is pinning much of its hopes for the rest of this century and the beginning of the next on the 777, its most expensive project -- at $4 billion -- since the 747 was introduced a quarter of a century ago. At a time when industrial icons like I.B.M. and Eastman Kodak have stumbled badly, Boeing is pointing to the 777 to show that it is still master of its trade. More than pride is at stake, however. The 777 may well determine whether Boeing, usually the nation's biggest exporter, will remain the dominant maker of civilian planes or lose its edge to Europe's Airbus Industrie and possibly other foreign competitors.
The problem is that designing any plane is a crapshoot in the volatile airline industry because it takes so many years to get a new one on the runway and so many more years to sell enough of them to earn back the huge capital costs.
For the 777, the game is more uncertain -- and Boeing's prospects less clear -- than usual. For one, the 777 is a unique and ambitious bird whose high-tech design process has gone well so far, but could still mask operational problems. For another, Boeing is trying to play catchup with the 777: Airbus Industrie's A330 wide-body twin-jet has been in service since November and another rival from Airbus, the four-engine A340, has been flying since January 1993. What's more, the market for new planes is much softer now than when the 777 was first envisioned in early 1986, or even four years ago when design work began in earnest.
The initial order book for the plane is relatively fat: 147 firm orders and 108 options. That puts the 777 behind the 747, which had 179 orders at a similar stage of development, but ahead of another wide body, the 767, which had 140 orders.
But overcapacity and fare wars have taken their toll on the industry and it is anybody's guess how many more airlines will be in a position to pay the $116 million to $140 million that each 777 costs. The answer will have a profound effect on the program's bottom line.
Asked how many 777's the company has to sell for the plane to be profitable, Allen R. Mulally, the program's manager, responded simply: "A lot."
The actual answer is fairly complex, said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I., who estimated Boeing's out-of-pocket costs at about $2.5 billion with suppliers investing another $1.5 billion.
"If they sell six or seven dozen a year for the next several years, they may have a return after 300 aircraft," or in about four years, Mr. Nisbet said. But, he added, "if those sales are stretched out over 20 years, there may not be a return."
Making things even more problematic is the risky strategy that Boeing is using to catch up with Airbus and snare as many buyers as the currently weak market will bear. Boeing is gambling that once the testing period ends, it will receive virtually immediate permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to let the 777 make extended flights over water, going as much as three hours from land. There is no precedent for this; the F.A.A. has previously required a new twin-engine plane to be in service two years before granting what is known as three-hour Etops. The acronym stands for "extended twin operations," but it is usually rendered by the less reverent as "engines turn or passengers swim."
Instant Etops, coming in June 1995, would help the 777 catch up with the A330, which is expected to get a more limited Etops of an hour and a half later this year. The A340, since it has four engines, does not need an Etops award of any duration, but nor does it offer the cost efficiencies of the 777.
Boeing has devised an elaborate series of flight tests -- including 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings, about double the normal amount, some with just one engine operating -- to try to win an early green light. The F.A.A., not unaware of the 777's importance to American exports, has said that such an outcome is "feasible," but that there are no guarantees.
There are skeptics who think Boeing will be unable to push the cautious agency as far as it wants. "I don't think they will get 180-minute Etops out of the box," said Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with NatWest Securities. He said that the company was having problems integrating some of the electronic components furnished by suppliers.
A Boeing spokeswoman, Barbara Murphy, said last week, "We are confident we will achieve Etops upon entry into service."
 
Flying by Wire
 Making the electronics on board work well with the plane's mechanical parts is particularly important on the 777, because it is a fly-by-wire airplane, the first commercial jet of its kind to be made by Boeing. Instead of using cables to control a plane mechanically, pilots who fly by wire send electronic signals over wires to electrical or hydraulic activators that move the plane's rudder, flaps and other control surfaces. (There are still a few cables in the 777 to provide a physical connection between the pilot's control column and the surfaces, but they are only backups.)
Analysts do not expect that a setback in winning early approval of Etops would cause firm orders for the 777 to be rescinded, in part because cancellations often result in financial penalties. Mr. McKinzie of United, for instance, while expressing unhappiness at the possibility of an Etops delay, said it would take delivery anyway and make do, flying the 777 to destinations other than Hawaii.
But a delay could well have an impact on future sales by sending more airlines to Airbus, which already is busy filling 213 firm orders for its A330's and A340's. A delay might also give new life to McDonnell Douglas's entry in the wide-body derby, the three-engine MD-11, sales of which have been flagging. Only 55 are now on order, Mr. Nisbet of JSA Research said.
If things became bad enough for Boeing -- if, for example, serious design problems were to surface during the upcoming flight tests -- the Japanese might jump in, analysts said. Japanese aerospace companies now make big chunks of the 777, but produce no large commercial airliners of their own. The Japanese Government has made commercial airliners one of the industries that it wants to penetrate.
Still, unless the very worst were to happen, no one expects problems with the 777 to threaten Boeing's very health, as was the case in the early days of the 747.
The first wide body, the 747 almost drove Boeing out of business in the late 60's. Because of design changes, the plane became so heavy that the engines developed by Pratt & Whitney were unable to get it off the ground. At one point, 17 of the giant planes -- all without engines -- were parked on the runway here with concrete blocks hanging underneath the wings to keep them from tipping backward. Bankers barely agreed to keep the company afloat until it could deliver the planes with redesigned engines and collect payment.
This time around, Boeing is in a much better financial position to weather problems, even with the airline industry in turmoil. It has a much fuller product line than in the late 60's, in large part a result of the ultimate success of the 747. Indeed, having survived its rocky start, the 747 has turned into a cash cow. With development costs long since paid off, new sales are largely gravy.
The big question now is whether the 777 will have such a fortunate long-term fate, regardless of what lies immediately ahead.
As it happens, the fate of the two planes appears to be intertwined. Proposed longer-range stretch versions of the 777 are intended to replace older 747's. But some aviation analysts speculate that the 777 and its competitors from Airbus will eventually replace the 747 in its present form. They say the 747 may be converted to a full double-decker to carry 600 or more passengers for use on Asian routes, where the number of landing slots is low.
To play in the same league as the 747, the 777 needs big engines. Supplied initially by Pratt & Whitney and later by General Electric and Rolls-Royce, the engines start at 74,000 pounds of thrust and may go as high as 100,000 pounds for stretch and long-range versions. In contrast, a 747 engine has 56,000 pounds of thrust. (The 777 can get away with less overall thrust because it weighs considerably less than a 747 -- 500,000 pounds versus 800,000 -- and therefore does not need as much power to get into the air.)
Having only two engines, rather than three or four, means saving on fuel as well as maintenance and spare parts. Mr. McKinzie of United says he anticipates that seats on 777's will be 20 percent cheaper to fly than those on the DC-10's they will eventually replace at his airline.
And that's why there is the push to use the 777 as soon as possible on United's Hawaii runs and to win an early Etops certification. Boeing executives say the computerized design of the airplane, together with the heavily augmented flight testing regimen, will justify the early award. F.A.A. officials say they are still negotiating with Boeing on the scope of the tests. In any event, they say, a decision about Etops will be made only when the testing program has been completed.
To try to anticipate problems in the 777's new fly-by-wire system, Boeing built the "iron bird," a steel framework the length and width of the actual plane. All the flaps, ailerons, spoilers and other control surfaces were mounted on the frame for testing in various simulated conditions.
Boeing managers say the paperless design approach -- combined with checks from the iron bird and other devices -- has largely worked with few glitches. Two and a half years ago, for example, designers put an electronic rendering of a wing flap through its paces, making it move on screen to see if it interfered with other components. Based on the results, the designers approved the dimensions of the parts involved. The same flap was recently tested on the 777 that will be introduced next month, and it worked without a hitch.
Previously, the problem of having two components in the same place was often not discovered until the first airplane was assembled, requiring extensive redesign. By using what engineers here call digital pre-assembly, many of those conflicts were identified and solved before the first piece of metal was cut.
Electronic designs, which can be transmitted directly from Boeing's computers to those of the many suppliers involved in the project, have also improved the accuracy of parts by cutting down on misreadings and other errors that are inevitable when using paper drawings, company executives said.
 
Closing the Gap
 "Typically with an airplane this big, you will have horizontal or vertical variances of three-eighths to one-half of an inch" from the original design, said Dale M. Hougardy, the 777 division's vice president for operations. But on the 777, the vertical dimension was off by just 23 one-thousandths of an inch, he said, and the horizontal deviated even less, by 11 one-thousandths of an inch.
For all its attention to dimensions and numbers, Boeing tried to improve its social engineering as well. Designers, aerodynamicists and manufacturing experts were combined into more than 100 "design-build teams" to improve communications.
"Everybody had to learn new skills," Mr. Mulally, the project manager, said. "Engineers had to learn to share their designs while they were in progress, rather than hold on until they were done."
And eight airlines were invited to participate in the process as well, giving prospective customers an opportunity to shape the machines they will have to operate and maintain. It marked the first time Boeing has brought outsiders so deeply into its inner councils. Mr. McKinzie said the airlines were able to persuade Boeing to make design changes to make their lives easier.
One involved the port on the wing where fuel is pumped into the plane. The wing is swept sharply upward, for aerodynamics and to provide ground clearance for the huge engines. "In 1992, we realized that the fuel panel would be 31 inches higher than on a 747," Mr. McKinzie said. "That was a real problem because our trucks are designed for a 747."
Boeing's response was to move the panel eight feet closer to the body of the plane, making it only six inches higher than on the 747. "We can put a step on our trucks and handle that," Mr. McKinzie said.
 
 
 
TAKING OFF WITH SOFTWARE<HE
ONE big lesson from the first paperless airplane: the software had better be up to snuff.
Boeing designed the 777 with eight I.B.M. mainframe computers supporting 2,200 work stations that eventually handled 3,500 billion bits of information.
But the company was forced to put in more engineering time on the project than it had planned, because software deficiencies made it difficult to translate concepts into detailed designs.
"The software was slow and complicated to manipulate," said Ronald A. Ostrowski, chief of engineering for the 777. And, he said, some engineers had a difficult time making the transition from thinking in two dimensions on paper to three dimensions on the computer screen.
"We did not have to add any people, but we had to keep the design teams together longer than we expected," he said. The company is working with I.B.M. and Dassault Aviation, the French aircraft maker, which formulated the software, to improve it for advanced versions of the 777.
"We expect to get an upgraded system in August, so we will use it on the B version," Mr. Ostrowski said. The 777B will carry fewer passengers but will have a range of 7,250 miles, compared with about 4,600 for the initial model.
In dispensing with paperwork, the digital design system greatly reduced the possibility of human error, Mr. Ostrowski said, and it exceeded the goal of reducing engineering changes, errors and reworking of ill-fitting components by more than 50 percent, compared with the earlier 767 program.
"The costs were higher at the front end, but the parts are going together better, so we'll make most of it up," Mr. Ostrowski said.
 
 
 
WHAT PASSENGERS WILL GET
A BIG airplane ought to mean more space for passengers, but it is the airlines, not Boeing, that will determine how much room to allow in the 777 by deciding how many rows of seats to pack into the cabin. And that could vary widely, because the plane can accommodate as few as 305 passengers and as many as 440.
Boeing's suggested range of leg room between seats is 60 inches in first class down to 30 inches in an all-economy layout, about the same range as it suggests for a 747.
With nine seats abreast in economy class, Boeing claims the 777 will have the widest seats of any competing jetliner. Unfortunately, layouts with 10 seats across are also possible.
But the consumer will get a bit of a break no matter how the seats are configured. That is because some of the overhead storage compartments have been designed to protect tall people from bumping their heads yet still remain accessible to shorter passengers.
These compartments, in the center aisles of the 777, are higher off the floor than in the typical plane. When a passenger pulls an easy-to-reach handle, the compartment will swing out on a hinge and then open at a downward angle. (The sloping sides of the fuselage prevent the new compartments from being used elsewhere.)
Since the 777 is designed for long flights, serious thought was given to the entertainment and work needs of the passengers. Depending on the airline, a passenger is likely to have a personal video screen to watch movies, use with a computer or even receive faxes.
The airlines will also have the option to install telephones, complete with a credit card slot for payment.

HEADLINE: Health Plan Must Preserve Doctor-Patient Ties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Most discussions of health care reform focus on the costs of medical care. Little attention is paid to the doctor-patient relationship, but it is the hallmark of high-quality American medicine and should be preserved regardless of what plan Congress provides. 
 In a single brief encounter with a physician, a patient is given a diagnosis -- usually the comforting news that nothing is seriously wrong. Concerns about the origin of symptoms, the natural history of the illness and implications for family members are addressed. Guilt and worry are alleviated. All of this is efficiently done in 15 minutes in the United States in most primary care settings.
All national surveys suggest that people in the United States want more, not less time with their physicians. But if economics alone drives new managed care plans, administrators will press for the least number of physicians per 1,000 enrolled patients. There will be pressure to see more patients in less time. In Japan, the average patient has five minutes with a primary care physician and has to make more visits a year.
Some have referred to the iron triangle of health care reform as access, cost and quality, to show how tightly each is linked to the other. In the context of the physician-patient relationship, face to face time with a physician is both access and quality. If it is reduced, both access and quality are reduced, and the possibility exists that overall cost will increase as unattended illnesses become more severe and expensive to treat.
It seems to me we should measure and publish average direct, patient-physician times for all approved health care plans. Such times with patients should be rewarded financially and be promoted as a criterion for quality health care.
I would also suggest that we should have routine questionnaires for physicians and their patients in future health care plans to measure perceived quality of care.
National polls show that patients think their own doctors give good care and that there is high quality medicine throughout the country. There are concerns, however, that the numbers of physicians who deliver primary care may be too few and that physicians charge too much. With universal access, costs of medical care will increase for any delivery plan,jeopardizin access and quality. If we fail to reward and preserve time with the physician, the doctorpatient relationship will never be the same.

Bottom Line for U.S. and China: No Kowtows on Human Rights

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
INSCRUTABLE, these Americans.
Their China policy has never seemed to be in so many hands. President Clinton's Cabinet (not to mention Congress and the American public) is divided between those who emphasize what China can do for American business and those who emphasize what China must do about human rights. 
 But this explains only in part why China sent Warren Christopher home from Beijing March 14 in a hail of verbal bullets fired at his tough human rights message.
Inscrutability, after all, was invented here.
Today, China, too, seems divided -- between hard-liners who believe President Clinton will not risk his Presidency in a trade confrontation, and those who would gamble that freeing the country's political prisoners will not destabilize the largest economic expansion in China's modern history.
It should never surprise foreigners that China's rulers, under pressure from any outside power, cherish their duty to stand up and smite the "foreign devils" who have been coming to China for two centuries, demanding concessions and leaving behind so much pain and suffering.
If he were alive today, Lord George Macartney could only sympathize with President Clinton and his Secretary of State. In 1793, the British peer anchored his man-of-war off China with the express purpose of prying open the gates of the Forbidden City to British influence. He brought two ships full of gifts and a 100-member delegation.
Instead of welcome, the great Qing Dynasty Emperor, Qianlong, humiliated his British visitor, first demanding that he prostrate himself in the kowtow position and then accepting the nobleman's descent to one knee. Qianlong, irascible at 80, took the British crown's gifts as "tribute," and sent Lord Macartney packing with an edict to King George III that the Celestial Kingdom "had not the slightest need of products from your land," followed by a warning that "your barbarian merchants" should not persist.
Today, the Clinton Administration is dangling multibillion-dollar incentives of trade, investment and technology before another Chinese dynasty, this one Communist, while insisting on concessions in human rights. When the Chinese sent Mr. Christopher packing this month, the message was the same: China needs nothing from America and would never submit to pressure.
It seemed a strategy to exploit the divisions in the Clinton camp. While saying progress is still possible on human rights, China also pointed to the possibility that it is preparing to go its own way again.
In 10 weeks, Mr. Clinton will have the answer. On June 3, he will receive the State Department's recommendation on whether China has made "overall, significant progress" on a well-defined human rights agenda that calls on China to account for and release political prisoners and open its notorious prison system to Red Cross visits.
With Washington so clearly divided over the conflicting commercial and moral principles in its China policy, the question now is: Can China help the State Department give it a passing grade -- and, if so, will China help?
At stake for the Chinese is not how much A.T.& T. or Ford wants to invest here. The Communist Party leadership sees the stake as its very survival, and, therefore, the political stability of the 1.18 billion Chinese.
Crime and corruption are rampant today despite thousands of executions and crackdowns in the provinces. Though much of the economy is booming, the largest portion of Chinese industry is moribund, still living in the "iron rice bowl" era of job security and low productivity. Incipient labor unrest is breaking out over penurious wages and work conditions that claim tens of thousands of lives each year. Though the Communist Party today is delivering more prosperity to more people by turning loose a new entrepreneurial class, every Chinese knows that Communist rule has ruined lives and wreaked havoc in virtually every household.
And if China is awakening, it is also a staggering giant whose social unrest and industrial pollution can radiate to every corner of the planet along with its economic potential. Many China experts say the only social contract that will keep the Communists in power is a fast rising economic tide.
 
The All-Important Economy
 With more than $20 billion in export sales to the United States last year, China has made the American market an integral part of its new economic edifice -- and, therefore, its future. So it is hard to imagine that the party leaders would gamble on pulling down such an important pillar of the temple. But it is also dangerous to say that Beijing's prickly comrades will not.
Look at Mr. Christopher's experience: He came to town expecting that his presence as the highest-level Clinton emissary to date would elicit progress on human rights. Instead, the Chinese were loaded for bear, lashing out at him for exerting pressure and interfering in China's internal affairs.
But then the Chinese, having deflated the pressure campaign, struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, Premier Li Peng reaffirmed China's commitment to improving relations with the United States. He pledged that China "will continue to make efforts" on human rights, which can only mean that the Politburo has yet to lay down all of its cards.
In other words, there are key decisions ahead -- China will never call them concessions -- that Beijing's leaders are working on, but have not yet taken. If the Chinese leaders want to move their relationship out of the shadow of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, it seems the Communist Party elders ought to be willing to let some light into China's dungeons. More than any other element in President Clinton's May 1993 executive order, the plight of China's political prisoners is at the center of the human rights agenda. The failure so far of China to release or parole a significant number is the greatest potential spoiler in this year's diplomacy.
Mr. Christopher and his aides say they are not calling for a transformation of Chinese society by the steps America has laid out; indeed, they say the executive order items were chosen as areas where China could make progress with little political risk.
But as Lord Macartney, and now, Warren Christopher, have learned, dealing with the Celestial Kingdom is a chancy business.

HEADLINE: We'll Always Have Paris. Big Deal.

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
"WE want it to remind people of Paris," the architect said wistfully, describing plans announced this month to transform the bleak, windswept plaza at the World Trade Center and its disorienting underground maze beneath Lower Manhattan's twin towers into a bustling, sunlit mecca of commerce and leisure.
It's hard to fault efforts to make the World Trade Center more hospitable; but what is it about Paris that causes so many Americans to reflexively hold it up as the highest expression of the modern metropolis? 
 Sure, much of Paris is charming and beautiful, particularly in the core that tourists frequent within 20 minutes' or so walking distance of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Its Left Bank sidewalk cafes are among the greatest people-watching spots on earth. And Paris is safer and better run than most American big cities.
Yet Paris, too, has more than its share of modern architectural disasters. In fact, the story of its post-World War II development -- with a handful of conspicuous exceptions like I. M. Pei's glass pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre and the new science museum on the site of the 19th-century stockyards at La Villette -- offers a litany of urban renewal failures.
The policy begun under Charles de Gaulle of situating new office towers outside the central city may have been wise, but one consequence is the jumbled, sterile La Defense complex just west of the Paris city limits. It is on a direct line of sight from the Louvre down the wide Champs-Elysees through the Arc de Triomphe.
New Yorkers may complain about the dark, terminal-like atmosphere of the World Trade Center's underground concourse, with its Duane Reade drug store and prototypical shoe stores. But La Defense has even tackier equivalents, like France's ubiquitous Carrefour discount store and Go Sport, a poor imitation of Herman's. And it is harder to find the entrances to the Metro and the RER suburban trains at La Defense than it is to locate the PATH escalators inside the Trade Center.
President Francois Mitterrand had the stark, monumental Grande Arche, with its tent-like canopy inside, built in a bid to give a striking focus to the place. When the building was opened in 1989 as part of the bicentennial celebration of the French revolution, Robert Hughes, the art critic for Time magazine, concluded: "It would take a nuke, not a cloud, to fix this pretentious monster. Luckily the rest of La Defense is so sub-Dallas that the arch has no context to wreck."
At least La Defense is outside the historic heart of Paris. French planners, though, have no such excuse for what they did to Les Halles, the old central food market.
In the early 1970's, France built the nearby Pompidou Center, the colorful, inside-out cultural multiplex that houses a museum of modern art, center of industrial design, library and music institute. The rusting hulk has aged poorly. And despite the Beaubourg district's immense popularity with visitors, the center is plagued by heavy deficits and requires costly government subsidies.
Meanwhile, the glass and cast-iron pavilions of Les Halles were torn down, leaving a hole filled in only years later with a multi-level underground shopping center gloomier and more confusing than the World Trade Center's. It is covered by a vast concrete and greenery plaza with paths and stairway chasms descending to the lower circles of Les Halles. The "park" is entered through curving steel piers meant to echo the food halls they replaced. Tourists and residents congregate around nearby restaurants and shops, but shun the plaza.
Most architects now believe these examples of late 20th-century Parisian urban design are not models to emulate, but lessons in what to avoid. So why should New York have such an inferiority complex?
 
It's Up to You, Nouveau Gauche
 It's not clear. Maybe it's because New York's eyesores, like Times Square and its vast stretches of bare public housing blocks, are so much more visible than those in Paris, where the immigrant poor and the downtrodden are generally consigned to the untouristed eastern districts and ring of inner suburbs. But New York urban designers at least seem to have learned something from recent history. The mixed residential-office complex at Battery Park City, for instance, may need more street-level shops, but it opens the waterfront to pedestrians and contains the inviting Winter Garden.
You can't say the same about France's builders, led by President Mitterrand. Paris' newest monument is the $1.3 billion National Library under construction in the working-class eastern side of the city on the Left Bank. It involves four 310-foot, L-shaped towers on each corner of a square. Critics say the French architects got it backwards in deciding to place books in the glass towers, risking their deterioration from heat and sun, while relegating the public to a subterranean reading room. "Normally," one expert noted, "books go underground and readers are given natural light." Not in Paris.

HEADLINE: Losing Control;
For Mexicans, Democracy Exacts A Scary Price

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
NEAR 4 in the morning, hours after party leaders had confirmed that a .38-caliber bullet had torn through the head of Luis Donaldo Colosio on Wednesday evening and killed the man who probably would have been Mexico's next president, Celzo Hernandez stood outside the headquarters of the ruling party holding a bullhorn, but saying nothing.
The buildings billowed with huge banners of Mr. Colosio's name, just as they had on the night last November when the 44-year-old former party chief emerged as the hand-picked successor to carry on the party's 65-year reign. Thousands cheered then, comforted that even though the choice of Mr. Colosio had been made behind closed doors, it insured a smooth transition and continued stability of a kind that no other country south of the Rio Grande has enjoyed. 
 Barely four months had passed and Mr. Hernandez, a campesino from the coast, had trouble finding any way to express how he felt after a lone gunman, a man who called himself a pacifist, had changed Mexican history.
"There's nothing but to keep moving forward," he said in a voice barely a whisper. For what reason? "La lucha," he said -- the struggle.
There seems to be no other way to describe the nation's challenge in this year of promise turned to peril, a season of violence that has left Mexico shaken and the United States deeply worried. Not since the savage revolution that began with the overthrow of a dictator in 1910 and ended only after a million Mexicans had died fighting for vague notions of freedom and justice has Mexico struggled so with the kind of nation it wants to be.
"Democracy is a historical apprenticeship, and a costly one for Mexico," said Octavio Paz, the Nobel Prize-winning poet and novelist. "But we are learning, and for us it has been worth all the pain."
From the bloodshed of the revolution of Emiliano Zapata and Francisco (Pancho) Villa emerged a rudimentary democracy, with a constitution and individual rights. For 65 years elections have been held, newspapers have been published and nearly all official stationery has echoed with the words "universal suffrage, no re-election," as if to recall what the fighting had all been about.
But slogans don't make democracy. The hardened survivors of the revolution who hadn't been murdered formed a political party in 1929 that, more than anything else, was designed to keep them in power. They created a singularly successful formula, in which the Government controls the party and a powerful president controls the government. Mexico then was sealed off, its economy closed to the rest of the world for decades.
Modern Mexico bears many scars from the revolution. Its collective memory is marked by an abhorrence of violence, a feeling deepened by more than half a century of political peace that seems just now to have ended with the first assassination of a major political figure since President-elect Alvaro Obregon was killed in 1928.
Mexico also has had to struggle with the many inconsistencies and contradictions left by the revolution, embodied in the name of the party itself. The Institutional Revolutionary Party was forged in revolution but over the decades has become merely an institution, resistant to change, known simply as the PRI. It has infiltrated so many functions of state that today people like Mr. Hernandez have trouble distinguishing the party from the Government.
The insurgency that blasted out of the southern state of Chiapas on Jan. 1 is just one crisis of many that PRI governments have faced since 1929. Under other circumstances the Government might have successfully applied its time-tested formula of meeting, discussing and eventually co-opting enemies to solve the problem. In other times, it might have tried to just blast away the trouble-makers.
But the rebellion is still unresolved, in part because -- in spite of the gray continuity the PRI represents, the way it has of leaning left or right while remaining the same -- Mexico itself has changed, and in doing so, changed the rules of the game.
The transformation started, some say, in 1982, when the country defaulted on its loans and was forced, hat in hand, to ask for help. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and eventually the United States helped Mexico back on its feet. But in return they demanded that Mexico's creaking, protected economy be opened up.
Sergio Aguayo, a human rights advocate and security analyst, sees that forced restructuring as the beginning of Mexico's final transition to democracy. It seems that as in the former Soviet Union the economic opening will eventually lead to the collapse of the political system and the emergence of something new.
In Mexico, that process has taken years longer, but the signs of it are unmistakable. The Government has removed itself from many parts of the economy, and moved confidently to have Mexico take its place among the world's strongest economies. The North American Free Trade Agreement is now in effect and, just last week, Mexico accepted an invitation to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the powerful grouping of advanced economies.
 
'Victim of Democracy'
 The economic transformation has inevitably brought pressure for political change.
To keep foreign investors pouring money into Mexico, old habits of corruption and fraud had to end. Information had to be made available, records reliable. The intellectuals who had been Mexico's only internal critics were joined by citizens who no longer feared being shot for criticizing the government, and non-governmental organizations finally began to take their place in the national debate. Democracy once again was not just a slogan but a goal.
All that was lurching ineluctably forward when Mr. Colosio became the PRI candidate four months ago. But the sudden insertion of violence after Jan. 1, and the prospect of instability it carries, suddenly made those changes seem risky, even ominous. Columnists in Mexico City newspapers now ask whether Mr. Colosio was not "a victim of democracy." His death and other flashes of violence -- including Chiapas and the recent kidnapping of one of Mexico's most powerful businessmen -- are expected to actually help the PRI because people are so frightened they would gladly vote for the same powers that have kept the peace for the last 65 years.
So much has changed so fast. When Mr. Colosio's selection was announced, his strength was continuity. His ideas on economics, politics and social policy were so similar to those of his mentor, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, that the curly-haired Mr. Colosio had at times been called "Salinas with hair."
After more than 100 people died in Chiapas, and armed Maya Indians declared war on a government they said had ignored the poor while catering to the rich, Mr. Colosio was forced to transform himself. At one point he said the only continuity he represented was change. Now that a replacement candidate must be found for Mr. Colosio, the door to change is again wide open.
The process to select a substitute is likely to be as much of a back-room deal as it was in November. But this time Mr. Salinas, who ultimately is responsible for picking the candidate and only later consulting party officials who approve the name, has many more considerations, limitations and expectations to live by. The last three months have seen to that. Those pressures will make selecting the new PRI candidate a more responsive, if not more open, act.
In some way the public will play a bigger role than ever before in the decision -- the most critical act in Mexican public life -- even if they, like Mr. Hernandez in the PRI square on the night of the assassination, have not said a word.

HEADLINE: Fish Market's Problems Revert to New York City

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Eight years ago the top Federal prosecutor in Manhattan began a crackdown against the Mafia that led to extensive Federal oversight of the Fulton Fish Market, the nation's largest wholesale fish and seafood distribution center.
Now the headaches of running the market and combating mobsters have come full circle to the former prosecutor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York's new Mayor. As Federal intervention wanes, it is Mr. Giuliani's administration that will be faced with directly supervising the market as the city resumes responsibility for it for the first time since 1982. 
 Many law-enforcement authorities, officials and market workers say the Federal Government's campaign largely failed to solve the market's main problems: Mafia influence, unregulated wholesale dealers known as "phantoms" and extortion of companies at the market. Experts say the fines charged against a group accused of controlling the unloading of supplies at the market were the program's major accomplishment.
The market, in lower Manhattan, is an important economic asset to the city, providing 1,000 jobs and generating sales of more than $800 million annually for wholesale dealers.
But Kenneth W. Fisher, a City Councilman from Brooklyn on the committee that monitors market conditions, said the market's volume had declined from a high of about $2 billion in sales 15 years ago. Suppliers concerned about extortion and fraud are switching to other markets on the East Coast, especially in Philadelphia and Boston, Mr. Fisher said.
"We are hemorrhaging business, driving retail prices up for consumers, and the city is losing more than $3 million every year in rents and taxes," he said.
It was Mr. Giuliani's investigation and court actions as a prosecutor in 1986 that exposed crimes and then indirectly created the difficulties that his administration must now tackle.
Among the tangled issues faced by the city are these:
*Negotiating new leases with dealers whose bargain rents on city properties have been unchanged for 12 years. City officials say the rents have been virtually the same since 1982, partly because previous administrations were concerned about signing long-term leases with dealers who Federal investigators might later find had mob ties.
*Evicting wholesalers who operate on city property without paying rent to the city. City and Federal officials say that authorized tenants profit from subleasing space to 50 or more phantom dealers without permission from the city. The city collects about $300,000 annually in rents and fees, although a Federal study in 1992 found that fair market rent at the site should be more than $3 million a year.
*Curbing the influence of the Genovese crime family, which continues to reap illegal profits from bookmaking, loan sharking, no-show jobs and shakedown schemes at the market. Law-enforcement authorities say that Alfonso Malangone and Ross Gangi, whom they identify as capos, or captains, in the Genovese gang, have replaced mobsters ousted by Mr. Giuliani's earlier Federal investigation.
*Regulating unlicensed companies or crews, known as unloaders, who transport fish and seafood supplies from delivery trucks to wholesalers. Last month, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court in Manhattan fined the heads of five unloading crews a total of $200,000 on civil charges that they conspired to split the unloading business among themselves.
Randy M. Mastro, Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, said in an interview that "new procedures and initiatives to address some of the rent and oversight issues" would soon be unveiled by City Hall. He declined to give details but said, "This is a subject near and dear to some of us in the administration."
In the 1980's, in fact, Mr. Mastro was the supervising Federal prosecutor in the market investigation under Mr. Giuliani, who was then the United States Attorney for the Southern District.
 
One Market, Two Perspectives
 In its 160 years of existence, the market has inspired colorful tales of gritty businessmen and laborers who toil from midnight to dawn so that fresh seafood is available in the New York City region. But law-enforcement authorities and workers provide another perspective on the market, describing it as a rough, insular world in which organized-crime figures have thrived for 60 years from kickbacks and secret partnerships.
"This is a small city where the mob knows everything that is going on," said a longtime market worker who spoke on condition that he not be identified. "There is a tremendous cash flow for them here. Some dealers take in $50,000 to $60,000 in cash sales every night, and the Government has no idea how easily money passes from hands to hands."
A former wholesaler, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that two years ago he paid $7,000 "under the table" to lease space in the market. "They said it went to the right people, which everyone knows is the Genovese people," he added.
In a civil racketeering suit brought in 1987 by Mr. Giuliani, Federal prosecutors asserted that Vincent Romano "runs the Fulton Fish Market for the Genovese crime family." In a settlement in 1988, Mr. Romano agreed not to take part in union or any other activities at the market.
Organized-crime investigators from the Federal Government, the state and the New York City Police Department said the Genovese rackets in the market are now controlled by Mr. Malangone, 57, and Mr. Gangi, 54.
Both men, according to the authorities, were promoted to capo in 1989 by Vincent Gigante, who has been identified in Federal indictments as the boss of the Genovese family. City records list relatives of Mr. Malangone and Mr. Gangi as owners of wholesale dealerships at the market.
Mr. Malangone, who lives on Staten Island, and Mr. Gangi, who lives in Brooklyn, have unlisted telephone numbers and did not return calls left at their relatives' companies.
 
Refrigerated Trucks, Cobblestone Streets
 The Fulton Fish Market evolved from one that sprang up in 1833 to serve fishing fleets on the East River near Fulton Street. The trawlers began disappearing about 70 years ago, to be replaced by trucks, and the market now comes alive only at night.
Sundays to Thursdays, shortly before midnight, refrigerated trailers rumble over cobblestone streets, bringing catches from Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports, from fish and shellfish hatcheries and from airports where containers of frozen supplies are flown in from Europe and South America.
In the gloom and mist of early morning, hundreds of retail fish store owners and restaurateurs wander along the market stalls, buying from wholesalers on three blocks of South Street from Fulton Street north to Peck Slip.
Most dealers are housed in two dank, shedlike structures on the east side of South Street, the 1907 Tin Building and the New Building, which opened in 1939. Part of the rent problem stems from an unusual pact between the city and the South Street Seaport Museum, which adjoins the market.
Until 1982, the market was supervised by the old Department of Markets, and rents were paid directly to the city. That year, under the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, the city turned over the management of rent collections and other responsibilities to the South Street Seaport Corporation, an arm of the museum.
The deal was part of an arrangement that permitted the Rouse Corporation to develop the waterfront and the adjacent historic landmark district. In an attempt to aid the museum, the city gave the South Street Seaport Corporation the right to collect rent on the market and to keep 10 percent of the revenue, in return for which it would be the market's landlord.
The main leases inherited from the city in 1982 were master leases with two trade groups that represented most dealers: the New York Wholesale Fish Dealers Association for the New Building and the Fulton Market Fishmongers Association for the Tin Building.
They pay a total of $168,000 a year. There are also separate leases, totaling $100,000 annually, with about 15 merchants in city-owned buildings across the street from the Tin and New Buildings.
 
Financial Hopes, Fiscal Reality
 John M. Pollack, the museum's vice president for administration, said the museum spent an average of $120,000 managing and cleaning the market, while it received about $27,000 a year as its share of the rents.
"The conventional wisdom in 1982 was that the rents would soon be renegotiated and that the museum would benefit financially," Mr. Pollack said. The museum does have other sources of revenue.
Peter Neill, the museum's president since 1985, said the administrations of Mr. Koch and his successor, David N. Dinkins, rejected museum requests to raise the rents or to increase its share of the collections.
Museum officials said they were directed by Koch and Dinkins administration officials, who retained authority since the city still owned the market, not to enter into long-term leases because the Federal investigation might tie some dealers to organized crime.
Mr. Koch said in an interview that he had no recollection of why the rents were frozen. "I wanted to clean up the place, but we didn't have the authority," he said.
Wallace L. Ford 2d, the Business Services Commissioner in the Dinkins administration, said rent increases and new leases were postponed because of concerns about the outcome of the Federal investigation.
Mr. Neill said museum officials, frustrated by the losses, asked last year for permission to drop out as the market's landlord. Museum and city officials said an agreement would soon be signed to make the city's Economic Development Corporation the landlord.
Mark Rudes, the president of the Fishmongers Association, acknowledged that Tin Building tenants were "paying very little rent." But, he said, the building is 87 years old, and increases would be justified only if the city made structural improvements.
Vincent Tatick, the president of the dealers' association in the New Building, declined to be interviewed.
In 1988, as a result of the Federal anti-racketeering lawsuit, Judge Griesa appointed Frank H. Wohl, a former Federal prosecutor, as the market's administrator, with the temporary job of overseeing some of the market's businesses.
An investigation by Mr. Wohl led to the $200,000 in fines last month against the five unlicensed unloading crews on the ground that they had an economic stranglehold over the market by determining which perishable fish and shellfish supplies would be quickly unloaded and delivered to wholesalers.
Gerald J. McMahon, a lawyer for the crews, said last week that the fines had not been paid and that the unloaders would appeal the order. Owners of the companies, in interviews, denied that they allocated work among themselves or that they were associated with organized-crime groups.
In 1992, an analysis by Anthony Carpiniello, a financial consultant for Mr. Wohl, recommended that the unloaders, who are unlicensed and pay no fees to the city, should be charged $1.4 million a year for their exclusive rights.
 
City's Losses, Phantoms' Gains
 Mr. Carpiniello also proposed that the city increase fees to $310,000 a year from $40,000 a year for a group known as loaders. They assign parking spots on streets to retailers and contend that by tradition they have the sole rights to deliver purchases to the parked vehicles of customers.
Because of Federal budget cuts, Mr. Wohl's staff of investigators and inspectors at the market was phased out by the end of 1992, although he technically retains some oversight powers. Last year, the Business Services Department replaced the Federal monitors with 10 uniformed market agents to police the area.
Museum, city and Federal officials said that in the last decade no comprehensive census had been made of wholesalers in the market because of the splintering of responsibility for overseeing the dealers. All the officials now agree that the task has reverted to the city.
Thomas C. Lavin, the city's market manager since 1992, said he was investigating reports that some dealers who paid rents of less than $1,000 a month through their associations were subleasing sections of their leaseholds for up to $6,000 a month.
Although the Business Services Department said it had a list of about 60 known tenants compiled by Mr. Wohl's office in 1992, Mr. Lavin estimated that as many as 170 dealers were operating in the market.
"We do hear stories about phantom tenants on city property," added Mr. Lavin, a detective on leave from the Police Department. "And we are in the process of identifying them."

HEADLINE: Italy Votes Under Rules, Born of Scandal

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, March 26

 BODY:
When Italians vote Sunday and Monday to elect a new Parliament they will use a complicated new procedure originally intended to put an end to Italy's system of choosing political parties, rather than individual candidates.
In part at least, the new electoral law allows Italians for the first time to choose from among candidates named on the ballot, much the way Americans elect members of Congress. 
 Up for grabs are all 630 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house, where the party or parties that win a majority of the vote will have the right to pick the Prime Minister. Also at stake are all 315 seats in the Senate. The campaign has come down to a fight between a left-wing alliance led by the former Communist Achille Occhetto and a right-wing alliance led by the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi.
On the economy, Mr. Berlusconi is promising tax breaks, a million new jobs and rapid privatization to reduce the $100 billion budget deficit, Europe's largest. Mr. Occhetto says the privatization process must not cost jobs. With two million people unemployed -- 11 percent of the labor force -- the issue is critical.
 
Candidates Trade Charges
 After more than two years of scandal that has discredited the postwar political elite, another important issue relates to which candidate will offer a clean break with the past. Mr. Berlusconi says that Mr. Occhetto is an old-style Stalinist under another name. Mr. Occhetto says that Mr. Berlusconi's close ties with the former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who faces trial on numerous corruption charges, roots him firmly in the old order.
The new voting system, which was enacted last year by the departing Parliament, was prompted by the involvement of the political parties in the wave of corruption scandals that has swept Italy, and was intended to foster clarity of choice and limit the old fragmentation of the political landscape.
At the same time, it was supposed to make individual candidates answerable to their constituencies, while curbing the power of party bosses. Under the old system, the bosses were not required to run for office in one-on-one contests, but were assured seats in the legislature that were allotted according to the electoral strength of their parties.
Fearful of losing power, however, the party leaders in the old legislature pushed through what is in fact a hybrid electoral system. Under its rules, three-fourths of the seats in each house of Parliament -- 475 in the Chamber and 232 in the Senate -- will be decided by the choice of a candidate on the ballot, as in the United States. One-fourth of the seats -- 155 in the Chamber and 83 in the Senate -- will continue to be apportioned to candidates named by the parties according to each party's share of the vote.
 
Three Ballots to Fill Out
 Thus, each voter will have three ballots to fill out in the voting booth. One, to choose a candidate for the Chamber, and the candidate with the most votes will win. The second, to pick one of 15 political parties to determine which share of the proportionally allotted 155 Chamber seats each party will get. Only parties with 4 percent of the vote or more will be eligible for additional seats.
The third ballot will serve to pick a candidate for the Senate, and as in voting for the Chamber the candidate with the most votes will win. The 83 proportionally allotted Senate seats will be divided among the political parties under a complex formula according to their showing in the direct vote.
Since candidates running for office in the direct vote for Chamber or Senate may also be put forth by their parties as candidates for proportionally allotted seats, most party leaders are virtually assured of entering the legislature, even if they are defeated in the direct balloting.
As if this were not enough, the system is further complicated by differences in the voting age, which is 18 for the election to the Chamber but 25 for the Senate. Thus, while 48.4 million Italians are eligible to vote for the lower house, only 41.8 million may elect the Senate.

HEADLINE: Wildlife Panel Retreats on China and Taiwan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 26

 BODY:
A United Nations conference demanded Friday that Taiwan uphold an international ban on the sale of tiger bones and rhinoceros horns, but it backed off earlier threats of tough measures against China.
The action by the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species could influence United States policy on the issue. President Clinton has to decide next week whether to impose limited trade sanctions on the Asian nations under legislation protecting animals threatened with extinction. 
 Tiger bones and rhinoceros horns are valued in Asia as ingredients in traditional medicines. There are fears that this could threaten the animals with extinction before the end of the decade.
The World Wildlife Fund and the Earth Island Institute said they would step up their campaign to persuade the United States to ban imports of wildlife products from Taiwan. But they conceded there was little hope that China would face punitive measures despite accusations that it allows smuggling of tiger bones.
"There's never been a more compelling case for sanctions," said Ginette Hemley of the World Wildlife Fund.
Only an estimated 10,000 rhinos are left in the wild.
Unconfirmed estimates say up to a quarter of the tiger population in Siberia was killed this winter and the bones smuggled into China.
There are now said to be only 150 to 200 Amur tigers left in Siberia. About 1,500 Bengali tigers are said to have been killed in India the last three years, reducing the population to about 3,000.
At a meeting in Belgium in September, the United Nations committee warned Taiwan, China, South Korea and Hong Kong that it might recommend a ban on their exports of wildlife products if they continued to deal in tiger and rhinoceros parts.
In the past, the six-member committee has called for sanctions against Thailand and Italy for violations of the convention.
Environmental groups maintain that Chinese factories are still producing products made from tiger bones despite the insistence of authorities that this has stopped.
The standing committee was most critical of Taiwan. It voiced concern at the Government's failure to bar forbidden imports and consumption.
But the final text was weaker than an initial draft, which said the committee would recommend sanctions against Taiwan.

HEADLINE: Nervous and Skeptical, Mexicans See Dark Plots

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 26

 BODY:
Raymundo Urbina, a 35-year-old resident of the southern city of San Cristobal de las Casas, took it more or less in stride when the textile factory where he had worked his entire adult life shut down last year and left him out of work.
He could accept it when one of his sisters had to go to the United States to find work. That he must struggle now to provide for his children, he says, is simply a function of the way things are. 
 What he cannot understand, though, is what is happening to his country.
"All these people hate PRI now," he said of the party that has governed Mexico for 65 years. Referring to the peasant rebels who seized his city on Jan. 1 and to a bishop accused of supporting their cause, he said: "People say the Zapatistas will attack again. They say the Bishop is a guerrilla. And now they kill the man who was going to be President."
 
A Semblance of Calm
 On a radio blaring nearby, a young disk jockey interrupted her string of rock hits and mentioned Wednesday's murder of the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, in Tijuana. Then she seemed to finish Mr. Urbina's thought: "It's like our country was sick or something," she said, "and we don't know how to find the cure."
By this weekend there were signs that Mexico had not quite fallen apart. After Mr. Colosio's assassination, many people seemed more sympathetic to his cause than ever, and party officials began meeting today to discuss a new candidate.
But if things were regaining a semblance of normality, one might not have sensed it from talking to ordinary Mexicans, whose conversations dwelled on a confluence of shadowy, violent events: The unsolved killing of a Roman Catholic Cardinal last May. The scores of kidnappings. The peasant uprising. The most significant political assassination since a President-elect, Alvaro Obregon, was killed in 1928.
 
Conspiracy Theories
 In public statements and private gossip, Mexicans spun web after web of theories about who might be behind Mr. Colosio's killing.
Conservatives whispered about the rebels in Chiapas and the leftist political party that is strong in the state where the accused killer, Mario Aburto Martinez, grew up. The rebels blamed hard-liners within the ruling party. Leftists suspected the interior ministry, where agents were no doubt hunting for subversives.
What appeared to strike remarkably few Mexicans as even plausible was the possibility that Mr. Aburto had acted alone. That the suspect "would say in his first statement that he would not say anything even if he were tortured reveals indisputably that this crime was not carried out in isolation," editorialized Diario de Chiapas, the local paper in Tuxtla Gutierrez.
What Mr. Aburto did say fed a good deal of suspicion. In his initial statements, Government prosecutors reported, he said he was part of a group he would not describe and had plotted years ago to kill President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. He said he shot Mr. Colosio to draw international attention to the cause of pacifism, the prosecutors added.
During the questioning, lawyers said, Mr. Aburto also proclaimed, "We have saved Mexico," without explanation. Then he insisted he had only intended to wound Mr. Colosio, the lawyers said, and had to be shown scenes of the shooting to convince him that he had killed the candidate.
An official familiar with the investigation said today that the police had found drawings in Mr. Aburto's home of his soul entering Mr. Colosio's body, of him and Mr. Colosio rising together to heaven, and of Mr. Colosio in a coffin. "He is someone who is unstable," the official said, "not insane, but obsessed."
Yet whatever the political sympathies, the theories about what is wrong in Mexico all seemed to share a belief that the Government could not be trusted to cough up the truth.
Some recalled the Mexico City earthquake in 1985, when officials repeatedly understated the number of dead. Others remembered the 1992 sewer explosions in Guadalajara, when officials at first tried to cover up involvement by the state oil company, which turned out to be responsible.
"If the Government does not give believable answers, people will speculate a lot," said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, a human-rights ombudsman who observed Mr. Aburto's first interrogation. "If in the next few days, we don't come to a clear explanation of this, the social environment can be poisoned."
Diana Penaloza, 22, who grew up in Mexico City and was back from studies in California to visit relatives, diagnosed the malaise as "all politics."
"The guys on top want to crush the peasants below," she said. "You see that in Chiapas. And it is the same with the political parties and what happened to Colosio."
Not only those far from power wondered about obscurantist forces.
Miguel de la Madrid, who preceded Mr. Salinas as President and chose him as the governing party's candidate, sought out reporters at Mr. Colosio's wake to tell them: "I am very concerned that the state of law has been broken, that the leaders are masked, that the political struggle is not out in the open. And I am very worried about the participation of the Mexican clergy in politics."
It was unclear whether he was referring to the masked rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas, or to members of the country's political parties. But the man who put Mr. de la Madrid in office, a former President, Jose Lopez Portillo, offered no less dark a view.
Behind the assassination, Mr. Lopez Portillo said, "there are outside forces" trying to destabilize Mexico. He said he could provide no further information on the forces, but as an indication of the seriousness of events, he told of watching television news with his 4-year-old son, Alejandro, on the night of the killing.
"Papi," he quoted the boy as saying, "I am afraid."
"Of what, my son?"
"That they are going to kill Mexico."
 
Broad Suspicions
 Jasiel Bueno, a 17-year-old student in Mexico City, wondered if those behind Mr. Colosio's killing might not lurk within the governing party itself. The problem, said her boyfriend, Israel Sosa, 19, is that "you just cannot tell what is happening anymore."
Rosa Martinez, 40, a homemaker, saw the most important clue to the murder in Mr. Colosio's campaign.
"This was the first time I ever heard one of the presidents or the future president, saying there was hunger and poverty in the country and he was going to end it," she said. "Maybe they killed him because of that."
In a telephone interview from Culiacan, a capital of the narcotics trade, Jesus Cantu, an editor whose independent newspaper was firebombed two weeks ago, said it was not merely the violence that had startled Mexicans but its suggestion of weakness in a political system that once seemed indestructable.
"The Government has been very capable in controlling the economic situation," he said. "But it has totally lost control of the political situation and the issue of public safety. You feel now like anything could happen."

HEADLINE: Winston Lord: Where the Buck Stops on China and Human Rights

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
Suddenly, it seems, Winston Lord has found himself at odds with the two worlds that have defined his career.
The point man for the Clinton Administration on China, Mr. Lord has emerged as the bane of official Washington -- including some leading members of the Administration's economic team -- which has begun to blame him both for Secretary of State Warren Christopher's confrontational trip to Beijing and for the China policy linking trade and human rights. 
 The prestigious Council on Foreign Relations, which Mr. Lord served as president for eight years, has thumbed its nose at him, unceremoniously canceling his invitation to a televised seminar on China where the Administration's approach was excoriated.
The recent ill fortune of Mr. Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, has little to do with his pedigree or his personality.
 
The Perfect Image
 An old-school Republican patrician, the 56-year-old is the quintessence of the well-born diplomat whose total loyalty and aversion to confrontation have helped him thrive in the cutthroat worlds of government and think tanks. Magna cum laude from Yale, and first in his class at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, he often introduces himself jokingly as the son of the late Mary Pillsbury Lord, a celebrated delegate to the United Nations, and as the husband of Bette Bao Lord, the Shanghai-born novelist.
Instead, his situation has much to do with trying to balance cold-war rules on how to deal with an authoritarian state and the evolving bottom-line rules on how to make a profit in the world's fastest growing economy.
The issue is whether Mr. Lord, a former Ambassador to Beijing who learned realpolitik diplomacy at the feet of Henry A. Kissinger but who now strongly advocates a tough human-rights agenda, has an ear for the language of dollar diplomacy.
"I don't want to be type-cast," Mr. Lord said in a recent interview. "I'm very concerned about economic issues, as concerned as everyone else. It's not fair to say I'm worrying about human rights and not economics or geopolitics. If there was not enough weight or attention given to economic considerations, it certainly wasn't purposeful. It's total nonsense."
 
Enter Economists, Angry
 Last May, when President Clinton avoided a bitter split with Congress by signing an executive order giving China a year's grace to improve its human rights performance or risk losing trade benefits, there was only praise.
But as the June deadline for renewing China's trade benefits approaches, a rising chorus of critics, from the National Economic Council at the White House to the Commerce and Treasury Departments, say they did not have enough input into what they now term a misguided decision. The question most often asked by officials who care more about balance sheets than the nuclear balance is this: Who got us into this in the first place?
In the absence of a clear statement of support by the President for Mr. Christopher and his team, the fingers are pointed at Mr. Lord. As the chairman of the interagency group on China policy and a firm believer in the executive order he helped to write, Mr. Lord makes a convenient target.
It was Mr. Lord, for example, and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, who devised the policy shift in September to one of intense, high-level engagement with the Chinese. Although officials on the economic side were pleased with the approach, they were unhappy that they had been left out of the consultations.
 
Weighting the Agency
 Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the National Security Council, complained to the deputy national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, that the State Department -- and Mr. Lord -- had too much control over the policy, senior Administration officials said. And, they said, Mr. Cutter felt that the policy focused too much on human rights and security interests.
As a result of Mr. Cutter's concerns, the senior interagency group was set up, headed by Mr. Lord but weighted heavily with economic agencies.
It was also Mr. Lord who convinced a wavering Secretary of State that canceling his trip to China would deprive him of the opportunity to carry an unambiguous message to China's leaders and might irreparably damage Sino-American relations. Instead of keeping the diplomatic volume low during the visit, the two men turned it up full blast.
It is not surprising that Mr. Lord does not lash back at his critics. He is so loyal that when Mr. Kissinger ordered him in 1971 to keep quiet about their secret mission to China, which ended 20 years of nearly total isolation, he signaled his destination to his wife by looking out the window as he was packing and saying, "I think I see a Peking Tom."
 
'Sour Grapes'
 Some members of the economic team admit they have fought for more emphasis on economic factors in foreign policy, but they add that the criticism of Mr. Lord is misplaced.
"I cringe to think how it would be if there was a traditional foreign policy person in that job," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. "Obviously the economic stakes with China are almost off the charts, and I have argued about the need to inject commercial considerations more into the policy. But I never identified Winston as the obstacle, and any revisionism about the policy that blames him is the worst kind of sour grapes."
Certainly Mr. Lord has revised his thinking on China over the years. As Ambassador from 1985 until just before the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989, he dutifully followed the Reagan-Bush line that China's political leaders were on the right track. saying in a 1988 speech that he did not see any "hard-liners waiting in the wings."
He fell out of favor with George Bush during the President's visit to China in February 1989 after Chinese security officials barred the dissident scientist Fang Lizhi from a barbecue in Mr. Bush's honor. Senior Bush aides disavowed any role in the invitation and blamed Mr. Lord -- incorrectly -- for not informing them. Mr. Bush "expressed regret" to the Chinese.
 
No More Nice Guy
 After Mr. Lord left Government, he openly broke with the Bush Administration over human rights, and in a commentary on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times in May 1990, he argued that extending trade benefits to China without being forthright about the Administration's displeasure with Beijing would be "a grave mistake."
Although Mr. Lord now argues strongly that revocation of the trade benefits would have enormous economic consequences for China, he wrote in the 1990 article that revocation would have the "most severe impact" on China's private sector, undermine Hong Kong and allow foreign competitors to profit at the expense of United States companies.
In his 14 months back in Government, the former career Foreign Service officer has been credited with shaping a strategy that puts Asia at the center of foreign policy and with moving forward the politically sensitive decision to end the trade embargo against Vietnam.
Both Mr. Christopher and Mr. Lord have supported the Administration's tough trade policy toward Japan. For North Korea, the leading policy official is Robert L. Gallucci, the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs.
 
Absent at the Forum
 But Mr. Christopher's trip to China has trained the spotlight on Mr. Lord. At the Council on Foreign Relations forum, Douglas H. Paal, who directed Asia policy on the National Security Council under President Bush, said, "If you find a policy is not serving United States interests, then you sacrifice somebody and get rid of the policy. That's how we do it in Washington."
Mr. Lord was not there to defend himself at the forum, where three former Secretaries of State -- Mr. Kissinger, Cyrus R. Vance and Lawrence S. Eagleburger -- also criticized the Administration for linking trade and human rights. At a planning meeting for the forum, Mr. Vance had argued that Mr. Lord might feel constrained in what he could say and that if a Government official were present, the council would also have to invite members of Congress. Thus the invitation was withdrawn.
 
'Present at the Creation'
 "The goal of the hearing is to offer realistic policy options to government and not to investigate government policy," Karen Sughrue, the vice president of meetings, wrote in a letter faxed to Mr. Lord's office in Washington on the day he arrived in Beijing. Saying no other Government official would attend, she added, "We appreciate your understanding on this and hope that it allows you to more fully recover from the jet lag following your Asia trip."
Mr. Lord was insulted. "It was stupid and dumb," he said. "I was present at the creation of the China policy. I had just come back the night before from meeting with Chinese leaders. I am a former president of the council. I'd like to think I might have added something to the discussion."
But ask him about the more substantive criticism of his and the Administration's performance on China and the rest of Asia, and his mood shifts.
"I'm very confident in our policies," he said. "I'm extremely serene."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS BOLSTERING FORCES IN KOREA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26

 BODY:
While the United States seeks support at the United Nations for possible economic sanctions against North Korea, the Pentagon has been moving to bolster its forces in South Korea to protect against an attack by the North. Washington wants sanctions imposed if North Korea continues to block inspections of its nuclear program.
To improve the ability to rush warplanes to South Korea, Defense Secretary William J. Perry has ordered the Air Force to build up its supply of munitions and spare parts there. The Army has also begun to replace older helicopters in South Korea with new Apache attack helicopters. 
 These steps have received less attention than the decision to send Patriot antimissile interceptors to Korea, but Mr. Perry told reporters in recent days that the Administration is planning further steps to strengthen its military position if the Security Council votes to impose sanctions.
 
Threats From the North
 The decision to prepare for a possible military confrontation is driven by North Korea's angry threats, the vast distances involved and the small size of the forces that Washington has in the area.
While Mr. Perry had said there does not appear to be an imminent threat of war, North Korea has threatened to attack South Korea if sanctions are imposed. Because it has concentrated much of its 1.2 million troops close to the border with South Korea, the north would be able to attack very quickly.
At the United Nations, the United States has prepared a draft resolution demanding that North Korea allow international monitors to complete their inspections of nuclear sites. The resolution warns that the Council will consider further action if necessary, an indirect reference to economic sanctions.
But China has proposed a somewhat weaker step that would not require the measure to be put to a vote, according to Asian and United States diplomats. China wants the president of the Council merely to issue a statement urging the North Koreans to comply. A United States official said Washington might go along with this if it is clear that sanctions will be considered if North Korea does not heed the warning.
 
Technological Upgrade
 Either way, military experts say, the Pentagon needs to strengthen the ability of its 37,000 troops in South Korea to defend themselves, and improve its ability to send reinforcements.
The United States warplanes in South Korea, for example, are a far cry from the armada of aircraft that Washington sent to Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war. The United States has only three squadrons of warplanes in South Korea, and only one squadron -- of 24 F-16's -- can drop laser-guided bombs.
The United States also has F-15's and F-16's in Japan, but the F-15's are air-to-air fighters and none of the F-16's in Japan can deliver laser-guided bombs.
If North Korea attacked, F-117 stealth fighters, F-15E's and other sophisticated planes would be rushed to South Korea and Japan. The move ordered by Mr. Perry will insure there are enough spare parts and munitions so the planes can go into action quickly if necessary.
Mr. Perry told reporters on Friday that the Pentagon planned "to take every step we can take so that our tactical air could be applied in a matter of a day or two or three rather than a week or two or three."
The Council is expected to issue a warning to North Korea within a few days. Mr. Perry said the United States would probably wait four to six weeks to see if North Korea complies before seeking economic sanctions. But he acknowledged that it was not clear whether sanctions would lead North Korea to permit inspections.
"We have a very limited knowledge of what drives the thinking of the leadership in the North Korean Government, w hat is likely to cause them to respond in a positive way, what is likely to cause them to respond in a negative or in a backlash sort of a way."

Katie's Back, But Her Gloves Are Missing

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

 BODY:
BEVERLY FICON remembers the white glove and snood years at Katharine Gibbs School. That was before some voices of feminism began scorning the very idea of teaching a woman to be an office secretary, as if it were capitalism's version of foot-binding.
"I came in during the era of hat and gloves, when the girls used to wear hairnets because hair was not to touch their shoulders," says Ms. Ficon, who began 28 years ago at the Katharine Gibbs School in Montclair, N.J., and is keeper of a flame that's far from sputtering as the chain of seven office-skill schools approaches renaissance. 
 Katie Gibbs, as insiders refer to this veritable Ivy League in the arts and sciences of boss management, telephonic stonewalling and water-cooler politesse, has been taken over by new owners. Actually, it's been retaken by devotees who had acquired the schools in 1968 from the heirs of the scrappy founder, Katharine Gibbs. Until the corporate cannibalism of the 1980's, they happily ran the franchises for two decades through thick and thin, including the dog days of feminist attacks, says Eleanor P. Vreeland, who has returned as Katie Gibbs chairwoman after a five-year interruption.
"Katie's back and we've got her," says Ms. Vreeland, a one-time secretary who is engineering the fast capital improvements ordered by Katie Gibbs's new buyer and old suitor, William F. Reilly, chairman of K-III Communications. One asset in the deal is Ms. Ficon's ability to handle modern individualistic students yet maintain a dress code (skirts and jackets, moderate heels, no Bacchanalian-patterned panty hose) and even occasionally see to silver-and-china coffee-serving nuances at the Montclair school.
Still, Ms. Vreeland plans no return to white gloves and snoods. She herself climbed through several swaths of the corporate jungle, facing down the sororal sniping at Gibbs by telling the students: "Ignore hang-ups about enslaving women." Rather, she teaches that the school is about nothing less than mastering corporate power at its central locus and earning promotions. She says that's what 52 percent of Gibbs graduates do within two years. "In Latin, a secretary is 'keeper of the secrets,' " Ms. Vreeland says with a Machiavellian lilt. "We teach people how to use power correctly."
No less impressive is that Ms. Vreeland refers to other women as "gals" and gets away with it, in a kind of Katie Gibbs, having-it-both-ways toughness. Ms. Ficon and counterparts like Julia Slick at the Manhattan school are valued by the new owners for their institutional memory, but even more for their ability to adapt to the modern era of ambitious single parents and well-educated but frustrated careerists. They are finding want ads and college degrees little benefit in the current world of job hunting. So they're choosing a more practical way to catch the boss's eye, learning secretarial skills at $7,495 for a full year's classes.
"We're countercyclical to the economy," Ms. Vreeland says of curriculum options ranging from three months to two years. Corporate personnel directors lately pursue a kind of steerage head-hunting through the placement service Gibbs runs for its 3,000 students and 75,000 alumnae -- and alumni, though still 90 percent of the students are women. One Boston law firm, reckless in its Katie Gibbs flirtations, greets a new hire from the school with an immediate two-week vacation, then a bouquet of flowers upon return to put an early gloss on the back-room treadmill. In the Reagan-Bush years, 12 Katie Gibbs graduates worked at the White House, burnishing Mrs. Gibbs's legend.
The widow Gibbs, who died in 1934, was known for inventing the business world's "finishing school" in 1911 out of the need to survive as a mother of two with no prospects. Even beyond that, all lovers of the romance of the office place (especially fans of Susan Ruttan, the Katie Gibbs alumna who went on to become the omnipotent, indispensable secretary in television's "L.A. Law") should sigh in salute to Katharine's son, Gordon. He married Blanche, his own office secretary. Blanche proved to have the moxie, like more than one Gibbs alumna, eventually to run the entire business in the 50's and keep the Katie Gibbs spirit and schools alive.
"It's funny," Ms. Vreeland says, "but nobody ever has a conversation without mentioning white gloves when they hear I'm from Katie Gibbs. The days of requiring gloves and teaching how to balance a teacup are gone, but they still translate for me into teaching business manners and a dress code. We don't want one of our gals to go into a board room and become the big attraction by bumbling about."
Let there be no lament for white gloves at Katie Gibbs. Take heart in the plans for expansion and for an alumnae meeting this fall at which white gloves will inevitably be mentioned and some women will dare to salute their peers as gals.

Eric Show's Solitary Life, and Death

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
The patient had not appeared for breakfast, and so at 8:05 A.M. on March 16, according to the log of the Rancho L'Abri Drug and Alcohol treatment center in nearby Dulzura, a civilian assistant named Keith Langhorn "entered room #6 of the lodge to check on Eric S."
"Observed patient lying on his bed and noted no rise and fall of chest," Langhorn noted. "Went for help from graveyard staff member Brent S. We checked the pulse and tried to wake patient. No response. Noted eyes were dilated and body cold. I left staff member with the body to call executive director, who instructed me to call medical director. Instructions given to call 911. Which was done immediately. Checked for heartbeat. None detected." 
 Shortly after, on that sunny Wednesday morning in the quiet farming village about 35 miles from the heart of San Diego, the fire department arrived, and then the sheriff. But the the man with longish dark hair and a dark mustache who wore a white-T shirt and white briefs could not be revived.
He lay on top of the blanket on the bed in the small, simple room, his hands on his chest, a few pieces of luggage in a corner, jeans and a shirt tossed on top of a dresser and a .22-caliber revolver loaded with five bullets under his pillow.
He wore one piece of jewelry -- a wedding ring.
And Eric Vaughn Show, who just two years earlier had ended his 11-year major-league pitching career with the Oakland A's after pitching for 10 years with the San Diego Padres, and who had started games in the 1984 National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs and the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, was pronounced dead. He was 37 years old.
An autopsy released soon after by the coroner's office said the cause of death was inconclusive, that is, there was no observable trauma or wounds to the body. A toxicology report would be coming in about two weeks. But in statements to the center's staff, Show said that he was under the influence of cocaine, heroin and alcohol. He said he used four $10 bags of cocaine at about 7 that night, Tuesday night. "Didn't like how I felt," he said, adding that he then ingested eight $10 bags of heroin and a six-pack of beer.
The questions about Eric Show's death are no less difficult to answer than the ones about his life. Why was he so hard on himself, such an apparently driven individual? Why was he so compulsive, or at least passionate, about almost everything he undertook?
Show (the name rhymes with cow) was known as a highly intelligent, articulate man with broad interests that ranged from physics -- his major in college -- to politics to economics to music. "Eric didn't fit the mold of the typical ballplayer," said Tim Flannery, a former Padre teammate of Show's. "Most ballplayers were like me then; we had tunnel vision. We weren't interested in those other things."
Show was a born-again Christian who regularly attended Sunday chapel services as a player and sometimes signed his autograph with an added Acts 4:12, which discusses salvation as coming only from belief in Jesus Christ.
He was an accomplished jazz guitarist. Sometimes after games on the road, he would beat the team back to the hotel and play lead guitar with the band in the lounge.
He was a member of the right-wing John Birch Society, a fact the baseball world was surprised to learn in August 1984 as the Padres moved toward their first and only division title.
And he was a successful businessman with real estate holdings, a marketing company and a music store, all of which kept him in expensive clothes, with a navy-blue Mercedes and a house in an affluent San Diego neighborhood.
But other elements seemed to intrude. And ultimately, the contradictions of the best and worst in American life became a disastrous mixture that defeated him.
 
Beyond Statistics, Just Who Was He?
 For most baseball fans, Eric Show was a decent pitcher who had once been lucky enough to make it to the World Series. But to the people who were close to him, he was, in the end, someone they did not fully know.
"He led several lives, apparently," said Arn Tellem, his agent at the time of his death.
To Joe Elizondo, his financial consultant, and Mark Augustin, his partner in a music store, and Steve Tyler, a boyhood friend from Riverside, Calif., where both were born and raised, Show was a charming, devoted friend and a caring man. "He would give you the shirt off his back," Elizondo said. "And he did. I once told him how much I liked a shirt he was wearing, and he said, 'Here, it's yours.' He'd stop a beggar on the street and learn he was hungry and run to a diner and bring back a hot meal for him."
To others, though, Show could seem selfish or arrogant.
And there were the drugs. Some said Show's drug problems began when he took injections to relieve pain in his back after surgery, and he sought more and more relief. Others wondered if he had been taking drugs before he reached the major leagues.
He may also have begun taking drugs simply because he liked the challenge of being able to handle the dreaded substance. After all, his job was to accept challenges and, being a professional athlete, to overcome them often. And during the early- and mid-1980's, Show's first years as a major leaguer, numerous players were using cocaine, including his teammate, Alan Wiggins, who liked to argue with Show and later died of AIDS.
Show, who stood 6 feet tall and weighed 185 pounds as a player but was listed in the last year of his life at 165 pounds, had been in and out of several rehabilitation centers in recent years. He had been in L'Abri for a month, from Feb. 12 to March 14. The average stay is 45 days, or until a person's insurance runs out. But Show appeared "anxious" to leave the center on March 14, according to the report of a staff member, although he was urged to stay. The center is a voluntary refuge, and Show got his way, and departed.
Apparently, he eventually headed for a seedy section of downtown San Diego, where he bought drugs and went on a binge. By 11 P.M. on Tuesday, March 15, Show had returned to his home, a two-story, four-bedroom, tan and green stucco house on a cul-de-sac, and called the rehabilitation center. He said he had been "using" and wanted to return to the center. Would someone come and pick him up? A van arrived 45 minutes later.
"I'm weary," he said when he arrived at the center. He said he had vomited a few times after taking the heroin. "I have to lie down," he said. Not long after, he was dead.
His death evoked memories of two strange scenes in Show's life, one in 1992 and the other last year.
In the spring of 1992, Show was in training camp in Arizona with the A's. He had signed a two-year contract with them in late 1990, and managed only a 1-2 record with them in 1991. Following several mornings in which he had reported late for workouts, he showed up with both hands heavily bandaged.
He explained that he had been chased by a group of youths and had to climb a fence, and had cut himself. But what was not reported was that the police later told club officials that Show had been behaving erratically in front of an adult book store, and fled when officers approached. They finally caught him trying to climb a barbed-wire fence.
Last July, he was caught by the police when running across an intersection in San Diego and screaming that people were out to kill him, and then begged the police to kill him. He was handcuffed, and while in the back seat of the police car, he kicked out the rear window. He was taken to the county mental hospital for three days of testing. Show had admitted "doing quite a bit of crystal methamphetamine."
It was one more startling development, one more contradiction for an athlete who, in reference to his John Birch membership, once said: "I have a fundamental philosophy of less government, more reason, and with God's help, a better world. And that's it."
 
'Always Looking For Answers
 Actually, it wasn't it. Show, as a John Birch member, also denied that he was a Nazi or a racist. In fact, he had a Hispanic financial adviser, a Jewish lawyer and agent, and black friends in baseball and his music world. People from his first agent, Steve Greenberg, to Tony Gwynn, a black teammate, agreed that he was no bigot. "He joined the Birch Society because he thought it would provide answers to how the world works," Tellem said. "He was always looking for answers."
Show once said, "I've devoted my life to learning." Asked what he was learning, he replied, "Learning everything." He read voraciously, spent hours in museums and had long, heartfelt discussions with anyone who would meet his intellectual challenges.
The intellect was apparent at Ramona High School, where he was a star student and pitcher. The sense of risk was evident to his friends, who remembered him climbing a 60-foot sheer cliff, and then waving his shirt in defiance.
But in his home, there was heartbreak. His parents divorced while he was still at Ramona. And between the son and the father, Les, an engineer who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, there was a constant conflict.
"He had a very difficult father," said Jack Smitheran, Show's baseball coach at the University of California in Riverside. "He was extremely involved, extremely result-oriented. One time he stuck his head in the dugout and began talking to Eric. I don't know what he said, but it was after Eric had thrown a bad inning. I told him to leave."
In college, Show met his wife, the former Cara Mia Niederhouse, whose given name was chosen by her father, for the song. She was soft-spoken, with reddish-brown hair. Friends described her as "cover-girl beautiful."
They met when he was playing in a college summer league in Kansas. He was a senior; she was a college junior who was home on vacation.
There were no children in their 16-year marriage, which lasted until his death. Cara Mia tried to set "boundaries," Elizondo said, and always allowed him back into the house. But like Show's college friends, she was unable to control his behavior.
When he left college in 1978, Show was signed by San Diego, and within three years, on the strength of a good fastball and a sinker, he was wearing the Padres' uniform.
In his first full season, in 1982, he was 10-6. Two years later, he was 15-9 as the Padres surprised everyone by beating the Cubs in the playoffs and making it to the World Series, where they lost to the Tigers.
Like the other starting pitchers on the Padres, Show was awful in the post-season, giving up seven home runs in eight innings. Derisive fans took to calling him "Long Ball Show."
But his post-season failure was quickly overshadowed by other events in his career. On Sept. 11, 1985, he gave up a single to Pete Rose, alllowing Rose to break Ty Cobb's all-time record of 4,192 hits. While the crowd in Cincinnati roared, and play halted for 20 minutes, Show sat on the mound. Some thought it was disrespectful, but Show said he had nothing else to do.
It was one incident, and there others. Jerome Holtzman, a baseball writer for The Chicago Tribune, recalled a game in which Show threw only slow pitches. "They were all nothing balls, and he got clobbered," Holtzman said. "I was amazed." Holtzman went to the Padres' manager, Jack McKeon, and asked about the performance. "Eric was experimenting," McKeon told Holtzman, with a shrug. "That's Eric."
"Guys know he marches to his own drummer," Flannery said during Show's days with the Padres. And while Flannery said "we just chuckle at him and leave him alone," Show irritated some players, sometimes pouting visibly on the mound when an outfielder didn't get to a ball he thought should have been caught.
In 1988, Show was 16-11 for San Diego, the most victories he ever had in a season. The next June, he suffered a lower back injury and had surgery to remove a disk. To pitch despite pain, Show began taking cortisone shots. Some said they believed that was the beginning of Show's drug problems, and that he sought more and more relief.
In the fall of 1990, after an 8-6 season, Show was released by the Padres. By then, there had been instances of erratic behavior: late arrivals, confrontations with management and screaming matches with other players. The A's, who had rehabilitated veteran pitchers from other teams, took a chance and signed him to a $1.6 million contract for two years. But there were problems, and assorted unexplained injuries in his 1-2 season of 1991. And then in the spring of 1992, baseball bid him goodbye.
"We tried to get help for him through our employee assistance program," Sandy Alderson, the A's general manager, said. "And we did. But it obviously didn't work."
Still, Show seemed to continue trying to get free of the addiction.
Mike MacIntosh, the San Diego Police Department chaplain, recalled how Show had called him around Christmas and wept on the telephone, pleading for help.
And just a few days before he died he wrote a tender letter to his wife, saying he hoped to draw a line between the part of his life that was, and the part of his life that would follow. He talked about a comeback in baseball, and said he was working on a new pitch -- a "cup ball" that would work as a changeup.
And then, on that last Tuesday night, when Show went back to the rehabilitation center for the last time, Elizondo recalled that Cara Mia and Eric had embraced and she had said gently, encouragingly, "Go get 'em, honey."
 
An Open Casket, A Padre Cap
 At the Acheson and Graham Garden of Prayer Funeral Home in Riverside, Eric Show lay in an open green casket, while outside an unexpected downpour struck the building. A Padres' baseball cap and a baseball had been placed beside Show, along with a guitar and a picture of Steve Tyler and him when they were boys. A cross hung around Show's neck.
Dave Dravecky, who had been a John Birch member with Show in 1984, gave the eulogy, talking about how Show had helped him deal with the loss of his pitching arm to cancer. Elizondo spoke about how warm and passionate Show had been as a friend. All the members of Show's family were there, except for his ailing father.
Cara Mia had requested that Romans 7:5-25 be read. "For the woman which hath an husband," it says at one point, "is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth." And: "But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members."
And: "O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
"He tried, oh, he tried so desperately," his sister Leslie Cifelli, said. "But he couldn't free himself."
It was recalled at the funeral that Show had a deep yearning to learn, experience and reach out. Show once related the following incident to a friend: On a clear night when he was 7, he took his mother's hand and pointed to the heavens. "Mom, there's something out there beyond those stars and that moon," he said, "and I'm going to find the answer."
Perhaps, now, he has.

The Jimmy and Jerry Show Could Be Heading for Cancellation

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

 BODY:
IT'S inevitable. Sooner or later, Jimmy Johnson or Jerry Jones will file for a Dallas divorce. They're incompatible. And after the latest spat between the Cowboy coach and the Cowboy owner-general manager, it might be sooner instead of later.
For all the rule changes adopted at the National Football League meetings in Orlando, Fla., the Jimmy and Jerry Show will eventually affect competitive balance much more than the new 2-point conversion. 
 It's not economics, it's egonomics. Jimmy and Jerry simply don't get along. The morning after the Cowboys celebrated their second straight Super Bowl victory two months ago, Jimmy was sniping at Jerry for all the news media to hear. And now Jimmy and Jerry are sniping at each other.
It's a sitcom without much com.
The plot thickened at a N.F.L. reception in Orlando, Fla., when Jerry walked over to where Jimmy was sitting with two of his former assistants who are now head coaches, Dave Wannstedt of the Bears and Norv Turner of the Redskins, as well as with Bob Ackles, a former Cowboys scouting director.
Jerry toasted the Cowboys' first Super Bowl triumph, in which all the men had shared a part, but Jerry was not invited to join Jimmy's group. Annoyed at the chill, Jerry returned to the bar, where he soon was growling about firing Jimmy and hiring Barry Switzer, once the professor of pigskin at Oklahoma and now at large.
The next day, Jimmy left Orlando and later acknowledged having been "deeply hurt" by Jerry's remarks.
But how deep is deeply? Deep enough to walk away from his annual $1 million salary for the next five seasons rather than coexist with the Cowboy owner? Deep enough to ignore the opportunity to be the first coach to "three-peat" in the Super Bowl?
Considering the egonomics involved, you never know.
But when Jimmy and Jerry eventually split, Jerry will be the loser. Jimmy will get the first coaching job that appeals to him. Jerry will be lucky to get another coach anywhere near as good. As long as Jimmy is on the sideline, the Cowboys, with Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman, could dominate the N.F.L. for another five seasons. But with a lesser coach, the Cowboys wouldn't be the same team.
Even after the Cowboys' first Super Bowl triumph, Jimmy wondered about his endurance in the job.
"When it gets to the point where I don't enjoy it, that's when I'll stop and head on out to the beach for good," Jimmy told Ed Hinton for his autobiography, "Turning the Thing Around" (Hyperion). "That may be 10 years from now. Or it may be next year. It could happen when we're winning, if I get to the point where I don't enjoy putting in the hours."
Especially when some of Jimmy's hours involve working with Jerry in the Cowboy offices.
Don't mistake this as another George Steinbrenner-Billy Martin re-run. George always fired and rehired Billy not because Billy was "a Yankee" but because Billy had nowhere else to go. When Jimmy and Jerry split, Jimmy will quickly surface, preferably somewhere in the vicinity of Miami, where he coached the University of Miami to two national college championships.
One theory is that Jimmy wants to coach the Miami Dolphins after Don Shula, now 64, decides to stop coaching.
Compared to the inevitable cancellation of the Jimmy and Jerry Show, the 2-point conversion will be a mere footnote in history. But what's significant is that the club owners voted for the run-pass option from the 2-yard line on the competition committee's recommendation over the objection of several coaches, including Dan Reeves of the Giants.
One of the coaches' arguments is that, with overtime, the N.F.L. doesn't need the 2-point conversion.
But if coaches don't like it because it creates another second-guess, fans will like it for the same reason. And if a team is behind by 16 points in the fourth quarter, look for Reeves and all the other disapproving coaches to call for that 2-point conversion in hopes of creating a tie with two touchdowns rather than needing two touchdowns and a field goal for a 1-point lead.
The coaches' obsession with settling for field goals in recent seasons prompted the 2-point conversion in hopes of enticing more touchdowns.
With that in mind, another new rule was created: after a missed field-goal attempt, the other team will take over at the yard-line where the ball was kicked, not the previous line of scrimmage. That 7-yard difference will prompt more end-zone punts, but it also will prompt more fourth-down risks for a first down.
In adjusting their payrolls to the high finance of free agency, the owners quietly lifted the salary-cap ceiling to $34.2 million, a raise of $400,000 from the original number.
Investing wisely in the pro football market has never been more important. Every franchise can have the best team money can buy, as long as the money isn't more than $34.2 million, the Dallas Cowboys included. But with the Jimmy and Jerry Show, the reigning Super Bowl champions are more concerned with egonomics than economics.

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform at Risk

 BODY:
The two linchpins of President Clinton's health care plan -- universal coverage and regional purchasing alliances -- are under sharp attack in Congress. Yet the Administration has responded with dismaying diffidence. If it waits much longer, the heart of its health care reform could be lost.
Universal coverage is the most important principle at risk. The President's bill would provide universal coverage primarily through an employer mandate, requiring employers to pay about 80 percent of the cost of insuring workers. But small employers bitterly oppose mandates because, they say, it will bury them in costs and force them to lay off workers. 
 That fear is greatly exaggerated, but the complaints have received a sympathetic hearing in Congress. Even the Administration's key Congressional ally, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, predicted that members would "not fall on their swords" to guarantee health insurance for every American, a pledge that Mr. Clinton has said is his irrevocable minimum goal.
Alliances, as defined in the President's bill, are regional purchasing cooperatives that would serve as giant shopping malls in which individuals could choose among private policies. Conservatives oppose alliances on the ideological premise that they smack of big government. But alliances can be made sleek and focused; they need not be regulatory monsters.
Employer Mandate. About 60 percent of the country now gets insurance through employers. To achieve his most important promise -- that never again would Americans have to fear the financial consequences of medical catastrophe -- Mr. Clinton sensibly decided to build upon the existing insurance systems. If Congress decides otherwise, it will have to replace employer-paid premiums with general taxes or payments by individuals.
Under some proposals Congress would require individuals to buy insurance, with subsidies for the poorer families. But that could mean a family of four earning only $30,000 might face a $5,500 bill for insurance that its employer used to pay. For a Congress that could barely muster enough courage to eliminate puny subsidies to beekeepers, the likelihood of passing universal coverage through any system other than employer mandates is minuscule.
Some in Congress fear that an employer mandate will drive up the costs of hiring workers and lead to large layoffs. But careful studies -- by, for example, the nonpartisan Employee Benefit Research Institute -- belie such fears. Employers pass along the costs of health insurance to workers, in the form of lower wages, and therefore have little reason to fire employees when health costs rise. For low-paid workers whose wages cannot (because of minimum wage laws) adjust, Mr. Clinton proposes subsidies to mitigate the impact. Prof. Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. estimates that under the Clinton bill, employers would have to pay between 15 and 34 cents an hour more for workers earning the minimum wage -- which, judging from experience, would not lead to large layoffs.
Alliances. Purchasing cooperatives are the best way to make sure that the chronically ill, employees of small firms and the unemployed are able to enroll in the same high-quality plans, at the same prices, as employees of Fortune 500 companies. They are also positioned to transfer money from health plans that do not sign up a fair share of chronically ill subscribers to health plans that do. Some in Congress want to make joining alliances voluntary. But that would invite healthy people to peel off and buy insurance on their own -- and force the sick into alliances with other high-risk subscribers whom the insurance companies would have to charge high premiums.
Mr. Clinton fed conservative fears by making his alliances needlessly regulatory. They, along with Federal boards, would control everything from physician prices to the number of urologists that medical schools would be allowed to train. But to protect subscribers, alliances need do little more than serve as shopping malls for competing health plans -- as Representative Jim Cooper's bill proposes. That should frighten no one.
Mr. Clinton's farsighted reforms are in jeopardy; he needs to fight harder for his bill.

Can't You Hear the Whistle Blowing?

 BODY:
IF only you know where to look in the undistinguished sub-basements of what is now Madison Square Garden, a little of the majesty of the old Penn Station lives on.
It's in parts of the marble floor that can still be seen through newer flooring, in a pink Milford granite slab of the old facade that is still visible if you look through the right hole in the drywall. 
 Tomorrow, Lorraine Diehl will show where to look. "The Late, Great Penn Station," a 90-minute tour that reveals the remnants of the station as it was before it was driven underground, takes visitors through the old carriage ways, up remaining staircases and outside to visit the only two remaining eagles of the 22 that once graced the station's roof.
The tour, which is repeated on the fourth Monday of every month, also explores the historic and economic forces that brought Penn Station into existence and, eventually, obliterated it. The old station opened in 1910; demolition, to make way for the Garden, began in 1963 and was completed by 1968.
"I try to kind of conjure the ghosts," said Ms. Diehl, who grew up in the shadow of the old station. "And a lot of times I get people who remember the station, so I bring them back into their own past."
Meet at 12:30 P.M. at the 34th Street Partnership information booth on the south side of the main waiting room in Penn Station. The tour is free. Information: (212) 868-0521.

No Dogs Allowed
Q. Many people bring their dogs into delis and other stores freely these days. But aren't pets prohibited in stores of all kinds? I think food stores may even now be forbidden to have a resident cat. 
 A. Seeing-eye dogs excepted, dogs, cats, reptiles and any other furry, feathered or scaled creatures are forbidden in all establishments that sell or prepare food.
But, cautions Steven J. Matthews, a spokesman for the city's Department of Health, if you see someone walking a Great Dane down the aisles of your neighborhood supermarket, that doesn't necessarily mean you can call in the law.
"We can't cite for what we can't see," Mr. Matthews said. The ticket would be issued to the grocery, not the offending pet owner, and the size of the fine would be determined by whether the animal was discovered in a food-preparation area.
For a first offense sighting of, say, a kitten curled up behind some boxes of tissues, the fine would be $100. But if the kitten was caught on the warm spot at the top of a refrigerator, the fine would double. The fines go up to $1,000 for repeat offenses.
As for other kinds of stores, none of the city agencies contacted were aware of any particular bans.
 
The 4 Blocks of Granite

Q. There are large stone blocks over the four columns at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's entrance. It seems as if the museum may have had plans to carve statues from the blocks. What should belong there, why were they never carved, and are there any plans to carve them?
A. In 1953, 50 years after the building was completed, your question was such a hot topic among people who visited the museum that the museum's bulletin published a lengthy article on the subject by the Met's archivist, Albert Ten Eyck Gardner.
Yes, the blocks were included in the facade's design with the intent that they would one day be carved. Four large groups of carvings, representing the great periods of art -- ancient, classical, renaissance and modern -- were originally planned to be cut into the stones.
Economics, politics and the birth of trade unionism intervened.
First, the project was so expensive that a choice had to be made between carving the blocks or completing the interior of the museum, according to the bulletin article.
Politics became an issue because of questions about who would be chosen to sculpt the groups and how the vast, evolving range of modern art could be captured.
Finally, Mr. Gardner suggests, unions were a factor because they had not yet succeeded in organizing craftsmen and fine artists. The Plasterers Union was working on the museum's interior, and the Building Committee worried that if a nonunion sculptor was hired, the Plasterers Union would go on strike.
So the stones remained -- and will remain -- rough.
 
Fire Island
 Q. I was recently on the train to Boston, and sometime after we left the tunnel out of Manhattan, I noticed a strange set of red brick buildings on what must be the northeastern edge of Randalls Island. About four stood in a row, all alone, with no cars or people or anything around them. Is this an abandoned housing project?
A. It's the Fire Department's training facility. Probationary firefighters go to school there and, among other things, learn how to put out fires in several of the nine buildings.
All the buildings at the academy are constructed of poured concrete, faced with brick, and each is marked by an enormous number to help the new firefighters orient themselves. To ease concerns about the environmental impact of ash and smoke, the fires are fueled by propane and controlled by a computer system. The smoke is artificial, too.
With a few exceptions, fires are started only in Building Two, known as "the burn building."
 
Higher Underground
 Q. In the BMT station at 34th Street, the southbound platform is higher than the northbound one. Why?
A. In 1918, when the BMT station was built, its southbound platform was built higher to accommodate a station of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad Company, just below. In 1937, the Hudson & Manhattan station was moved south a block.
After the old station was sealed -- and sealed it remains -- the southbound subway platform stayed where it was, on the principle that there's no need to fix what isn't broken, explained Charles Seaton, a spokesman for the Transit Authority. NINA REYES

HEADLINE: Labor and Environmentalists Find Accord on L.I. Sound

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
IF Moses had had to file an environmental-impact statement before crossing the Red Sea, we'd all be speaking Egyptian now.
"That was a sentiment," reported George Drapeau 3d, "that I overheard when unemployed construction workers gathered at a demonstration in 1992 to vent their anger and frustration at environmentalists whom they blamed for their plight." Mr. Drapeau is director of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and the Hudson Valley, an industry trade group. 
 Nancy Seligson, president of the Long Island Sound Task Force, an environmental group, concurred.
"Historically it is true that the environment and the economy have had different interests at heart," she said. "Whenever the two groups got together and the discussions focused on jobs versus the environment, it would end in controversy and angst."
Surprisingly, the situation began to improve in the unlikely setting of the January 1992 labor rally, where more than 1,500 angry construction workers staged a demonstration. It was then that the two adversarial groups took an extraordinary first step toward working together for the common good, Ms. Seligson said.
Mr. Drapeau recalled: "The demonstration was to protest lost jobs because of potential sewer moratoriums. It took place outside the Stouffer Westchester Hotel on Red Oak Lane in White Plains where an environmental conference was being held. It was a very heated demonstration. The potential moratorium on sewer upgrades was crippling the construction and building industries, which were experiencing a 35 percent unemployment rate at the time."
Ms. Seligson recalled that at the height of the demonstration Terry Backer, the Long Island Soundkeeper, whose brother is in the construction industry, said, "Let me speak." Mr. Backer went outside, she said, and "in his robust style told the crowd that the environmentalists realized that the construction industry was suffering. He said he hoped the two groups would find a balance by holding open dialogue, and he extended the olive branch. And that was the start."
The position of Long Island Soundkeeper, an environmental watchdog, was established by a fund set up in 1988 by a group of commercial fishermen, the Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association. The group won a settlement from the City of Norwalk for dumping sewage in the harbor.
Mr. Drapeau further capitalized on the opportunity by bringing Mr. Backer and Ross Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council, together to discuss their problems on a television cable show soon after the rally.
"They helped create an atmosphere in which former foes managed to put their conflicting interests aside for the first time," Mr. Drapeau said. "The result was that eight environmental groups and nine industry and labor organizations got together for the first time and formed the Clean Water/Jobs Coalition."
 
Jobs Begetting Jobs
 What began in Westchester, Mr. Drapeau continued, is now supported by more than 180 industry, labor and environmental groups and municipal organizations nationwide that have banded together to seek support for legislation that will provide major financing for cleaner water, more stringent pollution controls and restoration of natural estuaries.
And jobs will be created, Mr. Drapeau said, through upgrading sewer-treatment plants.
"Sewer-treatment work is labor-intensive," he said. "A waste-water treatment plant is a marvel of engineering. And there are jobs for craftsmen of all kinds needed. Teamsters, carpenters, electricians and, of course, engineers will be hired to do the work. We estimate that upgrade of sewers in the Long Island Sound area alone would mean that a total of 340,000 jobs would become available, since with every primary sewer job 16 other jobs are created."
Ms. Seligson added that a recent study estimated that clean-water infrastructure projects would yield 57,000 direct and indirect jobs for every $1 billion invested.
"For our Long Island Sound area, the indirect benefits include increases in the shellfish, recreation and tourism industries, which give a greater return to the economy than building roads," Ms. Seligson said. "The quality of water is the most precious resource a community has. Clean-water restoration is especially critical for Long Island Sound, which is a national treasure. It is an estuary of tremendous significance, the determining geographical point in our region that allows us to attract high-level employees who want to live here."
About 10 percent of the population of the United States lives within 50 miles of the 110-square-mile body of water, a population density that has almost caused the death of the native ecosystem. Pollution, the destruction of marshes and wetlands that serve as filters for the waterway, plus billions of gallons of raw or partly treated sewage empty directly into the Sound every day, compounding its problems.
Investment in water-pollution control, Mr. Drapeau said, will increase the rate of return on private capital, increase the growth rate of labor productivity, stimulate private plant and equipment investment and expand the local tax base.
"But we cannot go it alone," he said. "It's a national problem. We desperately need Federal help to get sewage-treatment plants in Westchester up to par. It is estimated that it will cost $6 billion over the next decade to accomplish this in Westchester. We want the Federal Government to assist municipalities with money to protect water quality. Sure, the country could solve all water-pollution problems by spending $137 billion, but that's not likely to happen. What we are realistically asking for is an increase in Federal funding from $2.5 billion to $5 billion annually."
 
Runoff From Massachusetts
 Mr. Drapeau said that passage of the Water Pollution Control Estuary Restoration Act, written by Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Harrison, and Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of New Haven, would provide funds to upgrade sewage-treatment plants in New Rochelle, Mamaroneck, Blind Brook and Port Chester.
"Our overflow problems are severe," Mr. Drapeau said. "For example, the sewage-treatment plant on the Post Road in Mamaroneck, which is the last one to be overhauled, serves White Plains, Larchmont, Mamaroneck, Scarsdale and parts of New Rochelle, Rye, Harrison and North Castle. A total of 282 miles of sewer lines feed into it. That's roughly the distance from Mamaroneck to Provincetown on the tip of Cape Cod."
Mr. Drapeau continued: "The plant has a capacity of delivering primary treatment of 2.6 million gallons a day. That figure can be expanded to 40 million gallons. Yet with all the snow and storms we have had this winter, a capacity of 92 million gallons a day was needed. What happens to the excess runoff? It goes right into the Sound."
One of 21 national estuaries, Long Island Sound is bordered by New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island and receives waste water from parking lots and streets in Massachusetts and Vermont by way of the Connecticut River as well as more local runoff and plant discharge.
Ms. Seligson said: "Because of the geographical importance of our national estuaries, we feel that the Federal Government must take a leadership role and pay an equitable share of the cleanup costs. States and municipalities can't do it alone. The water-pollution-control bill will provide funds to correct sewer overflows, restore and protect wetlands and address other pollution problems. All of us are affected. We have to increase pressure to pass legislation that will expand the Federal commitment to improving water quality."
Mr. Drapeau concluded that one benefit has already been realized from what had been a controversy. "The old thinking that pitted the construction industry against environmentalists has been retired at last. What started on Long Island Sound has become a nationwide effort with all groups working together."

HEADLINE: The Freedom to Choose Doctors: What Freedom?

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein; Michael M. Weinstein, an economist, is a
member of The New York Times editorial board who has written about managed competition since 1991.

 BODY:
THE LAST TIME I TRIED TO donate blood, the nurse declared me anemic on the basis of a routine finger-prick test. So I called my internist to ask whether I should redo an extensive battery of blood tests I had passed only two months earlier.
 Barely concealing contempt, he snorted: "If you belonged to an H.M.O., the answer would be no! But because you're my patient, the answer is yes." 
I've come to expect my doctor to be cranky; he doesn't like me very much. It's not that he thinks I neglect my family or mistreat my friends. I've done worse: I promote managed competition as the way to fix the health care system. Managed competition, my internist believes, will squeeze doctors and patients into cookie-cutter, profit-making medicine.
 Some of my friends aren't all that pleased with me, either. They, too, are obsessed with the idea of choosing doctors freely. Managed competition -- the basis of President Clinton's bill and the starting point for Congressional deliberations -- would, according to this line of thought, push the population into health maintenance organizations that limit the patient's choice of physicians. Supposedly that would tear many people away from beloved family doctors and relegate poor people to second-rate care.
 Mr. Clinton's bill would radically change how Americans buy health insurance. And there are many reasons to believe the plan won't work unless amended. But the assertion that consumer choice would be imperiled is a canard. For the vast majority of Americans, managed competition would provide more and higher-quality choice.
 Some Americans have the kind of health care choices Clinton critics idealize. If you work for the Government or a Fortune 500 company, you are offered an attractive array of policies. And if you are healthy, rich and live near a university-based medical center, you are guaranteed access to first-rate care.
 But if you have AIDS or another chronic illness, forget choice. In most states, it's the insurance companies that choose -- or don't choose -- you. Sick people aren't on their desirable list. If you buy your own coverage because you're unemployed, self-employed or work for a company that offers none, expect it to cost 40 percent more than group policies.
 There's often little effective choice of health care even for families with fee-for-service coverage, which lets patients choose doctors and doctors choose treatments. Many pick a local family physician without a clue as to his or her ability; the family physician, in turn, picks specialists without knowing their level of competence. Rural families and the urban poor have few doctors nearby to choose from.
 In the low-income neighborhoods of Philadelphia and New York where I do volunteer financial consulting, one of the biggest hurdles my clients face is finding a competent doctor. Even those on Medicaid and Medicare can't find physicians willing to accept them for the punishingly low fees set by the Government. The consequences can be grim. Eddie, an adorable 8-year-old with asthma, bounces from one emergency room to another, never getting the steady attention of a family physician. Thomas, a middle-aged man with cancer, turns down work that would lift him out of poverty because the new employer's plan would not cover his condition. For the urban poor, freedom to choose doctors is a sick joke.
 Small employers who provide insurance pay high premiums, leaving them less money to pay wages. And few small firms provide much choice: over 85 percent offer only one health care plan, more and more often not fee-for-service. That locks millions of Americans into one often skimpy policy that can be downgraded or dropped at any time.
 The situation would change drastically under Mr. Clinton's managed-competition proposal.
 Say you have a history of heart problems and work for a firm that doesn't provide coverage. Forced to fend for yourself, you buy what's available: an expensive policy that exposes you to unlimited out-of-pocket costs should a hospital stay run overlong.
 Under Mr. Clinton's bill, you and your neighbors would pick a plan through an alliance, a gigantic regional purchasing cooperative. Your employer would have to pay around 80 percent of the average-cost plan; for a more expensive policy, the extra cost would come out of your pocket. Choices would include fee-for-service and managed-care plans like H.M.O.'s that would cover the same basic benefits (you would pay for nonessentials like private rooms) and limit annual out-of-pocket expenses to $3,000 no matter how much care you needed. Insurers could set their own premiums (within limits), but they could not charge you more than they would your healthy neighbors.
 For you, the alliances would represent a stunning triumph. The chronically ill like yourself would join the same plans, at the same rates, as the healthy -- the traditional idea of insurance. The poor would get the same coverage as the rich. And small-business employees would get the options available in large corporations. Eddie, the young asthmatic, could enroll in a full-service H.M.O. that covers routine doctor visits. Thomas, the cancer victim, could take any job he liked.
 The alliances would make comparison shopping easy. They would describe each plan's cost, treatment practices (like what percentage of children received full immunization) and medical outcomes (like morbidity, mortality, consumer satisfaction). Hard data, not whim and rumor, would drive your choice.
 Critics charge that the alliances would drive families away from fee-for-service coverage and into H.M.O.'s. That sounds scary. But what the accusation amounts to is that under the competitive rules laid down by the alliances, you and your neighbors will judge fee-for-service inferior to managed-care alternatives. That's possible, but hardly scary. Fee-for-service insurers will have a tough time surviving because doctors under such plans are largely unsupervised, and there is no good mechanism for monitoring quality or controlling costs. Since doctors are reimbursed for virtually anything they do, they are rewarded for wasteful procedures.
 The underlying incentive at an H.M.O., which charges a flat fee that doesn't rise with a patient's medical needs, is to cut waste and keep customers healthy through preventive care. That means limiting patients to fixed panels of doctors whose practices can be scrutinized. (I can hear my internist scowling.)
 Close supervision also gives H.M.O.'s quality improvement methods unavailable to traditional insurers. Kaiser Permanente, the huge California-based H.M.O., assigns surgical procedures to the region's best surgeon for the operation in question -- the best way known to reduce surgical mishaps. H.M.O.'s discard treatment practices that don't work and control the overuse of specialists that plagues fee-for-service medicine.
 H.M.O.'s aren't a panacea. As critics correctly point out, they have not revolutionized medicine. Maybe they never will. But under managed competition --the fair ground rules laid down by the alliances -- the best health plans would take over the market because customers decided they were best.
 OPPONENTS SEE A DARK SIDE TO THE possible rise of H.M.O.'s. In theory, a system of fixed-premium insurance would give H.M.O.'s the incentive to cut out effective, expensive care along with waste. But H.M.O.'s are smart enough to calculate that cut-rate care becomes hugely expensive once the patient becomes seriously ill.
 Some consumer groups fear that only wealthy families will be able to afford fee-for-service under Mr. Clinton's proposal, leaving the poor huddled in low-quality H.M.O.'s. To calm those fears, the Administration would provide subsidies to the poor and adjusted deductibles and co-payments for fee-for-service policies. Such premiums are not likely to exceed those of H.M.O.'s by more than 10 percent -- hardly enough differential to make H.M.O.'s a magnet for the poor.
 Families that decide to switch to managed care should not find the transition traumatic. As patients flock to H.M.O.'s, so too will doctors. You could join the same H.M.O. as your favorite doctor. You would not, however, be able to keep a stable of specialists. But Mr. Clinton took the sting out of this threat by requiring every H.M.O. to offer, at higher cost, a policy that lets you use your own specialists.
 Insurance agents attack the Administration's decision to limit choice by imposing a one-size-fits-all benefits package. They stress that the provision would hurt the young and healthy, who would no longer be able to buy stripped-down coverage or pay discounted premiums. Yet the Administration's reasoning is sound. If insurers are allowed to continue tailoring policies to individual needs, they will cater only to the healthy. And today's healthy will get burned when they get sick.
 Of all the arguments about choice, the one that hits the hardest is my internist's. His relatively unsupervised fee-for-service practice might not survive in a more competitive environment. Before long, he and his colleagues are destined to join a managed-care plan that will dictate (his word) or monitor (my word) his practice. But his animus is misdirected; managed competition is only hastening what is already happening in the market without national reform.
 Arguments about choice are not a good reason to oppose Mr. Clinton's bill -- which is not to say the bill has no flaws that demand correction. It would needlessly gather nearly everyone into alliances; that would trigger an inevitable political roll toward a regulatory monster. The plan would subsidize excessively expensive employer-provided policies. Worst of all, the bill would discourage innovation by slapping price controls on private insurance premiums. If health providers can't raise premiums to recoup the costs of quality-improving investments, they won't make the investments.
These flaws, while serious, are remediable -- and corrected in Representative Jim Cooper's bill (which, however, fails to provide universal coverage). But before Congress can correct them, it must get beyond the smokescreen thrown up by the critics who cry "Choice!" Under the Clinton bill, doctors' choices will be limited, but in palatable ways. Consumers, meanwhile, would gain an immense new choice: effective health care. If Mr. Clinton's proposal is corrected and passed, it will improve both the nation's health and the economy. Then maybe even my grumpy internist will turn friendly again.

HEADLINE: Towns At Work On Diversity For Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHEN the Westport advisory panel on school desegregation sent out a survey to 12,000 people this year, panel members were encouraged by the response to one of the first questions. Of the 2,094 people who mailed the forms back, 73 percent said it was important for children to be exposed to different cultures and ethnic groups.
But on later questions, more than 70 percent also said they thought it was important to educate children in the communities where they live even if those neighborhoods don't reflect racial and cultural diversity. 
 "In principle, people support the concept of diversity," the chairman of the Westport panel, Eugene E. Cederbaum, said, "but they have some real hard questions that the law simply does not answer, questions about how all this is going to be funded, questions about how this might affect the quality of education."
"There's a real concern about how we're going to achieve the goals," Mr. Cederbaum said. "There's a strong feeling that it should not be done at the expense of quality education. What the answers tell is us that there's a lot of work left to be done."
The diversity panels are at work in all 169 Connecticut towns, many of them scurrying to meet the April 1 deadline for submitting reports to regional committees on how they will meet the requirements of the diversity in education act passed by the legislature last year. The regional panels will begin meeting next month, and must make their recommendations by September to the state's Education Department, which will review them and send them back to the towns. By December, all towns are supposed to have adopted a plan for increasing educational quality and diversity.
An Education Department consultant working on the integration program, Jack S. Hasegawa, said many of the panels faced tough going early on, since diversity has become a buzzword for the political parties to debate issues like busing.
 
Overcoming a Scare Over Busing
 One town sent out a questionnaire that asked if people would be willing to bus children to achieve racial diversity, which prompted several hundred people to turn out for a hearing. "Everyone thought that meant they were planning on busing kids," Mr. Hasegawa said, "so they had a really steamy meeting at the midpoint of their process." The fact is, he said, there are no busing requirements in the statute that set up the panels.
Many suburban towns are calling for increased collaborative efforts with urban schools, with ideas ranging from classroom exchanges to offering courses between towns via cable television.
And many seem to be taking the initial steps to expose students to greater diversity even before the reports are completed. The Guilford Superintendent of Schools, Thomas R. Giblin, said that the town was considering leaving the Shoreline Conference, an interscholastic sports conference, for a much larger South Central Connecticut Conference that is now being formed.
 
'A Real Risk'
 "It's a real risk for us," Dr. Giblin said. "We're real comfortable in the conference we're in now. But it will bring kids together from a much wider range of towns. I see things happening slowly, but over the next couple of years you'll see a lot of interesting things developing."
Most towns seem to be taking their charge far beyond the schools. Greenwich's 36-page report, "Improving Educational Quality and Diversity in the Greenwich Public Schools," contains recommendations for programs that would address the problem's societal roots.
While most of the diversity problems in town have a socio-economic basis, the report concludes "there is no doubt that problems of racial, ethnic and other forms of discrimination do exist and must be addressed."
The Greenwich report recommends, among other things, working on a regional basis to make affordable housing available so minority staff can be recruited, improving programs of educational outreach to the estimated 5,278 adults in town who do not have a high school diploma, lobbying corporations to allow parents to take time off to attend their children's school activities, and encouraging elderly people to participate in school programs.
 
Pulling Groups Together
 "It's been very encouraging to see that we could pull together Hispanics, Japanese, African Americans and various religious groups, as the meetings progressed," the Greenwich Superintendent of Schools, Dr. John A. Whritner, said.
All the diversity groups acknowledge the schism that exists in Connecticut's communities, summed up in the draft report by the Guilford diversity committee. "Our public schools reflect two Connecticuts: one largely white, affluent and suburban; the other largely non-white, urban and poor," the report said. "When the classroom mirrors the diversity within the state, we can best teach our children to appreciate and value people of other races, cultures and economic groups."
In his opening address to the legislature in 1993, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. had proposed sweeping changes in the educational system to promote diversity in education. A lawsuit, which is still pending, was challenging the segregation of Connecticut's schools -- the percentage of minority students ranges from 0 in Union to more than 90 in Hartford.
The package approved by the General Assembly and signed into law last June was watered down considerably from what Governor Weicker had proposed.
Although it set the April 1 and September deadlines for reporting, plus the yearend deadline for having a final plan adopted by each board of education and municipal council, it does not set out specific goals, provides no funding for diversity programs, or penalties for towns that do not adopt the plans recommended by the regional panels. In fact, the legislation does not even define diversity.
Still, Mr. Hasegawa said, "The bottom line is, the legislature required that the towns do this or lose their funding, and we've had 100 percent compliance."
The legislation sets out four general goals: to improve student performance, to reduce barriers to opportunity, to enhance student diversity and awareness of diversity, and to address the needs of students with limited proficiency in English.
 
Would It Erode Home Rule?
 In many areas the diversity panels have to overcome the inherent distrust of any proposal that even hints at an erosion of home rule. "Frankly, Meriden has almost nothing in common with Essex or Deep River or Haddam or Durham or some of the other towns around us," the chairman of the Meriden diversity panel, A. Patrick Alcarez, said. "The challenge to our region is, what does Meriden have to offer them?"
One committee suggestion was that Meriden offer small towns in the region access to its bilingual program via cable television. That would save neighboring towns the expense of setting up their own programs for a few students, while not requiring that students be shipped back and forth between towns.
"To the extent we can put together something that would minimize transportation and provide a link with the other towns around us, it's desirable," Mr. Alcarez said. "It opens the door to other programs."
He said one benefit of the process so far is that even if the legislation does not force any changes, it brought together people who are interested in working to increase diversity in the schools, groups that might continue working after the legislative requirements have been met and that have the ear of the boards of education.
 
Being 'Free to Dream'>
 "We're free to dream," Mr. Alcarez said. "I don't think there's anyone who thinks the recommendations we're coming up with are going to be reality anytime soon. But we also see this as an opportunity to shape the future."
The committees have ranged in size from eight-person panels in small northeast Connecticut towns to 72 people in Guilford. Most of the larger groups break into subcommittees, one for each of the goals set out in the legislation.
Greenwich, on the other hand, is among the few refusing to take the subcommittee route. It has a 40-person committee that always meets as a single group. But Dr. Whritner points out that the group is still only a fraction of the 230-member Representative Town Meeting that is the governing body of the town.
"We wanted to have something representative of the larger community to the extent it was possible," Dr. Whritner said. "The general feeling was it was better to keep everyone involved in the process. It makes us focus on something that, when it's finished, we can all buy into."
Much of the early debate focused on busing. More than 200 people turned out at a hearing in Guilford, most to oppose busing, Dr. Giblin said. "I don't think that's an issue right now," he said. "I think there will be some busing but it will all be voluntary, because some of the magnet school programs will work, and some people will be willing to put in time on the bus."
The supervisor of staff and organizational development for the New Haven schools, Marco A. Palmieri, said suburbanites should realize that urban parents have the same concerns.
"Most of our parents don't want to put their kids on a bus to make a one-hour drive out into the suburbs," Mr. Palmieri said, "but they want equal facilities, equal opportunities for their kids."
He also said that busing was not always necessary. New Haven has exchange programs with 40 suburban communities and 13 private schools now, and the Woodbridge Rotary Club, for example, recently adopted a New Haven school and will be working with its students.
"I don't think anybody is looking to put any kid into any situation in which he or she doesn't want to be," Mr. Palmieri said. "If you've got good programs, though -- good programs in safe and healthy environments -- that will attract kids."
For now, Dr. Giblin said, most educational officials realize it would be counterproductive to talk about busing, because the animosity it would generate would detract from any real progress.
 
How to Attract Students
 Dr. Giblin said that there was considerable discussion about how to lure students from town to town. Guilford, for instance, has a strong performing arts program that it might regionalize, the committee decided.
The committee discussed several options for opening the program, Dr. Giblin said. If New Haven students wanted to participate, for instance, should they attend during the school day, after school or on Saturdays?
Dr. Giblin said alternatives were also explored. Colorado allows a student to attend a course in another town where they do an entire year's studies in an intensive three-and-a-half week program. Some foreign exchange programs, if a student cannot afford to spend an entire year away, limit the time to a semester or less.
"Maybe we should be looking at smaller pieces of the year in this context as well," Dr. Giblin said. "There could be some major restructuring eventually, but we were looking at what we could be doing right now."
"The big question the committee looked at was, 'Can you have quality without diversity?' And to a person, the answer was no."
But how do people define diversity? In Westport, 38 percent of the people who responded to the diversity panel's survey thought Westport is not culturally or ethnically isolated, even though its minority student enrollment is just over 6 percent, compared to more than 10 percent on average statewide.
But Mr. Cederbaum said the process so far has forced people to as least look at diversity in the schools.
"What the act has done is stick the issue in our face, and it should stay there," he said. "I think the observations and recommendations made in the report will open the door, and Westport will step through it."

HEADLINE: Small Businesses And Tax Groups Question Proposal To Raise Sales Tax

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHEN County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke announced Monday during his annual State of the County Address here that he wanted to increase the sales tax in most Westchester communities by half a percentage point, Town Supervisor John A. Lombardi of North Castle and other municipal officials in the audience shrugged their shoulders in response.
"We're not crazy about it, but what's the alternative?" Mr. Lombardi said. "We can't continue to punish the property owner, and if we can't raise taxes one way, we have to look at another. 
 "What are our choices? Can we depend on new office construction? Absolutely not, because there already is a glut. Can we look to new industrial tracts? Well, that's pretty unlikely, too."
Although the sales tax alternative is politically more palatable than increased property taxes to vote-conscious municipal officials, it came as bad news for many small retailers in towns and villages.
 
State Approval Needed
 In Hastings-on-Hudson, Lawrence J. Marone, owner of Hastings Stationery, said he and other shopkeepers in the village were dismayed by Mr. O'Rourke's proposal. "Why do we have to bear the burden?" he said. "We need the few advantages we have."
Owners of small stores, struggling against competition from big-city enterprises, say that in addition to the personalized service they offer, lower sales tax in the county's villages and towns is their major draw.
Customers at Mr. Marone's store now pay 6.75 percent in sales tax, and many who buy their newspapers and greeting cards there travel from north Yonkers to avoid that city's 8.25 percent sales tax. The tax rate is also 8.25 percent in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon, and in White Plains it is 7.75 percent.
"In this economy, in this environment, the small shopkeeper can't afford to charge more tax," said Skip Beitzel, the owner of Hickory and Tweed, a ski and bicycle shop in Armonk. "The way it is now, it is nice for New Yorkers to come up to Westchester and see the trees and shop. And when you are talking hundreds of dollars at the cash register, the tax savings add up."
Mr. O'Rourke said during his address that he hoped the 17 members of the County Board of Legislators would join him in requesting authority from Albany to distribute the additional increase, which follows a full percentage point rise two years ago.
The estimated $33 million in revenue from the additional sales tax would be shared with towns, villages, school districts and the cities of Rye and Peekskill to help stabilize or even reduce property taxes.
 
Some Cities Unaffected
 The proposed tax increase would not affect Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers, which already have high sales tax rates.
The County Executive pledged another no-property-tax-increase in the 1995 budget if the sales tax proposal is adopted.
Stephen P. Tenore, chairman of the Board of Legislators, said that although the Board had no formal reaction, members were looking "with great interest" at increased revenues.
But he termed the proposed sales tax increase "only a short-term fix" because the County Executive was seeking an extension of the 1991 sales tax distribution authority through May 31, 1996. "It's not prudent," Mr. Tenore said, "to plan and budget for the long run knowing those revenues can dry up."
The proposal, however, has been endorsed by the Westchester Municipal Officials Association.
"If we don't do something soon, we are going to risk a taxpayers' revolt," said Arthur J. DeAngelis, mayor of Elmsford and president of the association. "A sales tax increase is the only fair way to go, and we really don't have to worry about shoppers running across any borders to save on the sales tax, because the bridges alone cost up to $4, to say nothing about the price of fuel or someone's time."
But the three-year-old Westchester Taxpayers Alliance, which represents more than 1,000 households throughout the county, was "violently opposed" to Mr. O'Rourke's proposal, said John D. Williams, a spokesman.
The alliance, which gave the County Executive its first Tax Fighter of the Year Award last year, said the needs of taxpayers would be better served by cuts in county spending and Mr. O'Rourke's proposal in the State of the County Address to reduce the work force by 10 percent over the next several years through attrition.
"The answer is that government has to become more efficient," Mr. Williams said. "And I disagree that shoppers won't be discouraged. They will be. It's amazing the lengths people will go to to save a point or a point and a half in sales tax. They will just travel to Connecticut to shop."
 
Privatization Proposed
 During his 25-minute speech in the chambers of the Board of Legislators, the County Executive also called for other measures to stabilize taxes.
He resubmitted a proposal for a cap on discretionary spending, holding spending increases to no more than the rise in the Consumer Price Index, and he asked that that plan be placed as a referendum on the fall ballot.
Mr. O'Rourke also recommended examining the benefits of privatizing some county services, including health clinics, golf courses and the County Center.
The County Executive called for an extension of the tolls on the Hutchinson and Saw Mill River Parkways from Nov. 1 -- when they are set to expire -- through April 1, 1995. He recommended forming a new parkway commission to develop a new toll structure, which would favor car pools at rush hour and help pay for increased police patrols.
To eliminate the inequity in real property assessments, Mr. O'Rourke tackled the politically sensitive issue of property assessments and asked for the creation of a citizens commission to design and implement within three years a revaluation of the county's 25 assessment jurisdictions.
"If you want proof each year of just how unfair property-tax assessments are in Westchester County, you need look no further than how our property-tax levy is split among the towns and cities," Mr. O'Rourke said during the address, his 12th since taking office. "Instead of stabilizing taxes, a no-tax-levy-increase budget results in swings -- up or down -- of several percentage points in each town and city's share. For further proof, consider the overwhelming number of certiorari actions and the tax refunds they generate."
Mr. O'Rourke predicted that county spending for certiorari refunds could be as much as $10 million in 1995. Toward that end, he said, the county was willing to pay the full cost of the revaluation, including mapping. He added that under the plan, longtime property owners would be protected by phasing in increases of more than 10 percent during a period of 10 years.
"Restoring tax fairness in Westchester makes more than financial sense -- it is also the right thing to do," Mr. O'Rourke said. "Let's summon the political courage to get it started this year."
 
Topics for a Forum
 Continuing to discuss new revenues, the County Executive said that if by May 1 he did not have a letter of commitment from the New York Racing Authority to build a teletheater in Westchester, he would recommend that the county become part of the Catskill Off-Track Betting region. At teletheaters, upscale betting parlors, betters can watch races broadcast on a giant video screen.
Part of his address focused on children and violence, and in June, the County Executive said, he will sponsor a countywide meeting on the issue. Also a school safety unit will be created in the Public Safety Department to offer security surveys to any school requesting one and to provide school districts with metal detectors and security equipment.
Mr. O'Rourke cited accomplishments of the last year, including a gun-amnesty program, relocation of 70 new companies and 10 new retailers to Westchester, an economic development program designed to create 32,000 jobs, an enhanced 911 service, a welfare-fraud detection system and the continuation of the county's AAA rating.

HEADLINE: New York Widens Work Release To Reduce Prison Overcrowding

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

 BODY:
Work release, a program allowing some inmates a large measure of freedom before parole, is increasingly being used in New York State to relieve prison overcrowding, officials acknowledge. As a result, prisoners who would not have been eligible five years ago are enrolled, including some who have repeatedly been denied parole.
As the state's Correction Commissioner makes room for newcomers in a prison system 29 percent over capacity, he says he is being forced to take too many chances with work-release participants. "We've expanded the work-release program to greater numbers than I feel comfortable with," said the Commissioner, Thomas A. Coughlin 3d. "We used to err on the side of conservatism. We now are forced to err on the side of liberalism." 
 Many other states facing overcrowding have expanded not only work-release programs but also electronic monitoring and other release provisions. But none have used work release so extensively as New York, which sent 24,200 prisoners into the program last year, up from 8,000 in 1989.
 
Seven Work-Release Centers
 The program, conceived to help convicts readjust to society as they approach parole eligibility, allows participants to leave prison for one of seven work-release centers, five of them in New York City, where they sleep, get counseling and undergo regular drug testing while they look for jobs or go to work.
As the program expands, there are worrisome signs. Last year 4,000 prisoners ran away, compared with 400 in 1989. Most were returned to custody, but more than 1,000 are at large, department figures show.
Between 4 and 5 percent are arrested for new crimes while in the program, compared with 2 or 3 percent in 1990, said James B. Flateau, a spokesman for the State Correctional Services Department. He said that the department did not keep statistics on the kinds of crimes committed by those inmates but that there were "all sorts," including homicides.
 
Still Looking for Job
 In an incident last month, 19-year-old Ramon Garcia, under the alias of Louis Medina, exchanged shots with a female police officer as he and two other suspects tried to rob people in a Brooklyn beauty salon, the police say. Mr. Garcia was serving three to nine years in prison after a 1992 conviction for robbery, Mr. Flateau said; he had entered the work-release program in December and was still looking for a job.
Another New York inmate on work release, James Revell, 23, was charged this year with robbing a gasoline station in Trenton and shooting a cabdriver at one of the gas pumps. Mr. Flateau said the inmate had been sentenced in 1990 to four to eight years in prison for robbery and had been on work release since January, working as a laborer.
The pressure to release inmates in New York and elsewhere has mounted as the cumulative impact of tougher sentences for drug offenders is felt, correction officials say. New York, though it has added more than 30,000 new prison beds in the last 11 years, has not kept up with the need. Of the state's 65,000 inmates, an average of 6,300 are now on work release at any given time.
In recent years, as the State Legislature split between senators who want to build more prisons and Assembly members who favor solutions like sentencing reform and alternatives to incarceration, an answer has been to expand work release.
Commissioner Coughlin contends that the state's prison population is swollen with nonviolent drug offenders who are more in need of treatment than confinement. He advocates increasing the capacity of drug treatment programs but also adding prison beds by transforming unused psychiatric centers into prisons; both matters are at issue in the Legislature's current budget negotiations.
 
Letters and Petitions
 None of this makes much difference to Darren McNamara's mother and three siblings. Three times the family successfully fought parole for the man convicted of bludgeoning the 22-year-old aspiring actor to death with a baseball bat. But the last time parole was denied, the killer, unknown to the family, was already living at home in Queens most days and holding a job making eyeglasses while on work release.
Since finding out last fall, the family has sent letters to public officials, circulated petitions and, most recently, filed a lawsuit seekking to send John Bonizio, who was sentenced to 6 to 18 years in 1984 for first-degree manslaughter, back to prison. They argue that a program that allows a convict to live away from a prison in effect grants parole to inmates unfit for it.
"It maddens me to no end that I have to fight the department here," said John McNamara, the victim's brother and a lawyer, who says his family has spent tens of thousands of dollars on the effort. "It's so upside down. I would think they would be our closest allies."
Mr. Coughlin said Mr. Bonizio has done well on work release, but the Commissioner acknowledges that he probably would have been turned down for the program in the past because "there are so many parole board denials." Mr. Bonizio was denied parole in 1989, 1991 and last year because of the savagery of the attack on Mr. McNamara and Mr. Bonizio's "extensive involvement in organized criminal activity," Parole Division records show.
 
Disciplinary Problems
 Mr. Coughlin said the shortage of prison space had forced him to allow the participation of prisoners who have had disciplinary problems, like fights, disobeying orders or possession of contraband, like drugs or homemade weapons. In the past, he said, nobody but those with clean institutional records would have made it into work release.
Inmates are eligible for work release if they are within two years of parole consideration. They are chosen for the program by Mr. Coughlin and his staff on the basis of factors including the inmate's attitude and behavior in prison and whether the crime involved violence. But other than two offenses that exclude an inmate from consideration -- a prison escape or a sex crime -- "there are no rules," Mr. Coughlin said.
Participants who have a home can stay there up to five days a week. Once inmates are within six months of parole eligibility, they can report to the work-release center as little as once or twice a week to submit urine samples for drug testing and see a counselor who tracks their overall performance. Mr. Coughlin said most of those who flee while on work release are drug addicts who want to avoid drug tests that could send them back to prison.
Although inmates are given at least six weeks to hunt for a job, many participants said they were allowed up to three months to look.
But many complain it is difficult to find work because they get no help. Unemployment runs high among participants -- 25 to 28 percent, including those who are laid off or dismissed -- and prisoners who fail to find a job eventually return to prison.
Those who succeed in getting employment perform a wide range of occupations, from unskilled labor to hair stylists, chefs and even security guards, correction officials said. Those who work with few exceptions must do it in the communities they come from, and they can keep the money but must pay taxes and their own expenses.
 
Looking for a Fresh Start
 Many inmates keep their jobs after release. One 29-year-old inmate at the Queensboro Correctional Facility, a work-release center in Long Island City, Queens, has been working for 11 months on a construction site and plans to continue in the $320-a-week job if he is paroled next month. The inmate, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used because he is trying to start a new life, now lives seven days a week with his girlfriend, who is pregnant with their first child.
After two convictions for selling drugs and five years in prison, he said he was ready for a fresh start.
"It's an excellent program if you want to do what's right," he said while at the center for a drug test last week. "I decided that I wanted something other than prison."
A survey conducted by the correction department in 1985 and 1986 showed that repeat offenses among participants are lower than among those freed without having participated in work release, department officials said. They said 8 percent went back to prison, compared with 27 percent for nonparticipants within a period of one to three years. The study, however, was made before participation in the program was so broadly expanded.
New Jersey has a program similar to New York's but much less extensive; 258 of the 25,162 inmates in the state prison system currently take part. There is no work-release program in Connecticut.
In New York, officials estimate that the program also saves the state $96 million each year in operational costs and an additional $330 million in construction costs for extra prison beds.
But John McNamara argues that prisoners like Mr. Bonizio do not belong in such a program. In addition to manslaughter, the inmate was convicted of trying to bribe an undercover police officer in connection with gambling operations and of possession of gambling records, both linked to organized crime, Parole Division records show.
Mr. Bonizio, 36, was accepted for the work-release program in February 1992 and transferred to the Queensboro center from the Mid-Orange Correctional Facility in Warwick. Officials at Queensboro say he leaves the center at 7:30 A.M. on Wednesdays and returns on Monday nights from home with his wife and 12-year-old daughter and his job.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Bonizio said he understood the McNamaras' anger but insisted that prison programs like work release have insured that he is prepared to return to society safely. In his 10 years in prison, he got a bachelor's degree in business management.
Mr. Bonizio, who said he never intended to kill his victim, just "scare him off," is to be eligible for parole in 1995.
"It's probably the most important program that the state of New York offers to people like me," he said of work release. "Whether Mr. McNamara likes it or not, I'm going to be released."
But John McNamara is not waiting. He has filed a lawsuit against the department charging abuse of discretion in allowing Mr. Bonizio to take part in work release and challenging the legality of his weekly five-day furloughs from Queensboro.
"I really believe that the feeling of injustice is one of the most powerful and painful of all the emotions," Mr. McNamara said, "and we've certainly had more than our share from the criminal-justice system in New York."

HEADLINE: Patients' Lawyers Lead Insurers To Pay for Unproven Treatments

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
Pamela Schmale, a 39-year-old bookkeeper, says she felt that her only hope of surviving advanced breast cancer was to have a bone marrow transplant. But her insurance company said it would not pay for the expensive and risky procedure, which is still undergoing clinical testing.
In desperation, Mrs. Schmale and her husband, Arthur, mortgaged their house in Boring, Ore., to raise the $100,000 or more they would need for the transplant. And her doctors recommended lawyers who might fight their insurance company for them.
 
Cost of Legal Advice
 The Schmales hired Sheldon Weinhaus, a lawyer in St. Louis who persuaded Mrs. Schmale's insurance company to pay the full cost of the transplant, which Mrs. Schmale had in January. Although Mrs. Schmale said her doctors told her it was too soon to know whether she would be helped, she was confident she had done the right thing. "I think it saved my life," she said. 
 In the last several years, patients have been increasingly turning to lawyers to pressure insurance companies to pay for claims that were initially denied, and some claims are even for treatments specifically excluded under their insurance plans. While this practice can help critically ill patients get access to treatments they desperately want, it raises issues of fairness, because the rewards go to those with the means to hire a lawyer.
Mr. Weinhaus said that lawyers charged, on average, about $10,000 for an insurance case and that they were not hired in such a case on a contingency basis.
The larger problem for society, some health care experts say, is that when litigious patients have their way, they hinder an important part of the effort to control health care costs: the attempt to stop paying huge sums for therapies that have no proven value.
But to litigious patients, no case is too advanced, no treatment is too expensive or too much of a long shot to be tried when the insurance companies pay the bill. And the companies, of course, merely pass the cost to the other policyholders by raising the insurance premiums.
The insurance companies usually agree to pay because of the cost of litigation and the chance that juries will impose large damage awards, said Dr. John Cova, a consultant on health insurance to the Health Insurance Industry Association. Even when a contract explicitly says the company need not pay for an experimental treatment, a jury often sides with the dying patient. The companies "are getting weary," Dr. Cova said. "They keep losing."
Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota, said the process favored the rich over the poor and the assertive and the articulate over the reticent and reluctant. "Squeaky wheels get rewarded," he said.
This kind of litigation became popular a few years ago, said Karen Gallinari, a New York lawyer who represents patients against insurance companies. Now, Ms. Gallinari said, it is common. She said she rarely had to go to court. "In most of the litigation we've been involved in, we settle early on," she said.
Recently, Ms. Gallinari got a call from a woman with Lyme disease whose insurance company was balking at paying for an expensive experimental treatment. "I told her what to say, and the next thing I knew I got a call from her saying the insurance company had decided to pay," she said.
 
Examples of Legal Might
 Examples abound of the power of the legal threats. Dr. William P. Peters, who heads a program at Duke University's medical school to treat advanced breast cancer with bone marrow transplants, reported that 19 of 39 women who had been denied payments persuaded their companies to pay after they hired a lawyer.
Dr. Thomas Spitzer, who directs the bone marrow transplant program at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that insurance companies came around after "a succession of women took their claims to court and won." Now, he said, "in the cases I am familiar with, they didn't even go to court." Just getting a lawyer was enough.
Dr. Curt Freed, who directs a program at the University of Colorado offering fetal tissue implants for patients with Parkinson's disease, said that insurance companies automatically refuse to pay for the $40,000 operation, but he added that five of eight patients who hired lawyers persuaded the companies to reverse their decisions.
"If we knew a way other than patients pressuring insurance companies and suing them, we'd be happy to follow that course," Dr. Freed said. "But it seems that the established procedure is pressure and lawsuits."
 
When to Acquiesce
 Dr. Caplan said he often questioned members of insurance company boards about how they decide when to deny payments. They use these four criteria: "Does this person have a lawyer? Is the person articulate? Have we already tried to say no at least once? Is this a person who can muster sufficient resources to give us a hard time, by getting media attention or starting a letter-writing campaign?"
Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and health economist at Stanford University, said companies tried to deny coverage for treatments like bone marrow transplants for advanced breast cancer because these therapies had not been proved effective.
"I would never blame people who have terminal illnesses and want to grasp at every straw," Dr. Garber said. But, he added, "the problem is that no one else is prepared to or able to say no."
Mr. Weinhaus said patients were not inclined to wait for science to declare that a promising treatment has crossed the line from experimental to proven. "When you're told that this is the only thing that will save your life, what are you supposed to do?" he asked.
But Mr. Weinhaus acknowledged that the system was unjust. "Why should my clients, who I would fight for to the bitter end, deserve more than anyone else?" he said.
Dr. Norman Daniels, an ethicist and health care specialist at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the country could simply not afford to pay for every treatment. Whether or not it is officially acknowledged, he added, rationing of medical care is a necessity.
"We are not obliged to provide wish fulfillment or the last chance at a miracle," Dr. Daniels said. "We are obliged to provide real assistance, and real assistance means something that works. When people say, 'If you don't do this, I'm going to sue you,' what they are doing is eroding any chance for society to say that we have got to draw a line."
Insurance industry spokesmen are dismayed by the situation. "In the current environment, it's virtually impossible or extremely difficult to ever say no," Dr. Cova said. Insurance companies are reluctant to fight their battles in court, he said, even when their contracts specifically say they are not obligated to pay for the treatments being sought, because of public sentiment. "Beating up insurance companies has become one of America's favorite indoor sports," he said.
Dr. Cova said patients and their doctors often paid no heed to the wording of health insurance contracts. He said, "The reasoning goes as follows: 'I want, and if I want something, I need it; if I need it, I have a right to it; if I have a right to it, someone else has an obligation to provide it.' "
Dr. Garber said he expected the legal battles to extend to treatments that were enormously expensive but that made only a slight difference in a patient's prognosis.
"What if bone marrow transplants allow women to extend their life expectancy from one year to 13 months, but it costs $100,000?" Dr. Garber asked. "Are we prepared to say that because we know it works, we will pay for it, no matter what it costs?
"We can write an insurance contract that will not cover it, but it will not hold up in court," he said.

HEADLINE: Britons Try All Contraptions To Halt Rampant Car Theft

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWCASTLE, England

 BODY:
When Sinclair Seymour bought a new Ford Mondeo station wagon two months ago, he took no chances. Not only did he make sure his car had a factory-equipped antitheft system, including deadbolts inside the doors, an alarm and a high-tech device that electronically locks the engine, but he also asked the dealer to install a backup alarm and mount a thick steel padlock over the gearshift.
Then, for extra peace of mind, he spent $225 more for a yellow wheel clamp, similar to the heavy metal boots some American police departments use to immobilize parking scofflaws. Now, whenever Mr. Seymour leaves his new car in a public parking lot he takes the clamp out of his trunk and locks it over his front wheel. 
 "I know, you think it's a little over the top," said Mr. Seymour, 50, a quality control technician at a local factory. "But then again, you don't live around here. If you don't want your car to be stolen, you have to take every precaution you can think of."
With drivers in England and Wales almost twice as likely as those in the United States to have their cars stolen, car security and antitheft technology have become a kind of national obsession, drawing the police, government regulators, insurers and manufacturers into a high-stakes game to stay one step ahead of the thieves.
According to United States statistics, 650 cars were stolen per 100,000 residents across America in 1992 (full figures for 1993 are not yet available). In England and Wales, the rate was 1,215 cars per 100,000 residents. The epidemic reflects not only a growing market for stolen vehicles in India, Pakistan, Nigeria and the West Indies, as well as Eastern Europe, but also the increasingly predatory tactics of young car thieves.
Given a sharp jump as well in thefts from cars, as thieves snatch purses, radios and portable phones, insurance payouts on theft claims jumped more than 800 percent in a decade to more than $713 million in 1992. At the urging of the Government and insurers, British manufacturers like Ford and Vauxhall are now arming their latest models with sophisticated antitheft technology as standard equipment.
 
Equipment Is Paying Off
 For example, the 1994 Ford Escort, Britain's best-selling car, comes with a factory-installed electronic engine immobilizer, which relies on a tiny microtransmitter in the ignition key. Unless the driver inserts the key programmed to match exactly a complex code inside the automobile's electronic control unit, the engine will not start.
An antitheft system, including the electronic engine lockout, is also standard equipment here on Ford's new Probe, which is made in the United States.
Government officials, insurers and consumers in Britain say the equipment -- coupled with growing public awareness of the problem -- is making a difference. While car crime continues to grow, the rate of increase has slowed slightly.
In the United States, only the more expensive domestic models come with alarms or other electronic antitheft devices as standard equipment. In Detroit, manufacturers say Americans are not yet prepared to pay to have immobilizers and alarms included as standard features. Instead of paying the $200 to $700 such devices could add to the list price of a car, they say, motorists prefer the option of having dealers or accessory shops install them as extras.
John Emmert, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company in Detroit, said the company was studying the systems being installed on its cars in Europe, but had no plans to make them available on its best-selling domestic models, except as options.
 
Insurance Premiums Up
 Part of the push in Britain comes from rising insurance premiums. In 1987, according to data from the United States and Britain, British drivers paid about half as much as Americans for car insurance. Since then, the Association of British Insurers reports, the average annual cost of a car insurance policy has nearly doubled, to about $638. In the United States, according to insurance statistics, the average insurance premium increased just 25 percent during the same period and is now about $710 a year.
But in areas like Newcastle, which is one of the English cities where the risk of car theft is highest, the jump has been much sharper.
Even with a good driving record and discounts for installing antitheft devices, for example, Mr. Seymour is paying the equivalent of about $1,250 for his basic insurance policy this year.
In 1992, after car theft had soared by 42 percent in two years, the Home Office began a nationwide antitheft campaign intended not only to increase consumer awareness of the problem -- a survey at the time disclosed that one in three Britons still left the car unlocked overnight -- but also to prod manufacturers to make cars harder to steal.
But the police acknowledge that one problem has been the innovative skills of the thieves themselves, who have managed to stay one jump ahead of the technology.
Last year, the police arrested a youth who was using an electronic grabber, a kind of scanner that can read the signal that is transmitted when a motorist uses a remote control device to unlock a car. The scanner can then play back the signal to unlock the car at a later point and give the thief easy entry.
 
Cars Stolen to Order
 Part of the boom in auto theft and car crime is driven by criminal rings exploiting a growing market in Eastern Europe and elsewhere for stolen luxury cars and parts. In Britain, as in the United States, cars are often stolen to order by gangs and then smuggled abroad for resale inside shipping containers.
In Manchester, which has the highest rate of auto theft in Britain -- 2,253 cars were stolen in the city in 1992 per 100,000 residents, compared with a rate of 1,700 in New York City -- the police say the problem has been complicated by new European Union regulations that have loosened border controls, making it easier for criminals to transport goods across Europe.
Detective Inspector Roland Hewitt, the head of the stolen car squad for the Greater Manchester Police Department, said that about 30 percent of the 57,880 vehicles stolen in the city last year were never recovered and were presumably shipped overseas.
"With the opening of the Channel tunnel, and European single market, we can only expect to see more activity of this sort," he said.
Still, the police acknowledge that the largest share of the problem in Britain involves not organized crime, but casual crime among young people out for thrills. According to police data, more than 75 percent of car theft involves young men under the age of 21, and nearly half of those are younger than 16, meaning they cannot legally drive in Britain.
 
The 'Mad Max' Syndrome
 Inspector Peter Aarsonson, who runs a police squad that deals chiefly with young car thieves, said that some poor youngsters in Britain were infected by what he called a "Mad Max" syndrome, referring to the crazed, leather-clad futuristic warriors whose high-speed duels in the Australian outback were the grist for a series of popular films in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
"Over the last several years, the car thief, the joy rider, has emerged as a kind of role model among kids in those disadvantaged areas where the economic downturn has hit the hardest," he said.
To fight back, police and government officials have mounted a campaign in recent years ranging from new police equipment to new laws intended to mete out stronger punishment to young offenders.
In Manchester, for example, the police department helicopter is the first in Britain to be equipped with an American-made scanning system able to pick up electronic signals from devices that drivers buy and then hide in their cars. Like a similar system sold in the United States, the device is activated when a car is stolen and enables the police to track it from the air.
They have also equipped some patrol units with a kind of low technology device. Made in America and called the Stinger, it is an expandable mat embedded with hundreds of razor sharp nails that is flung out across a roadway in the path of speeding quarry. The nails instantly puncture the tires, bringing the car to a halt.
Two summers ago here in Newcastle, the combination of hot cars and hot weather boiled over into several nights of rioting after two young men were killed in a high-speed chase with the police. Earlier, the youngsters were using the stolen cars to perform high-speed maneuvers before cheering nighttime crowds.
Some of the worst troubles took place in the public housing blocks just across the street from the Ford dealership in Newcastle, where even some of the cars parked inside the showroom are anchored by heavy wheel clamps.
On the carpet near the big display windows, a salesman pointed out the black skid mark made when thieves broke into the dealership a few years ago, hot-wired a new car parked in the showroom and then drove it straight through the glass.

HEADLINE: An Inflation Illusion?;
The Latest Fears May Be Groundless In a Global Economy With New Rules

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is putting interest rates on an upward path, for the first time since 1989, with the stated aim of controlling inflation and quelling the market's fears that it will surge in the near future. But those fears may be groundless, based as they are on theories that have worked in the past and may now be outdated.
There is little argument over the present: inflation is rising at an annual rate of only 3 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, which is as mild as inflation has ever been over most of the last 15 years. But the mild inflation rate today has not quieted the fears that the country will soon be operating at full capacity, running short of factory space, materials, machinery and workers to produce all that people want to buy. 
 "Everything may seem fine now, but we are in fact approaching a level of full employment and capacity utilization that would represent a point at which the inflation rate could be expected to climb," said William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Mr. Dudley's view, shared widely in financial and economic circles, is grounded in two theories about the causes of inflation that originated in an era when the American economy was more self-contained. They have not been fully tested in today's more global economy, when a factory in Singapore or Japan or Mexico can supply an American consumer as easily as one in Ohio or North Carolina -- making the foreign factories and their workers in effect part of America's production "capacity."
 
The Capacity Argument
 One of these theories holds that the gross domestic product, adding up the value of all the goods and services produced in the United States in a given year, can increase by only about 3 percent annually over a period of several years without using up the available factory space, materials and labor.
If the expansion is persistently greater than 3 percent, then the nation will run out of capacity, and Americans will find themselves competing to buy more goods and service than corporate America has the capacity to produce, bidding up prices in the process. Since last summer, the G.D.P. has been expanding by much more than an annual rate of 3 percent.
The second theory, more important than the first, holds that when the unemployment rate gets down to about 6.3 percent, then the country runs out of qualified workers, and companies have to offer higher wages to attract people. Prices then rise to offset the higher labor costs, and inflation increases. The unemployment rate, which has been falling for nearly two years, was at 6.5 percent in February, suggesting to many economists that the nation is running short of available workers and the bidding up of wages may soon begin.
"We are essentially at full employment today," said Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, head of the National Bureau of Economic Research.
For the last five years, the problems of measuring capacity have been left pretty much to the academics. As long as the national economy was either in recession or growing weakly, no one doubted that the nation was operating well below full capacity, whatever that might be. Indeed, the Federal Reserve spent those years lowering interest rates to encourage people to borrow and spend on credit, and thus use more of the country's idle resources, especially its idle workers.
 
Debate Front and Center
 But as inflation fears have taken shape -- fanned by the Federal Reserve's decision in early February to push up interest rates -- the debate about whether the economy was close to full capacity has moved to center stage from academia.
But the statistics that measure capacity, and how capacity is used, no longer do so with great accuracy. Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: "Full capacity is not a precise point or an observable condition. It is a range and a condition that has become very hard to pin down."
One problem with the traditional theory involves factory operating capacity. In the 1970's and 1980's, when factories operated at more than 80 percent of their potential capacity, as they are doing today, they began to have trouble keeping up with orders. The big difference today is that Japan, Germany, Italy, France and Canada are suffering from weak economies and low factory operating rates, said Nancy Lazar, a senior economist at the ISI Group in New York.
"Their operating rates have fallen from 88 percent to 79 percent in the past four years," she said, "and in today's free-trade environment, this excess global capacity will hold down inflation in the United States."
American auto manufacturers, for example, are operating at more than 90 percent of capacity today, an inflationary level. But Japan, for one, has auto factories without enough work to do, and they are standing by to make cars for the American market, Ms. Lazar and other economists argue. Or cars can be brought in from a Ford plant or a General Motors plant in northern Mexico, factories that are now, with tariff barriers almost gone, part of America's production capacity.
 
Reaching to Plants Abroad
 The concept of capacity has changed in recent years. When the Gillette Company finds demand for its razor blades rising in the United States, the company is not forced to expand a factory in this country. Instead, it often takes a less expensive alternative: the new orders go to a Gillette plant abroad that is operating below capacity.
Similarly, the notion that the current unemployment rate of 6.5 represents full employment or nearly full employment is a view that clashes with the continuing layoffs and job cutbacks. And it clashes with the public's perceptions about jobs, perceptions that make Americans more reluctant than in the past to spend or drive up prices, even if they have jobs, some labor economists argue.
"There is not a sense of comfort, even though the rate of unemployment is relatively low," said John Bregger, assistant commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Labor Department agency that compiles the country's monthly unemployment rate. "You are not seeing a lot of job strength in areas where you would need to have it for full employment, particularly in manufacturing. And people don't feel secure about their jobs, although that is not something that we can measure."
The Clinton Administration is similarly reluctant to embrace the view that the strong economic growth since last summer is pushing the nation quickly toward full employment and, with it, inflation. But neither has it criticized the Federal Reserve for raising rates, first in early February and again last week, to slow the economy by trying to discourage people from spending on credit. The Administration has counted on low rates, particularly for mortgages and car loans, to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and the Fed's action could threaten that strategy.
"We are of the view that the economy has not yet reached capacity," said Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "The remaining slack therefore still gives a cushion against inflation. As a result, we foresee only a tiny increase in inflation."
He said the inflation rate might edge up from 3 percent, but not by much. "It is not something that is going to get anyone excited if, in the next several years, it edges up to 3.5 percent," he said.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich underscores this point. "If it is true that we have have to draft seven to eight million people into unemployment in order to fight inflation, then we have a major social problem on our hands," he said, referring to the current level of unemployment.
The debate about what constitutes full employment coincides with a big change in the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment, a change that might be skewing the monthly figure. Instead of the 6.5 percent recorded in February, the actual unemployment rate might be 6.6 percent or 6.7 percent. That would be further away from the 6.3 percent level that many economists consider the point at which labor becomes so scarce that employers bid up wages to get workers, and in doing so raise the inflation rate.
The problem lies in what the bureau calls the seasonal adjustment factor, a formula that adjusts the figures to allow for temporary impacts like rising youth employment in summer and Christmas season hiring. The unemployment rate is determined from a monthly survey of 65,000 households, but while the questions in that survey and the method of conducting it were changed in January, the seasonal adjustment formula was not.
Applying the old formula to the new survey appears to result in a slightly inaccurate unemployment rate, says Katherine Abraham, the bureau's Commissioner. Until a new formula is developed, she said, "we could go through a year erring in the unemployment rate by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point, plus or minus."
"This problem is obviously pretty subtle," she said, "but if you are right on the cusp of full employment, the error could be an issue."

In Houston, a Monthly Magazine Finds a Home in a Sunday Newspaper

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
The recent marriage of a Houston life style magazine and The Houston Post is being watched closely as a possible new way to shore up regional magazines while increasing newspaper circulation.
Houston Life, an independently published, glossy magazine filled with features about the city, is now distributed with The Houston Post on the third Sunday of each month. 
 Because it is published by a separate owner, Houston Life differs from other newspaper magazines, which are published weekly as an integral part of the Sunday paper.
And because it focuses on a specific city, Houston Life differs from national Sunday supplements like USA Weekend or Parade, which appear weekly in many newspapers around the country. The Houston Post, in fact, continues to carry USA Weekend every Sunday.
 
A Magazine's Journey
 The chief architect of the arrangement, which began in February, is Mark Inabnit, a Houston publisher who has now owned the magazine twice. He started the publication in 1974 as Houston Home and Garden with an investment of $150,000. He sold it nine years later for $7 million, and the new owners renamed it Houston Metropolitan and turned it into a city magazine, concentrating on Houston area activities.
The change to the city format came just before Houston's economy fell into recession. By 1992, when Mr. Inabnit returned to the city after an absence of 10 years, the magazine was under new ownership and was losing a million dollars a year. He bought it back for the tiny sum of $90, deciding to use the magazine's assets to create a life style magazine.
"City magazines in my opinion are no longer a viable concept," he said. "People are now concerned about personal well-being, pets, family. My idea was to build an editorial product about how to live better in your particular city."
But figuring that it would take $8 million and three to five years to build a circulation of 200,000 to 300,000, he went to The Post before starting publication and proposed an unusual deal.
He would produce Houston Life -- provide editorial content, solicit advertising and print the magazine. The Post would insert the magazine in the Sunday paper and deliver it.
Ike Massey, the publisher and chief executive of The Post, enthusiastically embraced the idea and described it as "an added-value benefit" for his newspaper. The Post began distributing Houston Life last month.
"Basically, what Mark brings to the party is proven experience and know-how in publishing a magazine that Houstonians love," Mr. Massey said. "And what The Houston Post brings to the party is instant 300,000 circulation."
Both sides declined to give details on the financial arrangements.
In the first two issues of Houston Life, The Post's readers have found features like "Antiquing Through Bluebonnet Country" and "Let's Remake Main Street." The magazine has a sophisticated look, offering color photography and advertising throughout. The first issue had 168 pages.
Mr. Massey said he expected an increase in Sunday circulation.
"I have been in the newspaper business all of my adult life and been associated with quite a few newspapers in quite a few markets and I have never seen anything be so positively received," he said.
The article about remaking Main Street -- in which the magazine presented its own plan complete with architectural renderings -- drew enormous response. Readers asked how they could help revitalize the downtown area and gave suggestions.
The Post, with a Sunday circulation of 349,000, is owned by Media News Group, which also owns The Denver Post and The Oakland Tribune. The Post trails its competitor, The Houston Chronicle, which has a Sunday circulation of 608,000. The Post published a Sunday magazine called The Magazine for a while during the 1980's but eventually discontinued it. The Chronicle offers a Sunday magazine called Texas Magazine and also carries Parade.
Advertisers are responding favorably, though it is too early to gauge trends for the magazine or the newspaper. Larry Spiegel, principal of the Richards Group, an advertising agency that represents Continental Airlines, has been calling newspapers in other markets to suggest similar projects. "I think it's an interesting direction for city magazines for the future because it's a win-win situation," he said.
Allen Brivic, president of Brivic Media Services, a Houston-based media company, said the magazine provided a "quality environment where you can showcase ads."
"The distribution is wonderful for the magazine and should help The Post," he said. "Surely it puts Houston Life on the map overnight."
 
Struggle of Sunday Magazines
 Many newspapers nationwide have had difficulties with their own Sunday magazines. Phyllis Cavaliere, the national advertising director of Sunday Magazine Network, a 62-year-old newspaper cooperative, said there were now 31 locally edited Sunday magazines in newspapers, compared with 52 a decade ago. Many ceased publication because of declines in retail advertising, as well as in liquor and tobacco ads, and because many national advertisers were turning to magazines like Parade.

New Chief Wants to Widen NPR's Financial Base

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
Delano E. Lewis wants to turn National Public Radio -- the network that has brought the nation innovative programs like "Morning Edition" and "All Things Considered" -- into a paying proposition.
To reach his goal, Mr. Lewis, NPR's new president and chief executive, wants new kinds of programming and new kinds of listeners for the network, which is sometimes viewed as the champagne of radio. He also wants more support from companies for programs related to their industries. 
 Mr. Lewis, a former president and chief executive of the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company here, can even envision a time when an NPR program like the zany "Car Talk" may have a sponsor from the auto industry.
"You go out to selected groups of corporations, individuals, organizations and foundations and say, 'Look, this is something that has value to various communities, and I think it would be worth your while to be associated with it because it has got such and such a listenership and your marketing people may be interested,' " Mr. Lewis said.
But how many "Car Talk" sponsors would want to have their latest-model cars lambasted over the air, as often happens on the program? Can the hosts continue to criticize them?
"Of course they can, and that's been a bit of a problem" in wooing some sponsors, he said. "One of the car companies was gun shy, but they're getting real close to signing on. We'll have to work out each situation."
 
Looking for New Money
 Economics is much on the mind of officials at NPR and its member stations, including those in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has considered selling city-owned WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM.
"Del is very serious about increasing our financial resources," said Mary Morgan, the public affairs spokeswoman for the network. "It's been my sense and everyone's that the listener support and the underwriting are becoming increasingly important."
Nearly 57 percent of NPR's operating income comes from member stations. Gifts and grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and from private companies, foundations and individuals make up the balance. NPR's 1992 revenues totaled $43 million.
Mr. Lewis, who has no journalistic or broadcast experience, emphasized that at Chesapeake and Potomac, he was in charge of a communications company that had once been a monopoly but then had to adapt to a competitive market. He said he expected NPR to have competition someday from other privately supported networks.
"Many people think NPR is a station," he said. "They may say they don't like this program or that program, but our main mission is to produce programs and distribute them to our member stations, who pay us a fee for the satellite interconnection and for the program packages."
Mr. Lewis said one way to build NPR's listener base, and thus its potential financial support, was to attract younger listeners and to build its audience among minorities. He said 94 percent of the nation's radio listeners did not listen to public radio, even though diversity in programming had always been part of its Congressional mandate.
"I believe NPR has done a good job, has a good reputation and does quality programming," said Mr. Lewis, who has been on the job officially for only two months. "But we're a real secret in many ways. Its audience is rather homogenous -- white, predominantly male, over 30 -- and I think we need to grow that audience and make it more diverse."
Among the recent additions to NPR is "Wade in the Water," a program of African-American sacred music. Its creator and host is Bernice Johnson Reagon, the founder of Sweet Honey in the Rock, the a cappella women's group. She had been a curator of the division of community life at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.
Sandra Rattley, vice president for NPR's cultural programming, said "Wade" had been well received. She noted that it initially produced 3,000 copies of educational materials for school groups and other interested viewers, but that the demand from member stations required another 5,000.
Other cultural programs in the works include "American Stories," an hourlong story-telling program, and "American Pie," a series on ethnic food and culture.
The move toward diversity is welcomed by critics of public radio, who generally have been more concerned about NPR's news broadcasts than its cultural programs.
Jeff Cohen, executive director of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a New York-based liberal watch group on the media, said he was pleased that NPR was initiating shows outside Washington. But he said NPR's news programs depended too heavily on well-known Washington sources.
 
Criticism of News Programs
 "You can't talk about diversity on the one hand and on the other continually rely on the same establishment think tanks, pro-government and pro-corporate voices that NPR relies on as experts and sources," he said.
David Horowitz, a founder of the conservative Committee on Media Integrity and a former speech writer for Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, has faulted the network for what he views as its Democratic partisanship.
"It has organized an audience to the left," Mr. Horowitz said. "It broadcasts to the subculture rather than to the whole culture."
Mr. Lewis answered: "I know that I will have to deal with Congress and many of my critics about balance and objectivity or even why we should pay for public radio. But from a business point of view, I must first show the value of the product for someone to buy it."
He even sees a time when the network will be financially self-sufficient. "Our level of Federal funding may decline," he said. "I'm not going in to make that pitch tomorrow, but I'm saying that at least I want to make that effort."

HEADLINE: Local Elections in Turkey May Set Fate of Sagging National Cabinet

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, March 27

 BODY:
About 32 million Turks cast their ballots today in local elections that took on the significance of a national vote because of rapidly sagging confidence in the Government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.
The Government is in trouble with the electorate because of a drastic decline in Turkey's economy and a wave of political corruption scandals. President Suleyman Demirel, in an interview in the newspaper Hurriyet today, said the governing coalition could not survive if its total share of the vote dropped below 40 percent in today's election, in which voting is compulsory. Final results are not expected for several days. 
 The coalition partner of Mrs. Ciller's conservative True Path Party is the Social Democratic People's Party. In 1991, when Mr. Demirel led the True Path Party, it received 27 percent of the vote and its coalition partner tallied 21 percent, for a total of 48 percent.
Mrs. Ciller, 48, an American-educated economics professor, began her term in high standing based on her professional reputation and promises of prosperity. But in the nine months since she succeeded Mr. Demirel as Prime Minister, the governing coalition has suffered with the decline of the Turkish lira and soaring inflation.
Inflation now exceeds 70 percent annually and is expected to mount into triple digits by the end of the year.
Turkey's foreign debt and current-accounts deficit have raced ahead at a similar pace.
 
Layoffs Are Expected
 Interest rates are so high that industrial production is plummeting. The country's largest conglomerate, Koc Holding, has already stopped automotive production and last week announced a halt in manufacturing refrigerators. A wave of industrial layoffs is expected.
The mounting hardship of daily life is reflected in the increasingly open criticism, both from the outside and from within the 11 parties taking part in the election.
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, the True Path Party candidate for Mayor, Bedrettin Dalan, was Mayor until 1989 for the Motherland Party, the chief opposition group, and the Motherland Party's nominee, Ilhan Kesici, was with the True Path until a conflict with Mrs. Ciller.
Until last month, the fall in the mainline parties' reputations had worked greatly in favor of the Welfare Party, a pro-Islamic maverick movement, but its clean image, which even critics say appeared largely deserved, has taken severe blows since last month.
It has not been able to provide satisfactory answers to charges of receiving hidden aid from such divergent Islamic countries as Saudi Arabia and Libya and has been unable to account for money it collected, ostensibly to aid Bosnian Muslims.
 
'We're All Muslims'
 Even in districts where recent migrants from the rural areas of eastern Anatolia and the Black Sea coast have given the edge to the Islamic party, criticism of it was voiced openly.
"They are stupid enough to think they are the only Muslims," said Nazim Ustundag, a retired pharmacist, leaning against a house at the foot of the Galata Tower, a landmark in an old quarter on the European side of this bi-continental city. "We're all Muslims, even if I drink a glass of beer."
But he said the Welfare Party was a powerful force in the slums, where migrants settle because "they promise them everything, and the other parties are eating each other up." Migrants are estimated to arrive in the city of more than 10 million at the rate of 350,000 to 500,000 a year and provide a fertile recruiting ground for the Muslim party and its defense of the conservative values of Turkish countryfolk.
Elections did not go off without violence. In Istanbul, a bomb exploded at Hagia Sophia, the landmark museum that was a sixth-century cathedral and later a mosque. Kurdish separatists claimed responsibility for the blast, in which three European tourists were wounded. The museum was not damaged.
In the southeast, eight people were killed today by land mines that were believed to have been planted by Kurdish rebels, and two others died in clashes in western Turkey.

HEADLINE: Tax Cut Plans Prompt Fight In Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 27

 BODY:
After three months the debate over Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget has finally swung full circle to where it was expected to conclude all along: an election-year scrap over how much to reduce taxes.
Late last week, the Republicans who control the State Senate threw the budget talks into disarray by calling for tax cuts, mostly for businesses, totaling $700 million in the fiscal year that begins on Friday. 
 The proposal trumps a similar but less ambitious plan to cut $300 million in taxes offered by the Governor when he introduced his $33.4 billion budget in January. The Republican plan incorporates all of Mr. Cuomo's reductions, but expands on some, accelerates others and adds a dozen new tax cuts to the list.
On its face, the debate is over how state government can best persuade companies to stay in New York. The Senate Republicans and Governor Cuomo agree that reducing business costs by slashing taxes will help stop the job losses the state has suffered over the last decade, though they disagree on how much the state can afford to cut.
 
Defining the Debate
 But on another level, the real fight is over control of a debate that both the Governor and the Republicans think will be particularly rancorous in the fall elections, when all 211 seats in the Senate and Assembly are up and Mr. Cuomo will be seeking his fourth term.
In releasing their tax-cut plan last week as budget negotiations were turning down the backstretch, the Republicans seemed intent on shoving Governor Cuomo into a high-wire dance of rejecting tax cuts as unaffordable in a year when he has worked assiduously to fashion himself a tax-cut champion.
They also pointedly remind him that Jim Florio was toppled last year as New Jersey's Governor by an unheralded challenger offering deep tax cuts, Christine Todd Whitman. "Look at the cuts in Jersey," said the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, an Oyster Bay Republican. "We've got to be competitive if we are going to retain jobs in this state."
Upon hearing of the Republican plan, Governor Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, assailed the Republicans for disingenuously proposing something they know the state cannot afford. They called the tax-cut plan a gambit to embarrass Mr. Cuomo by failing to enact a budget by April 1 for the 10th consecutive year.
 
'Quite Sarcastic'
 "I'm pretty certain that the Senate has been quite sarcastic in treating our constitutional obligation here," Mr. Silver said. "The end result is headlines that say, 'the Legislature fails to enact a timely budget.' "
But Governor Cuomo noted that he would like to do what the Senate demands, if only the state had the money. "I'm not arguing that you shouldn't do more tax cuts," he said. "I believe you should do more tax cuts, just only do what you can afford to pay for."
Such hand wringing is precisely what the Republicans have been waiting for. Over the last three months, they have derided Mr. Cuomo's proposed tax cuts as timid, accusing him of undergoing a Zelig-like transformation from liberal spender to supply-side tax cutter, in reaction to negative public opinion polls.
But until they put their own plan on the table, Mr. Cuomo could score points by criticizing the Republican lawmakers for really wanting only "to spend, spend, spend." No longer, the Republicans say.
"These days everyone says they are for tax cuts," said John A. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino. "But some would question whether the Governor's budget included revenue raising or tax relief. Ours is the real thing."
The budget debate has now shifted to whether the Republican plan is tenable. The proposal calls for about 30 tax cuts, including reducing the corporate surcharge to 10 percent from 15 percent, phasing out the state beverage container tax, repealing this year the state tax on hotel rooms and cutting a variety of other taxes on petroleum products and beverages.
Governor Cuomo's tax-cut package calls for, among other things, reducing the corporate surcharge to 12.5 percent and for phasing out the hotel tax over several years.
The Republicans have said the cuts can be paid for by a combination of surplus revenues, $230 million from a proposed three-month tax amnesty and cuts to social services, capital spending and other programs in Mr. Cuomo's proposed budget. Under the amnesty plan, delinquent taxpayers would pay back taxes and interest but no penalties.
The Democrats say the Senate's proposed tax cuts would consume all available revenue in Mr. Cuomo's budget, leaving nothing for a variety of spending proposals that the Senate itself supports, including for school aid.
"There would be no education aid for Nassau County if you did these taxes," The Governor said, spotlighting the area that is home to Mr. Marino and his Senate inner circle.
The Democrats also question whether the three-month amnesty could produce $230 million. Even if it did, they say, the revenue would not be recurring and could not be counted on to help pay for the tax cuts in future years.
Republicans say a similar amnesty in 1985 provided more than $400 million to the state's coffers. They say there is evidence that many of those delinquent tax payers started paying consistently after clearing their old tax bills, and that the same would happen this time.
"We just came through a very bad recession when a lot of people might not have been able to pay their taxes because their jobs were hurt," Mr. McArdle said. "This gives those people a chance to get back on the rolls."
Even if the Democrats succeed in punching holes in the Republican plan, the Republicans may have succeeded in showing how Mr. Cuomo's own budget has walled him into an uncomfortable corner.
In a year when the economy is improving only slowly, Mr. Cuomo has not had abundant new revenues to work with. His strategy has been to capture the political middle by spreading money gingerly in three ways: modest increases for some programs, modest tax cuts and an array of measures meant to impress bond raters by strengthening the state's long-term fiscal health.
But Mr. Cuomo's potpourri of proposals has left many dissatisfied. Business lobbyists say his cuts don't go far enough. Wall Street raters says they don't plan on raising the state's bond ratings until fiscally conservative budgets are passed on time several years in a row. And urban and liberal lawmakers say the Governor's cuts take money from social services and education.
As if Mr. Cuomo did not face enough problems from across the political fence, even some Democrats have begun invoking Christine Todd Whitman's name to ratchet up pressure on Mr. Cuomo to expand his tax cut plans.
Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who wants Mr. Cuomo to propose broad-based tax cuts aimed at the middle class, said, "What surprises me is that Whitman understood the tax cut that plays is a middle-class tax cut. So far, Cuomo hasn't. So the ghost of Christie Whitman walks the halls of the Capitol, but her message isn't being heard."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Waste, With Nowhere to Go

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RED WING, Minn., March 23

 BODY:
After three decades of looking for a place where waste from the nation's nuclear reactors could someday be disposed of, that someday has arrived.
The two reactors in Red Wing have run out of storage space and no place has been found to put the waste. 
 As a result, the Prairie Island nuclear plant may have to close permanently next year, a little more than halfway through its expected lifetime. Other utilities have built temporary storage in steel or concrete casks, but building those here would require action by the State Legislature, which is balking.
If the twin reactors are shut, opponents of nuclear power will try the same tactic elsewhere, and experts say more shutdowns could result.
Around the country, thousands of tons of nuclear waste are piling up in earthquake-proof pools near each reactor. The storage is generally considered to be safe for years to come, but it requires a significant level of surveillance and maintenance.
 
Utility's Argument
 The owner of the Red Wing plant, the Northern States Power Company, insists that the casks and the reactor are safe. And if the plant is forced to shut, said James J. Howard, the company's chairman and chief executive, the likely result is that the plant will be decommissioned, requiring removal of all the fuel from the pool. That would mean 38 casks, instead of the 17 that the utility is now seeking.
In addition, Mr. Howard said, Northern States would have to buy replacement power, which it says would come from coal and would each year create emissions of 10,000 to 15,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide, a cause of acid rain. Plant opponents say cleaner power sources like windmills could be found.
The company also says that closing the plant could mean a 9 percent rate increase for some of its customers. The rate is now 1.5 cents a kilowatt-hour.
 
A 'Temporary' Action
 The Red Wing plant, built on a sandy island in the Mississippi River 28 miles southeast of Minneapolis, was designed in the 1960's with a small steel-lined pool. The idea was to hold the spent fuel for up to a few years until it could be hauled away for recycling, but recycling was banned by President Jimmy Carter.
The Federal Government has repeatedly promised to take the fuel. It has collected billions of dollars from the utilities, including Northern States, under a contract in which it agreed to take the waste beginning in 1998. But now the Energy Department says it is unable to meet the deadline.
Northern States, which serves a 49,000-square-mile area with a population of three million people in five states, gets 20 percent of its electricity from Prairie Island. The company, whose operating record here is envied around the nuclear industry, wants to put some of the fuel in 122-ton sealed casks with steel walls nine inches thick. The casks would be parked outdoors on a concrete strip about the size of four basketball courts laid end to end, surrounded by barbed wire and earthen berms.
But a state law that was intended to prevent the Federal Government from establishing a national high-level nuclear waste repository in Minnesota has been interpreted by state courts as prohibiting the casks unless the Legislature approves.
 
Opposition From Tribe
 Prominent among opponents of the cask plan is the Sioux tribe whose reservation shares the island with the reactor. Environmentalists also oppose the plan, mostly because using the casks would keep the plant operating.
"When you find you're digging yourself into a hole, the first thing to do is to stop digging," said George Crocker of the Prairie Island Coalition Against Nuclear Storage.
The tax-hungry city of Red Wing, which annexed the island when the plant was built, wants the plant to continue operating.
The utility's plan calls for the casks to be used until Northern States can take the waste elsewhere. The company has struck a preliminary storage agreement with the Mescalero Apache tribe in Mescalero, N.M., which is trying to establish an "interim repository" on its reservation, until the Energy Department can open a permanent one, probably at Yucca Mountain, Nev., in 15 to 20 years.
A committee of the Minnesota House approved a bill to allow the casks, but a similar measure failed in a Senate committee. The utility believes it can win on the Senate floor if it can get the bill there, but even Northern States says its prospects on the House floor are uncertain. To keep running, the company says, it needs action before the legislative session ends, probably in April.
[On March 24 the State Senate's Environment and Natural Resources Committee approved an amended bill that would let the company have enough casks to last until 2002, at which time the fuel would have to be shipped off site or the plant would close. The vote allows the issue to reach the full Senate.]
 
Indians' Concerns
 The Indian tribe living near the plant, the Prairie Island Mdewakanton Sioux, says the plant threatens members' health and livelihood. Six tribal members worked at the plant until the cask issue arose, and three of them have since quit.
One of the tribe's main economic projects, the Treasure Island casino, is just half a mile from the reactor. The tribe also has a marina and a recreational-vehicle park but has stopped planning for tourist expansion, said Darelynn Lehto, the vice president of the tribal council, because it does not know how potential visitors would react to a nuclear waste dump.
All in all, the plant provides 500 jobs in the area and pays $22 million in local taxes. But Ms. Lehto said all the money went to the City of Red Wing while the tribe got all the risk.
 
Good Performance Record
 An industry survey of reliability ranked both reactors here among the 10 best in the United States, and they also rank well in low radiation exposure to workers and backlog of maintenance work. To "demystify" the technology and counter public fear of things nuclear, the company has taken the unusual step of opening up the control room and other areas to tours, and 6,000 people have already come through.
Six American nuclear plants already use casks. If their use is barred here, both supporters and opponents of the Red Wing plant predict, environmentalists will seize on the tactic around the country.
Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary was a Northern States vice president before joining the Clinton Administration last year. One responsibility in that job was to prod the Energy Department to live up to its promise. In her current job, Mrs. O'Leary has raised the possibility of helping utilities cover their excess costs for storage. She has also taken steps like opening the department's files on human radiation experiments as a way to build credibility, so that the department can return to the nuclear waste problem.
Now Mr. Howard talks of the industry "taking our destiny into our own hands" and arranged a private deal with the Mescaleros, who could command millions of dollars a year in rent from utilities.
But many doubt that arrangement will go through. For one thing, New Mexico's non-Indian population is mostly against it.

HEADLINE: Saudis Refuse to Cut Output, Weakening OPEC's Accord

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 27

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia refused over the weekend to cut its oil production, deciding to maintain its market share instead of raising prices. As a result, world petroleum prices seem destined to languish in the bargain basement.
The Saudi refusal to cut output came at a weekend meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva. As a result, the best the organization could manage was to freeze current production quotas. 
 Saturday's accord on a freeze until the end of this year may help prices make a gradual, modest recovery from their collapse in 1993. But Saudi Arabia's resolve infuriated Iran, its political rival in the Persian Gulf.
Iran and other nations in the 12-member organization had wanted one million barrels daily taken off the market to push prices up quickly and bolster their debt-laden economies.
That opportunity "slipped through our hands," said Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Agazadeh.
Delegates conceded that OPEC remained a pale shadow of the cartel that in its heyday in the 1970's had held the West ransom, with a barrel of oil that touched $40.
Prices now are around $14 a barrel. After inflation, they are little higher than before the 1973 Middle East war, when OPEC used shortages caused by an Arab oil embargo to take control of pricing.
Independent economists say cheap oil generally means less risk of inflation. Jittery bond markets had kept a wary eye on OPEC in case Iran, not the Saudis, prevailed and quotas were cut.
A cut-price OPEC barrel does not always mean a break for the motorist at the pump. But gasoline in the United States is probably cheaper than at any time since World War II, after accounting for inflation.
OPEC hopes its accord to freeze quotas now will lead oil company buyers to decide that there will be a tight market when seasonal demand picks up.
Experts in the gulf region said Saudi Arabia entered the talks resolved to defend its market share and with no intention of cutting its quota of eight million barrels daily, a third of all OPEC oil.

Newly Rich Detroit May Conserve Cash and Scrimp on Dividends

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 27

 BODY:
Investors who were counting on the Big Three auto makers to pay generous common stock dividends after regaining healthy balance sheets could be disappointed in this season of prosperity in Detroit.
Despite recent increases in sales and cash flow, which have propelled the common stocks of Ford, Chrysler and General Motorsto new highs, several auto industry analysts expect auto makers to increase dividends more conservatively than has been their custom. 
 In a bit of a twist, the same Wall Street analysts who had urged the auto makers to be more generous with dividends during the last cycle of prosperity, in the mid-1980's, are now encouraging the companies to conserve their cash.
The industry has always been cyclical and capable of consuming huge amounts of cash. Still, both auto makers and analysts vastly underestimated how damaging the last economic downturn, and competition from abroad, could be for Detroit. Consequently, they could not sustain dividends and were forced to raise expensive new capital and to increase their borrowing.
"I think you have an industry that's a lot more cautious about its prospects," said Guru Baliga, an analyst for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. "Auto makers are focused on managing businesses at the top, not just the bottom, of the cycle. They are talking about going into the next down cycle with a lot of cash."
General Motors, with an unfinanced pension liability of $22 billion, should be the most deliberate and least generous in restoring its dividend. The world's largest auto maker, which pays 80 cents a share each year -- a 1.4 percent dividend yield -- was paying $3 a common share through 1990. In retrospect, many people in the industry say that G.M.'s last dividend increase, in 1989, may have been an imprudent bid by Roger B. Smith to end his tenure as G.M. chairman on a high note.
Jean-Claude Gruet, an analyst for UBS Securities Inc. in New York, forecasts that G.M. could fully finance its pension fund by 1995 and repay all its debt by 1996. Still, Mr. Gruet thinks it is possible that G.M. may keep the dividend at its current level or increase it only a token amount, despite generating $30 billion of excess cash over the next three years.
"Jack Smith isn't worried about the dividend," Mr. Gruet said of G.M.'s president, John F. Smith Jr. "G.M. has a lot of cleaning up to do. Raising the dividend now would be stupid. If they did it, I'd lower their rating."
Chrysler, currently the investment darling among auto makers, with its shares up sharply in the last two years, raised its common dividend last year to an 80-cent annual rate, from 60 cents, for a 1.5 percent current yield. Harvey Heinbach, analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, forecasts another dividend increase in 1994, but said it could be modest. "I don't want to generalize," Mr. Heinbach said. "But we're seeing more people owning these stocks for capital appreciation as opposed to income."
Ford has the strongest balance sheet of the Big Three, but few investment professionals think the No. 2 producer will increase dividends lavishly. Ford lowered its dividend rate to $1.60 a year, from $3, in 1991, so its current yield is about double that of the other two. What Wall Street may be overlooking is that Ford's dividend rate also establishes the amount of money paid to dozens of members of the Ford family on their restricted common shares. Keeping the Ford family satisfied has always been an important objective for the auto maker's board and management.
Of course, Detroit's ability to accumulate large amounts of cash rests on several assumptions. The most basic is that auto demand will remain strong at least through 1995. Higher interest rates could simultaneously choke off car sales and raise expectations for a better dividend yield.

HEADLINE: MIDDLE-CLASS DEBT IS SEEN AS HURDLE TO ECONOMIC GAINS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27

 BODY:
New figures from the Federal Reserve show a weak spot in the economic recovery: the heavy burden of debt being carried by the working middle class.
While the household finances of the rich and elderly have returned to normal levels, middle-class families remain stuck with unusually high debt payments as a proportion of their income, according to the Fed figures. Families that are not rich or old are paying nearly a quarter of their income to creditors, up substantially from levels in previous economic recoveries. 
 That high debt, resulting from stagnating wages while low interest rates have encouraged families to borrow, means consumers are living close to the financial edge, and ready to cut spending at any sign of economic trouble. But it is consumer spending that is fueling the recovery, and economists worry that overstretched middle-class families could put a powerful brake on the economy.
 
 
Retirement Accounts
 Further, more and more people's savings are in Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans -- which save money on taxes now but impose stiff penalties for early withdrawal. This reduces families' financial flexibility, making them unlikely to dip into savings to continue spending when to do so is difficult and expensive.
"What seems to be one of the best of times financially for our country as a whole stands, in contrast, to what is arguably one of the riskiest times that large parts of the household sector have faced in many years," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, an influential member of the Federal Reserve Board who presented and analyzed the new figures in a speech in Baltimore earlier this month. "I believe that the household sector poses one of the most serious risks to the continuation of this recovery."
 
Debt's Proportion of Income
 Interest payments and repayments of principal continue to claim an unusually high proportion of household incomes for families that earn less than $200,000 a year and have no one old enough to qualify for Social Security or Medicare. These payments by middle-class families consumed 22.9 percent of these households' after-tax income last year, down from a peak of 25.9 percent in 1990, but still far above the average in the 1960's and 1970's of a little under 18 percent, according to Mr. Lindsey.
By contrast, when elderly and wealthy families are included, the debt service burden for all households fell last year to 16.2 percent, only slightly higher than levels in the 1960's and 1970's.
Economists like Mr. Lindsey are worried about Americans like Jim Rice, a 39-year-old veterinarian in Cynthiana, Ky., who complains that his income has not kept up with rising prices, especially for cars. Mr. Rice refinanced his home last year with a larger mortgage and used the extra money to buy an $18,000 Oldsmobile Bravada.
"What I save is my retirement plan, and that's zilch," Mr. Rice said.
Economists also worry about people like Charles Scheffold, a 48-year-old electrical systems technician in Brooklyn who puts most of his savings into tax-deferred annuities. "I would say that my flexibility would be reduced by using those tax-deferred vehicles," he said. "I might lose opportunities on deals like a house or a co-op or a car."
For middle-class Americans like Mr. Rice and Mr. Scheffold, wages and salaries have stagnated. But rising financial markets and Government assistance programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have increased the incomes of the affluent and the old in recent years.
So while debt payments have fallen as a share of the rising incomes of the rich or old, the share remains high for middle-class families. At the same time, low interest rates have encouraged millions of homeowners to increase their mortgage debt and use the extra cash for consumer purchases.
The poor are unable to borrow much, so economists worry less about their debt payments.
 Some prominent academic and Wall Street economists agree with Mr. Lindsey's concerns. "The rate of consumer spending is not sustainable unless there is a noticeable pickup in the pace of income growth," said Michael J. Boskin, who was the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and is now a Stanford University economics professor.
Fed officials have repeatedly mentioned household indebtedness as one of the many indicators that has led them to hold down interest rates until recently. It may be one reason the Fed is moving more slowly this year to raise interest rates than it has in past economic recoveries.
Americans owe more money on their homes than ever before, with mortgages equaling a record 42.3 percent of the value of owner-occupied real estate last year, according to Fed figures.
Retirement savings -- including life insurance, pension contributions and tax-deferred retirement plans -- accounted for 64 percent of all household savings last year, the third-highest figure ever.
Overall personal savings have fallen at the same time. "The decline in personal saving was more than twice as important last year as it was during the 1908's as a spur to growth in the overall economy," Mr. Lindsey said. "An obvious problem for economic growth in the next two years is that a sustained decline in the personal savings rate as a means of financing higher consumption seems unlikely."
 
 
'Long-Term Problem'
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said she was not surprised by signs of continued problems in household indebtedness.
"There were and there may still be some balance-sheet problems which were certainly inherited from the past," she said. "This is a long-term problem. I don't think we ever thought that we could have a quick reversal."
Some economists play down the importance of such indebtedness. Robert Eisner, a Northwestern University economics professor, said that heavy consumer spending and low savings were not a problem to the extent that people may be spending their money on education. And if the current economic expansion increased household incomes soon, then heavy debts would become less of a problem, he added.
"If people have raised their debt service ratios, I think they probably know what they're doing," Mr. Eisner said.
Neal Soss, an economist at the First Boston Corporation in New York, said that there was "no magic limit" to the level of borrowing that American households could support. As long as Americans are willing to go even deeper into debt, then consumer spending can continue at high levels, he said.
David F. Seiders, a former Fed economist who is now the chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said that the record levels of mortgage debt may reflect a decision by many families to borrow more money against their houses because the subsequent interest payments are still tax deductible, unlike credit card debts and student loans.
 
 
'Less Support'
 But he believes that the overall high level of debt payments does make it unlikely that consumer spending can continue to be strong and keep the economy growing. "I think it's certainly the case that we're going to see less support for the economy out of that sector this year," he said.
Some Americans, like Sam Anteby, a Brooklyn chiropractor, are keeping up their spending even at the expense of paying penalties for the early withdrawal of money from tax-deferred savings like Individual Retirement Accounts, and are feeling under pressure from their debts.
"We used to have an I.R.A., and we had to cash it in," said Mr. Anteby, who has two children in private school and a new baby. "I owe money up to my eyeballs."

HEADLINE: Volcker Seen Among Choices for New UAL Board

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
United Airlines and its pilots' and machinists' unions are expected to announce today that Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and John Van de Kamp, a former California state Attorney General, will sit on the board of the airline if shareholders approve a $5 billion buyout proposal this summer.
They are two of the four so-called independent directors whose names will be included in the final paperwork outlining the unions' concessions-for-equity swap, according to people familiar with its contents. Documents are expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. The names of the other two independent directors could not be learned last night. 
 Mr. Volcker's name will no doubt be invoked often by the unions in coming months to help allay any fear among current shareholders that their interests will be ignored. Some industry analysts and institutional shareholders have raised concern that wages, work rules and job security would hold too much sway in setting long-term strategy at the airline.
"Volcker's name is synonymous with independence, given his background as head of the Federal Reserve," said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline industry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. "He lends a lot of veracity to the decision-making power of the board, that they will not be in the hip pockets of the unions."
Mr. Volcker, 66, served as Fed chairman from 1979 through the middle of 1987, and was known for his political independence. His policies were widely credited with taming the double-digit inflation that afflicted the country when he took over. An economist by training, Mr. Volcker since 1988 has been chairman of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a New York investment banker. He did not answer telephone calls yesterday to his home in central New Jersey
Mr. Van de Kamp, 58, was Attorney General of California from 1983 to 1991, and he brought a number of well-known lawsuits, including one that established states' standing to file antitrust actions under Federal laws. He has also served as Los Angeles County District Attorney, United States Attorney for Southern California and as a Federal public defender. Mr. Van de Kamp, who could not be reached for comment yesterday, is now a partner at the Los Angeles office of the law firm of Dewey Ballantine.
The proposed roster of 12 board members for UAL, the parent company of United, that will be included in the proxy statement will also include Gerald Greenwald, the former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, whom the unions have picked to replace Stephen M. Wolf as United's chairman.
In addition to the four independent directors and Mr. Greenwald, the board will include one representative each of the Air Line Pilots Association, the International Association of Machinists, and the carrier's nonunion workers.
The list will also include three board members from the current UAL board. The 12th director will be Mr. Greenwald's chief lieutenant, whose identity is not yet known.
Mr. Murphy of Morgan Stanley said that for the deal to be approved, the perceived independence of the proposed board had to be unquestionable.
"Clearly, it will be the acid test of the proxy solicitation," he said.
In previous failed attempts by the unions to gain control of United, the composition of the board was not a concern to shareholders because they would have sold their stakes outright.
But in the current proposal, stockholders are being asked to bet on the future performance of the reconstituted airline. The unions have proposed to trade about $5 billion worth of wage and work-rule concessions over roughly six years for 53 percent of the company's ownership.
Shareholders will also receive $750 million in cash -- to be paid from UAL's current cash holdings of $1.8 billion -- as well as $1.8 billion in preferred stock and notes.
If successful, the buyout would make United the nation's largest employee-owned company.

HEADLINE: We Can't Show Weakness to North Korea

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Beware the Hawks on Korea" (editorial, March 22): Critics of the Clinton Administration's concession-laden response to North Korea's violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, among whom I number myself, have earned your contempt for our efforts. You chastise us for "rashly calling for military action" and for offering "glib advice," which might, if the President should be so foolish as to heed it, cause the United States to "stumble into war."
I am a retired naval officer and a veteran of America's longest war. What are today horribly compelling televised images for most Americans were once the whole of reality for me. The terrible human losses incurred in war were once for me an experience so intensely personal that I will remember them all my life. 
 I take very strong exception to the implication that my opposition to the Administration's Korea policy evinces casual disregard for the tragedy of war. My public reservations about United States military interventions in Lebanese, Bosnian and Somalian civil wars were largely based on acute appreciation of the sacrifices war requires, sacrifices so dear that they should make avoiding war a primary, though not exclusive, object of every administration's national security policy.
Indeed, I have strongly criticized Administration attempts to placate the delusional or contrived concerns of the North Koreans about our military intentions in the Korean peninsula before they have resolved our own well-founded concerns about their nuclear program and the purposes they intend it to serve.
I premised my criticism on the reasonable supposition that should North Korea acquire a nuclear arsenal, its bellicose leadership may view military aggression against South Korea and the 35,000 Americans stationed there less fraught with risks for its security than it does now. The prospect of United States and South Korean forces crossing the 38th parallel after repelling an attack on the South should dampen the North Korean enthusiasm for war. I fear that will no longer be the case once Pyongyang is confident that conflict would be limited to South Korea because a counterattack on its territory would trigger a nuclear response.
The United States should respond to North Korea's treaty violations, its deployment of 800,000 troops along the border and its escalating bellicosity by reinforcing at every opportunity our unwavering resolve to hold it accountable for its lawlessness and to meet any aggression with greater retaliation in kind. We can start, as the Administration seems prepared to do, by taking actions necessary to prepare for our own defense, including deployment of Patriot missile batteries, holding joint exercises and reinforcing our troop strength.
To counter the global threat posed by North Korea's development of nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them within a 2,000-mile range, we should set aside our disputes with the two greatest powers in Asia, China and Japan, and focus our diplomacy on securing their cooperation in an economic embargo of North Korea.
I take it as an article of faith that appeasement of tyrants makes war more, not less, likely. History is replete with evidence to support my view. I fear that our previous concessions were taken by the North Koreans as signs of weakness in our resolve, thus increasing the present danger.

HEADLINE: Killing of 2 Students in California Fans Japanese Fears of America

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 28

 BODY:
Walter F. Mondale, the American Ambassador here, today took the unusual step of going on national television to apologize for the killing over the weekend of two Japanese students in Los Angeles and to counter Japan's growing certainty that the United States is a nation of gun-wielding maniacs, unfit for tourism or study.
Yet to millions of Japanese, the scene from a Los Angeles suburb -- a late-night carjacking, two 19-year-olds shot in the head -- seemed so horrifyingly familiar that no one bothered to describe America with the usual Japanese term: a "gun society." This time, it was just assumed to be the case.
 
No Arrests
 The police in San Pedro, a section of Los Angeles near Long Beach, said they had no suspects and few leads in the case. The two students at Marymount College in nearby Palos Verdes had pulled into a shopping center at 11 P.M. on Friday and were apparently shot as they got out of their car. The car was later found a few miles away.

GRAPHIC: [In San Pedro, the parking lot where the students were shot was piled with bouquets from mourners. The two "loved being in Los Angeles and they loved American culture," one of their professors said. Page B7.]
 
Questioning American Values
 On the front pages and in the television broadcasts tonight, no one suggested, as they had in past cases, that the two students were singled out because they were Japanese. Instead, the news reports said, Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were simply victims of a country that could no longer distinguish between the value of a life and the value of a 1994 Honda Civic. "For a Car?" one tabloid asked in a huge headline, repeating the question heard over and over today in a city with no car alarms and no need for them.
"This is the saddest day in my time here as Ambassador," Mr. Mondale, the former Vice President, said at a news conference. He said he was also extending President Clinton's sympathies, and he asked the Japanese not to give up on the United States.
"There are over three million Japanese who travel to the United States each year, many of them as tourists, and we have over 50,000 young Japanese studying in schools in the United States," Mr. Mondale said. "Practically every one of them has a wonderful experience. It is safe, it is fulfilling, they enjoy it, they come back."
The Japanese seemed impressed by Mr. Mondale's sincerity, particularly when he paused and said, "I deeply apologize." But it seemed unlikely he would be able to shake the prevalent view of the United States as a country that worries more about its trade deficits than its out-of-control streets.
What happened to Mr. Ito and Mr. Matsuura last weekend is the new nightmare for Japanese parents, the terrible story of the students who take the nearly obligatory year in America and who never return. To be an American living in Tokyo these days is to hear the same question from worried neighbors and friends. Do you know a safe neighborhood in New York? How is Tacoma? Do you think my son will be all right in Minnesota?
The same questions had been asked by Mr. Ito's mother, Rumiko.
Mrs. Ito, 43, who lives with her husband in Chiba Prefecture, a Tokyo suburb, said as she left for the United States that she had opposed sending her son to California for college, after being shaken by the slaying two years ago of Yoshi Hattori.
Mr. Hattori, a high school exchange student, was shot in Baton Rouge, La., as he and a friend approached the wrong house for a Halloween party. In Japan his murder became known as the "Freeze! case," because he apparently did not understand the warning yelled to him by a scared homeowner just before he was shot. The homeowner, Rodney Peairs, was acquitted of manslaughter last May under a Louisiana law that permits the use of deadly force against an intruder.
The verdict caused considerable anger at the American justice system; in Japan, where handguns are virtually banned, Mr. Peairs would probably have been given a long prison term.
 
Recalling Another Victim
 This morning, by chance, six students and several teachers from McKinley High, the school Mr. Hattori was attending, arrived at the American Embassy here to begin what their principal, Clarence Jones, called a "healing mission."
"We want to say that America is still a safe place," Mr. Jones said at Mr. Mondale's news conference. But, he conceded, "this certainly does hinder the message."
Many of the news reports here have focused on the phenomenon of carjacking, a crime that is not known to exist in Japanese society. One private news station went so far yesterday as to re-enact the crime.
 
Distorted Picture of America
 Mr. Mondale argued today that Japanese television exaggerates the risks, that killings like those last weekend "give an entirely distorted picture of life in the United States."
"Most everyone lives a safe and fulfilling life in the United States and are untouched by such horrible criminal behavior," he said. But, he added, "There is that part in American life that cries out for a better answer than the ones we've found to date."
It is difficult to tell what impact the violent imagery is having on the Japanese. The number of exchange students sent to the United States is down somewhat, but that may be attributable more to Japan's economic recession than to fear of crime.
But every case recalls the past ones: the president of a Japanese university, Iwao Matsuda, who was murdered in an upscale Boston hotel two years ago, or the case of Masakazu Kuriyama, a 25-year-old exchange student, who was killed while waiting for a train in Concord, Calif., last summer. Some Japanese say they wonder if they are being picked out of a crowd for violent crime, and the Government has begun several programs to warn travelers about how to take precautions, describing the United States the way the State Department might warn Americans about travel in a third-world country.
"It is a great thing that the U.S. raises human rights issues in its diplomatic policy," Chikushi Tetsuya, a popular television commentator, said tonight on his show. "But the most important human right is not to be killed."

HEADLINE: Lamenting Lost Lives, Lost Dreams

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 28

 BODY:
Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were enticed here from Japan by a promise that has lured countless others to Southern California: the prospect of making movies. Now both are going home, victims at age 19 of what increasing numbers of Japanese have come to believe is as American as Hollywood: senseless, deadly violence dispensed with ubiquitous handguns.
Bouquets piled up in the supermarket parking lot in San Pedro, 15 miles south of here, where the two film students at nearby Marymount College were shot in the head late Friday by a gunman who then stole Mr. Ito's white 1994 Honda Civic. 
 By today, the site had been transformed into a shrine, delineated by the melted wax of votive candles. On what had been two ordinary parking places were 27 bunches of flowers, 5 potted plants and a small box of Morning Star jasmine incense. On the side of an empty shrimp carton someone had written: "We must have gun control. Who is next? Your child?"
 
Flowers and a Scroll
 The Japanese consul general here, Seiichiro Noboru, stopped by to place flowers of his own. And a local man named Greg Griswold left a scroll of white paper tied with a pink ribbon, addressed to the two Japanese students. "My wife and I shop here every week, and we did so without fear," the message said. "You two took bullets for everyone else who comes here."
On Sunday, as their grieving parents arrived from Japan, the two friends, who had been declared "brain dead" earlier that day, were taken off life support.
Though Mr. Ito's car has been recovered, no suspect has been arrested. As the investigation proceeded, two sets of parents expressed bewilderment over the extent and randomness of American violence. "Isn't there something we can all do so that this doesn't happen again?" Shuki Matsuura asked shortly after consenting to have his son disconnected from life-support equipment.
 
Final Journey Home
 The students' parents met today with Mr. Noboru and Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles. Mr. Ito's parents planned to ship their son's body back to Japan; the family of Mr. Matsuura will bring back his ashes. Neither family would talk to reporters. "They are exhausted and grieving," said Shimizu Hisapsugu, an attache at the Japanese consulate in Los Angeles.
At Marymount College, a small and expensive two-year institution overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Palos Verdes, flags hung at half-staff today. Teachers mourned two young men whom they described as fun-loving, hard-working and utterly enthralled with America. Mr. Matsuura, in fact, was an American citizen who was born in the United States, having returned to Japan with his family as a young schoolboy.
In a journal entry written for a class earlier this month, shortly after he had returned from his grandfather's funeral in Japan, Mr. Ito described his ongoing Americanization. "When I ate the rice, I felt like eating hamburgers like American people," he wrote. "Though my home country is Japan, I really wanted to go back to the U.S.A. like a refugee. The air of California is very comfortable, like water in a desert. Truth: I like it here, as a second hometown."
He and Mr. Matsuura shared one more trait: They were obsessed with films, borrowing videocassettes of classics like "Metropolis" and "Juliet of the Spirits" from their instructors to watch overnight, even though they had just seen them in class. In another essay, Mr. Ito described how much he wanted a girlfriend who would want to watch films with him.
 
Love of American Culture
 "These two particular guys loved being in Los Angeles and they loved the American culture," said Pat Kelley, who taught them in a class on introductory film making. "They went out of their way to have American friends and learn the language and write in the language, and they lived and breathed films."
The Los Angeles Police Department has been inundated with calls from all over the world, particularly from Japan. "I had no idea there were so many newspapers over there," said a department spokesman, Arthur Holmes Jr.
Cast against the backdrop of the Los Angeles riots in 1992 and the shooting death of a Japanese student in Louisiana that same year, tourism officials said the killings of Mr. Ito and Mr. Matsuura could deal a devastating blow to the $11 billion Japanese tourism trade in the United States, which has already suffered from economic problems in Japan. Every year, three million Japanese visit America, and most of those come to Los Angeles, drawn by Disneyland, Universal Studios and other local attractions.
 
Other Destinations
 Their numbers declined by 30 percent after the 1992 riots. And now, tourism officials say, they are certain to plummet even further as more Japanese choose destinations that seem less dangerous, like Australia. Increasingly, those who come here do so as if they were entering a war zone. Last July, the Japanese Assistance Network, a travel marketing firm in Los Angeles, began offering Japanese tourists to report a crime by using a calling card enabling them to speak, through translators, to law-enforcement officials throughout the United States.
Dave Karraker, the network's national account manager, said several Japanese corporations provided the card -- called Anshin, Japanese for "a feeling of security" -- to executives stationed in America and to their families. Readers of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the leading Japanese-language newspaper in the United States, receive the card with every new subscription; two major airlines and a car rental company catering to Japanese tourists may soon follow suit.
Michael Collins, a senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, conceded that the latest killings would contribute to Japanese fear that Los Angeles is a dangerous place, and that the city would suffer for it. But he noted that most visitors enjoyed Los Angeles without mishap. "This is a ghastly exception to very positive stories that happen literally thousands and thousands and thousands of times a year," he said.

HEADLINE: Trade Plan Is Offered By Japan

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, March 29

 BODY:
In a bid to break the trade stalemate with the United States, Japan announced today a package of market-opening measures that is wide in scope but lacks some specific commitments sought by Washington.
In an early analysis, some American officials here said they felt that the measures did not go much beyond what Japan was offering on Feb. 11, when trade talks collapsed during a meeting in Washington between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. As such, the new steps might not immediately lead to a resumption of talks.
 
U.S. Disappointment Seen
 "I would be a little surprised if we see enough to say 'Let's go back to where we were on Feb. 11,' " one American official here said Monday night, a few hours before the package was officially delivered to the United States Embassy. Even Japanese officials, he said, were saying that the Clinton Administration would not be fully satisfied. 
 In a separate announcement today, Japan said it was discontinuing its voluntary restraints on exports of automobiles to the United States. But that move is expected to have little impact because exports have dropped below the ceiling during the last seven years as Japanese car makers shifted production to factories in the United States. [D15.]
After trade talks with the United States broke down last month, Japan promised to undertake voluntary steps to decrease its huge trade surplus by opening its markets wider. But the Government has become preoccupied by other domestic political issues. Today's announcement of market-opening measures was intended to mollify the United States with at least a partial plan.
 
Promises of Action
 In the package, decisions on crucial elements -- like cutting taxes, increasing public works spending and more deregulation -- were put off until June, although there were expressions of intent to take action.
Japanese officials say their new proposals for specific sectors like automobiles, telecommunications and medical equipment, which were the focus of the failed talks, go only slightly beyond the ones they made in February. Japan has still refused to set numerical goals for opening its markets. Setting such goals has been the keystone of the Clinton Administration's trade strategy.
Japanese officials sounded somewhat sheepish that stronger measures, like additional tax cuts to spur consumer spending, could not be announced this morning. But they said the new plan represents a significant first step, and they expressed hope that Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and other American officials would accept it.
"I hope he looks a bit into and beyond what we will be able to announce tomorrow," one Japanese official said of Mr. Kantor on Monday night, before the package was officially announced. Last week, Mr. Kantor said that only a "bold" plan by Japan would be acceptable.
When the trade talks fell apart in February, mainly over the issue of numerical targets, Japanese executives and officials at first were elated that the nation had finally said "no" to American demands. But then the yen strengthened, choking Japanese industries that rely on exports, and the United States unsheathed its sword by initiating a lengthy process that could result in sanctions against Japan.
Suddenly, Japanese business executives and newspaper editorials began insisting that Japan must offer a plan to open its markets.
Japanese officials have been hoping that Washington will drop its insistence on numerical targets in response to world opinion, which generally opposes that approach.
At the moment, however, those American officials like Mr. Kantor who advocate getting tough with Japan seem to be in the driver's seat because firm tactics worked in forging a recent agreement to open more of Japan's cellular telephone market to Motorola Inc.
The development of a plan by Japan has been hindered by the disarray in Prime Minister Hosokawa's coalition Government, which has been hurt by infighting and by questions over a loan that Mr. Hosokawa received from a scandal-tainted trucking company. The Government has not even compiled the budget for the fiscal year that begins on Friday, making it difficult for it to consider other economic stimulus measures.
The Government was unable to decide on the specifics of the main macro-economic elements of the plan -- extending into future years the income tax cuts enacted this year and increasing public-works spending beyond the 430 trillion yen (about $4 trillion) planned for this decade.
Today's plan merely expresses the Government's intention for extending the income tax cuts, saying the governing coalition is expected to decide by June. Regarding public works spending, the plan says only that increases will be considered in a review due by June.
The announcement promises that a plan to deregulate priority areas will be compiled by the end of June, with foreigners allowed to offer ideas. The priority areas include housing and land use, telecommunications and financial services.
Japan is also promising to overhaul government procurement, both in general and specifically for telecommunications and medical equipment.
In February, Japan refused to set targets regarding automobiles. But now, in a concession to the United States, Japan's largest auto companies are announcing voluntary plans to buy certain amounts of American and foreign auto parts. The Toyota Motor Corporation and Mitsubishi Motors announced their plans today.
Toyota projected that its purchases of American-made auto parts would increase to $6.45 billion in its fiscal year beginning April 1, 1996, up from $4.43 billion in 1992. Mitsubishi said it would try to raise its purchases to between $1.40 billion and $1.63 billion in the 1996 fiscal year, from $650 million in the 1993 fiscal year.

HEADLINE: Japan to End Restraints on Auto Exports to U.S.

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, March 29

 BODY:
Japan announced today that it would discontinue its voluntary restraints on exports of automobiles to the United States when its fiscal year ends on Thursday.
The restrictions, an example of what is now called managed trade, were begun in 1981, at a time when American car makers were reeling from Japanese competition. But the end of the program comes as Detroit's Big Three have narrowed the quality gap with Japan and are gaining more of the American market. 
 The export restraints have had little actual impact for the last seven years because exports have dropped below the ceiling as Japanese companies shifted production to factories in the United States. For the fiscal year that ends Thursday, exports of Japanese cars to the United States will total about 1.4 million, down from 1.57 million a year earlier and comfortably below the current export ceiling of 1.65 million units.
For that reason, the United States Government is not expected to voice much opposition to today's announcement. In recent trade talks with Japan, Washington has been much more interested in expanding exports of American products to Japan rather than blocking imports of Japanese products.
But some auto executives argued in the past that if the ceiling was too high, it should be lowered, not eliminated. The United States, they have argued, still has a huge trade deficit with Japan in automobiles and auto parts.
Perhaps out of caution, therefore, Japan waited until just before the end of the fiscal year. And it made its announcement on a day when the news would be overshadowed by a bigger announcement of measures to open its markets.
In announcing the decision at a news conference today, Hiroshi Kumagai, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, said one reason Japan was eliminating the auto export ceilings was that the world trade treaty reached in December under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade called for phasing out programs like voluntary export restraints.
In recent trade talks, Japan has resisted Washington's pursuit of numerical targets for opening markets.
But American officials point to the auto program as evidence that Japan is willing to agree to specific numbers if the situation demands them. Japan has argued that voluntarily restricting exports is possible, while assuring that imports reach a certain level is beyond the Government's control.
Japan also has restraints on exports of cars to Europe, although in that case, the ceilings are negotiated. In the case of the United States, Japan's trade ministry unilaterally set the ceiling each year.
The ministry decided to institute the ceilings in 1981 partly to pre-empt Congress from taking such action. The initial ceiling was set at 1.68 million units and was raised to 1.85 million units in 1984 and then to 2.3 million from the fiscal years 1985 through 1991, before dropping to 1.65 million.
The voluntary restraints helped cause big changes in the industry. Partly because the number of vehicles it could export were limited, Japanese companies began shifting from economy cars to larger cars, increasing their profits. They also successfully invaded the luxury market with car lines like the Lexus from Toyota and the Infiniti from Nissan.

The Colombian President said today that his main objective as the new leader of the Organization of American States would be to create a single free-trade zone for countries in the Western Hemisphere.
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, who was elected Secretary General of the organization on Sunday, said in an interview today: "We want the different trade agreements in the continent to converge into one single process, under equal conditions. We want to create a single, larger free trade zone." 
 In addition to the economic issues, President Gaviria discussed his hopes for bringing the organization up to date in the post-cold-war world and for cooperation among members in fighting the drug trade. He also promised to dedicate himself to promoting human rights.
 
Greater Effectiveness Sought
 He said he would encourage reform of the group, which has been criticized as ineffectual when it was unable to persuade Haiti's military Government to agree on the return to power of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a military coup.
"It is not that the organization has been debilitated," Mr. Gaviria said. "But with the ending of the cold war and the change in international realities, the nature of this hemisphere's problems have changed. That is what makes the organization look outmoded vis-a-vis these new realities."
Last year, Colombia established diplomatic relations with Cuba, ending more than 11 years of estrangement that began when Colombia accused Cuba of training and aiding Colombian leftist rebels.
Mr. Gaviria has since sought to increase links with President Fidel Castro.
When asked about the differences between his stand on Cuba and Washington's, Mr. Gaviria said: "All of us in America trust that Cuba will undergo economic and political changes that in the future will permit its reintegration to the inter-American system. I cannot take a different position from that of the organization, even though I believe that it is dialogue that will eventually help to stimulate the process of change."
On the issue of human rights, he said, "As Secretary General, I will work harder in preventing violations and promoting human rights" as well as working to strengthen organizations that monitor human rights.
 
Rights Violations in Colombia
 Mr. Gaviria's Government has been accused by international and Colombian human rights monitors of doing little to stop violations in his own country.
Last year, the Andean Commission of Jurists found that about three-quarters of reported violations in which culprits had been identified had involved Colombian security forces or the paramilitary group that they are accused of backing.
The Government has blamed leftist rebels for paving the way for violence and abuses.
Mr. Gaviria said the O.A.S. should foster increased judicial cooperation among member countries in antidrug efforts. The United States Justice Department recently decided to withhold evidence from Colombia that could be used in trials against drug traffickers because it was dissatisfied with the Colombian chief prosecutor's handling of such evidence.
"I hope differences can be resolved," Mr. Gaviria said, "because judicial cooperation is quintessential to Colombia's fight against drug trafficking."
Mr. Gaviria's chief opponent in the organization's election, Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus of Costa Rica, suggested that the choice had been unduly influenced by the United States, which gave its support to Mr. Gaviria.
Mr. Gaviria dismissed that suggestion, but gave much of the credit to his Foreign Minister, Noemi Sanin, who made several trips to Central American and Caribbean countries in an effort to win backing for Mr. Gaviria by promising Colombian support in local free-trade efforts.

HEADLINE: GAPS IN COVERAGE FOR HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 28

 BODY:
Twenty-five percent of all Americans were without health insurance some time from February 1990 to September 1992, the Census Bureau said today.
The statistic helps explain the political appeal of President Clinton's proposal to guarantee "health care that can never be taken away." Even people who have health insurance through their employers may lose coverage when they lose or change jobs, the bureau observed. 
 Thus, it said, 60 million Americans, or a quarter of the population outside institutions like prisons or nursing homes, lacked coverage for at least one month during the 32-month period.
In general, adults were more likely to have insurance as they grew older. Robert Bennefield, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said: "Young adults were most vulnerable to lapses in coverage, while the elderly were the least vulnerable. One-half of the people age 18 to 24 spent at least one month without coverage, compared with just 1 percent of older Americans, most of whom are covered by Medicare."
 
'There's No Guarantee'
 Hispanic people were much more likely than blacks or whites to experience a loss or lapse of coverage. Forty-eight percent of Hispanic people were without insurance for at least one month. By contrast, 36 percent of blacks and 24 percent of whites were uninsured for a month or more.
Women were slightly less likely than men to have had gaps in coverage, for two reasons. It was more common for women to be poor and to participate in Medicaid. In addition, a higher proportion of women than men were 65 and over; women were therefore more likely to be enrolled in Medicare.
Joshua M. Wiener, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: "Thirty-nine million Americans, or 17 percent of the population, lack health insurance at any given time. But the problem affects many more people over a longer period, and the middle class is worried. Many giants of American industry -- I.B.M., Sears, Procter & Gamble -- have laid off thousands of workers. You might have great health insurance now, but there's no guarantee you'll have it in the future because you may lose your job."
In a poll taken by The New York Times earlier this month, people were asked what happened while they were uninsured. About one-third of the uninsured said they had serious medical problems in that time. Another third said they had no serious problems at all. One-third said they had no real problems, but worried a lot.
The Census Bureau said that only 13 percent of full-time workers experienced gaps in health insurance coverage from 1990 to 1992, while 38 percent of those who were unemployed for a month or more had such gaps.
The likelihood of having insurance coverage was closely correlated with a person's income. "Falling below the poverty line increases the odds of losing coverage," the bureau said.
Among people with incomes under the official poverty level, 49 percent were without insurance for a month or more from 1990 to 1992. By contrast, among people with incomes at least four times the poverty level, only 9 percent were uninsured for a month or more. (A family of three was classified as poor if it had income less than $11,521 last year.)
 
Campaign Contributions
 In a separate study, a consumer group reported today that the health and insurance industries had significantly increased campaign contributions to Congressional candidates.
Contributions from January 1993 through January 1994 totaled $11.3 million, up 22 percent from the comparable period of the last election cycle two years ago, said the consumer group, Citizen Action.
Michael Podhorzer, health policy director at Citizen Action, said, "These hefty campaign contributions have helped paralyze Congressional action."
Contributions from doctors and other health care professionals totaled $2.6 million, up 39 percent from the earlier election cycle, Citizen Action said. Contributions from drug companies and manufacturers of medical equipment totaled $1.5 million, up 21 percent.
Mr. Podhorzer said the top contributors in the health and insurance industries were the political action committees of the American Dental Association, which gave $474,847 last year, the American Medical Association ($411,569), the National Association of Life Underwriters ($359,310) and the American Hospital Association ($326,850).

HEADLINE: A Foreign Tourist Is Charged With Murdering a Floridian

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: POMPANO BEACH, Fla., March 28

 BODY:
A destitute Canadian tourist has been charged with robbing a candy store here and fatally stabbing its owner.
The tourist, Jean Francois Chalifoux, 27, of Quebec was charged with murder on Sunday after police officers in this city 30 miles north of Miami saw him getting into a gold BMW that had belonged to the victim, Marilu Cogswell. She died of stab wounds on Saturday. 
 Mr. Chalifoux, who was on a six-week Florida vacation, was being held without bond. The authorities said Mr. Chalifoux had told them he was unemployed and had run out of money when he decided to rob the store.
The incident was an odd counterpoint to Florida's efforts to salvage its reputation as a tourist haven. Last year nine foreign tourists were killed in robberies, many of them in Miami.

HEADLINE: Dow Is Near Year's Low as It Falls by 12.38

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates another quarter-point last week, something traders had spent weeks wishing for, there was hope on Wall Street. Perhaps the stock market, which has almost slavishly tracked bond prices, would at last disentangle itself from the sinking bond market.
No such luck. The Standard & Poor's 500 yesterday set another record low for the year, falling to 460, in quiet trading. The Dow Jones industrial average came close to its low for the year as well, closing at 3,762.35, a scant 8 points away from the opening price on Jan. 3, 1994. 
 "There is still a strong interrelationship between the stock and bond markets that will continue until the bond market stabilizes," said Martin D. Sass, president of M. D. Sass Investors Services, which manages $1.3 billion in bonds and about $700 million in stocks.
That could take months as the bond market awaits clear and convincing evidence that inflation is subdued, despite the prospect of higher corporate earnings, which ought to push stock prices up.
Inflation hurts the value of current bonds and raises the borrowing costs of corporations, thus hurting stocks. With bond traders seeing inflation almost everywhere, despite scant evidence of it, the stock market has had little chance to rise, even though mutual funds, often the largest of stock buyers, are enjoying record cash inflows.
Moreover, this week is likely to be one of drift for the markets, with lackluster price movements and below-average trading volume. Passover and Holy Week are being observed worldwide, with stock exchanges in the United States closed on Good Friday. Also, some market-moving economic reports come at the end of the week -- jobless claims on Thursday and unemployment data on Friday.
In addition, the PRI, the ruling party of Mexico, may not name a successor to its assassinated presidential candidate in deference to Holy Week observance. That may lead to a decline in stock and bond prices in Mexico, where many American investors and companies have sought above-average returns on investment.
The bond market appeared to be reacting to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi Arabia refused to cut its production at the weekend meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The decline eased potential inflationary pressures.
Still, the stock market was nervous in the morning, with the Dow industrials falling as much as 46 points before closing down 12.38 points, to 3,762.35. The S.& P. 500 fell as much as 4 1/2 points, but closed down only 0.58 point, to 460.
The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index, which has often outperformed the Dow and the S.& P. 500, fell 10.95 points, to 772.50. That is less than 2 points from the Jan. 3 record low of 770.72.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.79 point, to 255.50, on lower-than-normal volume of 287.4 million shares. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks, 1,567 to 652. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 6.22 points, to 462.21.
Cisco Systems, a maker of networking software for computers, was the most active stock at 5.7 million shares, indicating how quiet the session was. Its price, however, was unchanged at $33. Like other competitors of Novell, which announced a big merger last week, Cisco faces an uncertain future for computer products as the industry consolidates.

HEADLINE: Help for Peso Rooted in Trade Debate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 28

 BODY:
A secret multibillion-dollar deal struck last November, when passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement looked bleak, turned out to be a powerful factor in helping Mexico survive market instability after the assassination of its leading presidential candidate last week.
But the emergency plan to swap pesos for dollars, which has yet to be utilized, has left some Mexicans uneasy with the extent of United States involvement in Mexican politics that the deal suggests. 
 In the first hectic hours after the shooting of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana on Wednesday night, Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen and the Mexican Treasury Minister, Pedro Aspe, revived the standby agreement under which the United States was willing, if necessary, to buy and hold for a limited time $6 billion worth of Mexican pesos to help Mexico stave off panic selling.
The Mexicans also negotiated a $6 billion line of credit with a group of European central banks. Both deals had been drafted in the days before the televised debate on Nov. 9 between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot on the North American trade pact. At the time, it was uncertain whether the United States Congress would approve the accord.
Together, the deals would have given Mexico $12 billion in assistance to withstand the fallout of a Nafta defeat, even though Mexican officials had repeatedly denied that there was any contingency plan.
Officials in both countries said the arrangements had not previously been disclosed now because they had never been signed and therefore were not official.
Both the United States and European deals expired on December 31, 1993, but the legal paperwork was preserved. The United States deal was revived, and officially signed, within a matter of hours last Thursday. However, there was not enough time after the shooting, Mexican officials said, to put the European deal back into place before the stock exchange reopened on Friday.
The anticipated effect was the same both in November and last week. Although the credit has not been used, the mere fact of United States backing was enough to calm worried international investors.
The Mexican stock exchange, banks and money-exchange houses, after being closed last Thursday, reopened on Friday with substantial losses, but far lesser losses than had been feared. Many investors said they had been reassured by the United States action, as well as by Mexico's acceptance on Thursday as a member of the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Today, the Mexican exchange dropped again, this time losing 74.6 points, or nearly 3 percent, on very light volume of 61 million shares. This is Holy Week in Mexico, a time for vacations, and the exchange will be closed on Thursday and Friday.
 
Credit Due for Mexico's Efforts
 Guillermo Ortiz, Under Secretary of the Mexican Treasury, said last week's "strategy worked only because the economic fundamentals were in place." He added that if Mexico had not worked over the last five years to solidify its financial institutions and build a reliable economic policy, "no matter how much we played on psychology and got help from our friends, this could not have worked."
While the existence of the dollar-peso swap soothed the nerves of investors, it annoyed some Mexicans because it seemed to signal support for continuing the long rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed here for 65 years. Mr. Colosio was the party's presidential candidate and was considered likely to win the Aug. 21 election.
Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said there had been no attempt to support one party over another. "We weren't supporting any particular outcome of the presidential election," he said, "but we were supporting financial stability in Mexico, which everyone would favor."
Mexicans are intrigued by conspiracy theories, and the newspapers have been filled over the last few days with unsubstantiated speculation that in exchange for the credit line, the United States demanded that Mr. Aspe be named the ruling party's candidate. The Mexican Government denies this.
The main opposition-party candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a popular leftist figure, declined to discuss the United States action. But members of his campaign staff said the generous helping hand appeared to prop up the ruling party, even though, they asserted, events of the last few months indicated that Mexicans might be ready for a change.
"What we are seeing is that the U.S. continues to support a political system that can not longer guarantee stability," said Andrea Dabrowski, foreign press secretary for the Cardenas campaign. "The United States bailed out Mexico in 1982, 1986 and 1988, and it did so again last week, but the cost of bailing out Mexico and supporting an undemocratic system continues to get higher."
Many others saw no political favoritism, but were concerned at what they saw as the underlying message of Washington's cooperation.
"The United States Government is alarmed," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a Mexico City consultant. "The scale and promptness with which they acted would indicate that whatever report they have about the political situation of Mexico made them absolutely alarmed."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Post Modest Price Increases

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices managed only modest gains yesterday despite a sharp decline in commodity prices, which did little to reassure market participants nervous over inflation.
Analysts said the advance in the fixed-income market was cooled by heightened bearishness ahead of key employment figures due out on Good Friday, when most United States bond markets are closed. 
 Northwest Airlines, meanwhile, has put off its sale of $350 million in junk bonds until investor demand in the high-yield market improves, according to a source familiar with the Northwest deal.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose 15/32 point, or $4.69 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.97 percent from 7.01 percent.
Friday was the first time the bond yield closed above 7 percent in 10 months.
The tumble in commodity prices was led by a more than $1-a-barrel plunge in oil, touched off by an OPEC decision against cutting production targets that virtually assured a continued glut of oil this summer.
Gold prices fell about $3 an ounce, and other commodities were also lower. As a result, the Commodity Research Bureau index, used as a barometer of future inflation trends, plummeted 3.19, to 227.56.
"It was a bearish story for bonds today, because with that kind of drop in commodities, you didn't have that kind of move in bonds," said Carl Steen, an economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc.
 
Little Done to Soothe Anxiety
 Analysts said the one-day decline in commodity prices did little to soothe nearly two months of anxiety caused by the Federal Reserve's decision on Feb. 4 to push up short-term interest rates for the first time in five years.
The central bank has said it wants to keep inflation from getting out of hand, leading market participants to busily search for signs of price pressures in the economy. The Fed went ahead with its second rate rise last week.
Market participants are extra cautious over inflation this week because they will not get a chance to react to Friday's government employment statistics for February until Monday. A big surge in payrolls could be interpreted as inflationary.
A Northwest spokesman said that the company's debt offering had not been postponed but that the airline was just continuing to check out market conditions.
"There's no question the market overall has deteriorated," said Mark Abels, the Northwest spokesman.
In the last month interest rates have risen sharply, making it prohibitively expensive for many companies to sell junk-bond debt, which already pays high yields to investors to compensate them for a higher perceived risk. While Northwest has been making money recently, it narrowly averted a bankruptcy filing last year.
Prices of short-term Treasuries were 1/32 point higher and intermediate maturities were 3/32 point to 7/32 point higher, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.25, to 1,252.05.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9427/32 , down 14/32 from late Friday. The average yield to maturity was 6.10 percent, up from 6.07 percent.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Study Says Taxpayers Subsidize the Cost of Driving Private Cars

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Of every dollar spent in New York State on road and bridge maintenance, traffic patrols and related expenses, only 65 cents is paid by motorists, with the rest drawn from general tax revenues, according to a new analysis.
The report, released yesterday by the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a coalition of environmental, planning and transportation groups, said that the difference, $2.4 billion, represents an unfair subsidy to drivers by general taxpayers, since 30 percent of New York State households do not own cars. 
 Reducing the cost to drivers below the actual cost encourages more car ownership and the driving of more miles, the study said, adding to pollution, congestion and other problems.
"If motorists paid the full fiscal cost of driving, they would economize on some vehicle use that is not economical for society as a whole," said the report, which was prepared by Komanoff Energy Associates, a consulting firm in Manhattan.
The report is part of an effort by the campaign to encourage investment in mass transit and slow the growth in motor vehicle use.
It contradicts earlier research efforts, such as one by the American Automobile Association's New York chapter that found motorists pay $288 million a year more than is spent on them. But the A.A.A. study did not include local government expenditure, which the new report, which covers all levels of government, identifies as the level where the biggest subsidy occurs.
The analysis did not cover areas outside New York State in any detail, but estimated that for the nation as a whole taxpayers subsidize motorists by $20 billion to $25 billion a year. Those numbers, if correct, would mean that the level of subsidy is higher in New York State than the national average.
"It has to do with the fact that New York has large expenditures and fewer drivers," said Cora Roelofs, a principal author of the study.
Whether such a subsidy exists, and whether desirable, is a matter of dispute. Jerrold Nadler, a United States Representative from Manhattan, said the subsidy was large but hidden. As a legislator in Albany, he said, he introduced bills to require the state to issue budget figures to make the subsidy clear. But his legislation never got out of committee, he said.
"We have made it much cheaper for people to use automobiles than it should be," he said in a telephone interview. "We artificially subsidize it, and we get more auto driving, more pollution of the atmosphere and more lung disease."
He said it was possible that society might decide to make the subsidy, but first its extent should be made clear. Instead, he said, lobbyists for drivers try to segregate money raised from fuel taxes to insure it is spent on roads, leaving the impression that the subsidy runs in the other direction.
But Catherine Nolan, an Assembly member from Long Island City who is a leading advocate of more support for mass transit, said that spending money from sales taxes, income taxes and other general taxes on roads was appropriate, even if the taxes were paid by nondrivers.
"How do they get their milk?" she asked. "Do they go out to the farm by mass transit? How do they get their clothes?"
Maintaining roads and bridges, she said, was part of a "larger good."
But Ms. Roelofs said that the subsidy figure would be even larger if it included all costs, like property taxes foregone by local governments because so much land is dedicated to highways. It also did not include the costs of air and noise pollution, accidents and congestion.
 
U.S. Charges Drivers
 The study found that not all parts of government subsidize drivers. Public authorities, like the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, deliver a surplus of $362 million that is spent on mass transit. The Federal Government also charges drivers nearly $50 million more than it gives them in New York, mostly through fuel taxes, the authors found.
But local governments spend $2.151 billion more on drivers than they collect, according to the study, including $360 million by New York City and $1.791 billion from other local governments in New York State.
The figures were mostly for 1991, although different jurisdictions use different budget years. User fees include taxes on fuels, parking, auto rentals and the petroleum industry in New York State, as well as license fees, tolls, parking meter revenues and other charges. Expenditures include road and bridge construction and maintenance, debt service on road-related bonds, the cost of operating toll booths and running licensing offices and traffic patrol.
The Tri-State Transportation Campaign includes the Regional Plan Association, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund.

Dollar Drops Against Lira Following Italian Exit Polls

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most European currencies yesterday in quiet trading, but fell against the Italian lira, which gained after a conservative party emerged as the likely victor in Italy's national elections.
The dollar also fell against the Japanese yen. 
 The dollar hit its lowest level in over four months against the lira as exit polls indicated the media executive Silvio Berlusconi and his conservative alliance were leading in parliamentary elections.
 
 
'Winding Down'
 "The uncertainty seems to be winding down," Angelo Evangelista, a vice president at Bank of Boston, said.
He and other traders said the lira benefited as the elections appeared to go off smoothly and produce a clear winner. In addition, several traders said Mr. Berlusconi's coalition was viewed as better for business and the economy than the left-wing contender.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1,627 Italian lire, down from 1,649 lire on Friday.
While much of the lira trading was against the German mark, the Italian currency's strength spilled over into its level against the dollar. It last reached these heights last November.
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen as investors grew nervous that trade frictions with the United States would flare again. Japan announced today a package of measures to open its markets further to American products.
"The fear is the United States will just balk and say, 'That's not enough,' " Margaret Kudarauskas, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said.
In New York, the dollar fell to 104.10 yen, from 104.81 yen on Friday.
 
 
Stronger Yen
 Investors believe the United States Government has supported a stronger yen this year as a way to resolve its trade deficit with Japan. A stronger yen can hurt Japanese exports by making them more expensive in dollar terms.
Meanwhile, the dollar rose in New York to 1.6720 German marks from 1.6665 marks. The British pound fell to $1.4965 from $1.4975.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Friday, included: 1.4215 Swiss francs, up from 1.4170; 5.7140 French francs, up from 5.7073, and $1.3743 (Canadian), down from $1.3758 (Canadian).

With Freedom, Hard Times

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere in Europe, the intoxicating reappearance of freedom in 1989 has been followed by a severe hangover. "After the Velvet Revolution," Tom Weidlinger's probing hourlong documentary, focuses on several families and individuals whose stories, affecting in their own right, illuminate much about the economic challenges and political perplexities of today's wishful democratic societies.
A farm family fights to regain the land taken from them by their Communist rulers. People who fought for freedom now have trouble finding a place to live and raise a family. A politically active rock-and-roll star becomes a millionaire entrepreneur. The anti-Communist daughter of a man who prospered under Communism tries to come to terms with her own compromises. A political leader in Slovakia loses the battle against Slovak separatism. A former Communist official finds a place in the new system. 
 Their stories are intertwined with the recent history of their country. Vaclav Havel, who personifies the struggle against dictatorship and the hopes for Czech democracy, is seen in a moment of typical candor confessing that when he arrived at work on the day after his election as President, "I suddenly had no idea what I was supposed to be doing."
The home-grown music is evocative, and the interviews, held where the people live and work, present the human face of a post-Communist society struggling to shake off its painful past even as it stumbles into a murky future.
Although Slovakia is in deep economic depression, the Czech nation seems to be thriving; the camera catches the business bustle of Prague. But remnants of the old system remain. A farmer says, "Today the same Communists are still in the same offices." The new freedom has also produced a new batch of exploiters, capitalists this time. One man laments the loss of community of the days when opponents of the Government shared their dreams and their risks.
The musician turned millionaire also admits to feeling nostalgic about the authoritarian rule that he fought: "This was the world we were born into, the world we knew. Our own dung heap."

HEADLINE: Plan to Carve Up Ocean Floor Riches Nears Fruition

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
HALF the Earth is up for grabs in the culmination of a long-running dispute between rich nations and poor ones. At issue is how the high seas will be developed in the decades and centuries to come, most especially their depths.
These areas of primal cold and darkness make up some 50 percent of the planet's surface, or nearly seven times that of the Moon's. The vast majority are unexplored. Valuable ores and exotic microbes have recently been discovered on volcanic rifts in the ocean and are being harvested to aid the biotechnology revolution. Some experts believe the deep may eventually yield oil and gas. 
 No one owns the abyss. Legally, the sea floor outside the continental shelves and the 230-mile economic zones of the world's coastal states is unclaimed wilderness. But that will soon change.
In November, after 21 years of gestation, the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty is to go into force, despite opposition by many industrialized nations, including the United States. The treaty has 439 articles that cover everything from navigation and research to fishing and pollution. The disputed articles center on the seabed, which the treaty proclaims as the "common heritage of mankind" and seeks to develop under the authority of the United Nations.
The current fight is over whether the treaty can be modified to make it more acceptable to the United States and other industrial powers. None of them has ratified it and some have denounced the mining clauses as a socialist fantasy to channel future profits into the developing world. Among the treaty's backers are Angola, Belize, Cuba, Djibouti, Fiji, Iraq, Mali, Yemen and Zaire.
The Clinton Administration has said it may soon sign the treaty, if it can be revised and made more favorable to free enterprise and American interests. This could break the logjam among the industrial powers and give the treaty broad political force. But would-be ocean miners are wary of the emerging compromise.
"It's frightening," Dr. Lewis Messulam, vice president of Ocean Management Inc., a consortium that tests the feasibility of deep-sea mining, said in an interview. "They've put in a lot of trimming to make it look better. But fundamentally, it's the same document. It's still, 'Give me half of what you've got. Tell me everything you know.' "
No deep-sea mining is now done. Experts agree it is a decade or more away, depending largely on how fast metal prices rise, to what extent technical advances can lower recovery costs and on whether the existing legal ambiguity can be cleared up.
Even so, in the last dozen years the world's industrial powers have quietly staked out exploratory claims in an area of the Pacific thick with manganese nodules, which lie scattered so densely in places they look like cobblestones. The nodules are rich in copper, cobalt and nickel, which is important for making stainless steel.
Countries like Japan, which has few mineral deposits of its own, are seen by experts as possibly wanting to mine the oceans as a way to help achieve greater resource independence, even if such labors initially had poor commercial returns.
United States claims in the Pacific zone, including those of Dr. Messulam's group, total about 190,000 square miles -- an area bigger than that of California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maryland combined. In various tests, many tons of nodules from the zone have been gathered, washed and processed to extract their metals.
Senator Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, who held a hearing in November on seabed mining, said new equipment, like improved sonars, cameras and recovery devices, were increasing its allure. He noted that Japan, a world leader in developing deep-sea gear, recently built an advanced robot to plumb the ocean's deepest trench and said that the United States must make similar investments if it wishes to be a major oceanic player in the decades ahead.
 
Scanning for Nodules
 "The potential payoffs will be vast," Senator Akaka told the hearing. "The race is on."
Manganese nodules were discovered more than a century ago during the first expedition to explore the sea floors. Scientists on the British ship Challenger dredged up whatever they could, including large numbers of potatolike nodules. Cutting them in two revealed mineral layers not unlike tree rings. The cores of larger nodules were often found to contain a bit of volcanic glass or a shark's tooth. It turned out that the teeth were from species long extinct, suggesting that the mineral layers built up over many millions of years.
In subsequent decades fields of nodules were found, ranging in size from golf balls to grapefruits, in the abyssal plains of all the world's oceans. The nodules were made of manganese with varying amounts of other metals.
By the 1960's, prospective ocean miners talked of scanning seas for nodules rich in the most valued metals. Some did it occasionally. The field's legitimacy took a leap in the early 1970's when Howard Hughes built the Glomar Explorer, a 618-foot ship advertised as being constructed to mine the manganese nodules.
In 1974, as the Glomar Explorer began its secretive maiden voyage in the Pacific, some 5,000 delegates and observers from 48 nations converged on Caracas, Venezuela, for United Nations deliberations to try to hammer out a sweeping treaty on the Law of the Sea. Understandably, much of the talk focused on the ship and much treaty language was born amid visions of the world's impoverished nations becoming rich by virtue of seabed mining.
The vision persisted even after disclosures in 1975 and 1976 that the Glomar Explorer's mineral work was a fiction meant to hide a Central Intelligence Agency effort to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from deep Pacific waters.
 
Control by a U.N. Agency
 The Law of the Sea Treaty, as finally written in 1982, said that all natural resources on or below the ocean's floor belonged to the people of the world and proposed that the United Nations create an agency to control their development. Among the law's provisions was a $500,000 fee to be paid by prospective miners, and a mechanism whereby half of any claim areas would be turned over to the Enterprise, a United Nations concern that would mine the sea on behalf of the world's people.
In December 1982, Fiji became the first nation to ratify the treaty. But that month the Reagan Administration denounced the process as nonsense and encouraged American companies to mine freely in accordance with United States law. It also negotiated bilateral agreements with other industrial nations to recognize ensuing claims.
Four American consortiums were formed to mine some of the richest Pacific areas lying between the Clarion and Clipperton fracture zones in the eastern Pacific, an area where the nickel content of nodules is particularly high. The area is estimated to have billions of tons of nodules, and each American claim is big enough to support mining operations for at least 20 years.
The United Nations group making preparations for the International Sea-Bed Authority, which would govern the abyssal zones, in the 1980's condemned the consortiums' plans as "wholly illegal." Speaking for the Group of 77, the developing states' lobby, the island nation of Cape Verde said any prospecting outside prospective United Nation's rules was a "dangerous path" that could lead to confusion and conflict.
Some industrial nations tended to take a more cautious approach by also registering with the United Nations, hedging their bets. To date, claims have been made in various ways by Russia, India, Japan, France, China, Germany, South Korea and consortiums composed of countries like Belgium, Canada, Italy, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
The United Nations at the moment has no formal mechanism for the resolution of conflicting claims. In cases of overlap, the nations at odds have worked out agreements between themselves in private negotiations. In a similar way, the United States during the Reagan Administration ceded Russia about 10,000 square miles of Pacific seabed to resolve a conflict.
 
Putting Treaty into Force
 The four American consortiums have spent an estimated $500 million to prospect over the years, but are doing little work now. The main labor of late is environmental research. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is studying the impact of ocean mining on such abyssal fauna as sea cucumbers, sea urchins, star fish, bristle worms, sea pens, sea squirts, sea lilies, acorn worms, peanut worms and lamp shells.
Mining is a hot topic because on Nov. 16, Guyana, in South America, became the 60th nation to ratify the treaty, the number needed to trigger its entry into force. The treaty, to become international law this Nov. 16, is now generating a rush of diplomatic activity.
The Clinton Administration has won some concessions and says it is close to negotiating a workable accord. The draft agreement would streamline the Sea-Bed Authority, eliminate provisions forcing the transfer of mining technology to the Enterprise, create a grandfather clause for American claims, abandon large annual fees miners pay before commercial production and, most importantly, increase American influence in the governing process.
This preliminary agreement, a State Department fact sheet says, would allow the United States "and a few other industrialized nations acting in concert to block decisions inimical to our interest."
But Dr. Messulam of Ocean Management, whose offices are located in New York City at Inco Ltd., a large nickel producer, of which he is the senior legal officer, said the changes were far from enough to make the treaty close to being tolerable. Half of all claim sites would still have to be turned over to the Enterprise, and onerous fees could still be slapped on miners.
"It's easy to say, 'Who cares? It's so futuristic,' " he remarked. "Well, we worry. As a legal precedent it's very important. And manganese nodules are a valuable resource. In due course, they'll be exploited. It's a question of when, not if."
 
'It's a Bad Agreement'
 If the Clinton Administration did sign a modified treaty, it would still have to be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. Only nations that ratify the treaty are bound by its provisions, though some of its less disputed ideas are already accepted as common law, like the 230-mile exclusive economic zones claimed by many of the world's coastal states.
Doug Bandow, a former special assistant to President Reagan and now a senior fellow of the Cato Institute, a private group in Washington, contended that the treaty would harm rich and poor nations alike by increasing costs and depressing productivity.
"It's a bad agreement," he wrote in a recent Cato report, "one that cannot be improved without abandoning its philosophical presupposition that the seabed is the common heritage of the world's politicians and their agents, the Authority and the Enterprise."
Clifton Curtis of the environmental group Greenpeace, which backs the treaty, said in an interview that ideological battles over mining had obscured the many benefits of the treaty's 439 articles. In particular, he cited provisions for the prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution, and for the protection of sea creatures.
"It's not perfect," he said of the treaty, "but the benefits far outweigh the problems."
David A. Ross, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, said the mining issue still had a false allure, despite depressed metal markets.
"About 50 percent of the world is covered with manganese nodules," he said. "It's an amazing thing. Seabed resources are awesome in size but not necessarily in value. Nobody has made a penny from manganese nodules except lawyers."
 
A Claim by South Korea
 Karl Jugel, head of the ocean minerals division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that despite the depressed metals market, industrialized nations were increasingly active in prospecting. The most recent claim, he said, was made by South Korea in January.
"There's a lot of interest internationally, maybe 20 countries in all," he said in an interview. "It's just a question of when the nickel market is going to recover."
John E. Flipse, a retired pioneer of ocean prospecting who taught engineering for more than a decade at Texas A & M University, said mining the oceans was inevitable.
"The cost of terrestrial mining and the environmental impact of terrestrial mining is increasing all the time," he said from his home in Georgetown, S.C.. "The qualities of the ores on land are diminishing, some rapidly. Huge new discoveries are unlikely. Ocean mining is going to work. The feasibility has been demonstrated.
"Ultimately, it's the sea or metal substitution."

HEADLINE: Picky Eaters in Monterey Bay Who Dabble in Petty Theft

 BODY:
SUCKERFACE the sea otter prefers octopus and purple sea urchins for dinner. Another otter, Flathead, likes to chew on crabs and suck the gonads of sea stars, while Nosebuster munches exclusively on turban snails.
Marine biologists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California have discovered that sea otters are picky eaters, generally preferring only 2 or 3 kinds of prey out of 30, and the preference is largely influenced by their mothers. They also found that male sea otters are prodigious thieves that pilfer a third of their food from the females; the females seem to tolerate this peccadillo. 
 Led by Dr. Marianne Riedman, director of the Sea Otter Field Research Program at the aquarium, the team of marine biologists tracked more than 60 sea otters along the Monterey Bay Peninsula from 1985 to 1992 to study their role in the coastal marine ecosystem. The studies included observation of the otters' social and mating behaviors, diets, survival strategies and patterns of communication.
 
First Long-Term Study
 "This is the first long-term behavioral observation of sea otters," Dr. Riedman said. "We found that they have great environmental and economical impacts and help maintain the near-shore marine ecosystem."
Whiskered and with a weasel-like face, at up to four feet in length they are the largest mustelids, a group that includes freshwater otters, weasels, minks, skunks and badgers. Scientists believe the sea otters evolved from a primitive fish-eating otterlike animal five million to seven million years ago.
Although newcomers to the sea compared with other marine mammals, they are among the most intelligent and innovative. Dr. Riedman said they are quick to learn from one another and have mastered the use of rocks to crack open shellfish.
Lacking blubber like other marine mammals such as whales and dolphins, sea otters eat up to 30 percent of their body weight daily to keep warm in the chilly waters. But their voracious appetites do not create a food shortage because each otter's preference for a few types of foods means that no single food source is likely to be destroyed in a colony.
When not busy diving for food, the otters wrap strands of kelp around themselves and float on their backs in groups, their paws pointed skyward as if praying. Lifting their paws out of water helps them conserve body heat, Dr. Riedman said.
 
Dense Layers of Fur
 The sea otters also keep warm with unusually thick and luxurious double-layered fur, the densest among animals. The soft and fuzzy outer hair forms a protective covering that keeps the fine and dense underfur dry. One square inch of sea otter underfur contains up to one million hairs.
But this feature essential to their survival almost led to their demise as humans discovered their fur and coveted it for their own warmth.
Sea otters once thrived across the rim of the North Pacific from northern Japan to the Alaska Peninsula and along the Pacific Coast of North America to Baja California. They are especially plentiful off the Channel Islands of southern California and the central and northern areas of the state. There were once thought to be nearly 20,000 California sea otters and 150,000 to 300,000 worldwide.
But commercial hunting that began 300 years ago drastically reduced their numbers. By the early 1900's, the sea otters had dwindled to 2,000 worldwide. They are now classified as "depleted" under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, "threatened" under the Federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, and are fully protected in California.
Under government protection, the sea otter population has resurged to 150,000 worldwide. There are now about 2,200 otters along the central California coast, Dr. Riedman said. The current clan of California otters descended from a group of 32 found in Point Sur in 1915. Biologists at first kept their discovery a secret to prevent poachers from hunting them.
While elated by the otters' return, scientists are concerned about the California otters' population growth of 5 percent a year, which lags far behind the rate of 17 to 20 percent among Alaska otters. Dr. Riedman attributes this to the mortality rate of nearly 40 percent for otter pups in California. Drownings in gill nets and other fishing nets along the coastlines also caused California sea otters to decline in the 1970's.
Sea otters are also sensitive to pollution. An oil or gas spill could endanger much of their population, therefore disturbing the delicate ecological balance in the ocean, Dr. Riedman said.
Sea otters help maintain this balance by protecting kelp forests, which provide shelter and nutrients for plants and animals, by feasting on invertebrates like sea urchins and abalones that destroy the kelp, Dr. Riedman said. Kelp also benefits humans. Extracts made from it can be used to make hundreds of products, ranging from ice cream to paint to dissolvable surgical thread.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Always Believe Dictators

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In his opening statement at the prime-time news conference last week, President Clinton spoke about the nuclear crisis with North Korea. He spoke 10 words, adding up to nothing.
At that, he did better than the American press. Until toward the end of the conference, nobody brought up a question about anything but Whitewater. 
 Then an exasperated foreign journalist said Senor Presidente, how about Korea, Russia and South Africa?
About Korea, El Presidente told him that the situation was serious,that the North Koreans could make "many contributions" to a united Korea -- true enough but unlikely. Carefully uninformative, the reply lacked the sense of danger and moment that the Administration itself feels.
The American press came to dig into Whitewater -- no trivial job. But if the President had wished he could have dealt with Whitewater and also seized the chance to create the national attention the Korean crisis deserves and is not getting.
All he had to say was what his foreign policy team believes: The dispute with North Korea is part of the most critical "foreign" problem the country faces, a sample of nuclear crises to come. The President's goals are to prevent both war with North Korea and its military nuclear empowerment. But after a year of trying he does not know whether the taut, isolated Communist Government will let the U.S. achieve the second goal without losing the first.
So far, he has not laid out the crisis plainly and fully, as war-or-peace issues should be presented. Americans have the right to know exactly what is going on in any crisis that could lead to war -- and how worried their own Government may be. The American public does not yet seem to grasp the fact that war is now what the North Koreans are threatening.
When dictators threaten war, believe them. In this century, dictators from Hitler to Saddam have fulfilled threats of war -- led on by their power, their secret lusts and their vision of humanity as existing to be conquered.
But if another Korean war is to be avoided without the North getting the prize of nuclear weaponry, the Communists must understand that the President is talking straight-on to Americans, alerting them to the risk as well as the goals.
Specifically Pyongyang must know he is telling his own country that North Korea might invade South Korea rather than give up dreams of Asia-wide power through nuclear weapons. Unless North Korea understands that the U.S. public is being told of the possibility of war, it may make the mistake that led to the Northern invasion of South Korea in 1950: the assumption that the U.S. would stay out.
The strange thing about the President's reticence on the North Korean danger is that his Administration has created a record that does it credit. Mr. Clinton faced the fact that the North Koreans were heading fast toward nuclear armament, which Bushbaker did not.
Then he tried to get North Korea to live up to its broken promises to permit full international nuclear inspection. He offered diplomatic and economic rewards. Probably it was inevitable that the Pyongyang dictatorship, like all such, would see conciliatory offers as weakness.
But if he had not tried, Mr. Clinton would have sacrificed in advance the U.S. and international support he will need if it comes to war, or the edge of war.
But the President has not made clear to Americans what his own Administration believes. Preventing production of nuclear weapons by countries that would distribute them to terrorist governments or terrorist movements, for profit or power, is the most important international problem in the world. For example: North Korea to Iran to Hezbollah.
Why the surprisingly laid-back public position toward a danger that in private makes Administration experts sit up so very straight?
When in doubt, pick the simplest answer. The President believes it would frighten people too much if he spoke up about Korea more plainly. That is a mistake Presidents tend to make -- underestimating the public's desire, right and need to confront whatever national dangers exist.
We are not talking about saber-rattling. The North Koreans are doing that loud enough. What's needed from Mr. Clinton is simply adult talk to adult citizens, and more than 10 careful words.

HEADLINE: A Scandal That Doesn't Exist Fills the News;
Let Counsel Investigate

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Senators William S. Cohen, Alfonse M. D'Amato, Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, Representative Newt Gingrich and other Republicans in Congress should honor the request of Robert B. Fiske Jr., special counsel in the Whitewater investigation, to delay any Congressional hearings on the matter. 
 Mr. Fiske has the facilities and expertise to do his job. He is a former United States attorney, has a staff of eight current or former prosecutors, more than 20 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and financial analysts, a special grand jury in Little Rock and a staff in Washington.
Issues that need Congressional attention are many. Among them: retraining for the unemployed due to the Grumman buyout and other business setbacks, health care, campaign finance reform, Haiti, welfare reform and better solutions to curbing crime.
Only one investigation at a time is needed.

HEADLINE: U.S. Spurns Japan's Concessions on Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The nation's top trade official dismissed Japan's latest proposed trade concessions today as inadequate and half-finished, and said the United States would not reopen trade talks until the Japanese went further.
The strong criticism by Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, showed that the Clinton Administration had no intention of easing its pressure on Japan despite the weakening of its Government and the growing possibility of fresh elections there later in the spring. 
 "The package of measures is of limited substance and appears to be half-finished work," Mr. Kantor said at a White House news conference.
The American response leaves trade relations with Japan in a stalemate, and no resolution in sight. Trade talks broke down on Feb. 11, when President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to meet an ambitious schedule set last summer for a gradual reduction of Japanese trade barriers and for new tax and spending policies to stimulate the Japanese economy.
Bowman Cutter, an official of the President's National Economic Council, noted that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hosokawa were not scheduled to meet again until July in Naples, at an economic summit meeting of leaders of seven industrial democracies.
Mr. Kantor said the Administration was not discouraged, and welcomed indications by Japanese officials that their latest proposed concessions were only a first step and would be fleshed out with details. "As the President has said, our door remains open," Mr. Kantor said.
But Japanese officials expressed dismay at the American response. "I think this is a very harsh message," an official at the Japanese Embassy said. "If the U.S. strategy is based on the belief that only by bringing pressure can you produce results, that runs the risk of bringing the U.S. and Japan to the edge of a cliff."
The House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, joined the Administration in rejecting the Japanese offer as inadequate. "Japan has once again offered to make changes sometime in the future, hoping to reduce tensions without acting," he said. "We should no longer accept recycled promises from the past."
The Japanese presented their proposals to American officials in Tokyo early today. The initial American reaction was that the package was a rewarmed version of previous offers, and Mr. Kantor noted this afternoon that Japanese newspapers and some business groups had reached a similar conclusion. "There appears to be agreement in Japan that the plan does not present concrete steps toward resolving the issues raised by President Clinton," he said.
The Japanese proposal promises an extension of income tax cuts, an overhaul of government procurement rules and the deregulation of big industries like telecommunications and financial services, which foreign companies have found tough to enter. But the proposal included very few details, most of which are to be worked out by June.
Japan announced later today that it would discontinue its restraints on exports of automobiles to the United States. The restraints, which will end Thursday, have had relatively little effect because exports fell below the ceiling when Japanese companies moved some of their production to American factories.
The Clinton Administration has increasingly sought to ally itself with businesses and other powerful groups in Japan to increase pressure on civil servants there who have resisted opening the market to imports.
 
Swapping Strategies
 Trade tension has recently pushed up the value of the yen, reducing or eliminating the profit margins of many Japanese exporters, who must pay for wages and material in yen, but receive devalued dollars for their goods. The dollar dropped further against the yen today.
The United States and Japan have in effect swapped trade negotiating strategies in the last year. For many years, the United States sought to rally international opinion against Japanese trade barriers. In contrast, Japan allied itself with big American companies like computer makers that relied on parts from Japan.
Now the roles are reversed, with Japan seeking diplomatic backing in Europe and East Asia for its defiance of an Administration that is much more willing than its predecessors to threaten sanctions against longtime allies. The next chance for Japan to rally international opinion against United States policies will come in Marrakesh, Morocco, where more than 100 trade ministers are scheduled to meet on April 15 to sign the new GATT agreement, which is to expand international free-trade rules.
"There were some steps forward in the government procurement area," Mr. Kantor said, but before trade talks can resume, Tokyo must commit itself to allowing specific measurements of trade progress like numerical targets and to further stimulating its economy.
He expressed doubt about pledges today by the Japanese auto companies to buy more American-made parts. The companies had agreed in 1992 to expand these purchases, he noted, adding that his concern that the Japanese Government was not involved in insuring that the companies made good on their pledges.

HEADLINE: MEXICAN LEADER PICKS SUCCESSOR TO SLAIN NOMINEE

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 29

 BODY:
One week after the assassination of its presidential candidate, Mexico's long-governing party today announced that its new standard-bearer would be Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a former Cabinet minister who had been managing the slain nominee's campaign.
The choice of the new candidate was made by the departing Mexican President, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In selecting Mr. Zedillo to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was shot to death in Tijuana last week, Mr. Salinas turned to one of the American-trained economists most closely associated with his own effort to modernize Mexico's institutions and strengthen its ties to the United States. 
 But the choice was made over the unusually open objections of some of the governing party's leaders, many of whom saw in Mr. Zedillo the epitome of an unfeeling technocrat.
 
Need for Greater Appeal Seen
 They argued that the party could only be held together by a politician with greater appeal among the workers and peasants, a traditional foundation of the party's support.
Mr. Zedillo, a former Secretary of the Budget and of Education, immediately became the favorite in the vote scheduled for Aug. 21. His support is largely a result of surging public sympathy for the Institutional Revolution Party, widely known as PRI, its Spanish acronym, following Mr. Colosio's shooting last Wednesday.
And in accepting the candidacy today, he seemed both to outline his electoral strategy and answer the party's old guard by portraying himself as a loyal heir to the political vision of Mr. Colosio, whose campaign he had managed.
 
Colosio 'Best' for Mexico
 "Luis Donaldo Colosio was the best man for Mexico," Mr. Zedillo told a gathering of party leaders who ranged from the powerful 93-year-old labor boss, Fidel Velazquez, to the young professionals with whom Mr. Colosio had surrounded himself.
Mr. Zedillo added, "Today, all of us members of the PRI have a mission: To carry to electoral victory the platform of Luis Donaldo Colosio, to make real the promise of that future of well-being, equality and justice for which he offered his life."
How far the memory of Mr. Colosio might propel his successor remained far from certain.
Despite the excitement generated by Mr. Zedillo's selection, questions continued to arise today about whether the 23-year-old industrial mechanic charged with murdering Mr. Colosio as he left a rally in Tijuana might have been part of a conspiracy.
In a country where the pressing of worker and peasant flesh is a basic ritual of election campaigns, new concerns about security also became evident. While a large crowd waited outside in vain, Mr. Zedillo gave his acceptance speech in a small room full of party officials.
As much as any of the able, young officials known as Salinistas, Mr. Zedillo would seem to embody Mexico's emerging middle-class dream. The second of six children of an electrician and a secretary from the border town of Mexicali, he earned a doctorate in economics from Yale University and rose quickly to key positions in the country's Central Bank.
Yet within his own party, there are many who doubt whether Mr. Zedillo's talents are suited to the political and social challenges that have been underscored by the peasant uprising this year in the southern state of Chiapas and the resulting demand for greater democracy and a more equal distribution of the country's wealth.
"The problem is no longer one of economics," one party official said, arguing against Mr. Zedillo's nomination hours before it was announced. "The problem now is political."
Even by comparison to the nomination last November of Mr. Colosio -- who stood out among the initial contenders for the party's candidacy by his devotion to Mr. Salinas's policies -- the hand of the outgoing Mexican President was obvious today.
For the first half of six-year term to which Mr. Salinas cannot be re-elected, Mr. Colosio had served as the leader of the PRI. He had named many of its provincial leaders, approved many of its candidates to governorships and the Congress, and built a strong base of party support around the country.
 
Fought to Weaken Labor
 Mr. Colosio had fought to weaken the big labor and peasant organizations that are pillars of the old guard. Yet even so, he was about the best party regulars could do in a Cabinet dominated by young, highly educated officials with little taste for the political style of a party that had depended on electoral fraud, control of the media and other authoritarian instruments to remain in power for 65 years.
In the minds of some party leaders, Mr. Zedillo was about the worst they could do. During three years as the Minister of Budget and Planning, he acquired a reputation as a tight-fisted, somewhat arrogant manager with unbounded faith in the market-oriented economic principles advanced by Mr. Salinas.
Partly in an effort to widen his political experience and groom him as a possible candidate for the succession, Mr. Salinas gave Mr. Zedillo the task in 1992 of carrying out his ambitious plan to break the power of the huge teachers' union, decentralize control over the public education system and modernize teaching methods and materials.
Mr. Zedillo stumbled quickly in the job. His ministry's first elementary school social science books, which contained a revisionist view of Mexican history widely accepted by academics, caused a national scandal. After a year of revisions, the second batch of books was recalled as well.
Officials close to Mr. Zedillo described his reaction to the furor as typical: He tried not to worry much about his reviews in the press, and got most of the job done.
His loyalty and reputation for personal honesty appeared to earn him the inside track for the governing party's candidacy in the year 2000 when Mr. Colosio named him as his campaign manager, saying he represented "the generation of change."
Like his political mentor, Miguel Mancera Aguayo, who has headed Mexico's central bank for 14 years, Mr. Zedillo is known as austere, rigorous and highly intelligent.
Mr. Zedillo is also widely known as a favorite of Mr. Salinas's chief of staff, Jose Cordoba Montoya, a French-born son of Spanish exiles who is viewed by some members of the governing party and the opposition as a power behind the throne.
 
Antagonized Traditionalists
 Officials of the Colosio campaign said Mr. Zedillo had antagonized the traditionalists in part because he clearly envisioned a campaign in which they would count less. He emphasized opinion polls, focus groups and television advertising over back-room negotiations.
But Mr. Zedillo was also held responsible by many analysts for Mr. Colosio's difficulty in generating public enthusiasm and articulating a message of change after the Chiapas rebellion badly soiled the image of Mr. Salinas's administration.
Asked about the nomination, a State Department spokeswoman, Maeve Dwyer, said the United States did not take a position on the Mexican presidential race but praised "the nation's determination to proceed with elections as mandated by Mexico's law and Constitution."

HEADLINE: The Italian Right: 3 Men to Watch;
Umberto Bossi; Northern League

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, March 29

 BODY:
A blunt 52-year-old politician from the economically vibrant Lombardy region, Umberto Bossi is the leader of a movement that caught the wind of taxpayer revolt when the first signs of recession appeared in the 1980's. Resentment was most acute among prosperous northern Italians, who felt that their pockets were being picked by the Government in Rome for pork-barrel projects in the depressed south.
In 1982, Mr. Bossi founded a newspaper in Varese, his hometown north of Milan, called Lombardia Autonomista, which became the mouthpiece of his movement. Known initially as the Lombard League, it promised northern Italians autonomy from the south. Changing its name in 1991 to the Northern League, it marched from victory to victory in local elections. Mr. Bossi entered Parliament in Rome in 1992. 
 To appeal to moderates who disliked the threat of secession, he tailored his message to specific audiences, at times arguing for a federal system like the United States, at times insisting that the only solution was to break Italy into three or more republics.
Umberto Bossi was born on Sept. 19, 1941, in Varese. He married his longtime companion, Manuela Marrone, this year. He has three children, including one from a previous marriage.

HEADLINE: Aide Says U.S. May Scrap an Across-the-Board Penalty for China

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
A senior State Department official said today that the Administration might consider a selective withdrawal of current trade privileges from China's state-owned enterprises instead of an across-the-board penalty if Beijing failed to make sufficient progress on human rights.
Responding to a question after a speech to the United States Chamber of Commerce, Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, said such selective sanctions "should be looked at" because they would help preserve private enterprise in China and protect United States investments there. 
 Administration officials said the selective approach was under review, but they are discovering that even a compromise solution could pose serious problems: the Chinese might still retaliate, and specific curbs are harder to enforce than blanket sanctions.
Administration officials admit that they are in a box over their China policy, which has linked an extension of China's preferred trade status with improvements in its human rights performance. They recognize that the United States economy -- and companies with investments in China -- would be hurt if Washington denies most-favored-nation trading status.
During Secretary of State Warren Christopher's trip to China in early March, he warned Beijing that more had to be done to justify extending the low tariffs it currently pays.
In recent days, Administration officials have signaled that they were searching for a compromise between those urging that China's trade status be extended and human rights groups pushing for sanctions unless Beijing begins to account for political prisoners and ends the use of prison labor.
Mr. Lord, one of the architects of the Administration's policy, said Washington still hoped China would make enough progress on human rights that President Clinton could extend its trade status in June. Still, Mr. Lord held out the prospect of targeted sanctions, in a statement that many viewed as a trial balloon.
Mr. Lord said one advantage of the selective withdrawal of the benefits was that it would reduce the impact on American business and on places like Hong Kong and Taiwan, which do business disproportionately with private enterprises in China.
But Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said he was unsure how such sanctions would be applied. "That's all something that's very much under review," he said.
A senior Administration official said, "For the Chinese, selective sanctions might be the worst-case scenario because private industry would be favored over state enterprises."
Represenatative Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat, said such sanctions would help channel foreign investment away from the state sector and into the private sector, since its exports would not be penalized.
"If you have targeted revocation you encourage the private sector while you send the message home to the Chinese Government because its state-run industries are hit," said Ms. Pelosi, who has repeatedly sponsored unsuccessful bills that would penalize China unless it improved on human rights. She said talk of a compromise penalty sent China a strong signal that the Administration was serious about pushing ahead with sanctions.
Robert Matsui, a California Democrat and co-chairman of a House task force supporting renewal of China's most-favored-nation status, also applauded Mr. Lord's proposal.
But Mr. Matsui and many business executives pointed out that such a targeted approach has shortcomings.
Richard Brecher, director of business advisory services at the United States-China Business Council, said such a penalty would probably not prevent retaliation by China.
Some trade experts dismissed the idea of selective trade sanctions as unenforceable, asking how United States customs officials could determine whether a dress or toy was made by a state enterprise or a private enterprise.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wages a Quiet War Against Poverty

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has embarked on the most energetic antipoverty effort in a generation, but it has deliberately done much of it so quietly that few people have noticed.
In an era of painfully tight budgets, the Administration has added tens of billions of dollars to existing programs, a major example being the $21 billion expansion of tax credits for low-wage workers. 
 The Administration has also created a host of new housing, training and community development programs, which cost less than the tax credits but could set new policy directions for the poor. And while its plans to overhaul welfare and health care face big hurdles in Congress, they would be landmark antipoverty developments.
 
Taking the Opposite Tack
 In another era, a Democratic White House might have pointed to such efforts to advertise its concern for the needy. But, loathe to invite unflattering comparisons to past antipoverty campaigns, officials in the Clinton White House take the opposite tack, bending over backward to frame their actions as part of an effort to help the broad middle class.
While the Administration did highlight the tax credit expansion, for instance, officials described it more as an attempt to help workers than as a major onslaught against poverty.
In talks with a half-dozen top antipoverty officials, the word "poverty" scarcely comes up. Instead, there is talk about "children," "work," "investments" and "empowerment."
"We don't term things a lot around here as antipoverty," said Carol Rasco, the White House domestic policy adviser. "But from the get-go we've talked about work."
Most Administration officials say it would be counterproductive for President Clinton to talk too much about the poorest Americans, particularly the black and Hispanic residents of violent ghettos.
 
Middle-Class Backlash Feared
 They say it could provoke a backlash from middle-class voters who would interpret his remarks, regardless of the specifics, as a call for higher taxes and a return to failed government programs.
The negative imagery associated with the "war on poverty" under President Lyndon B. Johnson is so great that most antipoverty strategists endorse the middle-class wrappings, with only an occasional rueful complaint that the nation is ignoring its racial and class conflicts.
The oratorical caution is not absolute, of course, and it may have started to give way. Mr. Clinton gave a major speech about poverty and violence last November in Memphis, and he returned to the theme of ghetto poverty in February when he visited a junior high school in Washington.
Beginning on Wednesday, a series of Cabinet officials will outline the domestic efforts at a conference here, sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, for about 2,000 people who run housing and development programs.
In videotaped remarks, the President will praise their efforts "to battle poverty and cynicism." And a draft of the keynote address, by Vice President Al Gore, indicates that he will use the speech to define the Administration's urban agenda. He argues that the programs amount to a "powerful approach to breathe new life into distressed communities."
Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, calls the conference a coming-out party of sorts for the Administration's "urban, community and antipoverty" policies.
The list of initiatives is long and varied. Some programs focus on needy places, like the plan to spend $3 billion over five years on empowerment zones. The program will give tax breaks and social service grants to 10 poor neighborhoods with promising revitalization strategies.
Other programs seek to help needy people regardless of where they live. That is the case with the earned income tax credit, which gives cash payments of up to $3,370 a year for families with incomes from $8,400 to $11,000. The payments phase out for families with higher incomes, ending for those who earn more than $27,000.
The Administration is also spending an additional $2.5 billion over the next five years on food stamps, $580 million on vaccinations and $1 billion for programs to prevent foster care. Its welfare proposal, still in draft form, seeks to spend $15 billion over five years for education, child care and work programs, though its financing remains uncertain.
While some program expansions were promised in the 1992 Presidential campaign, others have come as surprises. Mr. Clinton scarcely mentioned the homeless during the campaign. But Mr. Cisneros has called homeless programs his top priority, and has more than doubled his department's budget for them, to $1.5 billion a year.
The extent of ferment cannot be measured by budget numbers alone. The Administration has also shifted money within the antipoverty budget to new programs that show promise.
The Moving to Opportunity program, for example, will spend only $234 million over the next two years to help 6,200 families relocate from poor neighborhoods to more affluent ones. But the experiment is being closely watched among housing experts, who say it could lead to a significant shift in the way the needy receive subsidized housing.
 
'Promising Set of Initiatives'
 "Is there something labeled the antipoverty policy?" Hugh Price, a vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, asked rhetorically. "No, but there are certainly the most promising set of initiatives for poor people in a generation."
Ask Administration officials what binds the package together, however, and they quickly broaden the conversation beyond the poor.
"It's not just a poverty strategy," said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. "It's a strategy that lifts up the low-income worker."
Robert B. Reich, the Secretary of Labor, called it a policy "designed to get people into work and improve the chances that people stay in work."
Robert E. Rubin, the President's economic adviser, said: "The underpinning principle is empowerment. It is really trying to equip people for the mainstream economy."
Secretary Cisneros has spoken more explicitly than most Administration officials about the interplay between race and poverty. And he has gone out of his way to spotlight the problems of the poorest Americans; for example, he spent a night in a Chicago public housing project, and spent another night in a homeless shelter in New York City.
 
Need for 'Ellipitical Language'
 Mr. Cisneros argues that Mr. Clinton has spoken frankly about race and poverty, but contends that too much Presidential attention to the issue could lead middle-class voters to fear abandonment.
"You have to use some ellipitical language," he said, arguing that straightforward moral appeals could "sharpen the divide, turn people off to the message."
Among those who agree is Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, an Assistant Attorney Ggeneral whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, made his greatest mark as an advocate for the poor.
Ms. Townsend said that highlighting the problems of inner cities today risks alienating both whites and poor blacks, who sometimes feel they are being singled out for criticism. "It's too volatile, too easily misunderstood," she said.
Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University, concedes that the Clinton strategy is most productive in the short run. But, arguing that other cities could follow Los Angeles into riots, he said, "Sooner or later we have to come to grips with these racial and, to a lesser extent, class conflicts."

HEADLINE: Man In the News: Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon;
A Tragedy's Stand-In

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 29

 BODY:
Two years ago, when he was Secretary of Education, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon tried to set Mexican history straight by ordering new public-school textbooks that for the first time mentioned student demonstrations in 1968 and seemed to blame the Mexican Army for shooting protesters.
Mr. Zedillo's approach proved to be too direct for many Mexicans. He ran afoul of the politically powerful army and other conservative groups, and the history texts were rewritten the next year. 
 Today Mr. Zedillo (say-DEE-yoh) was selected by leaders of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party to replace its assassinated presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio. While Mr. Zedillo is generally admired for his intentions and his quiet, studied approach to problems, many Mexicans hope he will be more successful in pursuing his ideals now than he was in his quest for new history books.
"It was simply a mistake, but it turned out to be an immense mistake," said Enrique Krauze, a historian who criticized Mr. Zedillo's action on the textbooks.
 
Challenges Are Enormous
 He said the minister acknowledged that he had made an error, "and after the whole thing was over, he had -- in the best sense of the word -- humility, and accepted that he should have heard other opinions and should have acted differently."
Mr. Zedillo, a 42-year-old Yale-trained economist, now faces enormous challenges in furthering the economic and social reforms he has helped put in place over the last five years. He must balance that goal against the more pragmatic one of accommodating hard-liners in his party who are demanding a restoration of social order and the retention of the party's hold on power.
From the moment this afternoon when officials of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by the Spanish acronym PRI, announced Mr. Zedillo's name, he was automaticaly pushed to the lead in the presidential election scheduled for Aug. 21.
It is shaping up as the most difficult campaign in the 65 years that the party has controlled the presidency, rocked by a peasant uprising, the killing of Mr. Colosio and uncertainty like nothing seen for half a century. Yet the party has picked a candidate who has never run for office before.
 
A Professorial Politician
 Mr. Zedillo, whose demeanor is more professor than politician, a banker not a back slapper, will have to rely on the organization. He will also fall back on the skills that brought him from his modest beginning, selling old cans to a scrap dealer to help his family in the dusty border city of Mexicali, to a confident professional at home in Mexico's central bank or a neighborhood primary school.
Mr. Zedillo comes from a lower-middle-class family that moved to Mexicali, within sight of the United States border, when he was 3. His father was an electrician who installed movie screens and sound systems. For a time his mother sold candy at the theaters, and visits fostered the boy's infatuation with film.
He attended Mexican public schools, did well, attended the National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City and then Yale University on a scholarship from the Mexican Government. He received a master's degree in 1977 and a doctorate in economics from Yale in 1981.
 
Critical of Mexico
 "He seemed to be someone who wanted to play a role in putting things right in economic policy in Mexico," said Gustavo S. Vega, who studied with Mr. Zedillo in the early 1980's and is now a visiting professor of political science at Yale. "He is an idealist in the sense that he tries to recognize a problem for what it is, and then figure out a way to tackle it."
In his doctoral dissertation, Mr. Zedillo outlined the causes of Mexico's debt crisis. Going against more politically convenient explanations that attributed the crisis to the intransigence of foreign banks, Mr. Zedillo said that Mexico's fiscal irresponsibility had caused the crisis.
That view caught the attention of executives at the country's central bank, who had their own differences of opinion with the way politicians were handling the economy.
Mr. Zedillo joined the bank as an economist, then moved to the planning and budget office in 1987 after Carlos Salinas de Gortari was named the PRI's presidential candidate. When Mr. Salinas became President the following year, he became his Budget and Planning Minister.
 
Fighting Inflation
 Mr. Zedillo helped put together Mexico's plan for fighting inflation through a pact of Government, industry and unions on wage and price controls. The plan was considered instrumental in bringing down inflation from nearly 160 percent just before Mr. Salinas took office to 8 percent last year.
That performance and his allegiance to the other economic reforms of the Salinas administration have made Mr. Zedillo a favorite of foreign investors.
In January 1992, he was placed in charge of the education department and revamped Mexico's public-school system, breaking up the unwieldy federal system and giving the 31 states more responsibility.
But the uproar over the textbooks seemed to reflect a lack of political skills, and many people had ruled him out as a presidential candidate even though he was considered one of the four or five leading contenders in the party.

HEADLINE: Novel Idea in Welfare Plan: Helping Children by Helping Their Fathers

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
The plan to overhaul welfare that was presented to President Clinton last week grapples for the first time with the needs of a group usually pushed to the periphery of the welfare system: unwed low-income fathers.
Staking a claim to welfare reform and family values, the Administration wants to train these men for jobs while giving them a sense of responsibility as fathers. The goal is to involve them in their children's lives and increase what the fathers can earn in order to help them lift their children out of poverty. 
 Although the proposal has been scaled back to keep costs down, it still takes a novel approach, extending social services like counseling, job training and parent-education classes to unmarried low-income fathers while toughening enforcement of child support.
The plan recommends, for example, giving states financial incentives to track down even low-income fathers who are not paying child support. At the same time, it would guarantee visitation rights for fathers who are cut off from their children and provide training for parents in mediating disputes.
Several recommendations incorporate lessons from successful fatherhood programs around the country. But some experts are leery of the proposal's cost and its emphasis on job training, which has a spotty record. Others who work with unwed fathers say they fear that the proposal's tough child-support measures, which have been endorsed by advocates of mothers living in poverty, will drive the men further from their families.
Still others question whether it makes sense to extend services to fathers at all. "When you give special treatment to a young man who got someone pregnant, you sure better be providing job training to young men who didn't," said Douglas J. Besharov, a welfare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group.
Experts who can draw on their experiences with these men say that no solutions will work in the long term unless fathers are motivated to take fatherhood seriously and participate in a child-support system that they now perceive as inflexible and unfair.
"Our question at the outset was, What will it take to get young men to pay child support?" said Ralph Smith, who works with fathers at the Children's Network in Philadelphia, a private group. "It became clear the real question was, What will it take for them to become engaged in the lives of their children so that they can provide the care and support their children need?"
The Administration's answer is a new social contract for low-income fathers who do not have custody of their children: If they acknowledge their paternity and accept responsibility, they will receive help.
The recommendations include these:
*Establishing paternity early, at the hospital if possible, in all births to unmarried parents, and requiring women to identify their child's father before they can receive welfare.
*Requiring all teen-age mothers and fathers to join job-training, education and counseling programs, either as a condition of receiving welfare or in lieu of paying child support.
*Requiring fathers who do not pay support to perform community work.
*Requiring mothers to let fathers visit their children, and involving fathers in programs like Head Start, which are often intended for mothers.
*Reducing child-support payments if fathers lose their jobs, or suspending payments while the fathers are in job training or attending school.
 
Retreat From Costly Plans
 Retreating from more expansive and expensive recommendations in the early planning stage, the proposal calls for establishing demonstration projects to be financed over five years. It seeks $390 million for projects that would offer unwed fathers job training, parent education and counseling and $135 million for projects that would help fathers win visitation rights or mediate disputes with their children's mothers. No cost estimate has been made for the teen-age parent programs.
Over all, the proposal tries to address several problems rooted both in failures of the welfare system and in the behavior of those in the system. Paternity is established in less than a third of births to mothers receiving Aid to Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program, and only one in six of the mothers in the program receives child-support.
In addition, state enforcement officials seldom pursue low-income fathers for child support, arguing that the men cannot pay enough to justify the expense of a search.
Programs devised to reach unwed fathers show that their lives are often so complex and their family relationships so tortured that reuniting them with their children is a daunting task.
Ricky Hall, for example, is a 25-year-old father of two in a Cleveland job-training program for fathers, Beat the Streets. Run by Cleveland Works, a nonprofit organization, the program has placed 170 of 300 fathers in jobs over the last three years; all the men acknowledged paternity and are paying child support.
Mr. Hall pays no child support but says he will when he finds a job. He wants to see his children, but his former girlfriend has a new, jealous boyfriend, he said. "I could go and start trouble, but I choose not to," he said.
Mr. Hall is not alone in his tenuous family ties. Unwed fathers, studies show, tend to be involved initially in their children's lives, often arriving after a birth with milk and diapers in a public declaration of paternity, said Mercer L. Sullivan, an urban anthropologist at the New School of Social Research in Manhattan.
 
Parental Ties Fray Early
 About 36 percent of unwed fathers visit their young children regularly and provide some kind of support, said Robert I. Lerman, an economics professor at American University in Washington, who compiled a statistical portrait of these men. Yet a father's ties to his children often fray if his relationship with the mother sours, if he loses his job or if a new boyfriend appears.
Drawing on a national study that has followed 13,000 14- to 21-year-olds from 1979, Professor Lerman found that while 57 percent of fathers with children no older than 2 visited the youngsters more than once a week, only 22 percent were in frequent touch with their children at the age of 7 1/2 or older.
Even those fathers who contribute child support often do so sporadically and under the table. Parents' Fair Share, a program that works with parents in nine states who owe child support, found at least 15 percent of its participants working off the books.
And there are some violent or abusive fathers who mothers would keep out of their children's lives.
Professor Sullivan said the task of any program then becomes "not so much reconnecting fathers as legitimating the connections that are already there, and keeping them from breaking down over time."
Many fatherhood programs have discovered that to maintain these "connections" young unwed parents like Mr. Hall and his former girlfriend must be taught to work together even if they live apart.
The Administration's proposal would provide for this kind of training. But Mr. Smith and many other experts say they fear that its recommendations for enforcing child support, while a deterrent to recalcitrant fathers, will drive many men away from their families or into providing them money surreptitiously.
For example, they point to a provision in many state laws that returns all but $50 from the father's child support payment to the state, no matter what the amount they pay. Proponents of this arrangement see it as a legitimate reimbursement for the cost of welfare payments to mothers.
But directors of fatherhood programs say that as a result, both fathers and mothers prefer under-the-table payments so that the family sees more of the money.
"Simply saying that tougher enforcement is going to make a very big difference ignores the other central fact that these guys can ignore the system easily because they can work off the books," said Gordon Berlin, a senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which administers the Parents' Fair Share program.
One Administration official said the plan had several incentives to unwed fathers, like job training and more flexible rules for child support, to balance the tougher measures.
The proposal's endorsement of job training is also causing deep divisions in the welfare policy ranks. Many who work with unwed fathers argue that without training, the men will land in dead-end jobs or none at all. But several analysts say job training is too expensive, has a poor record of placing participants in well-paying jobs and rewards bad behavior.
Existing fatherhood programs can claim successes like Jesse Golphin, a 24-year-old father of four and former drug dealer who now works with the Cleveland housing authority and pays child support. But they also show how slow a task it is to change people's behavior.
 
Long Road to Success
 Hassan Lemons, for example, was the 17-year-old father of a girl when he entered a program. Mr. Lemons began working with Charles Ballard, who runs the National Institute for Responsible Fatherhood, a private group based in Cleveland that relies on counseling to motivate men to act like parents.
"Back then, being a father was embarrassing," said Mr. Lemons, now 18. "Mr. Ballard made me think that children are the best thing in the world." Then he and his girlfriend broke up. "I stopped seeing my child for about three months," Mr. Lemons said. "The people from the institute kept saying, 'Where's your child? That's really taking it out on her.' "
Mr. Lemons got back in touch; now he and his former girlfriend try to confer regularly about their daughter. He says he will pay child support now that he is working as a handyman. But he recently fathered another child, and he said he needed to spend time with his new girlfriend.
Counselors from the program urged Mr. Lemons him to adopt a "no-risk" life style, which includes no sex outside marriage. Did it influence him? "I haven't had sex with anyone else," Mr. Lemons said of his new girlfriend.

HEADLINE: Another Steep Drop For Stocks

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
For the stock market, the last four days of falling prices have been a sickening trip back in time. Yesterday's slide capped an eight-week decline that has wiped out most, if not all, of the gains this year.
And many on Wall Street say the decline could go far beyond the relatively benign 10 percent "market correction" that has been widely predicted since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in February. Many investors have been looking forward to such a correction, in effect a 10 percent-off sale, which would take the Dow to 3,580, a level not seen since early October 1993. 
 But some analysts are predicting a more worrisome price drop of 15 percent or more that could extend well into autumn.
 
 
'It's Not Clear'
 "In the recent past, corrections have been hard and swift," said Neal Litvack, executive vice president for Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund manager. "Now it's not clear how this market is developing."
Yesterday was the worst day of the recent slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most widely watched barometer of stock performance, dropped 63.33 points, to 3,699.02. Measured by the Dow, the calendar should read sometime in early November 1993.
Long-term interest rates, the ones used to set borrowing costs for everyone from General Motors to the consumer on the car dealership floor, are the biggest culprit behind the recent market slide.
 
 
Rising Rates
 Yesterday, rates on the benchmark 30-year Government bond, the most closely watched indicator of long-term interest rates, hit 7.06 percent, a 13-month high. The move was prompted largely by the strengthening of consumer confidence and a slight recovery in new housing sales that set off new inflation worries. [Page D2.]
The sharp decline in the stock market has prompted some Wall Street professionals to proclaim the beginning of a bear market, a long-term decline in which investors abandon stocks, sometimes for years at a time.
"I've been bullish for three years," Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company, said. "But what troubles me is that this stock weakness isn't event-driven. Nothing in particular happened today to cause it. You may get some rigor-mortis rallies in the weeks ahead, but this spells bear."
Other professionals say the long-running bull market may still have life left. Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat First Butcher & Singer Inc. in Richmond, Va., said: "There's still plenty of money around to borrow and short-term rates are cheap at 3 1/2 percent. When first-quarter earnings start coming in strong over the next couple of weeks, they'll provide a compelling incentive for the bull market to get back on track."
For now, individual investors, still the mainstays of the market, do not seem to be abandoning stocks, according to Fidelity Investments, which manages $206 billion in stocks, bonds and money market funds, or more than the gross domestic product of Switzerland.
But individuals are also not pouring as much money as they once did into Fidelity, with net cash inflows estimated to total $2.5 billion for the month ending this Thursday, down from $3 billion in January.
And Fidelity's international equity funds -- those that invest in stocks in Europe, Asia and Latin America -- have seen some cashing out this month for the first time in 14 months.
Still, these net redemptions for international funds so far total only $300 million out of $8 billion, or less than 4 cents on the dollar. Moreover, Fidelity continued to get more than a million inquiries this month, 200,000 of which will typically result in a new account.
 
 
'There's Money Out There'
 "Clearly there's money out there looking to get committed to the stock market," Mr. Litvack of Fidelity said. "But people may not be comfortable about committing their money now."
Since March 23, the day after the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates another quarter of a point, the Dow has fallen a total of 170 points. Since its Jan. 31 peak, the Dow has fallen more than 279 points, or 7 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the smaller-company Nasdaq composite index have both fallen more than 6 percent from their peaks.
Anxieties about the Whitewater affair; political murder in Mexico, where many Americans fleeing the troubled United States stock market have made investments; tensions with Japan over trade relations, and continuing disturbances in North Korea, South Africa and Israel have not helped.
The end of the first quarter of the year is looming Thursday, when portfolio managers overseeing billions of dollars of stock have the last chance to lock in profits or cut their losses. Conversely, investors looking for bargains are biding their time until the lowest prices appear, usually just before the store, the New York Stock Exchange, closes at 4 P.M.
 
 
Fair Number of Winners
 True, there are still a fair number of winners, including such economically sensitive stocks as Caterpillar, the equipment maker whose stock price continues to be up 24 percent for the year, despite recent declines.
But yesterday even Caterpillar fell 3 1/8, to 110 7/8, on the New York Stock Exchange. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 2,034 to 280. The Big Board composite index declined 4.2 points, to 251.3, on moderately heavy volume of 301.6 million shares.
Of the 30 Dow industrial component stocks, 27 dropped in price, led by Caterpillar.
The S.& P. 500 fell 7.52 points, to 452.48, and the Nasdaq index fell 17.21 points, to 755.29. The American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 7.78 points, to 454.43.
The most active stock yesterday was again the American depository receipts of Telefonos de Mexico, the huge national telephone company. Its volume totaled eight million shares, and its price dropped 3/4, to 59 7/8.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Rose 1.9% in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 29

 BODY:
Sales of new homes edged up 1.9 percent in February, regaining a small part of the January decline, which was the steepest on record, the Government said today. The West posted the only regional gain.
Analysts attributed the small increase to continuing harsh weather, and some were concerned that rising mortgage rates could hinder a rebound. 
 The Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said sales of new homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649,000 last month.
The February increase regained just part of the record 22.5 percent loss in January. The January figure, revised from an initial 695,000, was at an annual rate of 637,000. The December figure was 822,000, the highest since 857,000 in April 1986.
David F. Seiders, an economist for the National Association of Home Builders, said he and many other analysts had thought the winter was merely postponing sales and that buyers would return when the weather improved.
 
Higher Rates Could Interfere

"The problem is, we lost them while interest rates still were pretty favorable," he said. "Now we're going to have to get them back in a higher-rate environment, which could interfere with the recovery process."
Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages averaged 7.15 percent in February, up from 7.07 percent in January and a 25-year low of 6.74 percent in October, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. But rates reached 7.80 percent last week and many analysts believe they could hit 8 percent by the end of the year. If so, it would mean an increase to $733 in the monthly principal and interest payment on a $100,000 mortgage, from $665 for a 7 percent loan.
The National Association of Realtors has reported that sales of existing homes fell in January and February; it also attributed the decline to the weather.
Despite falling from their recent peak, new-home sales during the first two months of 1994 were still 6.4 percent above sales a year earlier.
The Government said the median price of a new home in February was $132,000, up from $126,500 in December and $129,400 a year earlier.
Regionally, sales surged 28 percent in the West, to an annual rate of 215,000, the steepest increase since a 29.2 percent gain last November. But sales plunged 10.6 percent in the Northeast, to a 42,000 rate; 10.2 percent in the Midwest, to 115,000, and 5.8 percent in the South, to 277,000.

HEADLINE: Wrecker's Ball Puts Gaps in Historic Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, March 29

 BODY:
Philadelphia's past is its best hope for future economic development, Mayor Edward G. Rendell said this month in announcing a new promotion to lure tourists here.
That same day, a contractor with a city permit knocked down two early 19th-century commercial buildings in the Old City section of Philadelphia. A similar brick factory building nearby has been pulled down since then, another is expected to be demolished this week, and the dust in historic Philadelphia has not settled yet. 
 The marketing of the city's history on the one hand, and the continuing demolition of old buildings on the other, have turned up the volume of debate here over the stewardship of an architectural treasure-trove.
Mayor Rendell says that he is committed to saving hundreds of buildings from the Colonial to Victorian eras, but that the city cannot afford to rescue the hundreds that lack architectural significance.
 
A Balancing Act
 "You tell me," he said in a recent interview, "as Mayor, should I elevate preservation of buildings on Front Street above adequate recreation for the kids of the city, or before children who are battered or abandoned?"
Crumbling, vacant buildings like the ones in Old City should be demolished, he said, if they become unsafe and stand in the way of development.
But Mr. Rendell said he would try to stop the willful neglect of buildings by owners who are determined to circumvent a law that requires them to maintain the properties. Philadelphia has begun requiring that any construction on the site of a demolished building be approved by the city's Historical Commission.
Preservationists say the Mayor's policy could destroy the architectural integrity of relatively intact historic districts. If the city continues to replace period buildings with parking lots, tourists will not come to Philadelphia just to park their cars, said Richard W. Thom, an architect and vice president of the Old City Civic Association.
 
Loss of Old Buildings
 "We're losing buildings two at a time now in Old City, and it's destroying the whole context of the district, the context that gives it such a sense of history," Mr. Thom said while giving a tour of Old City, Philadelphia's first commercial district, which abuts Independence National Historical Park.
Philadelphia has one of the nation's richest collections of 18th- and 19th-century buildings; 55 are National Historic Landmarks like Independence Hall and the Betsy Ross House. But, preservationists say, Philadelphia is far behind other cities in designating entire historic districts.
Philadelphia has no neighborhoods listed on the National Register of Historic Districts; New York, by contrast, has 55. But Philadelphia has designated 6,500 buildings dating to Colonial times, and certification of 7,000 others is pending.
Heritage tours are increasingly popular, and officials here say Philadelphia has ample room for growth. Independence National Historical Park, the city's most popular attraction, draws 1.5 million visitors a year, far less than Fanueil Hall in Boston, for example, which draws 14 million, or the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, which draws 17 million.
Landmarks groups say the city may jeopardize its prospects. "Many preservationists are surprised and disappointed that the strength of the preservation movement in Philadelphia has deteriorated drastically," said Patricia D. Wilson, director of the mid-Atlantic office here of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, an educational organization.
 
Problem for Owners
 For decades, parking lots replaced buildings in historic districts. This trend was reversed from 1976 to 1986, when generous Federal tax credits for preservation led to an estimated $1 billion in restoration projects in Philadelphia and $15 billion nationally, according to Government data.
But many buildings have continued to deteriorate in Old City and other neighborhoods. In some cases, owners give up making repairs when they can no longer find tenants or buyers. Preservationists have accused some owners of deliberately neglecting old buildings to the point where they will have to be torn down, thus making the land available for valuable parking space or for sale to speculators.
It is often hard to determine an owner's motives. For example, preservationists complained to the city that the owner of early 19th-century buildings with Greek Revival columns at 110-112 South Front Street neglected them for years by leaving them open to the weather and vagrants, who set fires.
Inspectors declared the buildings a safety hazard and ordered the owner, Provencal Realty of New York City, to repair or demolish them. Two weeks ago, the company demolished the buildings, saying repairs would have cost $1.5 million, and for no purpose, since there were no prospects of finding tenants or buyers.
George R. Zacharkow, a lawyer for Provencal Realty, said the owners did everything they could to maintain the buildings, which had been vacant since 1991 after a restaurant closed.
But Lloyds of New York, the insurance company that holds the insurance policy on the property, has denied the owner's claim for the demolition costs, said a Lloyds official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "During our investigation, we found that the building had been left open without taking any provision to keep vagrants out of the building," the official said, adding that he expects the case to go to court.
Mayor Rendell said he saw no value in saving properties like the Elisha Webb Chandlery, an 1835 brick building at 136 South Front Street that preservationists fought unsuccessfully to save. The city allowed the owner, a nearby restaurant, to tear down the deteriorated building last fall to expand its parking.
"I would think that a parking lot looks better than an undeveloped, even a stabilized, Elisha Webb house," Mr. Rendell said. "We have got to be conscious of the fact that if there is not economic development, there will be no money to do real preservation."
This month, Mr. Rendell announced a campaign to solicit $2 million from regional corporations to market Philadelphia's historic districts. A nonprofit organization, borrowing ideas from Disney and historic theme parks like Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts, will promote an 80-square-block historic district that includes much of downtown, Independence National Historical Park, Old City and Society Hill, the city's first residential neighborhood.
A few days after this initiative, Mr. Rendell responded to preservationists' criticism of the demolition on Front Street by announcing plans to create another nonprofit organization. This one, which would try to raise $1 million from foundations and corporations, would monitor the condition of downtown buildings and provide the city with money to make emergency repairs, billing the costs to owners, under a preservation ordinance that allows the city to take action when the owners fail to do so.
But the initiative may have more to do with public relations than with preservation. Even Mr. Rendell acknowledges serious doubts. "I am skeptical a million dollars can be raised, but hopeful," he said.

HEADLINE: New Education Legislation Defines Federal Role in Nation's Classrooms

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d 

 BODY:
When President Clinton signs a sweeping school measure this week, the nation will for the first time have a Federal blueprint to educate its children.
The legislation, called the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, recommends academic standards for students in the 4th, 8th and 11th grades. It encourages states to design new ways to measure student achievement and exhorts states to lower the dropout rate, improve preschool programs and reduce crime in schools. The legislation also addresses job training and promotes literacy for adults. 
 The goals are relatively vague and are voluntary; more significant is that the law stakes out a Federal role over what happens within the classroom. Until now, the Federal role in public schools largely involved the education of poor and disabled children and the protection of civil rights.
Ever since Massachusetts founded the nation's first public school 150 years ago, the education of children has been seen as an intensely local matter. Even today, districts around the country sometimes chafe at state supervision and mandates.
 
Changing Attitudes
 "If I had ever whispered national standards, I think I would have lost my job," said Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the last Commissioner of Education before Congress elevated the job to Cabinet status in 1979.
"We bent over backwards 15 years ago so that no one would think we were interfering," Mr. Boyer said. "Within a decade, we have gone from this preoccupation of local control to national standards. There is no turning back."
The consensus behind the legislation is that a national effort is needed to improve schools in the United States. This came from a perception that Japan and Germany do a better job of training their citizens and that this makes those countries more competitive economically.
Education analysts said the legislation was as important as the efforts in the last century to open secondary education to everyone and as the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, ending legalized segregation in the nation's public schools.
The loss of local control was hotly debated as the legislation was being written. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley, who calls the legislation a guiding North Star, and other national education officials did much to dispel the notion that the Federal Government was assuming the mantle of Big Brother.
And increasingly, education analysts and state and local education officials have embraced the notion that a national framework for what students should know is good for schools across the country.
But will national education goals and new student assessments make any difference? Almost uniformly, the answer among educators is yes.
"This legislation will make a difference," said Ramon Cortines, chancellor of New York City's public schools, the nation's largest school district. "Once you have a curriculum framework, it helps us understand where we are going and that we are going to be responsible for what students know and what they are able to do."
 
Voluntary Standards
 The legislation recommends voluntary academic standards in math, science, history, geography, foreign languages and the arts, and encourages states to design new ways to measure student achievement. It codifies into law the six national education goals embraced in 1990 by President George Bush and the 50 governors. The goals, which the legislation says should be met by the year 2000, include these:
*All students will arrive at school ready to learn.
*The nation's high school graduation rate will be at least 90 percent, and students will be competent in English, history, geography, foreign languages and the arts.
*American students will lead the world in math and science; all adults will be literate, and every school will be free of violence and drugs.
The legislation also added two more goals: improved teacher training and creation of programs in local schools to enlist parental involvement.
The legislation, which takes effect on July 1, provides $105 million in its first year. Of that, about $91 million will go to states, territories and Indian reservations to help finance model projects. Each state's share of the money will depend on student enrollment and the number of children enrolled in Chapter One, the Federal program to help poor students reach grade level in reading and math.
Another $6 million in the first year will finance operations of the National Education Goals Panel, an independent agency, and help create the National Education Standards and Improvement Council, charged in the legislation with overseeing the development of national education standards. And $3 million will be used to create the National Skills Standard Board, which will develop guidelines on the skills needed for a wide variety of industries.
In the second year, the President is expected to ask for $700 million and in the third year, an additional $1 billion, Federal education officials said.
The road to improved education began long before the national goals were written. Ever since the "Nation at Risk" report in 1983 documented the deficiencies of public education in the United States, virtually every state has tried to overhaul public education, toughen the curriculum and teaching standards and lengthen school years and, in some cases, the time a student must stay in school.
 
$7 Million for New York
 Under the legislation, New York State is expected to receive about $7 million of the $91 million earmarked for states. School systems will apply for the money on a competitive basis.
Much work remains: academic standards for all subjects except math are still being written and must undergo scrutiny by the independent Federal panels created by the legislation. And Secretary Riley said he expected a difficult battle to get the proposed $700 million for the legislation's second year.
But Mr. Riley, a former Governor of South Carolina, said the legislation, at minimum, represented a new statement of national policy. Although the academic standards are voluntary, he predicted that most states would adopt them, if for no other reason than economics.
"It will become a matter of competition," Mr. Riley said.

HEADLINE: Confidence Index Is Highest Since '90

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Reflecting a view that jobs are becoming easier to find and the economy is stronger, an important index of public confidence rose in March, reaching its highest level in nearly four years, the Conference Board reported yesterday.
The index jumped to 86.7, from 79.9 in February. But the Conference Board, a research organization supported by Corporate America, emphasized not the sudden jump but a steady upward trend since August, when the national economy shifted out of the doldrums and began to expand rapidly. 
 "People are telling us in our surveys that they are moderately less concerned about jobs," said Fabian Linden, director of the survey. "My sense is that slowly people are getting more confident. I don't know why the index jumped so much in March. But the important thing is that there has been a steady upward trend through the fall and winter."
 
 
 
Less Apprehension
 The Conference Board's confidence survey, and a similar survey conducted by the Consumer Research Center at the University of Michigan, suggest that consumers are in a good enough mood to keep retail sales stronger than they were through most of last year. The public is also less and less apprehensive that the economy will fall back into recession, said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan survey. The March results of the Michigan survey, which are also strong, will be published Friday.
"There was a time last year when people were very apprehensive that we would slip back into recession, and that apprehension is gone, although no one is expecting a boom or the prosperity that existed in earlier times," Mr. Curtin said. "Now when our confidence index rises, it does so on the expectation that the economy will continue to expand in the style of this decade, which means slowly."
The Michigan index shot up to 94 in January from 77 in September, rising far more quickly during the surge in economic growth in the fourth quarter than did the Conference Board's index. Since January, the Michigan index has leveled off at 93 or 94 through March, reflecting healthy growth in the first quarter, which ends on Thursday. But the growth is not as robust as it was in the fourth quarter of 1993.
An improving job situation helped to push the Conference Board Index up to its highest level since July 1990, when it reached 101.7 only to plunge sharply in the following months as a recession took hold. Now it is rising again, with a slightly larger percentage of people in the March survey saying jobs seem more plentiful than they seemed in February.
The answers about jobs have gotten gradually more optimistic almost every month since late summer. Of the 3,800 people in the survey who replied to a questionnaire, 13.2 percent said jobs had become more plentiful, up from 12.1 percent in February and 8.5 percent last August. These replies reflect a sharp rise in the number of net new jobs that the nation has created since August -- one million out of a total of 3.2 million created in the last two years, the Labor Department reports.
 
 
 
More Job Confidence
 "Even though the number of layoffs at large and well-paying corporations continues to be at a high rate, the fact that people can get some type of job gives them some sort of confidence that even if they are laid off, they will be able to find work," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Often, however, the new jobs pay less than the old.
The Conference Board Index, which rose to 86.7 in March from 59.2 in August, is composed of two sub-indexes. One tries to measure people's feelings about the economy and the job situation as they exist today. The other measures their expectations about jobs and economic growth in the next six months. The index assessing the next six months rose to 93 in March from 84.4 in February and 68.8 in August, while the index measuring the public's assessment of current conditions rose to 77.3 from 73.1 in February and 59.3 in August.
But while the monthly indexes published by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan are on the rise, they remain well below the levels they reached in the 1950's and 1960's, when to millions of Americans the economy seemed far more robust than it seems today.
"People clearly have a different point of reference," Mr. Curtin said. "This is a new age of diminished expectations, and in the context of diminished expectations, we are in a relatively positive period. The indexes reflect that optimism, but no one expects a quick and substantial return to the good times people enjoyed in the past."

HEADLINE: Farrakhan Softens Tone But Sticks To Message

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNION, N.J., March 29

 BODY:
By the time Louis Farrakhan released his oratorical grip on a Kean College audience early today and the students filed outside a campus theater well past midnight, a fine raw rain that greeted them did not lessen the new enthusiasm many professed for the Nation of Islam leader.
It was a performance that swelled with defiance at perceived enemies in the news media, at Hollywood image-makers he insinuated were dominated by Jews, and at a mass culture he accused of robbing black Americans of the chance to succeed. Perhaps less predictably, for nearly three and a half hours he kept up a drumbeat of criticism, gentle at first and then volcanic, aimed at young blacks who he said were more concerned with sex, rap music and drugs than with working to elevate themselves and the condition of all black society. 
 Through much of the long evening, as banks of television cameras recorded every word and about 60 police and security personnel kept watch on an audience of nearly 900 students and guests, he skirted pointed attacks like those that had infused a speech last Nov. 29 at Kean by his lieutenant, Khalid Abdul Muhammad. It was that speech that created much soul-searching on a state campus struggling with a quest for multicultural diversity and a firestorm of condemnation beyond the campus.
 
A Rambling Defense
 But toward the end of his speech, in a rambling defense against recent allegations that sought to link him to the murder of Malcolm X three decades ago, Mr. Farrakhan accused Jewish power brokers of trying to destroy him.
"The same people opposed to him are opposed to me right now," he stormed. Then, alluding to the crucifixion of Christ, he said: "It's the Passover season. It's the right time."
But phrases like this, which may register on many ears as patently anti-Semitic, did not produce that reaction with many in audience.
Fabianna Tassini, an 18-year-old freshman from Brazil, said, "I came here expecting to hear a lot of bigotry, but there was none of that.'
In fact, Mr. Farrakhan went back and forth between declaring he was not anti-Semitic and that it would be wrong to be against Jews as a people, and then moving on to attacks on individual rabbis and Jews with influence in newspapers and the entertainment industry who, he said, sought his destruction and held black America in their thrall.
Part of the confusion is perhaps attributable to Mr. Farrakhan's speaking style. He often moved quickly from one thought to another within the context of a larger story, at points referring to Jews in nonthreatening ways, and then, anger rising in his voice, using the words "you," "they" and "them" with unclear antecedents to condemn those who mistreated the black race.
 
Hints of Reconciliation
 Compared to Mr. Muhammad's unallayed declarations that left no room for equivocation, Mr. Farrakhan's words in his speech Monday night were honeyed and appeared to offer reconciliation.
To some extent, the speech approached the goal set earlier in the evening by Patricia Rivera, a Kean College trustee. "I hope the speech he gives tonight is an exercise in caution and tempered by his religious beliefs,' she had said minutes before Mr. Farrakhan entered Wilkins Theater flanked by 15 bodyguards. Outside, phalanxes of state and local police officers watched over several hundred anti-Farrakhan demonstrators, including many Jewish groups, who gathered in the rain and mud to condemn hatred and bigotry.
About 200 yards away, a few dozen pro-Farrakhan demonstrators milled about, telling reporters that Americans needed to heed his message.
Inside, Mr. Farrakhan demanded that young blacks regain their pride and turn their backs on a violent and hedonistic popular culture that he said was destroying them.
 
'A Giant Crib'
 Mr. Farrakhan repeatedly had driven home his point that blacks were unwittingly abetting an orchestrated plan to relegate them to uselessness in a world economy that increasingly demanded higher educational skills like science and mathematics. In thundering tones, he said white racism and lack of black self-discipline relegated blacks to the bottom of achievement.
"The ghetto has become a giant crib for immature children to play with themselves so others can go on to rule the world," he stormed, evoking sustained applause from the audience that was sprinkled with relatively few white faces.
Mr. Farrakhan said he was planning to mount a march on Washington next year to demand "reparations" from the Government for the years in slavery. "You worked us for 300 years -- where's our money?" he said, adding that only black men would be invited to join the march.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates SurgeOn Worries Of Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates pushed higher yesterday, mainly because of investor concerns over inflation and fears that the Federal Reserve might move to tighten credit policy further. As a result, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at its highest level in 13 months.
Charles Roden, managing director of fixed-income securities for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, believes the market is trying to figure out where rates are going, and with the end of the quarter nearing, many long-term bond portfolio managers are cutting their average days left to maturity. "I suspect end-of-quarter cash may be king for a while as managers shorten up positions," Mr. Roden said. 
 He added: "In my mind, I think the market is adjusting to a 7.5 to 8 percent long bond with shorter rates somewhere in the 4.50 percent area. If inflation kicks in, then I see those rates going higher. But I don't think business is robust enough."
 
 
'A Convenient Excuse'
 According to traders, a surge in consumer confidence and a slight recovery in new-home sales were both interpreted by the market as signs that the economy may grow stronger yet and sustain its expansion. One trader said: "I don't think it was the data that helped create the selling. The negative tone was already in place. The market just used the data as a convenient excuse."
The picture of a strengthening economy has again raised investor concern about inflation and expectations of yet another tightening by the Federal Reserve Bank.
By late in the day the 30-year bond was down 11/32 of a point, to 90, for a yield of 7.06 percent -- the highest rate since Feb. 17, 1993, when it was 7.1 percent.
Shorter maturities, benefiting from the volatility on the long end of the yield curve, were mixed. The rate for a three-month bill was unchanged at 3.48 percent; a six-month bill was down a basis point, to 3.82 percent. The current one-year bill, which will be replaced tomorrow, when the Treasury auctions $16.5 billion of a new one-year issue, was up 2 basis points, to 4.19 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts at MMS International say that while there are many investors who may see value in the long end of the market, most are inclined to wait until after the end-of-quarter pressures ease and the employment report comes out on Friday, or at least until they see more evidence that the market's bearish trend is exhausted.
One trader said he thought the market was a little oversold, as yesterday's data left investors wondering about the economy, not knowing if current bond yields represented fair value.
According to a survey of 40 to 60 economists and head traders by MMS International, the median expectation is for Friday's job data to show 230,000 new jobs in March. But the market is increasingly aware that it could possibly go as high as 300,000. "But the people who are doing the trading are focusing on the higher numbers," MMS International analysts said. "If the number comes in closer to the median figure, the market is likely to rebound."
Yesterday's data revealed weakness in new-home sales, rebounding just 1.9 percent in February, to a 649,ooo annual rate. That follows a sharp downward revision of January's number to 637,000 from 695,000. While this was somewhat weaker than expected, bad weather was still a factor in February.
The March consumer confidence index surged to 86.7 from a revised 79.9 in February, stronger than expected. The conference board's survey in March found solid gains in expectations as well as current conditions. The expectations index surged to 93 from 84.4, while current conditions rose to 77.3 from 73.1.
Analysts said improved weather across much of the country in March may have accounted for the rise in confidence, but this nonetheless provided some of the ammunition for the bears to knock down bond prices.
The Treasury yesterday sold $14 billion of 21-day cash management bills at an average rate of $3.47 percent.
In the municipal bond market yesterday, the New York Environmental Facilities Corporation negotiated the sale of $716.95 million in water pollution control revenue bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The tax-exempt bonds were initially priced to yield a maximum 6.125 percent for issues due in 2014 and 2015, but were discounted for a yield of 6.19 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of 21-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Against Yen As Japanese Plan Is Faulted

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday as currency traders showed disappointment over Tokyo's plan to cut Japan's trade surplus.
The trade package includes tax cuts and public spending goals to stimulate Japan's economy and measures to improve American access to certain Japanese markets. But instead of calming jittery dollar dealers, the package was viewed by many as not going far enough and by some as doing more harm than good. 
 "Expectations are so low right now it's hard to imagine anything coming in lower," said Bruce English, vice president of ABN/AMRO.
In late New York trading, the dollar dropped to 103.15 yen, from 104.10 on Monday.
Trade tensions between Washington and Tokyo typically set off dollar sales on the view that the White House will favor a stronger yen to shrink Japan's trade surplus. Not only does a strong yen make American goods relatively cheaper in Japan and Japanese goods more expensive in the United States, but it also weighs on Japanese companies' balance sheets and presumably pushes Japan's Government to act on trade.
 
Kantor Critical of Plan
 The White House has routinely denied that it uses the exchange rate as a weapon, but foreign exchange dealers have always doubted this.
The dollar fell to its session lows late in the trading day when the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said the new market-opening plan fell short of American demands and did not merit a resumption of stalled trade talks.
"The package of measures is of limited substance," Mr. Kantor said. "They do not meet U.S. concerns."
Japan responded quickly to the falling dollar. In Asian trading yesterday morning, the Bank of Japan actively bought the dollar in an unsuccessful attempt to halt its decline.
Despite the dollar's weakness against the yen, it rose slightly against most European currencies. It was quoted at 1.6732 German marks in late New York trading, up from 1.6725 on Monday. And the British pound skidded to $1.4855, from $1.4965, in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Monday's quotes included: 1.4266 Swiss francs, up from 1.4215; 5.7340 French francs, up from 5.7185; 1.3755 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3745, and 1,641 Italian lire, up from 1,631.

Crude Oil Prices Rebound; Overreaction to OPEC Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices rebounded somewhat yesterday after Monday's plunge as bargain hunters emerged amid perceptions the market had overreacted to OPEC news.
Light crude oil for May delivery ended 24 cents higher at $14.32 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after trading as low as $14.05 during the session. 
 May heating oil rose 0.86 cent, to 42.07 cents a gallon; April unleaded gasoline rose 1.09 cents, to 44.4 cents a gallon, and May natural gas fell 0.4 cent, to $2.062 per 1,000 cubic feet.
May crude oil plummeted $1.05 a barrel on Monday after the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to keep its production ceiling at 24.5 million barrels a day for the rest of this year rather than reduce output in an attempt to boost prices.
 
 
'Completely Shocked'
 The decision was just what most analysts and traders expected, so some were surprised by the market's response on Monday.
"I was completely shocked," said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an investment research firm in Bronxville, N.Y. "The market was acting like this was something completely out of left field."
Traders were encouraged by the market's ability to remain above the five-year low of $13.75 on Monday and above $14 yesterday, said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil Inc., a New York-based trading company.
"There is a temporary feeling in the market that maybe the bearish news has been discounted," he said.
A weekly industry report released after the close of trading showed a steep decline last week in United States stocks of gasoline. Gasoline stocks fell by 5.1 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute said; traders had expected a decline of 2 million to 3 million barrels.
Distillate stocks, which consist of heating oil and diesel fuel, declined about 500,000 barrels. That was a smaller drop than expected. Crude oil stocks fell about 5.4 million barrels, as expected.
On other commodity markets, precious metals extended Monday's losses as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 63 points.
 
 
Gold Drops
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, April gold fell $2.10, to $386 an ounce, while May silver slipped 4 cents, to $5.657 an ounce.
April platinum lost $1.80, to $409.20 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders were worried that the falling stock prices might foretell an economic slowdown, which would reduce industrial and investment demand for metals, said Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst for Prudential Securities Inc.

HEADLINE: Evolution Of Tea: Now It's Hip

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
TEA is becoming the coffee of the 90's. A new-found appreciation of fine tea has led to a rush of smart tea bars and tea shops from coast to coast.
Tea lovers are no longer content with indifferent mass-market black tea from Argentina packed in skimpy tea bags. They are graduating to higher-quality tea bags, choice loose teas and even costly, carefully plucked leaves from single estates. And tea companies are responding by offering an ever-wider variety of teas. 
 Given the passion for variety and expertise that already exists for wine, beer, coffee and even bottled waters, perhaps it was inevitable that tea would be next on the list.
Importers, packers and sellers, along with people who sell tea-making equipment and publish books and newsletters on tea are benefiting from the new interest in tea. Dana May Casperson, who publishes a newsletter called Everyone's Cup of Tea, has found a ready audience for her talks on tea etiquette in San Francisco.
Fortunoff's, the chain of stores in the New York region, has seen an increase in demand for teapots, especially in its bridal registry. Mary O'Brien, an importer of rare teas who owns Chiawalla Tea Room in Salisbury, Conn., is converting a schoolhouse in nearby Ashley Falls, Mass., into a learning center and museum devoted to tea.
Even Seattle, with its high concentration of coffee bars, is intrigued. "Tea is big in coffee country," said Miranda Pierzada, a former travel agent who opened Kuan Yin, an Asian-style tearoom, in Seattle in 1990.
Tea, in fact, is popular all over the country these days. Over the last year, tea sales have increased by 7.7 percent, said Helen Berry, a vice president of Beverage Marketing, a research company in New York. Find/SVP, another New York market-research company, expects the growth to continue over the next few years, driven by increased consumption of ready-to-drink iced tea, specialty teas and herbal teas. The company predicts that sales of regular tea and tea mixes will decline, but by 1997, it estimates, the specialty-tea market will increase to $531 million, up from $415 million in 1993.
This new popularity has to do with tea's soothing qualities, something to be craved in this stressful era. It is more subtle than coffee and is meant to be sipped, not gulped, as the labels for Republic of Tea, a line of new designer teas and tea bags, point out. And it's not expensive. An indifferent cup of tea costs as little as a penny to make, while most better teas cost no more than 15 cents a cup.
A cup of tea has less caffeine than a cup of coffee -- half the amount or less -- making it attractive to those concerned with health and fitness. Iced tea is popular with people who want a nonalcoholic alternative at mealtime. Recent studies indicating that green tea may possess important disease-preventing, and possibly cancer-preventing, qualities have also helped increase sales of this category of teas, one that has been largely ignored by Americans until now.
Increasingly, the tea sold in this country is ready-to-drink iced tea, which nearly doubled the dollar sales of tea in retail stores from 1991 to 1993, when they topped $2 billion. "Ready-to-drink is king," said Joseph P. Simrany, the president of the Tea Association, a trade group in New York, but "interest in the gourmet side of the tea market is definitely increasing." The kinds of teas sold in the stylish new tea shops are generally estimated to account for only 8 percent of the market for loose tea and tea bags.
Quality is starting to take over where price once dominated. That's fine with John Harney, the president of Harney & Son, a tea merchant in Salisbury, Conn. His company packs and sells several dozen different teas, including those served at Ritz-Carlton hotels and at the Tea Box, the shop in the Takashimaya store on Fifth Avenue. "The specialty teas are where it's at today," he said. "Like coffee, once people have a good tea they don't want to go back to ordinary supermarket teas."
With this in mind, the Thomas J. Lipton Company, the largest tea company in the United States, with more than 50 percent of the market, is introducing the Sir Thomas Lipton line of tea bags for retail sale. They are higher-quality teas and are available in English breakfast, Irish breakfast, Earl Grey and Darjeeling blends; they were previously sold only to restaurants. Peter Goggi, Lipton's director of tea buying, said the company anticipates a substantial crossover from better coffee to better tea.
Joel Dean, one of the founders of Dean & DeLuca, is adding to the store's line of teas after noticing that sales of better teas began to increase about two years ago. And Miriam Novalle recently opened T, a large tea emporium, salon and cafe in the lower level of Guggenheim Museum SoHo at 575 Broadway (T's entrance is actually around the corner at Mercer and Prince streets).
Dean & DeLuca carries select brands like Kusmi and Mariage Freres teas from France, Jackson's of Piccadilly from England and Royal Gardens from Fort Bragg, Calif. And Dean & DeLuca is about to introduce a line of private-label teas.
Ms. Novalle, a former perfume blender, carries hundreds of teas, including her own blends, special imports and more than 30 from Mariage Freres, a Parisian company known for its standards of excellence. "Connoisseurship is necessary to appreciate tea," she said, "but it's actually so simple because brewing a good pot of tea is so easy."
Kelley & Ping in SoHo, Felissimo on West 56th Street and the Tea Box at Takashimaya are other places that offer a selection of unusual teas, including many green teas. Tea shops like these, as well as Toraya on East 71st Street and the new tea bar about to be added to Zen Palate on Union Square East, reflect a shift in tea drinking toward better tea and away from the long-dominant English-style blends.
English teas are typically black-tea blends meant to be sturdy enough to stand up to the addition of milk and sugar. But as the interest grows in green teas and the more delicate teas like Darjeeling and fine oolongs, tea is beginning to shed its English image, especially afternoon tea, the complicated, frilly Victorian ritual often mistakenly labeled "high tea."
But tea still has a long way to go. In most restaurants, even the finest ones that pride themselves on their ingredients, cuisine and tableware, tea service is essentially no better than it is in economy class on airplanes: a cup of water with a tea bag on the side.
And in the United States, 95 percent of the tea consumed hot is made with tea bags, not brewed from loose tea.
But as Bill Rosenzweig, the president of Republic of Tea in San Rafael, Calif., said, "Our mission is to inspire a tea revolution in this country by encouraging tea made with good tea leaves." Republic of Tea, which he started with Mel Zeigler, the founder of Banana Republic, combines good quality with clever and effective marketing, resulting in a fivefold increase in the company's sales in two years.
With the latest innovation, a series of decaffeinated after-dinner teas introduced by Celestial Seasonings in flavors like chocolate-raspberry and amaretto-cream, or with some Republic of Tea flavors like vanilla-almond and coconut-carob, the crowd that likes flavored coffee may be ready to cross over. As Ms. O'Brien, the Connecticut tearoom owner, said, "There's a tea out there for everyone."
 
Talking the Talk: A Guide to the Various Types of Tea
 From a single evergreen plant, camillia sinensis, come the thousands of teas consumed around the world. The variety depends on where the tea is grown and how it is gathered and processed. Some of the variables that determine the type of tea are whether the tea is made from long leaves or short leaves, early buds or later pickings; whether the leaves are whole, broken or rolled and, most important, whether they are allowed to oxidize.
The finest teas are consistent-looking and fresh. Because tea readily picks up foreign aromas and fades in contact with light, teas should be sold and stored in containers that are airtight and opaque. Shops that keep their teas in glass canisters are as bad as those that display coffee in open burlap bags. In the proper container tea can last up to six months. But it should never be stored in the refrigerator or freezer.
 
 
BLACK TEAS
 These dark, tannic teas are made by allowing the fresh green leaves to wither and darken through oxidation (the term used in the tea business is fermentation). The process takes about a day, after which the leaves are dried by warm air. Black teas include winy Keemun and smoky Lapsang Souchong from China, Ceylon teas from Sri Lanka and India, Assam and Darjeeling, the exquisitely delicate tea grown in the Himalayan foothills. Traditional blends like English breakfast are made of black teas.
Tea nomenclature is steeped in the romance of faraway places with little regard for modern reality. Why else would tea from Sri Lanka still be called Ceylon, or that of Taiwan be known as Formosa?
And so many of the terms can befuddle. Take "first flush," an often misunderstood term associated with Darjeeling. It refers to the first sprouting of new leaves, which do not produce the best tea. First-flush Darjeeling is a spring tea, the Beaujolais nouveau of tea, gentler than the second flush, which comes in June. Some connoisseurs prefer the deep coppery complexity of autumnal Darjeelings. Drinkers who are fussy about their cru of Chablis may also look for single-estate Darjeelings -- in tea the term is garden -- with names like Castleton and Bloomfield.
Another confusing name is Orange pekoe, which has nothing to do with the taste of the tea. Pekoe (pronounced PECK-oh) is a Chinese term referring to young budding leaves. In the 17th century Dutch tea traders made it sound fancy by adding a noble name, Orange. Orange pekoes, which can range from flowery to full-bodied, usually come from Sri Lanka.
Black teas are the classic English teas, strong enough to stand up to the addition of limon, milk or sugar. Blends like English breakfast are made from black teas.
 
GREEN TEAS
All Japanese and many Chinese teas are green teas, prized for their aroma and finesse. They are processed by lightly drying the leaves. Some green teas are whole-leaf while others, including Chinese gunpowder, are made from leaves rolled into little balls, hence the name. Japanese matcha is powdered green tea.
Green teas should be sipped plain, without the addition of sweeteners, lemon or milk. One exception is Moroccan mint tea, made by pouring sweetened green tea over lightly crushed fresh mint leaves.
 
 
OOLONG TEAS
 These are elegant whole-leaf Chinese teas that are partly withered and oxidized, something of a cross between green and black tea. Most that are exported are called Formosa, from Taiwan.
 
 
FANNINGS
 This is what small particles sifted out of better teas are called. Fannings and broken leaves are used in better teabags.
 
 
TEA DUST
 Cheap teabags are filled with tea dust, left after the fannings are removed. Worse still are floor sweepings, a term tea snobs delight in applying to bad tea.
 
 
FLAVORED TEAS
These are not new marketing gimmicks (although some flavors, like pineapple or chocolate-raspberry certainly are). For centuries tea has been infused with jasmine or rose petals, and sometimes sold with the dried buds still in the tea. Earl Grey is flavored with oil of bergamot, a type of Chinese orange. The best flavored teas are made with natural ingredients and essences, not harsh artificial flavors.
 
 
HERBAL TEAS
 Verbena, chamomile, lemon grass, peppermint and linden are some of the more popular herbal teas, or infusions, preferred by the French. Various herbal blends are also available on the rapidly growing American market. Herbal teas are often believed to have curative properties, and for that reason are stocked in some health-food stores.
 
Making a Good Cup of Tea Is Anything but Complicated
 MAKING a good cup of tea is exquisitely simple. It's too bad most restaurants have not yet figured it out.
First, heat the teapot by filling it with water that has just come to a boil. Discard this water, and place 1 teaspoon of loose tea per cup in the teapot (the exact amount may vary according to taste). Pour in fresh water that has just come to a boil, 6 ounces for each cup of tea. Allow the tea to steep for 3 to 5 minutes; then, pour it through a strainer into a cup or mug. Some types of green tea should be made with water that has cooled down a bit.
A pound of loose tea will yield about 200 cups of brewed tea.
Using a tea bag eliminates the strainer, but it is still best to make the tea in a teapot so the water stays sufficiently hot.
The typical restaurant service, a cup of hot water with the tea bag on the side, will not produce the best cup of tea, because the water is never hot enough when it reaches the table and because the tea should not be dunked into the water; the water should be poured over the tea.
Many French and American teapots come with infusers, which are perforated glass or ceramic cylinders in which to put the tea leaves. Most tea experts find that these do not allow for sufficient expansion of the leaves and do not recommend them. The tiny metal tea holders that can make one cup of tea offer only a slight improvement over tea bags. These gadgets are designed to simplify cleanup, not to improve the cup of tea.
Tea in a pot often becomes too strong, but that problem can be dealt with by adding boiling water.
When tea is made, the leaves release their caffeine first, so the amount of caffeine can be reduced by pouring off all the tea after 30 seconds, then adding fresh boiling water to the leaves or the tea bag.

HEADLINE: The Mayor and the Fish Market -- Again

 BODY:
The Fulton Fish Market has been a fixture on the lower Manhattan landscape since 1833. But decades of abdication by New York City's government have turned this bustling wholesale fish and seafood distribution center into a haven for organized crime, where extortion and physical intimidation are a routine part of doing business.
Eight years ago Rudolph Giuliani, then a U.S. Attorney, began a worthy assault against the Mafia, leading to the appointment of a special Federal administrator, Frank Wohl. Mr. Wohl was given the temporary job of investigating corruption at the market and imposing fines and other sanctions. 
 Mr. Wohl made commendable progress. But his staff of investigators and inspectors was phased out two years ago, returning responsibility for policing the market to where responsibility belongs: City Hall. Mr. Giuliani now has the opportunity to finally clean up the mess by imposing long overdue regulatory controls.
This is more than a matter of law and order. The fish market -- the largest in the nation -- is an important economic asset to the city, providing 1,000 jobs and about $800 million annually in sales.
Yet a crime-free, well-managed Fulton Fish Market could obviously contribute much more. Over the last 15 years the market's volume has declined significantly, as extortion and fraud have led suppliers to unload their refrigerated trucks at other markets on the East Coast, especially Philadelphia and Boston.
Moreover, the city has lost out on millions of dollars in needed revenue by allowing authorized dealers to pay bargain-basement rents, and by failing to collect any rent at all from "phantom dealers" who sublease space without permission from the city. This money could be used to modernize the market and make it a place suppliers want to use instead of avoid.
Goaded by reports of violence, Mr. Giuliani's predecessor, David Dinkins, tried to re-establish a city presence at the market. But his efforts fell far short of what was needed to improve the city's revenue collection. Nor did they do much to inhibit the strongarm tactics of the market's unlicensed unloaders, whose control over the flow of the perishable goods lets them demand exorbitant fees for prompt handling.
Mr. Giuliani may lack experience with some of the municipal problems hurled in his lap. But few know better the problems at the Fulton Fish Market and what needs to be done. That includes raising rents on authorized dealers and evicting the non-paying phantom wholesalers who cannot be traced when they stiff fish suppliers on money they owe.
Randy Maestro, Mr. Giuliani's chief of staff, who supervised the market investigation when Mr. Giuliani was U.S. Attorney, promises that "new procedures and initiatives to address some of the rent and oversight issues" will soon be forthcoming. He and Mr. Giuliani have the chance to finish a job on which they made a good start a decade ago.

HEADLINE: Change, Italian Style

 BODY:
Political upheavals tend to be messy, and Italy's ballot box purge of its postwar political class is no exception. The leaders of the victorious right-wing coalition are already headed off in contradictory directions, leading disappointed losers of the left and center to predict a rupture before a new government can be formed next month.
Whatever their hopes, this fact remains: A new, often demagogic populist right has won a decisive triumph that cannot be conjured away. The center has been utterly discredited by scandal. The post-Communist left, despite the end of the cold war, has been unable to broaden its appeal. The rout of the main postwar parties is close to complete. 
 Meanwhile, what many Americans think of as the real Italy -- the dynamic, part-entrepreneurial, part-governmental economy that has survived, even thrived during decades of misgovernment and corruption -- remains untouched, at least for now. In fact, the man who seems likely to be the next prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, is also the country's biggest media magnate, with an empire that includes merchandising, financial services and sports.
Yearning for a clean new start, Italians have paradoxically embraced a pair of parties with a dubious history and a man who incarnates both the glories and the excesses of the recent past.
The election's biggest losers were the Christian Democrats, Socialists and other allied parties that dominated Italian governments for more than four decades. Many of their leaders now face criminal charges of corruption. Almost as badly hurt was the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to the Communists. Although the P.D.S. finished second over all, its surprising inability to exploit the collapse of its traditional rivals leaves its future in some doubt.
The winners, alarmingly, include neo-Fascists and north Italian regional chauvinists, classic outsiders who are now in a position to claim the spoils of office.
But the biggest winner of all seems to be Mr. Berlusconi, a man of no particular ideology who entered politics only two months ago. His slick and professional media campaign exploited vague slogans and flattering camera angles to position its candidate as at once a radical agent of political change, a reassuringly successful business leader and the latest champion of the Christian right against the eternal Red peril.
That combination proved a sure-fire formula for vote-getting. But it could turn into a confusing prescription for governing. The confusion can only be confounded by the quirky quicksilver coalition Mr. Berlusconi rode to victory.
His main ally in north and central Italy was Umberto Bossi, who rose to prominence by urging these more prosperous areas to loosen their political and financial ties with the economically more backward South. But in the South, Mr. Berlusconi joined forces with the neo-Fascist National Alliance, which stands above all for Mussolini-style strong central government and national unity.
Monday night, joyous neo-Fascists cruised Rome's Piazza del Popolo shouting "Duce" and offering straight-armed salutes. Mussolini's granddaughter, re-elected in Naples, declared the neo-Fascist breakthrough "like a dream."
Grand, if somewhat unsettling theater. But Italy does have serious problems of governance. Its public debt of $1.1 trillion is among Europe's highest, as is its budget deficit of nearly 10 percent of current output. And despite Mr. Berlusconi's personal triumph, there is a question about whether the occult business practices underlying Italy's economic successes can survive continued investigation by independent prosecutors and the railings of unpredictable partisans like Mr. Bossi.
As Italy takes its place within an increasingly integrated European Union, these issues will assume increasing importance, perhaps transcending the old divides of left and right, north and south, centralist and federalist that shaped this election.
Italy's friends abroad must hope that despite discouraging appearances, the voters' wishes for modernization, renewal and higher ethical standards will be rewarded.

HEADLINE: Japan Makes It Tough to Do Business There

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Let's Learn How to Negotiate With Japan" (letter, March 15) by Ann Barcher, on the cultural insensitivity of the Clinton Administration in its trade negotiations with Japan, is typical of misconceptions in trade disputes between Japan and the rest of the industrialized world. It is also naive in the lessons Ms. Barcher relays from her uncle's experiences with the Japanese as a representative for the Boeing Corporation. 
 The problem confronting Western business in Japan is not lack of sensitivity to "ancient cultural traditions." Rather, it is the Japanese "keiretsu" system of hierarchical corporate control and interlocking ownership of industry, finance and commerce, in combination with a chauvinistic officialdom with regulatory powers that encourage discrimination against foreign competition in Japan. The Japanese way of doing business is by its nature incompatible with the systems of other industrialized countries and inimical to free trade and fair competition inside and outside Japan.
The Motorola case is a perfect example of how the Japanese bureaucracy creates an unfriendly environment for foreign investment in Japan. To get licensing permission to do business in Japan, Motorola was forced by Japanese authorities to take on the telecommunications company I.D.O. as a domestic partner. But I.D.O. was a partner of the giant Japanese N.T.T. in developing a system competing with Motorola's.
Whatever one makes of the merits of Motorola's claims about the share of the Japanese market it should have, the relationship forced upon it with a Japanese competitor virtually guaranteed that Motorola's partner would not satisfactorily fulfill contract obligations with the Americans.
Similar conditions are placed on foreign companies in Japan, especially when the Japanese have sought to protect nascent domestic industries from more advanced competitors. But other types of barriers exist, which have profound effects on the United States economy.
For example, automobile imports to Japan are subjected to a battery of inspections on arrival at the docks, which add thousands of dollars to their price. In this way, a Ford Taurus which is competitive with Toyota's Camry in the United States, is priced out of the Japanese market.
With their market effectively protected from the challenge of comparatively priced foreign cars, the Japanese sell their own cars domestically for far more than they do in the United States, thereby directly subsi
dizing United States sales and competing unfairly in this country.
The argument that United States companies will not manufacture cars with the steering wheel on the right is specious and disingenuous, because Ford manufactures such automobiles in Britain for sale in that market, and it does very well. But Ford is proscribed from doing the same in Japan, because the Japanese bureaucracy can effectively block the necessary direct investment required for foreigners to manufacture in Japan.
One can point to "success" stories among United States and other Western companies that have done well in Japan. But in many instances this is because, like Boeing, they had a product the Japanese needed, but were unable to produce on their own; or, as in the case of the American retailer Toys 'R' Us, because the Japanese finally submitted to United States pressure and opened their arcane distribution system just enough to allow Toys 'R' Us in and to remove the pressure to do more.
Assuming that trade friction with Japan would go away if only the United States were more sensitive to Japanese culture, or that the United States trade deficit with Japan is what it is solely because we consume more than we produce is simplistic at best and ultimately detrimental to future trade relations between the United States and Japan.
One may take issue with the tactics employed by United States negotiators, but that is a separate issue. Until Japanese attitudes toward foreign competition and foreign investment in Japan become more liberal, conflict between Japan and its competitors, not just in the United States, but in Asia and Europe as well, will be unremitting.

HEADLINE: CUNY Really Needs Restoration of Its Severely Slashed Funds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You call for filling immediately the empty seats on the City University's board of trustees in "Neglect of the CUNY Board" (editorial, March 15). However, you have the facts wrong when you describe Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget generous to CUNY. 
The Governor and state legislators have crippled New York's public higher education system with severe budget cuts in recent years. This year's proposed executive budget merely restores a fraction of the cuts and leaves higher education extremely underfunded.
Tuition nearly doubled in two years at CUNY's senior colleges as state funds were slashed 20 percent. Students now pay more for less: 10,000 fewer class sections since 1988-89, fewer professors, fewer library hours and deteriorating campuses.
Meanwhile, financial aid programs shrank, limiting college access for thousands of students. The tuition assistance program now requires some of New York's poorest students to pay 383 percent more for their portion of tuition. The Governor has also proposed eliminating such assistance altogether for graduate students.
Worse, New York cut higher education funds more than other states affected by the recession. New York slid from 12th to 35th in state spending per capita for higher education.
The Governor's proposed budget does not fully restore previous cuts and can hardly be characterized as generous to CUNY. It is up to state legislators to finance higher education fully. Without adequate financing for public higher education, the promise of an educated work force is a farce.

LOCKHEED DIVISION TO ELIMINATE 2,000 JOBS

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, based in Marietta, Ga., announced plans yesterday to cut 2,000 jobs, most of them at its Marietta plant, by the end of 1995. The company, a division of the Lockheed Corporation, said the cuts were necessary because of reductions in military spending and a "general economic slowdown in the international market." Lockheed Aeronautical has 11,700 employees, almost all of whom work at the Marietta plant northwest of Atlanta. It produces the C-130 Hercules military transport plane and the P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft. The 2,000 jobs will be eliminated through a combination of layoffs and attrition, a spokesman, Doug Oliver, said.

HEADLINE: Bronx Couple Charged With Murder in the Death of Their Daughter, 4

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
To friends and neighbors, Orlando and Sherain Bryant appeared to be attentive, well-meaning parents who frequently walked their five children to school and to church every Sunday. But the police say the Bryants were regularly beating and abusing their children, finally killing 4-year-old Shayne Bryant on Monday.
The police said Shayne, whose death authorities have attributed to "child abuse syndrome," had been burned with cigarettes and beaten. Police officers, responding to a call about an "asthmatic girl," discovered her body, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, sprawled face up on a dining room table in the family's apartment in the Twin Parks West Consolidated public housing project at 760 East 183d Street in East Tremont. 
 The police also took Shayne's five-year-old sister to the hospital, where she was found to be severely burned on the right hand and to have a bruised face and swollen lips.
Mr. Bryant, 51 yearsold, with five arrests for drug possession, and his 38-year-old wife, whom the police say has had bouts with heroin addiction, were charged yesterday with second-degree murder in their daughter's death. They were also charged with assault and endangering the welfare of a minor.
Edward Chappello, commander of the Bronx detective bureau, said the family had been accused of child abuse in the past and that on at least "several occasions" New York City's Child Welfare Agency had removed the children from their parents' home and placed them in foster care. The last known case in which the bureau was involved with the Bryants was three years ago, the police said. Deputy Chief Chappello said all the Bryant children showed signs of abuse, including "stressed" behavior, markings on some and wounds on others.
At City Hall, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani met yesterday with the Human Resources Administration Commissioner, Marva L. Hammons, and asked her to personally review the Bryant case. Earlier in the day, he said the agency had known of aspects of the case since 1987. He said that "questions have arisen as to what did H.R.A. know."
During a news conference at the 48th Precinct headquarters, Deputy Chief Cappello said, "If you took all the information and put it together, the children were being abused, and not slightly abused." He said the Bryants sometimes gave their children a choice on how they would like to be disciplined if they did something wrong. "They would be told, 'Either you can take a beating or you get no food for two days,' " he said.
After interviewing the surviving Bryant children and their father, the police said they learned that Shayne had been tied with strips of cloth to a child-sized chair some time before she died. Exactly what happened to the girl while in the chair is unknown, authorities said. But they said Shayne's body showed cigarette burns on her forehead, face and the backs of her hands.
 
'Petrified, Frightened'
 Mr. Bryant was arrested shortly after the police, answering the emergency call, discovered Shayne's body at 7:20 P.M. Monday. Mrs. Bryant was apprehended early yesterday morning as she hid with her other children at a friend's home on Nelson Street, Deputy Chief Chappello said.
The children, who are now in the custody of the Child Welfare Agency, were "petrified, frightened" when police found them, he said.
"They were maltreated by both," Deputy Chief Chappello said of Mr. and Mrs. Bryant, "but more so with the father. He supposedly used his fist, and she used a shoe and a belt and stuff like that."
Police said Mr. Bryant, who neighbors said worked in Manhattan as a janitor at night, had an arrest record that included possession of illegal drugs, gambling and an assault charge not related to child abuse. Less was known about Mrs. Bryant, who is unemployed. Some neighbors described her as a problem drinker who, on occasion, would be visibly stressed by the responsibilities of caring for five young children.
Deputy Chief Chappello said that the police investigation is continuing.
Sylvia Free, a grandmother not unaccustomed to the sight and sound of some of her 20 grandchildren under foot, said she often looked after the Bryant children. Ms. Free, who lives on the same floor as the Bryants, said Sherain Bryant would pop into her apartment and ask if she could keep her children for a few minutes, a few hours.
"She was good about coming right back," Ms. Free recalled. "She would go to the store or something and come right back and pick up those children."
Neither Ms. Free nor more than a dozen neighbors who said they often saw the Bryant children said they had any indication that the children were being abused. The sound of crying children in the long, narrow halls of the project is commonplace, even the sounds of threats made by frustrated parents to their children, many said yesterday.
None of them, they said, suspected that the Bryant children might come to harm.
"They were always neat and clean," said Jeanette Duggins, who sometimes took turns with Mrs. Bryant walking their children the three blocks to Public School 32. "I trusted her with my children," she said as tears welled in her eyes.
Daniel Nettles, 10, who attends P.S. 32, sat with some friends and studied the bustle the reporters and news trucks made around the housing projects in which they lived.
"I went to school with them every day," the fourth grader said of the Bryant children. "Now she's beat up and dead, and that's sad."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Wednesday about the beating death of a 4-year-old girl in the Bronx misidentified the building where she lived. The building, at 760 East 183d Street, is called Twin Parks Northeast, not Twin Parks West; it is privately owned, not a public housing project.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A challenge to the complacent on the U.S. unemployment rate.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AS you have heard before and will no doubt hear again, it's America's turn to gloat. The economy is perking along nicely, while unemployment is at its lowest point in three years and still heading south. Japan and Europe, by contrast, remain mired in recession.
Lest the celebration get out of hand, however, remember this: no economist able to pass a sobriety test is predicting that unemployment will fall much below 6 percent. That leaves the economy several million jobs shy of the 3 to 4 percent jobless rate that was considered normal during the 1950's and 1960's. The mainstream economics profession, it seems, is not only becoming reconciled to a 1980's-style world of poorly paying jobs for the unskilled, but has grown complacent to European-style rates of unemployment. 
 That's why Edmund Phelps's freshly published book, "Structural Slumps" (Harvard University Press), is likely to shake the establishment. For while much of what the Columbia University economist (now working at the Russell Sage Foundation) has to say about the "natural" rate of unemployment has been alluded to before, his ambitious explanation of long-term joblessness may serve as a license for intervention in an area where fatalism has long been fashionable.
In the classical economics that dominated thinking for more than a century, voluntary unemployment was always a temporary phenomenon in free markets. Prices -- in this case, wages -- would be bid down to the point where everyone willing to work found a job.
In the 1930's, John Maynard Keynes thought of some clever reasons why unemployment had persisted far longer than anyone but Marxists had expected, and why it was government's job to intervene. But Keynes thought government was only there to grease the wheels. He honored the classicists in acknowledging that as long as there was unemployment, market forces would tend to reduce it. His line, "in the long run we are all dead," simply referred to the idea that people couldn't afford to wait for the market to work its sometimes lethargic magic.
"Frictional" unemployment, by the classical way of thinking, would always exist because people were always between jobs. Joblessness might also follow from the accretion of union power or minimum wage laws that blocked the equalization of labor supply and demand. Only in the last few decades have economists strayed from the spirit of 19th-century economics, arguing that some level of unemployment was "natural" because of the divergent incentives of employees and employers.
Probably the most ingenious variations on this theme should be credited to Mr. Phelps, Steven Salop of Georgetown University, Guillermo Calvo of the University of Maryland and Joseph Stiglitz, now a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
It makes sense for employers to pay more than the bare minimum to attract workers, they suggested, in order to keep the employees from leaving after they had absorbed valuable skills. And, Mr. Phelps argues, premium pay that builds loyalty may even be the order of the day for seemingly interchangeable unskilled employees, so "the workers will not amuse themselves by inserting unpleasant ingredients in the burgers." Competitive wage rates are thus likely to exceed the market-clearing rate, leaving otherwise healthy economies with a variation of what Karl Marx called "the reserve army of the unemployed."
Conservative economists, before and since, have hardly been silent on the questions of what to do about rules, like restrictive union practices and generous unemployment benefits, that artificially reduce the demand or supply of labor. But there has not been much systematic thinking about how the multitude of other factors that drive a modern economy also change the natural rate of joblessness. And that is where Mr. Phelps's book fits in.
The analysis and the statistical evidence supporting it cannot be summarized in time to be absorbed by readers on the 8:18 from White Plains. But the punch lines can: Mr. Phelps attributes much of the rise in natural unemployment since the 1960's to higher payroll taxes, higher real interest rates and the aftershocks from energy price instability in the 1970's and 1980's.
The latter two causes are largely beyond the control of American policy makers, Mr. Phelps notes; both real interest rates and energy prices are determined by world markets. But he argues that it would make considerable sense to shift taxation to forms that do not raise the hourly cost of labor -- a national value-added tax, for example. By the same token, he would lower the effective cost of hiring and training the unskilled by subsidizing the wages of those at the bottom of the labor markets.
In recent years, popular economics has had much to say about what works in free economies (ours) and what does not in planned ones (theirs). Mr. Phelps would shift the focus back to how free markets can fail, too. And perhaps it is time: 6 percent unemployment only looks good from the vantage point of the other 94 percent.

HEADLINE: State Banks Win on Sale Of Annuities

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, yesterday gave state-chartered banks the right to sell annuities, a form of investment usually sold by insurance companies.
About half the banks in New York, including Chemical and Key Bank of New York, have state charters. The ruling does not apply to nationally chartered banks like Citibank and Chase Manhattan. 
 As interest rates have fallen, banks have moved into selling annuities, along with mutual funds, to customers dissatisfied with returns on certificates of deposit. Generally, they have had to offer annuities through independent insurance agents operating out of their branches.
Annuities are similar to individual retirement accounts, which banks can offer, because taxes on the interest earned can be deferred until the customer retires, but they are not subject to the $2,000 maximum annual contribution limit on I.R.A.'s.
In 1991, the State Banking Department let banks set up subsidiaries to sell annuities, but this was challenged by the New York Association of Life Underwriters, which won in the initial trial. The ruling was overturned on appeal. Yesterday the Court of Appeals ruled 6 to 0 in favor of the Banking Department.
 
Aggressive Moves Promised
 "This is something that we worked very hard to lobby for and we will move to take advantage of it as aggressively as we can," said Mae A. Cavoli, general counsel of Key Bank, which already has independent insurance agents in its branches.
The Federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has also moved to let the national banks it regulates sell annuities. This, too, was challenged in court and was recently overturned by a Federal appeals court in New Orleans. The Government has until April 13 to decide whether to appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
"The decision in New York buttresses our case," said Leonora S. Cross, a deputy comptroller.
"Annuities are the fastest-growing investment product and represent a significant revenue stream for a number of banks," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a partner of Sullivan & Cromwell, who filed a friend of the court brief on behalf of the bankers.

FORD AND UNION WORKERS AVERT STRIKE IN OHIO

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company and workers at one of two assembly lines at a Ford plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, reached a contract agreement last night, heading off a strike. The United Auto Workers had authorized a strike if a new agreement was not reached by midnight. UAW Local 2000, which represents 1,900 workers on the Mercury Villager-Nissan Quest minivan production line, rejected a contract offer on March 14. Workers on the other line, which makes Econoline full-size vans, approved a separate contract at that time. Details of the new agreement were not released. As part of a 1988 joint venture with the Nissan Motor Company, workers on the Villager-Quest line agreed to use Japanese-style management principles, including the team concept, in which workers learn to perform several different jobs. But employees have complained of insufficient training and say they do not have the time or support to do their jobs properly. Workers on the Econoline assembly line have a traditional agreement, each performing a single job.

DIME SAVINGS TO HELP MORTGAGE HOLDERS IN CONNECTICUT

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Dime Savings Bank of New York has agreed to make $6 million dollars in loans available to hundreds of Connecticut homeowners who ended up in foreclosure after taking out high-risk mortgages in the late 1980's. The agreement, announced yesterday, concluded an investigation by the Connecticut Banking Department and the State Attorney General into complaints that the bank made monthly adjustable rate mortgages without properly explaining to borrowers that their monthly payments would not cover the interest and that the difference would be added to the principal. The bank did not admit any wrongdoing in the agreement, maintaining in a statement that its lending practices were "legal and proper." The bank will forgive any money owed by 735 borrowers whose properties were foreclosed on and sold to repay their mortgages.

Leslie Fay Weighs Closing of Plants

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Leslie Fay Companies said yesterday that it was considering closing its manufacturing operations in Wilkes-Barre and the Wyoming Valley region of Pennsylvania, a move that would result in layoffs of roughly 1,200 workers.
Although the proposal was made in the first bargaining session with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the announcement was noteworthy because it portended further economic hardship for that region, where the bulk of the company's United States production operations are based.
 
Proposal to Retrain Workers
 The company, which is based in New York, also proposed that the union use the money it received from Leslie Fay for "liquidated damages" to retrain those workers who stand to lose their jobs. The company said it had paid $1.5 million to the union in the last two years to compensate for jobs lost in the United States because of reassignments to foreign contractors. 
 The union dismissed the company's proposal, but because Leslie Fay is already operating under bankruptcy court protection, labor has less leverage in the negotiations than it might against a financially healthy company.
"The problems of this company have nothing whatsoever to do with domestic production and have everything to do with the financial scandal and internal mismanagement," John Burke, a spokesman for the union, said. "This is a company that cooked its own books and now wants to burn the workers who have helped build the company over the last 40 years."
Last year, an audit showed that accounting changes falsely inflated Leslie Fay's after-tax profits by $62 million from the fourth quarter of 1990 to January 1993.
Leslie Fay also reported yesterday a loss of $49 million, or $2.61 a share, for the fourth quarter. The company attributed the loss to expenses related to its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It said the results reflected $21.4 million in pretax reorganization charges, $9.9 million in interest and financing costs and a tax benefit of $1.2 million.
Shares of Leslie Fay fell 12.5 cents, to $3.625, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
Excluding special items and taxes, the company had a fourth-quarter loss of $18.9 million, on sales of $123.3 million.
The company also said it had reached an agreement with a group of banks to extend its debtor-in-possession financing through July 31.

HEADLINE: Caution by Mutual Fund Investors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
With interest rates rising and stock prices dropping, mutual fund investors are showing more caution than they have in years, fund managers said yesterday. But stock funds still appear to be taking in more cash from new investments than they are losing to redemptions.
"The real story is bond funds," a spokesman for the Vanguard Group, John Worth, said. He said Vanguard bond funds saw significant redemptions, with the largest in funds that invest in junk bonds and in mortgage-backed securities. 
 At Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, stock funds will take in a net 30 percent less in March than in February, Jane Jamieson, a senior vice president, said, while bond funds are seeing outflows of cash. She added that in the last few days, as both stock and bond prices plummeted, there have been net redemptions, but she called them "modest."
But some other groups, particularly those that sell funds through brokers rather than directly to investors, said money continued to come into both stock and bond funds, even in recent days.
International funds, the stars earlier in the year, seem to be losing appeal as many foreign markets fall back. "Basically, international is flat now, and all the money that is coming in is going into domestic stock funds," Robert Adler, who monitors fund cash flows for AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif., said.
The comments came as the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported that bond funds in February took in a net $1.1 billion, the smallest amount for a month since December 1990. And that figure was inflated because the entire flow came in funds that invest in both stocks and bonds, like balanced funds and asset allocation funds. Funds devoted strictly to bonds saw outflows.
Municipal bond funds saw a net outflow of $364 million in February. It was the first month since September 1990 that these funds failed to have net inflows of cash.
The cash flow figures include sales and redemptions, as well as transfers of money among funds. They do not include reinvested dividends.

Funds' Value Down
 By The Associated Press
Investors who poured billions of dollars into the 10 largest stock mutual funds can thank this week's market selloff for putting their investments into the red so far this year.
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. said yesterday that the biggest funds were off by 2 percent to 4.9 percent just since Friday's close. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen nearly 4 percent this week.

Rates Move Higher for a Second Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates moved higher yesterday for the second straight session on investor fears of fast economic expansion and Federal Reserve monetary policy, as well as on end-of-quarter window-dressing by fund managers.
And while bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates, did not deteriorate as badly yesterday as they did on Tuesday, trading was choppy and caused the yield on the 30-year bond to reverse its field a number of times. 
 Analysts said the buying of Government securities was restrained by the approach of the Good Friday holiday and employment report. Investor concern about fast economic growth that would translate into more inflation helped to erase early gains. Even a sharp drop in stock prices yesterday, which generally creates demand for Government securities, did not keep bond prices from falling.
 
Economists Forecasting Growth
 "Interest rates won't stabilize until investors start buying bonds, and investors won't start buying until there are signs that the economy is slowing down," one trader said. Economists are forecasting growth this year will be more than 4 percent, up from 2.8 percent last year.
By late in the day the 30-year bond was down 13/32 , to 8920/32 , for a yield of 7.09 percent, up from 7.06 percent and still at a 13-month high. In the shorter-maturity bill market, rates benefited from the volatility in the stock market as investors headed for the security of the money market.
The rate for a three-month bill was down 2 basis points, to 3.46 percent, and down 5 basis points, to 3.77 percent, for a six-month bill. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Alan Kral, a portfolio manager at Trevor, Stewart, Burton & Jacobsen, an investment management firm, described the market as liquidity-driven, with the need for liquidity brought on as heavily leveraged positions in the market unwind. "And it is for that reason we don't think the market is trading on economic fundamentals," he said.
Mr. Kral said the need for liquidity right now had much to do with the first quarter, as managers cleaned out portfolios, also known as window-dressing.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisers, said that "the bond market is extremely oversold, and suggests there are numbers of leverage positions that had to be unwound at any price," adding, "And hence, the nonstop liquidations."
Mr. Battipaglia thinks the rapid decline in bond prices probably had a bigger impact on the portfolios of hedge funds, the bigger market players that use various forms of leverage, with little equity backing.
With no major economic data due until Good Friday, when the March employment numbers are released, yesterday's factory orders had little impact on the market, traders said. The monthly employment report is widely regarded as one of the best indicators of the health of the economy.
 
Municipal Bonds
 In the municipal-bond market, where prices have dropped along with Treasury securities, there is rising concern among investors and traders that mutual funds are selling bonds from their portfolios to raise cash to meet demand from those pulling out of funds as prices plunge. But as one manager said, "Redemptions haven't been as bad as many people expected, but some market watchers are getting a sense that they may pick up."
According to Bloomberg Financial Markets calculations, fair value yields on double-A rated, 10-year general obligation bonds have surged 79 basis points, to 5.92 percent, since the Fed's initial move to raise short-term interest rates on Feb. 4, the highest yield since Feb. 8, when the yield was 5.95 percent.
At the same time, the 10-year municipals have increased in value relative to Treasuries for investors in the 39.6 percent tax bracket, yielding about 85.88 percent of Government securities, up from 84.7 percent before the Fed's increase.
Yesterday, the Ohio Building Authority initially priced for sale $175 million in revenue bonds, the day's largest sale, with the proceeds used for improvements in adult correctional facilities.
Rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Corporation because they are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, the bonds were tentatively priced to yield a maximum 6.04 percent for an issue due 2013.
Underwriters led by Bear, Stearns & Company priced the shorter-maturity serial bonds to yield from 2.90 percent for a bond due 1994 to 5.05 percent in 2000, 5.60 percent in 2005, and 5.95 percent in 2010.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Steep Stock Market Decline Takes the Dollar Lower, Too

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against major currencies yesterday, shadowing a steep fall in American stock prices.
Dealers said that the psychological effect of tumbling stock markets -- the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 2 percent yesterday -- is leaving traders wary of the dollar. 
 "The movement of the dollar in the U.S. is stock market-driven," said Chuck Spence, a vice president of Standard Chartered Bank.
The stock price plunge has some traders concerned that the Federal Reserve Board might reconsider its recent policy of monetary tightening, since higher rates have been blamed for the falling market.
Yet, higher interest rates are what dollar holders covet because investors want to put their money in currency-denominated bonds and other paper that provide higher returns.
The dollar was also blind-sided yesterday by an advance in the German mark. Traders unloaded the British pound for marks on speculation that Prime Minister John Major might be challenged for his party's leadership, which would carry a challenge to the Prime Minister's office, as well.
The dollar finished at 1.6750 German marks in late New York trading, down from 1.6770 marks on Tuesday. It also fell to 102.85 Japanese yen from 103.15.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar had another rocky session, falling to well below 103 yen before the Japanese central bank intervened for the second day, buying dollars and helping the dollar to recover during the session to 103.30 yen. But it still failed to reach the previous close of 103.80.
"It looks like the dollar is seeking the path of least resistance, and that's down right now," said Dave Moline, a Norwest Bank yen trader.
The pound declined to $1.4800 in late New York trading, from $1.4820 on Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4193 Swiss francs, down from 1.4266; 5.7260 French francs, down from 5.7340, and 1,632 Italian lire, down from 1,641. The Canadian dollar fetched 72.53 cents, down from 72.20 cents on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Fall Again; Fears of Slowdown Cited

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Copper prices sank yesterday for the fifth time in six trading sessions, as the stock market's sharp selloff raised fears of an economic slowdown.
Traders maintained, however, that underlying demand for the industrial metal was solid. 
 "This action is corrective in nature," said Hans Kashyap of the Analytics Research Corporation. "The longer term uptrend for copper still remains intact,"
Copper's upward price trend stretches back to October, when strong signs of an economic recovery combined with falling copper inventories to push up prices.
But yesterday, another drop in the stock market -- the fifth straight decline -- and a 1 percent decline in February factory orders spelled weakness in copper, the Prudential Securities analyst Bette Raptopoulos said.
Copper's myriad industrial uses ties the price closely to the course of economic activity.
 
'Panic Liquidation'
"This is panic liquidation by everybody," one trader said. "Equity markets around the world are soft, especially the United States stock market."
"There are high volume stop-loss orders when you see a market starting to fall like this," another trader said. "The market just whips right through them. The question is how far can copper fall before prices stabilize and confidence is regained."
Copper for May delivery, the most active futures contract, lost 2.90, to 86.45 cents a pound at the Commodity Exchange in New York, after the contract hit a low of 86.20 cents, a level not seen since Feb. 28.
Mr. Kashyap said he expected copper to move lower over the next few sessions to test support at 84 cents before rebounding.
Other metal prices were mixed.
Platinum prices advanced on growing worries about unrest in South Africa, the world's largest platinum producer. Violence prior to late April elections could hamper mining operations and exports. The active July platinum rose $3.10, to $415 an ounce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
At the Comex, April gold rose 10 cents, to $386.10 an ounce, while May silver slipped 1.7 cents, to $5.64 an ounce.
On other commodity markets, cotton prices rose close to three-year highs ahead of today's report on the spring poor planting conditions. At the New York Cotton Exchange, May cotton rose 0.68 cent, to 78.05 cents a pound.
Analysts expect the United States Department of Agriculture to forecast a modest drop in the number of acres planted in cotton, compared with last year, but the droughtlike conditions could prevent many plants from emerging from dry soils. Extreme dryness and the recent lack of rainfall in the high plains of Texas could severely hamper cotton plantings in a region that grows up to one-quarter of the nation's cotton.

HEADLINE: Fears and Fanfare for the New Store in Town;
A Giant Retailer Opens Its Doors, and Main Street Will Never Be the Same

SERIES: When Wal-Mart Comes to Town -- A periodic look at how a retailing giant changes a community's economy.

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GREENPORT, N.Y., March 30

 BODY:
When Mike Nero was 13, one of his favorite things to do was to drive his father's 1953 Ford station wagon around an uncleared field off Fairview Avenue in this rural Hudson Valley town. That was 30 years ago.
This morning at 7, Mr. Nero was behind the wheel again in the same spot. This time he was driving a golf cart and ferrying customers across a sprawling parking lot to the front door of the town's new Wal-Mart, which celebrated its grand opening today with a heavy dose of hype and fanfare. 
 "People here have been waiting for this store to open for a long time," said Mr. Nero, who was laid off from an aerospace factory over a year ago and gratefully accepted a job in Wal-Mart's stockroom for $5.50 an hour. "This is the biggest thing to happen in this area in a long time."
 
Vigorous Northeast Expansion
 Indeed, it is. For over a year now, Greenport and the neighboring city of Hudson, two economically struggling communities across the river from the Catskills, have been gearing up to welcome the nation's largest retailer into their midst.
The new Wal-Mart here is the 40th that the company has opened in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in a blitz of the Northeast that began in 1991. Eighteen more stores are scheduled to open in the three states by the end of 1995. Counting the six other grand openings held today -- Battle Creek, Mich., and Chico, Calif., were among the other sites -- Wal-Mart now boasts a roster of 2,034 stores nationwide.
To the consumers who packed the store's aisles here this morning, the verdict was quick and virtually unanimous: there seemed to be bargains at every turn in a store so big -- big enough, in fact, to house two football fields side by side -- that it was easy to get lost in its 23 departments.
 
Awaiting Tax Revenues
 The local officials were there too, barely able to contain their anticipation of the property-tax and sales-tax revenues to be generated by a business that has instantly become one of the 10 largest private employers in Columbia County. Smaller Wal-Marts in other towns have routinely sold $20 million worth of goods a year.
But the mood was decidedly more somber on Warren Street, Hudson's main thoroughfare and the business district closest to the new store, where mom-and-pop merchants wondered aloud today about how the retail giant would affect their sales. For decades, the Arkansas-based chain, which duplicates virtually every shopping option of Main Street under one roof, has earned a reputation for using rock-bottom prices and attentive service to drain the vitality of similar downtown strips across the country.
"Wal-Mart does a neat-and-clean job of getting people to spend and overspend," said Jim Runde, the owner of Browne's Shoe Store, which he has operated on Warren Street for three years. "After Wal-Mart, shoppers have no money to spend anyplace else."
 
A Stark Contrast
 The empty parking spaces in front of some of Warren Street's shops stood in stark contrast to the carnival-like atmosphere that reigned two miles away at Wal-Mart. There were pony rides for children, a giant hot-air balloon, free goldfish, workers dressed as life-size Oreo cookies and a greeter at the front door who acknowledged every customer with a smile and the same stock phrase: "Hi, welcome to Wal-Mart. How may I help you?"
During a 45-minute ribbon-cutting ceremony that began with the national anthem, the store manager, Paul Franz, 34, lived up to the chain's "family values" reputation by introducing his wife, Chris, to a crowd of dignitaries that included the Town Supervisor of Greenport and the Mayor of Hudson. "I love you," Mr. Franz told his wife, speaking into a microphone.
Later, like a baseball manager listing his opening-day lineup, Mr. Franz would introduce his five assistant managers and their wives too, some of the couples holding hands throughout the ceremony, staged in front of a store cafeteria that features the menus of Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
The moment that seemed to garner the loudest employee applause came when Lee Pelletier, a 57-year-old maintenance worker, stood up, hands shaking, to read a poem that he had submitted to a store contest promoting worker safety. As the first-prize winner, he was awarded a VCR.
"Safety first is what we say / Wal-Mart people know that's the way," he read. "We don't run in the street or in the store / We are especially careful on wet floors."
 
Plenty of Job Applications
 Many in Hudson and Greenport hope that Wal-Mart can help reverse an economic decline that has been marked by the loss of hundreds of manufacturing jobs over the last 20 years, during which more than a dozen area factories closed. Although Wal-Mart came to town offering a relatively small number of positions -- about 170 full-time jobs, most paying $1.25 above the $4.25 minimum wage -- more than 1,600 people applied for work.
Local business leaders point to Wal-Mart's arrival as one of several signs that the county's fortunes may be changing. Kaz Inc., a manufacturer of consumer health-care products that has had a factory in the area for almost 50 years, announced last month that it had decided to build a new $6 million plant in Hudson. And developers have filed plans in the Greenport town office to build J. C. Penney, Kmart and Wholesale Depot stores.
One Warren Street merchant who stands to gain from Wal-Mart's presence is Jeff Bagnall, the proprietor of Sweeps, a shop that sells vacuum cleaners and repairs an array of appliances. Mr. Bagnall has reached an agreement with Wal-Mart to handle the repair work covered by warranty on all the lawn mowers, snow blowers and garden equipment that the store sells.
Last week, when Wal-Mart quietly opened its doors to the public for a series of dry runs before its grand opening, Mr. Bagnall cleared out his back room and hired a new mechanic to handle the anticipated demand.
"Do I expect to see a very significant increase in revenues and customers coming through the door?" Mr. Bagnall asked. "Yes."
 
Direct Competitors
 The jury is still out on how other merchants who are more direct competitors of Wal-Mart will fare. They include the J. C. Rogerson Company hardware store, a fixture on Warren Street since 1832; Town Fair, a longtime toy store, and Airhead Balloons/ Hudson Flower Market, a gift shop.
"We expect business to be a little slow for a couple of months, only because people will flock to see what is new in town," said Debbie Brash, 38, manager of Airhead. "But we will definitely survive Wal-Mart."
Among the visitors to Wal-Mart today was Dennis McEvoy, 44, a partner with his father, John, 68, in Rogerson's. Scribbling furiously in a palm-sized notebook, Mr. McEvoy noted several items -- including cans of Rust-Oleum spray enamel and three-prong plugs -- that Wal-Mart was selling at a lower price than his store was. But Mr. Rogerson said he remained confident that his store, which has seven floors of behind-the-scenes stockrooms, would continue to prosper because of its volume and a selection that even Wal-Mart managers concede they cannot match.
Though most of the customers who flocked to the Wal-Mart today pronounced themselves impressed with what they saw, Maude Ridzi, 69, and her husband, Frank, 74, were not among them. Having picked up only two quarts of motor oil, the couple said they did not expect to return.
"I don't think the prices are that great," said Mrs. Ridzi, a retired postal worker. "But it's nice to walk around."
 
Series So Far
 The most recent article of this series on Wal-Mart's arrival near Hudson, N.Y., appeared on Jan. 24. It examined the hopes and prospects of job-seekers and the store's interview process. The first article, on Nov. 28, looked at the effect of Wal-Mart's presence on businesses along Hudson's main thoroughfare, Warren Street.

 BODY:
The City Council yesterday proposed establishing four new economic development zones in New York City, which would provide the distressed areas with state help to stimulate business and employment.
The official decision on which areas will be designated as development zones will be up to the state's Department of Economic Development, which is to make the selections by June. 
 There are already four economic development zones in New York City, in East Harlem, East New York in Brooklyn, Port Morris in the Bronx and South Jamaica in Queens. The City Council proposed the establishment of new zones in southwest Brooklyn, just west of Sunset Park, the North Shore of Staten Island, Hunts Point in the Bronx and Far Rockaway, Queens.
Economic development zones generally cover a two-mile area, and local businesses are given investment tax credits, wage tax credits and reductions in utility rates. Businesses in these areas are also eligible for tax relief for construction materials. There are currently 19 economic development zones throughout the state.
Mary Ellen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Economic Development, said that there were about 30 applications from communities throughout the state to establish economic development zones and that the state would designate 15. "It's still not clear where they will be established," she said.
 
Complaints Among Democrats
 But Council members said they felt confident that the state would establish four zones in New York City.
The Council meeting began nearly an hour later than scheduled because it was preceded by a lengthy meeting of the Democratic members, many of whom complained to Speaker Peter F. Vallone that they learned the details of the Council's own budget proposals from newspaper accounts rather than from a briefing for Council members.
"I was unhappy because I had to read about the budget proposals in the newspapers when I should have received the information in a briefing from the Council leadership," said Sal F. Albanese, a City Councilman from Brooklyn.
"I also had some concerns about the budget proposal itself. It's basically a warmed-over Giuliani budget that will result in a reduction in services and will make the city less livable."
Mr. Vallone said the criticism by some Council members represented "grumbling that's rather normal at this stage of budget negotiations."
Earlier in the day, following a public hearing, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed a bill that would make it illegal to restrict or to block access to an abortion clinic. New York City joins several cities that have passed laws to keep anti-abortion protesters from harassing women outside clinics.
Mr. Giuliani also signed into law a bill that extends most of the city's rent control and rent stabilization rules, but lifts controls for at least 1,500 apartments with relatively wealthy tenants over the next few years.

HEADLINE: Slowly, the New York Region Begins Regaining Its Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
For the first time since New York City and its suburbs sank into recession in 1989, they showed a slight gain in employment last year, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday.
The pace of growth is expected to accelerate this year, the agency said, but gains will be smaller than elsewhere in the nation. 
 While providing broad statistical evidence of a long-awaited turnaround, Port Authority officials said the region's economic engine was hardly running on all cylinders. Although Wall Street brokerage houses, banks, law offices and other professional firms are prospering, it said, the industries that have been hardest hit by the long economic downturn -- manufacturing and construction -- continue to falter.
But with employment gains spread almost equally across the city and its suburbs, "We can cautiously say we have finally turned the corner on the deepest recession since World War II," said Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority.
 
Some Jobs Regained
 The agency, which released its findings as part of its annual economic review and forecast, said the region gained 11,900 jobs in 1993, an increase of 0.2 percent.
The 1993 gains came after four years of painful losses, when the region's economic nosedive claimed 714,000 jobs, or 9.3 percent of the total.
Although it said the rate of job gains would rise to 1 percent this year, the agency said it expected lingering problems to keep the recovery at a slower pace than in other regions. For the nation as a whole, it predicted a 2 percent increase in jobs this year.
Amid a procession of corporate layoff announcements, including recent cutbacks by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, based in Basking Ridge, N.J., and Nynex, based in White Plains, Port Authority economists said jobs would continue to decline in many industries, including manufacturing, public utilities and communications.
Hospitals will also cut back, anticipating financial pressure under Federal health-care reform, and government agencies will respond to fiscal constraints by cutting employment, the report said.
 
A Long Road Back
 Richard Roper, director of the Port Authority's Office of Economic and Policy Analysis, said he did not expect the region to regain all the jobs lost since 1989 until at least the year 2000.
And because of what analysts believe to be a permanent reordering of the region's economy, in which manufacturing will never regain its vigor and low-skilled jobs are increasingly scarce, the agency's forecast aggravated long-term worries over the region's social and economic future.
"It leaves us with the prospect of a large pool of unemployed people, no doubt living in poverty," Mr. Brezenoff said. "The gap between rich and poor is widening."
Other economic analysts said the most important finding by the Port Authority was not that a regional recovery has begun, but that it was moving at a snail's pace.
"This was the deepest recession in memory, and now it's the weakest recovery," said Samuel Ehrenhalt, the New York regional director of the Federal Government's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In other periods of economic recovery, including the one that followed New York City's steep downturn in the 1970's, he said, full recovery, as measured in employment levels, had taken no more than two years.
 
The Hopeful Signs
 Still, the Port Authority analysis revealed scattered signs of economic encouragement for the region.
Inflation, which has almost always been higher in New York City and its suburbs than in the nation as a whole, dipped below the national average in the last four months of 1993.
The value of homes in the region, which had fallen almost steadily from 1989 to the end of 1992, rose slightly in the last nine months of 1993, and the number of homes sold in the region rose by 4.4 percent for all of 1993.
Tourism was up in Manhattan. Although attendance at Broadway theaters dipped by 7.4 percent in 1993, the report said, occupancy rates in Manhattan hotels increased, and average room rates rose by $1.60 a night, to $136.80.
Among economic signals that remain largely mixed, the Port Authority report underscored a long-term shift in the region's economic landscape, where business conditions in New York City and its suburbs are tied together much more closely than in previous economic cycles.
The change is reflected in the differing patterns of recession that affected the region in the early 1970's and since 1989.
In the deep downturn 20 years ago, the agency's records show that New York City lost more than 600,000 jobs, but the suburbs gained employment, easing the burden for the region.
But according to the Port Authority's analysis, the current cycle of recession and recovery has affected the entire region in almost equal measure.
 
Downs and Ups
 From June 1989 to June 1992, the report said, employment fell by 10.1 percent in New York City, by 8.6 percent on Long Island and by 9.9 percent in northern New Jersey.
In the year ending in June 1993, employment crept back up by 0.5 percent on Long Island and by 0.9 percent in northern New Jersey. It continued to fall slightly, by 0.3 percent, in New York City, although by the end of the year the city had recorded a 0.1 percent gain.
"The pattern is very similar," Mr. Brezenoff said. "It shows that our economy is truly regional."

HEADLINE: Depositors to Withdraw Money in Retaliation for Natwest Bank's Transfer of Jobs

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
Venting frustration over another exodus of jobs from Long Island, several local government officials and real-estate developers said yesterday that they would withdraw money from National Westminster Bank to protest a transfer of some back office operations to Pennsylvania.
"It's time we stop mincing words to businesses that seek to use Long Island residents as their cash cow," said Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive. "In part, what we are doing is symbolic. But it's an important message that we hope will be interpreted in a positive fashion. We want to lend our support to those businesses who are willing to remain here on Long Island."
 
First Such Boycott
 The action, which one expert said may be the first time major depositors have threatened a bank boycott over a loss of jobs, is not expected to halt NatWest's move. 
 With $11.7 billion in total deposits in New York, NatWest would only be modestly affected even if most local governments on Long Island banded together and withdrew the estimated $150 million to $200 million they hold in NatWest accounts.
The bank, a subsidiary of Britain's second-largest banking institution, National Westminster Bank, expects to save much more by reducing its operating costs than it would lose in profits from any withdrawal of funds.
"Our decision wasn't an easy one, but it was an essential one," said Tim Connolly, a NatWest spokesman. Faced with growing competition, NatWest plans to reduce its costs by $34 million after two years and $25 million annually in the future by moving 1,300 service jobs from the New York area to Scranton, Pa. It expects to gain the savings through lower wages, taxes and utility costs.
After the move, which will require a new $31 million building, NatWest would continue to employ 3,000 people on Long Island in its data center in Melville and its 69 branches in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
 
Little Comfort
 But that appears to provide little comfort to local officials and developers, who are particularly worried that other service-oriented companies may be tempted to abandon Long Island because of the higher costs of doing business there.
"The loss of NatWest may be more serious and more dangerous to the Long Island economy than the loss of Grumman," Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said last week.
Other New York banks, including Chemical and Citbank, have a significant number of back-office jobs on Long Island. In contrast to NatWest's decision to relocate almost 1,000 jobs in customer service and credit card operations, Greenpoint Savings Bank is looking for a location in Nassau County for a headquarters to employ 1,500 people.
In the past, several banks have been targets of campaigns by depositors, but they have usually been efforts to end discriminatory lending practices or protests over loans to South Africa. One union led a boycott against a Seattle bank because it refused to negotiate a contract.
"This doesn't happen very often on a large scale," said Tom Schlesinger, director of the Southern Fiscal Project in Charlotte, N.C. "This is the first I've heard of this kind of protest being targeted at a loss of jobs."
 
Led by Real-Estate Group
 The Long Island protest was organized by the Association for a Better Long Island, which represents commercial, industrial and residential real-estate concerns with $10 million in deposits at NatWest. Suffolk and Nassau Counties hold $65 million in NatWest accounts, officials said.
In an echo of Vietnam-era draft-card burnings, Vincent Polimeni, the association's chairman, cut up his NatWest credit card.
"We've had enough in terms of seeing companies leave without doing anything to try to stay," Mr. Polimeni said. "We're calling on everyone to take what money you may have in NatWest and put it in the banks who are staying here on Long Island."
Leaders of the protest, while saying they would all recommend withdrawals, said that none of their governments have acted yet.
Those joining Mr. Polimeni and Mr. Gulotta, the Republican leader of Nassau County, at a news conference in Mineola included: Robert Gaffney, a Republican and the Suffolk County Executive; Lewis J. Yevoli, Democrat and Supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, and Arthur Thompson, the Mayor of Freeport.

HEADLINE: The Intricate Steps to Cutting the United Way Pie

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
Raising money for United Way takes ingenuity. So does spending it.
To encourage giving by employees of the Chemical Banking Corporation, Walter V. Shipley, Chemical's chairman and chief executive, took 12 senior officials on a tour of a family shelter in Manhattan run by the American Red Cross with financial help from United Way. 
 "They all got wired in, because you could not look at the kids and not be moved, and the results were terrific," he said, noting that eight Chemical executives each contributed $10,000.
On a much more modest scale, Dr. John A. Whritner, School Superintendent in Greenwich, Conn., made early-morning visits to 13 schools, tied on an apron and flipped pancakes, fulfilling a promise to make breakfast for schools where every teacher, clerk and custodial worker contributed to United Way.
Elsewhere, companies gave prizes to contributing employees: At Christ Hospital in traffic-congested Jersey City, some won free parking spaces for a month. At Waldbaum's supermarkets on Long Island, television sets and boom boxes were offered as raffle prizes. At St. Francis Hospital's two locations in Beacon and Poughkeepsie, N.Y., employees could win three days off with pay, and for a donation of $6 weekly, a trip to a Catskill resort.
Persuading employees to give to the 2,100 United Ways across the nation is obviously an essential link in the United Way chain. But there is a lot that must go on both before and after United Way money gets to 47,000 agencies -- from the Salvation Army to the smallest neighborhood shelter -- helping children, adolescents, the elderly, the disabled and the homeless.
 
Restoring Confidence
 What happens to get campaigns started has become particularly important since confidence in United Way ebbed and public support fell off after revelations three years ago about the $463,000 salary, lavish spending and mismanagement of William Aramony, United Way's longtime president. He was forced from the job and the Justice Department is investigating his finances.
Mindful of the past scandal, Elaine Chao, who became president of United Way of America in November 1992, underscored in an interview that United Way was a "volunteer-driven" charity -- volunteers largely run the 2,100 campaigns, raise the money and decide its distribution.
Local United Way groups pay a small sum, about six-tenths of 1 per cent of the money they raise, in dues to United Way of America, based in the District of Columbia. In return, members get campaign tools such as the familiar logo of the outstretched hand, a blizzard of prepared media advertisements, training for the thousands of volunteers who help run campaigns, and the intangible benefits of having a presence in Washington.
 
The City, a 'Peculiar Animal'
 Ms. Chao also emphasized that funds raised locally are spent locally. A more complicated distribution situation exists in the New York area, a "peculiar animal," she said, because it has so many commuters as well as corporations with plants or offices at several locations.
To accommodate these geographic realities, a regional organization called United Ways of Tri-State was on June 1, 1977, to run fund-raising campaigns at 158 of the largest corporations, and to channel this money to 32 member United Ways in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The 32 run their individual campaigns and keep the money they raise; they also get a significant chunk of Tri-State money.
The Tri-State funds are distributed according to a formula taking account of each member's needs, how much it raised and its historic involvement in helping agencies that might otherwise not be able to operate. The last regional campaign raised $108.3 million from fund drives at the 158 companies, in part from corporate gifts but mainly from employees who signed pledge cards giving a percentage of their salaries to charity.
United Way of New York City received $41.6 million, the largest single share.
In the last few years, economic depression in the Northeast and downsizing of major companies have reduced the number of employees solicited for donations and Tri-State proceeds dropped 8 per cent last year, even while competition increased among the 32 member United Ways over the distribution of the pooled money.
While most members affirm the benefits of a regional approach, some have expressed misgivings about the costs of Tri-State -- it spent $6.3 million for expenses.
 
Complaints on Priorities
 There are other frictions. A number of the suburban communities questioned New York City's share, arguing that they too have jobless and homeless to look after, although admittedly on a smaller scale. In turn, the more affluent complained they received less from Tri-State than they contributed, and consequently preferred to run their own drives. United Way of Bergen County in New Jersey and Milford in Connecticut elected to pull out of Tri-State. Central New Jersey withdrew but then rejoined.
Recently, a number of company leaders began an effort to restructure Tri-State, reducing its board from 74 members to between 30 and 40 and giving more places to corporate and labor representatives. The same proposal calls for greater uniformity in financial reporting -- a potentially controversial issue since it influences the members' shares.
The Tri-State board is to vote on the proposal today.
Meanwhile, an increasing number of companies are permitting their employees to designate where they want their donations to be directed, choosing from an array of environmental or advocacy groups that are not part of United Way's network.
Employees may decide whether to direct money to the United Way where they work or where they live or to both. United Way of New York City, which received $4.6 million less as its share in Tri-State, lost an additional $1.2 million because employees exercised their choice to select a recipient United Way outside the city.
 
Some Causes Go Begging
 Ralph Dickerson Jr., president of United Way of New York City, complained recently that companies tend to direct money to "sexy headline issues" -- drug abuse and homelessness are in favor right now -- while ignoring equally compelling needs such as foster care. He urged instead that companies provide general support through United Way without choosing specific targets.
By longstanding agreement, a 35 percent share of the general support money that United Way of New York City receives goes to four organizations -- the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society. The rest is distributed to about 660 smaller groups.
To stretch its resources, a growing number of innovative financial partnerships are being developed, with municipal, state and Federal agencies or private philanthropies, in which United Way provides some money in combination with its management assistance.
Two $1.5 million contributions -- from Henry R. Kravis, the investor and corporate buyout specialist, and a United Way board member -- enabled the local United Way to secure a $1.5 million Federal grant, and to package an antidrug program in collaboration with the Fund for New York City Public Education and support from Chase Manhattan Bank and a number of philanthropies.
A collaboration between United Way of New York City and the city's Board of Education created a dropout prevention program that has proved successful and will be continued through 1996.
A $100,000 outlay from United Way and $975,000 from the State Department of Health financed a program to provide medical care and support for women with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. In the newest partnership, a number of philanthropies including the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N.J., provided money to set up Iris House, the city's first residence and service center for women with H.I.V.

HEADLINE: At Utah Hospital, Innovative Way to Track Medical Quality

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
In the mid-1980's, the medical staff at LDS Hospital here took on a seemingly contradictory mission: to cut medical costs and also raise the quality of care. For help, they turned to a sophisticated computer system they had just installed.
By tradition, improving quality had usually meant offering more services, employing expensive new drugs or buying costly diagnostic machines. But the LDS doctors tried a different approach. They simply began re-examining their existing treatments. 
 As one of the first efforts, they compared each patient's medical history with literature on drugs before deciding which ones to prescribe. To their surprise, the doctors quickly found that the frequency of adverse reactions to drugs fell to 0.2 percent from 5 percent -- saving $450,000 a year that had been spent on prolonged hospital stays.
This experience was repeated in other areas. In fact, patients throughout the hospital began recovering faster. Fewer of them died. And the hospital began saving more than $1 million a year.
 
Better Quality, Little Notice
 Now the doctors at LDS say they believe the health-care plans being debated in Washington, all fervently searching for ways to reduce costs, ought to include programs like theirs.
The Clinton plan and most of the others include a host of provisions intended to promote quality; White House officials say they admire the LDS approach, although the Administration plan provides no money or explicit encouragement for similar programs.
Still, a growing body of experts, including some White House officials, are wondering why quality management programs, like the one at LDS, do not have higher visibility in the national health-care debate.
"I'm mightily puzzled by that," says Dr. Arnold Epstein, a senior White House health-care adviser.
 
Reducing Costs
 Representative Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who has followed this issue for more than a decade, said efforts like the one at LDS Hospital should be part of a health plan. "We think good quality programs will actually reduce costs," he said.
Craig Anderson, a health care economist at the accounting firm of Ernst & Young, said: "In our studies, it's very typical that active quality management can save 40 percent of the overall costs -- or greater. These kinds of numbers have been documented time and time again." Mr. Anderson's estimate also includes savings achieved by eliminating inefficient or redundant tests and procedures.
 
Computer in Every Room
 LDS, which was once called Latter-day Saints Hospital, is the flagship of the Intermountain Health Care chain, which has 24 hospitals in Utah. By the mid-1980's this 520-bed hospital had installed a computer in every room, replacing paper charts. So everything a doctor did was put into the database as it happened. With that, the medical staff started tracking trends in patient care.
First they examined post-operative wound infections. Every patient who undergoes surgery faces a small risk that his wound will become infected. On average nationwide, this occurs between 2 percent and 4 percent of the time. When it does, the patient must, at the least, remain hospitalized longer than expected. In a few cases, the patient dies.
And in every instance, the additional care costs money -- $9,000 per case on average, LDS Hospital found. The Government estimates that this problem adds about $4.5 billion to the nation's annual health care bill.
Years ago, hospitals found that patients put on antibiotics a few hours before the surgery began were less likely to develop an infection later. For their study, the LDS doctors examined the surgical records of 2,847 patients, and what they found surprised them. Surgeons were administering the antibiotic almost at random. Some started it as much as 24 hours before the surgery, some as much as 24 hours after.
 
Improvements Show Quickly
 But by comparing the timing with the results, the doctors found that patients who were put on antibiotics in the two hours before the surgery had a far smaller rate of infection.
The doctors told the rest of the staff about their findings, and over time all of them began administering the antibiotics at the correct time. Very quickly the frequency of infections began to fall -- from 1.8 percent in 1985 to 0.9 percent in 1986 to 0.4 percent in 1991. The number of deaths fell, too.
There were large financial implications as well. Given the cost of treating the infections, LDS hospital found that by 1991 this relatively minor change was saving about $500,000 a year.
Led by Dr. Brent James, who manages Intermountain's quality-control program, LDS doctors studied several other common, preventable problems and came up with similar results.
 
Too Good to Be True?
 The doctors "were flabbergasted," said Gregory Poulsen, the hospital chain's vice president for strategic planning. "There just hasn't been any good mechanism in American medicine to compare practice strategies before," he said.
LDS doctors started publishing journal articles about their work, and other hospitals began taking note: here was a way to cut costs and improve patient care all at once. Now Dr. James spends much of his time giving speeches and presentations to medical groups -- and, more recently, to government officials, including Representative Wyden, who eagerly embrace his preamble: "When quality goes up, costs go down."
It sounded almost too good to be true. And in one respect, it was.
At an informal hearing Mr. Wyden held at the Capitol in January, Dr. James gave his standard speech about the cost savings won from improving the quality of care. He also described the philosophical underpinnings of the LDS program.
The LDS computer system can track which surgeons are the best and which are the worst, and Dr. James found that each time they imposed a new quality-improvement program, the records of nearly all of the doctors improved. But computer analyses showed that for a handful, the records did not get better.
These are the incompetent doctors, and what does Dr. James do when he finds them? Generally very little.
"I have a few bad apples," he acknowledged. "And I know who they are. But for quality improvement to work, you have to construct a 'safe' environment where doctors trust you. Any time you start taking names, you're going to start a cycle of fear, and quality improvement will not occur."
 
The Discipline Question
 Around the hearing room, a few people shook their heads at that. Later, Mr. Wyden said: "If he knows who those people are, there's got to be a way at a minimum to bring in the state medical board," which is charged with disciplining bad doctors.
But the Utah medical board has never heard from Dr. James's program. During an interview in his office, David E. Robinson, the board's director, could barely control his anger as he heard of the LDS approach.
"As those words come out of their mouths," he said, speaking slowly as he leaned forward in his chair, "that's a terrible indictment of them and of the practice of medicine that they are willing to sacrifice patients to unnecessary mortality, morbidity, injury and pain by these doctors. It's unconscionable!"
There lies a conflict between the two broad fields of quality management. Dr. James says his larger efforts are more important than prosecuting a few malefactors. But Mr. Wyden says "that just doesn't pass the smell test."
This is a dilemma, he adds, that health reform will have to solve.

HEADLINE: Giuliani and City Union Chiefs Agree on a Plan to Reduce Jobs

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the municipal labor unions announced last night that they had reached an agreement on a package of severance offers that the Mayor hopes will cut 7,600 jobs from New York City's payroll without having to resort to layoffs.
The agreement was Mr. Giuliani's first success in his effort to reduce the size of the city's work force of 216,000 as he seeks to close a $2.3 billion gap in the next fiscal year's budget. 
 Under the program, the severance packages would be offered for three weeks beginning tomorrow to a pool of about 80,000 workers, excluding teachers, police officers, firefighters and other uniformed employees. The offers range from $3,500 or two weeks pay for newly hired workers, to $15,000 for workers with 30 or more years of service, as well as nine months of health care benefits for all who accept the package.
Appearing beside the leaders of the city's largest unions, the Mayor said the agreement recalled the cooperation of the 1970's, when the city and the unions, seeking to avert the city's impending bankruptcy, forged an alliance to lay off thousands of workers.
"The end result is that New York City has a program and an agreement here that really is an innovation," Mr. Giuliani said. The severance package, modeled on similar efforts in private industry, "is new and a much better way of achieving fiscal stability than even in the 1970's," he said.
The severance offer was the first test of the new Mayor's ability to bargain with the municipal unions, most of which supported his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, in last November's election. Wielding the threat of immediate layoffs, the Mayor got largely what he wanted from the unions on the severance package.
He appeared, however, to back away from another demand he made of the unions: that workers begin paying for some of their health benefits, a proposal that would save the city $200 million a year.
Stanley Hill, the executive director of the city's largest union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said that the agreement "was not easy" but that it was necessary to reach an agreement on severance "to avoid that tough word called layoffs."
"We know that the times are tough," Mr. Hill said as he stood beside the Mayor at District Council 37's headquarters on Barclay Street in lower Manhattan. "We understand that the times are tough."
The agreement still needs the approval of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, which controls a $200 million surplus that the Mayor hopes to use to pay for the severance packages. Mr. Giuliani expressed confidence that with a deal in hand, he would win the corporation's support.
In a statement last night, the corporation's chairman, Eugene J. Keilin, said that the board would make a decision after reviewing the details of the packages. "We are pleased that the city and the unions have reached agreement," he said.
In fact, the Mayor hopes to entice 9,500 workers off the city's payroll. Under the severance program, however, the Mayor assumes that the city will have to replace 1,900 of the workers who take the offer, for a net reduction in jobs of 7,600. The Mayor has said he will limit replacements to one in five in order to win the support of the Municipal Assistance Corporation to use its $200 million surplus.
The agreement, described by the Mayor's aides as the first severance package offered by a city, left a number of issues unresolved. Most notable among them was how successful the city would be in persuading workers to leave their jobs and the impact the reductions would have on the city's myriad services.
Raymond D. Horton, the head of the Citizen's Budget Commission, cautioned that the real question now would be whether enough workers would accept the severance offer.
"You'll have to have 7,600 different employees sit down and run this through their economic calculus and decide whether this is in their best interest," he said.
 
Long Session
 The agreement came after a negotiating session that began Tuesday morning and continued overnight, breaking for only a few hours around dawn. And it was reached, aides to the Mayor said, a day before Mr. Giuliani was prepared to order 10,000 layoffs immediately if the severance offer could not be put together.
The unions also agreed for the first time to a major demand that would allow the city to redeploy workers from agency to agency for a period of 15 months. Mr. Giuliani said that would minimize the impact on services since commissioners would have "maximum flexibility" in refilling newly vacant positions by shifting employees already on the payroll from other departments.
Appearing ebullient, the Mayor's chief of staff, Randy Mastro, described the agreement on redeployment as "a historic thing."
The severance program is a major part of the Mayor's preliminary plan to balance a $31.2 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. By cutting 7,600 jobs, it would save $250 million over the next 15 months and more each year thereafter.
Under the Mayor's plan, the severance program would eliminate roughly half of the 15,000 jobs Mr. Giuliani has said he wants to cut. The administration has said the rest of the proposed jobs cuts would come from attrition, as well as a proposal to slash 2,500 administrative jobs at the Board of Education, something the Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, still has not agreed to do.
Sitting down with the unions for the first time a month ago, the Mayor initially offered to pay $5,000 to $10,000 to each worker, as well as health benefits for up to a year and the value of unused sick leave and vacation. The unions countered with an offer that gave more to workers with more experience, starting at $3,500 for workers with less than 10 years of experience and rising to $25,000 or a year's pay for workers with a least 26 years on the job.
 
A Compromise
 The packages announced yesterday amounted to a compromise, providing a scale of cash payments and health benefits for nine months. All workers would still collect unused sick leave or vacation days and be eligible for unemployment insurance.
The Mayor's Commissioner of Labor, Randy Levine, who lead the Mayor's negotiating team, called the deal "a real, negotiated collective-bargaining settlement."
From the start, however, the unions appeared to have little room to negotiate. They could either accept severance and some cash for workers who had to leave or they could challenge the Mayor's threat to move to layoffs.
Arthur Cheliotes, the head of Local 1180 of the Communication Workers of America, described his sensation during the negotiation as "feeling like I was Dr. Kevorkian."
"The pain is there," said Mr. Cheliotes, whose union represents administrative employees. "How do we deal with it? This is what we had to do under the circumstances."
The unions did appear to win some room to negotiate on the Mayor's demand that employees pay 10 percent of their health premiums for individuals or 20 percent for families.
That concession did not come up at the news conference announcing the agreement until the Mayor was asked specifically if it remained a demand, along with another proposal to save another $200 million by temporarily reducing the city's contributions to workers' pension funds.
Mr. Giuliani said that he would continue to negotiate those proposals, which are also important to his budget. He suggested that the unions had offered alternatives that could produce the same savings.
"And we're more than willing to talk about them," the Mayor said.

HEADLINE: Chief of Staff To Salinas Resigns Post

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 30

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's powerful chief of staff resigned his post suddenly tonight. The official, Jose Cordoba Montoya, was an architect of Mr. Salinas's economic reform policies and a political mentor to the governing party's new presidential candidate.
The departure of Mr. Cordoba, was seen by some Government officials as part of the price that Mr. Salinas will be made to pay for forcing his choice of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as the new candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party over the objections of many party leaders. 
 The resignation was announced only hours after Mr. Zedillo was subjected to a political shakedown by the party's labor-union affiliate, whose leaders all but demanded that they be given control over scores of congressional seats in return for supporting the new candidate.
"They are starting to deliver the bill, and it is going to be a big one," one official said, referring to leaders of the party's old guard who had challenged Mr. Salinas's selection of Mr. Zedillo.
 
No Official Explanation
 The Government offered no official explanation for Mr. Cordoba's resignation. In a two-sentence statement released tonight, the Secretariat of Finance said that its minister, Pedro Aspe, a sometimes bitter rival of Mr. Cordoba, had named him to be Mexico's new representative to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington.
Mr. Cordoba, 43, had long been a lightning rod for criticism of the Salinas administration by the political opposition and bitter attacks within the Government. Leaders of the governing party said they opposed Mr. Zedillo's nomination in part because they feared that as one of Mr. Cordoba's political disciples, the former budget and education minister would, if elected, ensure the chief of staff's continued power.
Discreet to the point of seeming mysterious, Mr. Cordoba acted as Mr. Salinas's gatekeeper and closest advisor. He coordinated meetings of senior economic and national-security officials and was the envoy who the President sent on his most sensitive international missions. He was both a leading proponent and a high-level negotiator for Mexico's new economic partnership with the United States and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In a political system in which the executive dominates all other branches of Government and Mr. Salinas built himself into the country's most powerful President in years, Mr. Cordoba was viewed as the power behind the throne.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Press North Korea Over A-Sites

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 30

 BODY:
The United States has decided to press for a United Nations resolution demanding that North Korea open up its nuclear sites to international monitors despite objections from China, American officials said today.
But following deliberations at the United Nations this evening, American officials said that China was continuing to voice strong opposition to a Security Council resolution warning North Korea to comply or face possible economic sanctions. 
 "The possibility of a vote is more remote now," said Jean-Bernard Merimee, the French Ambassador to the United Nations, who is serving as the President of the Council this month.
China's objections have continued despite an effort by Washington to mollify Beijing by softening the language in the proposed measure that refers to a deadline for North Korean compliance, officials said.
Washington and Beijing have been at odds over what diplomatic action to take since North Korea blocked monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency from completing their inspections of its nuclear sites earlier this month.
 
China's Main Complaints
 After the United States proposed a resolution warning North Korea to comply or face possible sanctions, China, which has the power to veto Council measures, objected.
A senior Clinton Administration official said that the Chinese have two main complaints. One is that they object to the language in the resolution drafted by the United States saying that the Council will consider further action if North Korea does not relent on the issue of inspections. That is an indirect reference to economic sanctions.
The second objection centers on the need for a Security Council resolution. China prefers a weaker measure: a statement issued by the Council President urging North Korea to allow the inspections.
Although Chinese diplomats did not specifically threaten to veto a resolution in tonight's deliberations, the strength of their objection left the fate of the measure unclear. "They made it clear they cannot accept a resolution," an Administration official said. "They do not specifically say what they are going to do."
 
U.S. Surprised by Response
 The vigor of China's response this evening caught the Clinton Administration and its allies by surprise. Earlier today, American and French diplomats said that their plan was to seek a Council vote on Thursday. Beijing, they said, would abstain when the measure was put to a vote.
"I think it's highly unlikely the Chinese would veto a resolution of the kind that we are working on right now," Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo of South Korea told reporters this morning after meeting at the State Department with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "At a minimum I think they will abstain," he added.
United States officials noted the original draft of the resolution had been modified to make it less objectionable to Beijing.
The original draft of the resolution asked Hans Blix, the Director General of the atomic energy agency, to report to the Council within one month of the adoption of the resolution. This would set the stage for consideration of economic sanctions if the North Koreans failed to comply with the inspections.
But after the Chinese complained that the measure could be interpreted as an ultimatum, United States diplomats rewrote the measure.
 
No Specific Deadline Set
 As rewritten, the measure does not set a specific deadline for Mr. Blix to report to the Council on North Korea's compliance with international controls on its nuclear program. Rather, it asks the agency head to address the question of North Korea's compliance during his next scheduled report to the Council. That report is to be made after the agency's next regular inspection of North Korean sites, which is planned for early May. Administration officials say the change in language is more a matter of tone than of substance.
A senior Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said earlier today that while Washington strongly favors a resolution, it may accept a statement, which would have the virtue of being unanimous, if China agrees to toughen the language in the measure. But China is unlikely to agree to a statement that makes an allusion to sanctions.
The Administration has informed the North Korean mission in New York that it is still willing to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang and to suspend its military exercises with South Korea if the North will meet two conditions: allow the inspections to proceed and exchange envoys with South Korea.

HEADLINE: Sharp Increase Along the Borders of Poverty

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Mar. 30

 BODY:
The Census Bureau provided new evidence today of one of the most troubling trends in the American economy: a sharp increase in the percentage of people who work full-time but cannot by themselves lift a family out of poverty.
The percentage of all Americans working full time but earning less than the poverty level for a family of four, about $13,000 a year, has risen by 50 percent in the past 13 years, the study said. 
 The likelihood of working full time but earning little was greater for every group the Bureau measured: male and female; black, white and Hispanic; young and old, and college-educated and high school dropout.
But the trend toward low wages was particularly sharp for young workers and for those without college degrees. The increase in young people working full time but earning less than $13,000 a year prompted the Bureau to use a word it usually avoids in its reams of dry tables. It called the development astounding.
Outside analysts agreed.
 
Striking Statistics
 "These numbers are quite striking," said Rebecca Blank, an economist at Northwestern University who studies income inequality. "They underline how much worse off the low-skilled worker has become."
In 1992, 18 percent of the nation's full-time workers earned less than $13,091, compared with 12 percent in 1979. The numbers are expressed in 1992 dollars, adjusted for inflation.
An annual income of $13,091 means an hourly wage of about $6.50. The percentage of full-time workers age 18 to 24 with such wages has more than doubled, to 47 percent in 1992, compared with 23 percent in 1979.
The Census Bureau arrived at the benchmark of $13,091 by modifying the official poverty level for a family of four, which is $14,228. The modification comes from using a different formula for adjusting inflation.
 
Two-Wage Families
 Many low-wage workers may not be poor, since they may live in households where a second worker raises the family income. But the bureau's calculation is a rough gauge of a single worker's ability to lift a family of four out of poverty.
The earnings of young workers are considered significant since they may influence a variety of later decisions, including whether to marry, have children or continue to work.
Economists readily admit that they do not understand all the reasons that wages are collapsing for workers with few skills. But they speculate that the trend may be contributing to any number of social ills, like the record rates of welfare dependency, out-of-wedlock birth, child poverty and general social disaffection.
The wage erosion clearly complicates one of the Clinton Administration's main domestic goals, to help welfare recipients become self-supporting within two years. The wage erosions cuts against a two-part principle President Clinton has stressed: that people should work and that the work should pay.
Part of the wage erosion has been offset by the growth in the earned-income tax credit, an annual payment up to $3,370 the Government gives to low-wage workers to make their labor more rewarding. The study did not account for the tax credits or estimate the difference they may have made.
 
Several Causes Cited
 Economists say several causes lie behind the trend, but they disagree sharply about the emphasis each should receive. The decline of manufacturing jobs seems to play a role, as does the the globalization of the world economy. For instance, a company can move its assembly plant to Thailand, rather than raise wages here.
The decline of unionization may play a part, by removing a pressure to keep wages up. And so may the decline in the value of the minimum wage, which eroded by about 23 percent, from 1979 to 1992, when adjusted for inflation.
Marvin Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, argues that the cost of benefits like health insurance may also be relevant. With companies paying more and more for health insurance, for instance, they may have less money left over for wages.
But even Mr. Kosters, who has been less alarmed over income inequality than some of his colleagues, was surprised at variety of subgroups affected by wage erosion. "It's really quite amazing," he said.
In 1992, 14 percent of the men working full time earned less than $13,091. That was up from 8 percent in 1979. For women, the figure rose to 24 percent, from 20 percent in 1979.
For men without high school degrees, the figure rose to 32 percent, from 15 percent in 1979. But it also rose for men with bachelor's degrees or more to 6 percent, from 3 percent in 1979.
Hispanic men and women were more likely than blacks or whites to be working full time for low wages, perhaps because of immigrants settling for unattractive work.

HEADLINE: Democracy Postponed

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico had to wage a tough struggle to impose his choice of Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as his party's new presidential candidate. For Americans as for Mexicans, Mr. Salinas's victory is a mixed blessing.
On the positive side, Mr. Zedillo, an economist, is committed to the economic reform policies of the past six years. The "dinosaurs" of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, opposed his candidacy and wanted to return to the patronage and protectionism of the past. 
 But by selecting -- once again, behind closed doors -- a narrow technocrat without any obvious political skills, Mr. Salinas has bet that economic changes can simply be imposed from on high and that the democratization of Mexican political life can be indefinitely postponed. That is an odd bet given the depth of Mexico's current political crisis. It could imperil the very economic changes Mr. Salinas seeks to entrench.
Traditionally, it has been the prerogative of a Mexican president to choose his successor. But this has been an untraditional year. In January, Indian rebels in Chiapas took up arms to press grievances related to the PRI's monopoly on local politics. Broad national sympathy for the rebel cause revealed that many Mexicans shared similar frustrations with a closed political system.
Then came last week's assassination of the original PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Mur rieta. The motives behind the murder are still unclear. But it left a void. Though a supporter of Mr. Salinas's economic policies, Mr. Colosio was no technocrat. His political skills gave promise of bridging the gap between bright but remote reformers and a population worried about potential threats to jobs, wages and farms.
Mr. Zedillo's career displays no such promise. As Budget Secretary, Education Secretary and most recently Mr. Colosio's campaign manager, he acquired a reputation for stiffness and arrogance.
Even in this chaotic political year, Mr. Zedillo's status as PRI candidate virtually assures his victory in the August election. No PRI presidential candidate has lost since the party was founded in 1929. The best hope now is that Mr. Zedillo will use the campaign to hone his political skills. The most important challenge for Mexico's next president is to respond to the fear of economic change by giving ordinary Mexicans a stake in their political system.

HEADLINE: Latvians Resent Russian Troops Who Stay On

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Russia and Latvians Agree on Troop Pullout Deadline" (news article, March 17) illuminates how vestiges of Soviet imperialism influence ethnic relations in the region. Latvia accepts ethnic pluralism for its historical minorities and is struggling to find an equitable solution to the status of hundreds of thousands of economic settlers brought in under Soviet rule. 
 But it is another thing altogether to have Russia push for the legalization of the status of former Soviet military personnel as additional "minority" members. Paradoxically, Russia has had some success.
As you report, Latvian negotiators have buckled under Russian pressure and have agreed that military pensioners of the former Soviet forces in Latvia will be allowed to stay, privatize their apartments and eventually claim citizenship. Miraculously, people experienced as occupiers by local inhabitants are transformed into compatriots, wealthy ones at that.
This concession to Russian demands undermines ethnic conflict resolution because most Latvians perceive it as deeply unjust. It is dangerous to obfuscate truly ethnic issues with issues of Soviet and Russian expansionism. For years, the international community has demanded that Russia (and before that the Soviet Union) unconditionally withdraw its troops from the Baltic states.
By linking troop withdrawal to demands about the status of demobilized soldiers, Russia reinforces the notion that Soviet-era settlers represent a Russian fifth column, rather than a minority to be integrated into the community of Latvia. It is international practice for states to extend citizenship rights based on loyalty to their constitution, not because a neighboring state demands it.
Who is or is not given access to privatized apartments is another sensitive issue. During the Soviet era, access to state-owned apartments was one of the most sought after privileges bestowed by the Communist elite. In Latvia housing was assigned preferentially to former Soviet military and other new arrivals.
Many Latvian families have never had the luxury of their own apartment and now battle the economic hardships of post-Communist transition. If the privatization of apartments perpetuates the privileges of old elites, this will reinforce popular bitterness about the persistence of ethnic and political injustice.
Having recently returned from a trip to Latvia, I can say that the current "deal" with Russia is highly controversial and may fail to be ratified by Parliament. Even more so because Estonia has repudiated similar linkage between troop withdrawal and demands about privileges for retired Russian military officers wishing to avoid repatriation. If Estonia is coerced to sign, ethnopolitical strain will increase.

Death by Privatization

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Specialists are bewildered by the more than 30 percent rise in the Russian death rate and the 25 percent fall in the birth rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union two years ago. 
 But since President Boris N. Yeltsin's "market reforms" sent Russia lurching toward capitalism, real wages have fallen by 50 percent, health care spending has been slashed, and public services have been all but eliminated.
Production of such vital necessities as shoes and coats has been nearly halted by "privatized" corporations. Most Russians no longer have enough income for even the barest essentials. Without decent medical care, food, clothing and housing, people actually die. Amazing, isn't it?
Experts blame the Soviet system for this catastrophe. Yet in 1987, before Mikhail S. Gorbachev started market reforms, the Russian birth rate was 17 per 1,000 and the Russian death rate 10 per 1,000, almost the same as in the United States.
It was only after the abandonment of central planning, and especially after the end of price controls in 1992 and after the sweeping privatizations of industry, housing and services that followed, that the death rate took off and the birth rate shriveled.
No one denies the massive failings of the Soviet system, which left a bureaucratic caste in dictatorial control of society.
Yet by the basic measure of survival, today's policies of privatization, the free market and capitalism are far worse.
A million or more Russians have died who would otherwise have lived, thanks to the "market reforms" so admired by Western leaders.
Let's hope that when people advocate the virtues of privatization and the free market in the West, we look at what these policies are doing to Russia. And let's hope that the long-suffering Russian workers soon rid themselves of the bureaucrat-capitalists and save themselves from extinction.

You'll Always Walk Alone

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
To any American who was around in the 1950's, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d were as corny as Kansas in August -- and as much a part of the decade's oppressively sunny landscape as Ike, backyard barbecues and Ozzie and Harriet.
This begins to explain why a jaded, middle-aged crowd was so startled to find itself weeping at the opening night of "Carousel" last week. The audience came to Lincoln Center for a sentimental nostalgia trip back to that idyllic America of cockeyed optimism. Instead they found themselves abandoned in a dark alley. 
 Sure, the lovers still sing "If I Loved You." But the evening begins with the grim apparition of a turn-of-the-century New England mill where young women toil in sweatshop misery. Only when a whistle shrieks at closing time does the hurdy-gurdy Rodgers waltz swell, sending the laborers twirling through the factory gates for a pathetically brief escape to a gaudy fairground.
Once there, the heroine, Julie Jordan, hooks up with Billy Bigelow, a carousel barker who drifts into unemployment, alcoholism, wife-beating, armed robbery and suicide. Their Maine town is ruled by a mean class system in which even the police and God conspire with the mill owner against the working poor.
"Carousel" sounds more like "Town Without Pity" than a piece by the authors of "The Sound of Music" and "The King and I." But not only did Rodgers and Hammerstein write it, they did so when they had no reason to be gloomy. "Carousel" made its debut on the heady eve of V-E Day. It was the team's follow-up to "Oklahoma!," the most beloved and lucrative musical Broadway had ever seen.
Liberated by success to say whatever they pleased, Rodgers and Hammerstein chose to depict an America haunted by inequities and suffering. Though an extraordinary British director, Nicholas Hytner, has made some slight embellishments at Lincoln Center, the darkness he mines in "Carousel" is all in the original text.
But until now that true "Carousel" had been suppressed. It disappeared in the 50's, when Hollywood and a thousand stock productions bowdlerized the show to fit the treacly conformist culture of a decade whose rigid dogma was sexless suburban family bliss.
Confronting the unexpurgated "Carousel" in 1994, we can see clearly that it tells the truth about its era rather than preaching the expected R & H-positive homilies. There were plenty of Billy Bigelows and women loyal to them, as well as a 25 percent poverty rate, by the prosperous 50's. But Americans were expected to keep whistling happy tunes. Wife-battering was barely acknowledged, and the country's rising intake of alcohol and tranquilizers took place behind closed ranch-house doors.
Today debunking the happy postwar years is an academic industry. But art speaks more powerfully than sociology. While the Lincoln Center "Carousel" unfolds in beautiful sets that nominally fit the picturesque Rodgers and Hammerstein mold, its New England is not quaint but lonely, more Edward Hopper than Norman Rockwell. The lovers, "two little people" who "don't count at all," in Billy's bitter words, are a hot pair, but they grope desperately for each other against a vast moonlit night that only emphasizes their lowly status in an indifferent universe.
From that moment "Carousel" becomes disturbing because it starts to seem timeless. As Billy has an afterlife, so does the America with which Rodgers and Hammerstein surrounded him.
Everyone in "Carousel" looks familiar, not just from the 50's but from around the corner. Even the show's proper, upwardly mobile Mr. and Mrs. Snow could be that couple whose boisterous summer cookouts don't quite dispel the stink of booze and the muffled sounds of marital brawls.
At Lincoln Center, the audience begins sobbing as soon as it hears "You'll Never Walk Alone," but is that because anyone takes the anthem's words literally? Everything about this musical says that we are alone. The audience crying at "Carousel" realizes that it is up to us to break this country's unending cycles of social injustice and domestic violence. And that not even Rodgers and Hammerstein, the soothing parental figures we had always depended on, can bail us out.

LOST at Sea

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
LOST is a loser, but the U.S. is getting ready to sign on.
The Law of the Sea Treaty -- its apt acronym LOST -- has been ratified by 60 nations and will come into force on Nov. 16 of this year. The big question -- one that will affect global business on and under the sea for generations -- is whether the U.S. will subscribe to what third-world leaders and international bureaucrats hail as "the constitution of the oceans." 
 I have long argued we should not. Although many of the treaty's navigational and fishing provisions are unobjectionable, the core of the new international law is a collectivist cartel that conflicts with our national interests and betrays the spirit of capitalism.
Back in the 70's, as the have-not nations were touting a "new world economic order" to redistribute the world's wealth, Carterites and some liberal Republicans enlisted in the cause to declare the resources of the sea bottom "the common heritage of mankind." (That was before we became "humankind.")
Their essential idea was that entrepreneurs of the industrial nations would mine the seas for mineral wealth, just as explorers and discoverers did for centuries, but with this difference: Most of the product of free enterprise would be turned over to a Socialist "Enterprise," a vast new U.N. bureaucracy that would both regulate and compete with the miners of the sea.
The philosophy was wrong. John Locke, on whose writings Thomas Jefferson drew, held that when a person mixed his labor with a material resource, the person acquired a property right in that resource. That provided a profit motive, the incentive to explore and develop that created fortunes and built industrial democracies.
But under the Marxian collectivist philosophy expressed in the Law of the Sea, the ocean resources belonged not to the ones who found it, but to the United Nations. An OPEC-style cartel would graciously allow the developers to keep a part of their stake, but would demand they share their technology and would determine production and prices.
To its eternal credit, the Reagan Administration saw this basic conflict of ideology and said to LOST negotiators: Nothing doing.
Reagan's principled rejection, as Doug Bandow's recent Cato Institute study points out, caused great gnashing of teeth among diplomats at the U.N. and politicians in scores of third-world countries who had been counting on lifetime sinecures with perks in the LOST "Enterprise," to be based in sunny Jamaica.
Despite the drop in mineral prices that discouraged expensive seabed exploration, and blind to worldwide loss of interest in Socialist economics, bureaucrats pressed ahead.
Enter the Clinton Administration with its multinationalism and multiculturalism and multimultiism. Thanks to the U.N. representative, Madeleine Albright, and gnomes in the State Department who never met a global treaty they didn't like, LOST was found. Their technique was to dress up the pact with market rhetoric, drop the requirement to share technology with the third world, and slightly modify other egregious offenses to free enterprise.
Something happens to diplomats who get involved in a diplomatic "process": The deal becomes the goal. Their measure of success is a flock of signatures on a document at a televised ceremony with souvenir pens handed out all around.
When the Clinton State Department is asked about the status of LOST, the answer is: "Hasn't made it up to the seventh floor yet." Secretary Warren Christopher has his hands full with a threat from a bellicose North Korea, and cannot focus on convoluted philosophical disputes.
What will happen? When LOST gets up to foggy bottom's seventh floor, Christopher will lawyer it a little, make sure the U.S. has a veto, get some Pentagon admiral to praise its unnecessary legitimization of Straits of Gibraltar passage, and have President Clinton sign it as a symbol of the brave new multinational world.
Then the Senate will decline to ratify LOST because its central provision is anti-free-enterprise. Is such a display of disunion in the President's interest? Or in America's?
No. The time to drop the vast boondoggle of LOST is now.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner 

 BODY:
WHEN Dr. Richard M. Lerner was 15, he told his parents that he couldn't live with them anymore. He moved in with his grandmother, who lived in another neighborhood in Brooklyn. The adults stayed in close touch. Three weeks later, tired of the long commute to his high school and in need of fresh clothes, he returned home.
"It was the break I needed at the time," said Dr. Lerner, now an expert on adolescent development and the director of the Institute for Children, Youth and Families at Michigan State University in East Lansing. 
 In retrospect, he sees that experience, as well as the other times he spent away from his parents, as important steps toward maturity. A few years ago, he was on the other end of a similar situation when his wife's 14-year-old niece lived with them for several weeks to see what life was like outside her home in New Jersey.
It's common for adolescents to look for ways to explore who they are and to see how they fit into the world. The timing may reflect biological changes in their brains, for they are now able to think differently from the way they did a year or two earlier.
Now, they can more readily imagine new solutions to problems or different approaches to situations. Their world is no longer black and white, but a complex mosaic of grays. An explosion in the possibilities they can envision for their lives calls them to re-examine their sense of identity and who they might become. They can, often for the first time, picture themselves as independent from their parents.
For many, spending time away from their immediate families is a normal and appropriate way of testing their new ways of thinking and of forming relationships. These children are very different from runaways, whose dramatic actions often point to serious underlying emotional problems for them or for their family.
"You have to ask whether the adolescent is leaving because he's running away from issues such as dealing with authority," said Dr. Peter L. Sheras, a clinical psychologist and an associate professor of education at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, who studies parent-adolescent relations. "Or is it a mature decision to move out because he needs a different environment at that moment to grow emotionally?"
These excursions are psychological as well as physical, whether they take place in a structured summer program or through an informal stay with a relative or a friend's parents. They allow the teen-ager to shed the mantle of the past and to try on new roles and styles of relationships.
"When I was growing up, I wanted to spend every summer with my grandmother in her summer home in upstate New York," Dr. Lerner recalled. "It allowed me to be a different person than I was with my parents. She was willing to let me try things, like staying out late, that I couldn't do in Brooklyn."
Although today's families assume it to be normal, the idea of children living with their parents until they are 18 is quite new. As recently as a century ago, when few teen-agers attended high school, adolescents from all social classes were routinely placed with family members or even strangers when they reached puberty. Earlier generations did it at even younger ages.
"In the 17th century, children were often sent to live in other people's homes when they were about 10 or 11," said Dr. Joseph F. Kett, a professor of history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who has studied the history of adolescence in America.
In those days, the reasons for leaving one's parents were more likely to be economic than psychological. For most families, adolescence was a time for work. Even those teen-agers who went to school usually lived far from home.
Having an adolescent live elsewhere, at least temporarily, can also be beneficial to other family members, especially if there is conflict at home.
Dr. Sheras described a 16-year-old who couldn't get along with her father and stepmother. The girl arranged to move in with another relative.
"This was a healthy decision on her part," Dr. Sheras said. "Her self-esteem has gone up. She isn't arguing as much with her father and stepmother. And she's developed a more mature relationship with her younger half-siblings."
 
Listen Before Letting Them Leap
 BEFORE responding to a teen-ager's request to spend some time living away from home, parents should keep several things in mind. "Don't overreact," said Dr. Peter L. Sheras, an associate professor of education at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. "Listen to your child before you speak."
Your goals are to understand the reasons behind your child's request and to find safe and appropriate ways of meeting his needs. Here are some specifics:
Remember that children at different stages of adolescence have different emotional needs.
Sometimes those needs can be met without the child's spending time away from home. "Twelve and 13-year-olds are usually struggling with issues of control over their own lives," said Dr. Alan S. Waterman, a professor of psychology at Trenton State College, who studies how adolescents develop their identities. These younger adolescents are often more interested in being able to make decisions about their lives and less concerned with what those decisions are.
"Sixteen to 18-year-olds are more interested in the types of decisions they're allowed to make," Dr. Waterman continued. "They're concerned about their future, not just rebelling against their parents."
Help them plan their time away from home.
This gives them the message that you have faith in their maturity -- something most adolescents are desperate to hear. Explore alternatives, like spending some time with a relative or taking part in a supervised summer work project. Discuss other options, like spending several weekends away instead of the same number of days in a row.
Be in close touch with the people your children will stay with. Explain any special concerns you may have.
If the stay is for more than a few days, agree on ways to communicate regularly with both the adults and your children.
Let go.
Remember that the more resistant you are to your children's emotional growth, the more of a struggle it will become.
"Some parents have a very difficult time giving young adolescents enough opportunities to make their own decisions," Dr. Waterman said. "Being too restrictive can actually provoke rebellion."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Business Digest on Thursday and a front-page contents listing about the stock market's activity misstated the severity of the 63.33-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday. It was the worst since Feb. 4, when the index lost 96.24 points; it was not the worst decline of the year.
