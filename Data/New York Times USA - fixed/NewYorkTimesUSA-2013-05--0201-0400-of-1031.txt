HEADLINE: Seeking Visibility for China's Art

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: China is a major art market, but some artists and curators feel it is underrepresented in the world&#8217;s major museums and galleries. 

 BODY:
BEIJING - China's art market, though its growth slowed significantly last year, is an established part of the art world, ranking second in size behind the U.S. market in 2012 and ahead of Britain's, according to a recent report. 
In fact, Chinese collectors - scouring the world for deals, or "panning for gold," as The Art Newspaper's new Chinese edition put it - have become a common sight (or, often, voice at the end of the telephone) at auctions around the world, even in small towns in Europe. 
"Whether in New York or Hong Kong, everywhere you can see Chinese buyers 'hearing the wind and reacting,' " The Art Newspaper wrote, using a Chinese saying that means moving fast. 
But as private buyers build collections, the art publication posed pressing questions: In artistic terms, is China a creator of value in this process, or mostly a receiver of value? And how can Chinese art become more visible around the world, getting into more museums and private galleries?
The Art Newspaper is a leading voice in global art; here's what Thomas Shao, chief executive of Modern Media Group, the Chinese partner in the Chinese version of the publication that launched its first edition in March, had to say: "The Chinese are now curious about the world of art beyond their frontiers, so it is vitally important to launch a professional art newspaper that provides timely and accurate news about the global art scene." (The comments are on the newspaper's Web site.)
The launch came as the spring auction season was about to begin here. China Guardian Auctions, a major player, starts previews in Beijing tomorrow and sales begin on Friday. Its Hong Kong auctions took place last weekend, netting nearly $38 million, it said. 
Here's how The Art Newspaper formulated the question in its second Chinese edition, in April: "Can Chinese Art Make the World Look?" 
Specifically, many artists and curators feel art from here is underrepresented in museum collections around the world, and in major galleries. 
Part of that may be its newness. China is an important market, but it's a developing one, subject to considerable fluctuation, based on last year's figures. 
In 2012, China's art market dropped hard, year on year, by 24 percent, to (EURO)10.6 billion (nearly $14 billion), according to figures compiled by Clare McAndrew in a report of The European Fine Art Fair based in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
The market in the U.S., by comparison, recovered by 5 percent, year on year, to over $19 billion.
"Slowing economic growth and continuing uncertainty in the global economy filtered down to the art market in 2012 with global sales contracting by 7 percent to (EURO)43.0 billion," the report said. "A key factor in the decline was a slowdown in the Chinese market." 
Still, the Chinese market made up 25 percent of global sales, which totaled more than $56 billion, said Ms. McAndrew in the report.
Beyond such figures, how can China secure the intangible, cultural value and visibility that it craves?
The Art Newspaper's Chinese edition, in a cover story, cited an art academic, Zhao Li of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, as saying that China lacks a domestic culture of passing art down from generation to generation, so when the realization dawns that something has value, collectors can only turn to the market and "go shopping."
The article didn't delve into the reasons for that tendency but a host of political and sociological factors play a role here, including the deep artistic losses after the 1949 Chinese revolution as the Communist Party sought to largely eliminate traditional culture and control contemporary cultural development. China's art scene only began to bloom again in the 1980s after the end of the Cultural Revolution, and is still subject to censorship as well as creativity issues tied to the political and educational system.
"How do artists see the issue of Chinese art getting on to the horizon of world art?" the article asked. The solutions seem to lie in growing the infrastructure at home and focusing on quality, it suggested.
"In the beginning when art went overseas, Chinese artists had political and ideological labels stuck on them by curators but the individual's learning and technique was not heavily considered," said Zeng Fanzhi, an artist, in the article. 
"As the years passed, these artists sorted out their individual careers, but there was no corresponding industry here in China. What China most needs today is still museum-level, high quality, serious, good exhibitions, to sort out and explore the atmosphere surrounding artistic worth and learning," he said.
The artist Wang Jianwei told the newspaper that art was a mirror of social capability. What is most lacking today is knowledge about art and respect for creativity, he said.
"The art market is developing and we have a market that's the richest in purchasing power, but we're still very far from creativity itself," he said.

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Adam Davidson on Dueling Economists

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week&#8217;s cover article answers questions on why Larry Summers and Glen Hubbard have such different views &#8212; despite their similar training. 

 BODY:
 Adam Davidson, who writes the magazine's It's the Economy column, is the author of this week's cover article about the economists Larry Summers and Glenn Hubbard. Davidson is a founder of NPR's Planet Money, a podcast and blog. His last cover article was about the area between Washington and New York along the Amtrak line. 
 What surprised you most in reporting on the two leading economic thinkers for the two political parties? That the two agreed to the proposition? 
I think the most striking surprise was the passion that Larry Summers raises in people, positive and negative.
His friends were incredibly effusive. Tim Geithner, Sheryl Sandberg, Bob Rubin and countless younger folks - staff members at the White House, graduate students at Harvard - told me he had been a generous, loyal mentor. Several people told me they love him. At least 20 people told me things like this. I haven't heard that kind of praise for anybody in a long time, and it was, frankly, out of keeping with the picture I had of Summers as, well, a jerk. And his friends did say he could be tough, that he demanded a high level of intellectual rigor in policy discussions. But they described a very different side, someone who was there for them at pivotal moments.
On the other hand, I heard such angry denouncements of him from some people on the left. One economist told me I shouldn't talk to him at all. He would poison my brain. Another academic told me that Summers should be barred from any role in public policy.
Glenn Hubbard, for his part, seemed to generate the same response from everyone who knows him: He's a nice guy. Some people see him as a real mentor, but didn't talk about him with the level of passion that Summers's folks did. Others disagree with him but still said they like him.

 You write that you have had a fantasy of presiding over a grand bargain by the two sides. I think many people have a fantasy instead of strangling the opposite side. How do these two feel about political polarization? 
We were making a strong choice by using these two guys as a vehicle for exploring the economic divide. I could have found two moderate economists who don't play a role in politics and, probably, have had a much easier time getting consensus. Summers and Hubbard are smart economists, and they are also savvy political figures. So when they debated in person and when they talked to me one on one, each seemed intensely aware of how his words could play in the political sphere. As a result, they had little interest in actually resolving political issues, since any solution they came up with would, immediately, be used to pressure their political allies.
I think these two men - probably more than any other economists of their generation - think of their roles both as truth-seeking academics and changing the world through the messy business of politics. Which is to say, they play a role in fighting for and against the polarization that drives us all nuts.
 What was the social dynamic at the meeting? 
Certainly polite and certainly not warm, I would say. They've known each other for decades and have spent much of their lives sitting in rooms not agreeing with other very smart people. They're pros at disagreeing. That's what I felt. It's really impressive watching two practiced minds go at it so openly. There wasn't much anger that I picked up on. It was, for the most part, workmanlike, straightforward and intellectually aggressive.
 You highlight the similar training that both Summers and Hubbard received and the fact that they are often analyzing the same data. Does it seem that both of their (very different) analyses are academically defensible? 
They are certainly academically defensible. They've both written many papers that have been academically defended through the peer-review process and are used as references in lots of subsequent papers. I believe Summers is one of the most highly cited economists alive and, I think, Hubbard is, as well, in the field of tax policy.
This has been a mini-obsession of mine for a long time: how can economists think such different things? I think partly it's the questions different economists ask. And partly it's the nature of economics. They can't run randomized trials or repeat studies. You can't do the Great Depression 20 different times to test different government policies. All you can do is look at the complicated mix of human behavior and try to piece out a story.
Unlike physics, economists don't settle things. There seems to be plenty of room for different conclusions that are still accepted in the academy.
 Some readers have suggested that the answer to the question posed by the article - which economist has better ideas - is "neither." Does it seem likely that any other star economists from the left or the right could take either of their places? 
We are not defining Hubbard and Summers as the only two intellectually defensible options. We're not saying the truth lies in either one's story. We are saying - and I think it's demonstrably true - that they roughly define the politically realistic realm of policy outcomes.
I love talking to lots of economists with lots of provocative ideas. But we have a status-quo-biased system. Things don't change that quickly or radically. We're not going to a gold standard. We're not eliminating the Fed. We're not breaking up all the big banks, and we're not turning America into a European-style social democracy. However good or bad any of these ideas - and countless others proposed by other economists - none of them are going to happen.
I don't think that much change comes from economists. I think it comes more from political realities. Probably the two giants of the 20th century, who actually did shift government policy in the U.S. and around the world, were John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman. I don't see anybody in our system who is at that level of influence. Summers probably comes the closest.

HEADLINE: Small vs. Big, Local vs. Global

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The business community, once seemingly unified around a common set of economic and political priorities, is splitting apart, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
Small looks beautiful for business these days. Big companies rake in higher profits but win far less affection from most Americans. The business community is increasingly divided, largely because economic trends are driving a growing wedge between the interests of small locally owned companies and large global corporations. 
Scientific measures of public attitudes toward business are hard to come by. But a survey conducted in 2010 by the Pew Research Center for the People survey found that 71 percent of Americans believed small business was a positive influence on the way things are going in the country, far higher than the 25 percent who believed the same of large corporations. 
Indeed, small businesses enjoyed higher positive influence ratings than either churches and religious organizations (at 63 percent) or colleges and universities (at 61 percent), not to mention the federal government - which is tied with large corporations at 25 percent.
Small wonder that Republicans want to claim the small business mantle for their own. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Tea Party enthusiast, insists that calling Republicans the party of big business is the "biggest lie in politics."

But small business itself is obscured by many little lies. The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy focuses on independent businesses with fewer than 500 employees, but official definitions vary by industry. Industry lobbyists hoping to sink their teeth into the favorable loans and contracts targeted to small business create pressure to revise size limits upward. 
Large banks often categorize companies with annual revenue of under $20 million as "small." But the most recent available Economic Census data (for 2007) suggest that threshold is misleading. About 89 percent of all companies with employees brought in less than $2.5 million. Companies operated only by their owners represented about three-quarters of all companies in that year; they are not included in most Census reports because their total revenues are so small. 
In other words, the companies winning the popularity contest are not necessarily those fitting the official definitions. 
Most Americans praising small business are probably thinking in qualitative rather than quantitative terms. Small is beautiful because it's local. Size matters less than connections and commitment. 
We think of small business owners as men and women who invest in their own communities, work in the same building as their employees, send their children to the same schools and walk their dogs in the same neighborhood parks. 
Much of the political pressure to pass the proposed Market Fairness Act, which would require Internet companies to collect state sales taxes, comes from stories of very small businesses driven out of business by competition with very large companies - like Amazon's effect on independent bookstores. But size is not the fundamental issue. Some online commerce taking place, for instance, through eBay, is small in scale. It seems unfair to many that nonlocal companies should enjoy a tax advantage over local ones. 
Tensions between local and global enterprises now pervade discussions of corporate strategies for managing "stateless income." Local businesses don't have the will or the way to establish offshore tax havens. Indeed, many are hurt by reductions in state and federal tax revenue that have led to cuts in spending on infrastructure and education. 
Large corporations are increasingly footloose, able to go wherever advantageous tax policies, cheap labor or lax regulation beckon. Locally owned businesses are far less likely to hit the road. 
The resulting divergence in economic interests is driving new political alignments. As David Hess explains in his fascinating book, "Localist Movements in a Global Economy," most business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have been dominated by large publicly traded corporations. That dominance is now being challenged by groups like the American Independent Business Alliance, which explicitly aims to "keep economic and political power rooted in the community" and the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, which emphasizes social and environmental responsibility through "localism." 
In a recent article in The Nation, William Greider describes the American Sustainable Business Council, the Main Street Alliance and the Small Business Majority, all efforts to strengthen progressive coalitions around issues like health care and immigration reform. 
Public Citizen's U.S. Chamber Watch lists nearly 60 local Chambers of Commerce that have publicly denounced or canceled their membership in the U.S. Chamber, citing disagreement with the national organization's political positions on issues ranging from corporate tax reform to minimum wage increases. 
These are not the small businesses that Senator Cruz wants to embrace, and they don't want to hug him, either. If this insurgency grows, Republicans will have a harder time defending the claim that they represent Main Street rather than Wall Street.

HEADLINE: New American Bill Threatens Indian Outsourcing Companies

BYLINE: NEHA THIRANI BAGRI


HIGHLIGHT: Legislation is discriminatory and protectionist, Indian companies say. 

 BODY:
MUMBAI - A new American immigration bill threatens the future of Indian outsourcing, Indian companies say, because it will limit the number of foreign workers they can bring to the United States.
The Senate immigration bill, which is currently pending in the United States Congress, would make it more expensive for foreign outsourcing firms to bring over temporary foreign workers on H-1B visas, while giving American companies access to a larger pool of those visas to bring over their own foreign workers.
Under the bill, which is being backed by executives from American technology firms, the total number of H-1B visas will increase to 110,000 from 65,000. However, the bill will limit the overall percentage of foreign workers that outsourcing companies like Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services or Infosys can have in the United States, and will require companies that have 30 to 50 percent of their workforce on temporary visas to pay $5,000 for every new foreign worker they hire. 
After 2014, companies that employ more than 75 percent of their workers in the United States on temporary visas will not be granted new H-1B visas, and by 2016 that threshold will be brought down to 50 percent.
The bill does not specifically target Indian outsourcing companies, but because foreign workers typically make up 50 to 75 percent of these companies' staff in the United States, the legislation will greatly limit their hiring practices.
Many Indian outsourcing firms have been expanding their operations in the United States, even as the economy there has slowed in recent years. Indian companies have invested $5.9 billion in the United States to set up offices closer to their American clients, according to a survey of 35 Indian companies by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the India Business Forum published last year.
"The people who have drafted this bill have rightfully looked at the needs of the United States, but they have also tried to create discriminatory conditions which act like trade barriers and inhibit the free movement of people between the United States and India," said Som Mittal, president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies, known as Nasscom, a group lobbying Washington for modifications to the bill. "If the bill does go through with the conditions that it has today, it will significantly impact our businesses and our capability to compete."
The bill presents another significant problem for Indian companies: foreign workers on temporary visas would not be allowed to work on "outplacements," which means working at the offices of their customers, a practice that analysts say is essential to their model.
The bill also has provisions for visa fee of $10,000 for companies that have temporary foreign employees making up over 50 percent of its workforce in the United States, and it requires companies to follow strict guidelines when advertising jobs in the United States.
"These proposed changes, if enforced, will increase the visa and wage cost for Indian IT outsourcing companies and impact their margin considerably," said Niral Dalal, lead research analyst at Fortune Financial Services who specializes in information technology.
The Indian technology industry is waiting to see what happens next. "Like many companies, we are watching the developments of the proposed immigration legislation to determine how it may affect our business," said Infosys in an e-mailed response.
Industry bodies like Nasscom and the Confederation of Indian Industry are lobbying for changes in the proposed bill. The latter said in a statement that the provisions dealing with temporary works would be "against the interests of Indian companies" and "create an unequal playing field for them."
"Any such restrictions, including new ones, on non-immigrant visas, if adopted, should apply uniformly to all applicants," said Chandrajit Banerjee, the confederation's director general. "Action specifically targeting Indian companies would not be in accord with our growing strategic partnership."
In the long run, if the bill as proposed becomes law, analysts say that Indian companies will be forced to adapt and alter their business model. Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director of institutional equity at Anand Rathi Financial Services in Mumbai, said companies would eventually have to resort to hiring more people in India and reducing their workforce in the United States.
Some argue that the provisions of the bill could harm American businesses that outsource their work to Indian companies.
"I am especially worried that U.S. competitiveness will be hurt if the bill is adopted as drafted," said Ron Somers, president of the U.S.-India Business Council. His group is lobbying in Washington to "educate lawmakers about the benefit of the U.S. -India commercial relationship," he said.
While the Indian information technology industry has been a keen supporter and benefactor of strong trade relations between India and the Unites States, the bill would deal a considerable blow to the industry.
"These are companies that in some ways have had the most vibrant relationship with the United States, and this would be seen as an unfriendly move towards them," said Neelam Deo, director of Gateway House, a research institution in Mumbai, and a former ambassador to Denmark and Côte d'Ivoire.
With the Indian information technology industry carrying considerable clout in New Delhi, the issue threatens to complicate trade relations between India and the United States.
"This industry is important to the Indian government because contributes significantly to the gross domestic product and lowering our current account deficit, while creating employment for Indian people," said Mr. Mittal of Nasscom. "If the bill is passed with the current conditions then our own government will consider whatever options they have to react to these protectionist measures." 
An earlier version of this post said that Indian companies have invested $820 million in the United States to set up offices closer to their American clients. The correct figure is $5.9 billion.

HEADLINE: China's Changing Internet Landscape

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: China was on vacation much of last week for the May 1 Worker&#8217;s Day holiday, but executives at two of China&#8217;s most important online companies were busy completing a deal that may reshape the country&#8217;s Internet. 

 BODY:
China was on vacation much of last week for the May 1 Worker's Day holiday, but executives at two of China's most important online companies were busy completing a deal that may reshape the country's Internet. 
Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce and online payments firm, announced that it had bought an 18 percent stake in Sina's Weibo subsidiary for $586 million in a deal expected to jump-start Sina's revenues through social commerce. Weibo, a microblogging service somewhat akin to Twitter, is one of China's biggest social networks. Think Amazon or eBay investing into Twitter. 
China's top three Internet companies, known as the BATs, are Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu, listed on the Nasdaq market, has a market capitalization of just under $30 billion. Alibaba is private butan eventual initial public offering, likely in either the United States or Hong Kong, could make the company one of the most valuable Internet firms in the world. Tencent is listed in Hong Kong and is worth nearly $65 billion, or almost as much as Facebook.
Mobile Internet usage is growing rapidly in China, in large part because of the proliferation of Google's Android and cheap smartphones made in China. Sunday's CCTV Evening News dedicated the first three minutesof the broadcast to a report about surging smartphone use and the benefits to China's economy from the increasing consumption that the mobile Internet is expected to drive.
Weibo's several hundred million users now access the service more from mobile devices than from PCs. The deal with Sina is part of Alibaba's strategy, along with other initiatives like developing a new mobile operating system, Alibaba Mobile OS, to become the leading mobile firm in China. According to a report in Monday's issue of Caixin, one of China's top business magazines, Baidu was also negotiating with Sina for a Weibo deal. A Baidu representative declined to comment on that claim. 
Tencent has its own Weibo service (weibo is the Chinese word for microblogging) as well as WeChat, a mobile messaging and social networking service that has several hundred million registered users. In December this column cited WeChat as one of the eight trends to keep an eye on in 2013. 
All this activity and wealth creation is happening inside of what the Economist magazine, in an excellent recent report on China's Internet, termed a "giant cage." But there are recent signs that the government is concerned the cage may need strengthening. 
The previous column noted that the government appears to be reining in the more salacious online exposes of corruption that occurred over the last few months in favor of channeling them into official outlets.
On May 2 China's State Internet Information Office declared war against online rumors because they "have impaired the credibility of online media, disrupted normal communication order, and aroused great aversion among the public." One report suggests the regulators have some of the most influential users of Sina Weibo, those with millions or tens of millions of followers, in their sights. Online rumors have beena real problem, but crackdowns against them can be used for broader goals. 
Last week's announcement follows a new rule to tighten media controls, especially in regards to Weibo, issued in April, and an essay titled "How is the Party to Manage the Media Well in the New Era?" by a propaganda official who in 2010wrote the influential book "The Art of Guiding Public Opinion." 
There have been campaigns against online rumors before. The most concerted efforts to reign in Weibo began after the sixth plenum of the 17th Party Congress in October 2011 when official media declared that "Internet rumors are like drugs" and propaganda work should focus on "strengthening the channeling and control of social media and real-time communication tools." That campaign was followed by the December 2011 requirementfor real name registration of Weibo users. 
Strict implementation does not always follow rule promulgation in China, and the real name registration requirement was largely ignored. Sina admitted as much in its 2011and 2012 20-F annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Here is what the company wrote in the recent 2012 filing:
We are required to, but have not, verified the identities of all of our users who post on Weibo, and our noncompliance exposes us to potentially severe penalty by the Chinese government.
The regulators may not always succeed the first time but it would be a mistake to assume they will not keep pushing the issue, especially when propaganda work and ideology are so core to the party's control. At the end of March, the State Council released its task list for the next five years and one of the items is an Internet real name registration system by June 30, 2014. 
The Alibaba deal is about strengthening mobile positioning and spurring social commerce. The government would probably be pleased to see Weibo shift from being a hotbed of social and political commentary and critiques to more of an online shopping arcade that, through integrated online payment functionality, has the voluntary real name registrations of many users. 
Just as China's leadership is clear it will pursue economic reform without structural political reform, so it also appears intent on building a commercially vibrant yet managed Internet, an "Internet with Chinese characteristics." Given the scale of business activity and wealth creation on the Chinese Internet, the cage looks quite gilded and may prove far more robust than many expect.

HEADLINE: Where the Jobs for the Young Are and Aren't

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: In three regions &#8212; the upper Midwest, New England and the area around Washington &#8212; the job market for younger adults is considerably stronger than in the rest of the country. 

 BODY:
In three regions - the upper Midwest, New England and the area around Washington - the job market for younger adults is considerably stronger than in the rest of the country. These three regions are the closest thing to an exception to the trend I described in a Sunday column: the sharp decline in employment rates for adults 25 to 34 years old. Whereas the United States had perhaps the highest employment rate for this age group among large, wealthy economies in 2012, it has one of the lowest today. 
When you look at the three regions that are doing better, you quickly notice they are among the country's best educated. According to the Census Bureau, the 10 states with the greatest share of bachelor's degree holders are, in descending order: Massachusetts, Colorado. Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Minnesota. And the District of Columbia has a higher share than any state does. Many of those also have relatively high employment rates for people 25 to 34.
The state with the lowest share of bachelor's degree holders is West Virginia, which also has the lowest share of employed 25- to 34-year-olds. Only 67.1 percent of West Virginians in that age group were employed, based on the most recent data, from 2012. The next nine states from the bottom of the bachelor-degree ranking don't have high employment rates, either: Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Alabama, Indiana, Oklahoma and Tennessee. 
This pattern is especially striking because the employment measure here - the employment-population ratio - counts as non-employed everyone who does not have a job, including people in graduate school. No employment metric is perfect. I used this one because I wanted to capture people who would prefer to be working but who are not officially unemployed - that is, actively looking for work. (For more on the flaws with the official unemployment rate, listen to Stephen Colbert.)
States with a relatively high proportion of college graduates are also states where a larger number of people in their late 20s are likely to be enrolled in graduate school and thus not working. Yet these states are nonetheless the one with some of the highest employment rates.
To be clear, education is not the only explanation. Workers in the Washington metropolitan area benefit from the federal government, and parts of the Midwest can thank an energy boom. North Dakota has the highest share - 84 percent - of 25- to 34-year-olds who are employed.
The state data here comes from Moody's Analytics, based on underlying numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and my colleague Alicia Parlapiano created the map. Sometime soon, we will look at employment rates by metropolitan area.

HEADLINE: After Years of Battling, Bank of America and MBIA Settle Mortgage Dispute

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A $1.7 billion deal ends a legal dispute over mortgage-backed securities. 

 BODY:
 8:29 p.m. | Updated 
Bank of America and MBIA, the troubled bond insurer, have reached a $1.7 billion agreement to settle a long-running legal dispute over mortgage-backed securities that became troubled when the financial crisis blossomed.
The deal, which was announced on Monday, provides a lifeline to MBIA, which stood in danger of being unable to meet its obligations in a few weeks' time. And the agreement will turn Bank of America from bitter foe to equity investor in, and major lender to, the insurer. 
The battle between the two financial giants had its beginnings in transactions before the financial crisis between MBIA and two companies - Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial - that Bank of America acquired during the crisis.
Merrill Lynch was in a position to collect billions from the insurer - if it had enough cash to meet its obligations.
But it seemed unlikely that MBIA could come up with the cash unless Countrywide agreed to pay billions to settle claims that it had misled the insurer regarding the quality of mortgages in securitizations insured by MBIA, and had failed to honor its obligations to repurchase those mortgages.
Now the multibillion-dollar claims the institutions had against each other will be canceled out. Under the agreement, Bank of America will pay $1.6 billion in cash to MBIA, and will lend the firm another $500 million. It also acquired warrants that, if exercised, would give the bank a 4.9 percent stake in the insurer. In addition, the bank will surrender to MBIA about $130 million in MBIA bonds.
Bank of America said the agreement would reduce its previously announced first quarter after-tax profits by $1.1 billion, or 10 cents a share, but would improve its capital position. MBIA indicated that the settlement would have little impact on its profits, but said its first-quarter results, scheduled to be released on Thursday, would be delayed.
The agreement also appears to remove any practical chance that MBIA's split into two companies will be reversed. One company, National, is taking over the municipal bond insurance policies. The other, known as MBIA Corporation, backs the insurance the company issued on securitized products and on credit-default swaps. Both remain subsidiaries of the parent, MBIA Inc.
Jay Brown, MBIA's chief executive, said the agreement "sets the stage for National to reclaim its leadership in the U.S. public finance insurance market."
Shares of MBIA soared on word of the settlement, rising $4.46, or 45 percent, to $14.29. Bank of America shares surged 64 cents, or 5 percent, to $12.88.
Before the settlement, it appeared that within weeks the insurer would owe as much as $3 billion to Merrill Lynch stemming from credit-default swaps issued by MBIA concerning commercial real estate transactions.
MBIA Corporation had met earlier obligations by borrowing money from National, the municipal bond part of the company.
But Benjamin Lawsky, the New York State financial services superintendent, refused to allow further loans, and it was expected that MBIA Corporation might be put into receivership before it had to pay Merrill Lynch.
In an interview, Mr. Lawsky said negotiations had been going on for more than a year, but accelerated in the last couple of weeks. "There was a way to get to yes because everyone had claims on everyone else," he said. The agreement, he said "resolves significant exposure and expensive litigation for Bank of America, while also giving MBIA a path forward."
MBIA originally insured municipal bonds, a profitable business because few such bonds ever defaulted and municipalities buying the insurance would get AAA ratings on their bonds, saving them more in interest payments than the insurance cost because many muni bond investors were very risk-averse.
It later expanded into insuring securitizations and writing credit-default swaps, businesses in which the purchasers were more sophisticated. When the financial crisis struck, it became clear that the company had taken some very bad risks.
In 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, which later was folded into the Department of Financial Services, approved a decision by MBIA to split into the two companies. Banks and hedge funds that owned securities insured by MBIA went to court to try to reverse the split. In March, MBIA prevailed in one of those suits, as Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the insurance department had wide latitude to approve the split with or without much investigation.
She cited a deposition by Michael Moriarty, the then-deputy superintendent of the department, who said "the department did not, nor do they usually, verify the financial condition of a company." Since that was the policy, the judge concluded she had no authority to question it, even if some information provided by the company was false.
Bank of America had vowed to appeal that decision, raising the possibility that an appellate court would order a trial that could be embarrassing to the state regulator. Under the settlement, the bank will drop that appeal.
Some MBIA legal disputes remain. Société Générale, the French bank, remains a plaintiff in the suit over the split, and that dispute seems likely to cost MBIA perhaps $200 million to settle. MBIA is also pursuing complaints against ResCap, a mortgage company previously owned by General Motors' finance arm, and against Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank. Settlement of those disputes potentially could bring in more than $500 million to MBIA.
Another suit against the MBIA split was filed by hedge funds that feared their insurance claims would not be honored. That suit is still pending, but the agreement would make it harder to pursue since all the information the bank obtained in disclosure from MBIA would be returned to the insurer.
Bank of America had bought the bonds in an effort to frustrate MBIA's effort to change their terms. By turning over the bonds to the insurer, it now seems likely MBIA can change the terms. The expectation is that MBIA will eventually resell the bonds to investors, providing cash for the company.
The money provided by Bank of America will largely be used to repay the loans National made to MBIA Corporation, solidifying National's finances.
Under the warrants, Bank of America will have the right for the next five years to purchase 9.94 million shares of MBIA for $9.59 a share. If the warrant is exercised, that would provide the insurer with another $95 million.

HEADLINE: Medical Devices Fall Short for Children

BYLINE: LAURIE TARKAN


HIGHLIGHT: The development of surgical tools designed for young patients lags behind that for adults, largely, experts say, because of economics and a smaller market. 

 BODY:
Only 15 months old, Vivian Andorf underwent her sixth cardiac catheterization. Her cardiologist inserted a flexible tube through a tiny artery in her leg and wended it to her heart in an attempt to treat her narrowed veins and arteries, the result of a congenital condition.
In prior procedures, the first of which she had at a mere 3 weeks old, an adult-size catheter had to be used. Catheters sized for a child, let alone an infant, were not available. The larger catheter took longer to insert and was more likely to injure her already abnormal blood vessels, said her cardiologist, Dr. Alex Golden of the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital. 
"It's trying to put something too large into something smaller," he said.
But during the sixth procedure, Vivian became just the second young patient in the country to benefit from a catheter approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children. It is a rare success in the field of pediatric medical devices.
The development of surgical tools and medical devices designed for children lags a decade behind device development for adults. The lag, say experts, can be blamed largely on economics. The pediatric market is far smaller than the market for adults, making it difficult for companies to recoup research and development expenses for smaller devices.
"Innovation in medicine is driven by need, but also by the market," said Dr. Michael R. Harrison, the director emeritus of the Fetal Treatment Center and the director of the Pediatric Device Consortium, both at the University of California, San Francisco. "Big markets have lots of folks developing devices, but small markets like the pediatrics market don't."
Take, for example, the field of knee and hip replacements in adults. "There's been an incredible amount of investment and talent and innovation devoted to those things," said Dr. Harrison, "but essentially none to pediatric orthopedic devices."
So for decades, pediatric surgeons and other specialists have had to make do, using adult-size devices "off label" in children. They might chisel out their own smaller surgical tools in workshops, or jury-rig devices to squeeze into their tiny patients. Always, they contend with the extra challenges that come with using a device that's not quite right.
"Often we end up having to dramatically modify an operation simply to be able to implant a device in a child," said Dr. Pedro del Nido, chairman of the department of cardiac surgery at Boston Children's Hospital.
Among the adult devices used with children are stents, defibrillators, pacemakers, artificial mitral valves, chemotherapy delivery devices, kidney dialysis systems, and metal implants that help straighten a spine or replace a piece of bone.
Young patients often have to undergo multiple operations to resize or replace devices that no longer fit or have worn out, because they were not designed for the physiological changes of childhood. While the failure rate of defibrillators in adults is extremely low, for example, it's 20 to 25 percent in children, said Dr. del Nido.
"Children have growth spurts. Their immune systems and hormones are changing," said Barbara D. Boyan, the dean of the engineering school at Virginia Commonwealth University. "You need to be able to adapt to different ages, different stages of development."
At the same time, some pediatric conditions do not occur in adults or are best treated in childhood. These conditions are often completely ignored by medical device companies.
In 2007, Congress passed the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, authorizing the F.D.A. to offer grants to stimulate the development of pediatric devices. The agency has given $11 million in grants to several university-based consortia. These groups offer seed money to developers and provide technical advice, assistance finding investors, and advice about navigating the regulatory process.
The consortia have assisted in more than 220 projects, which are in various stages of development.
Still, some believe that the grant money could be better spent. Tim Moran, the founder of Pediaworks, the nonprofit company that created the pediatric catheter, said that there's little market data on what pediatric devices are most needed, something he hopes to change.
Mr. Moran grew interested in pediatric devices after seeing his daughter, who was born prematurely, wince or scream in pain when devices designed for adults were used in her care. Mr. Moran surveyed pediatric cardiologists to identify their greatest needs and found that the catheter was high on the list. He eventually discovered a company in Japan that was making smaller catheters and created a joint venture to develop the catheter for children and to seek approval for it in the United States.
"I'd love to see the pediatric community as a whole identify the biggest device needs in their space," said Mr. Moran, who plans to survey doctors in about 20 specialties about their medical device needs.
But market data may not have helped someone like Tommy Blackshaw, who was born with a condition that is rare in children, mitral valve stenosis. At 22 months, his dysfunctional heart valve needed replacement. Because the adult-size artificial mitral valve was too large to fit in the proper position, it had to be implanted above it.
About six years later, the valve had to be replaced. Dr. del Nido, Tommy's cardiologist, believes that the less than ideal placement caused his heart to weaken. Tommy's heart began to fail when he was 13, and he was told he needed a heart transplant. He got one, on Valentine's Day, and he's doing well.
"It would have been less dangerous if they had a smaller valve," said his mother, Sandra Blackshaw of North Andover, Mass. "But there were no options for him."

HEADLINE: Estimate of Immigration Overhaul's Cost Gets Mixed Reviews on Right

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: A Heritage Foundation study predicted that a proposal now in the Senate would vastly increase the government deficit in coming decades. 

 BODY:
A researcher whose fiscal calculations have provided crucial support in the past for conservative opponents of an immigration overhaul released a report on Monday, predicting that a proposal now in the Senate would vastly increase the government deficit in coming decades. But this year the estimates, by Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, have received decidedly mixed reviews from conservatives. 
Mr. Rector and his co-author, Jason Richwine, estimated that offering a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants, which is part of a plan by a bipartisan group of senators to overhaul the immigration system, would generate a "lifetime fiscal deficit" for the government of $6.3 trillion. 
An earlier, similarly high calculation by Mr. Rector of the cost of giving legal status to illegal immigrants was a powerful organizing tool in 2007 for opponents of a comprehensive immigration reform bill proposed by then-President George W. Bush. Citing Mr. Rector's warnings of a huge drain on taxpayer resources, conservative activists rose up to defeat that legislation.
This year, Mr. Rector had somewhat different findings, and they received a very different reception from leading conservatives. 
The new study assumes that large numbers of immigrants formerly in the country illegally would eventually use government programs for low-income Americans, after a 13-year period in which they would not be eligible for those benefits under the terms of the bill. 
The steepest costs Mr. Rector projects would come toward the end of the immigrants' lives, after they had become United States citizens and retired. At that point, he estimates, the difference between what they would pay in taxes and what they would use in government services would leave a fiscal deficit of $22,700 a year for each immigrant.
"You simply do not want to give illegal immigrants access to the welfare state," Mr. Rector said during a conference call with reporters. Doing so, he said, would be "ruinously expensive."
Hours after Mr. Rector presented his findings at a news conference at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, Haley Barbour, a Republican leader and former governor of Mississippi, convened his own press call to dismiss the study.
"This a political document," Mr. Barbour said. "This gigantic cost figure that the Heritage Foundation puts out is actually the cost over 50 years. If you put the 50-year cost of anything in front of the public, it is going to be a huge number." 
Mr. Barbour, who is among a growing number of Republican leaders who have urged the party to take a less hard-line approach to immigration, criticized Mr. Rector for failing to estimate the economic benefits of bringing immigrants into the legal system, and for underestimating the potential for economic improvement over time among immigrant families. 
Grover Norquist, the conservative anti-tax crusader, has also spoken out in recent days to pre-emptively dispute Mr. Rector's claims. An analysis posted Monday on the Web site of his organization, Americans for Tax Reform, called the cost estimate "wildly overblown," arguing that the study had, among other things, lumped native-born Americans into many of its calculations. 
Surprisingly, some of Mr. Rector's findings echoed what the senators sponsoring the immigration bill have said about its fiscal impact over the 13 years before formerly illegal immigrants would be allowed to become American citizens. He estimated that "tax payments would increase more than government benefits" during that period, reducing the deficit.

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 Must-Reads 
Tom Chiarella says he believes that in business the little things are really the big things. Jordan Weissmann says America's technology-talent shortage is a myth. And Ezra Klein explains how the Van Halen Principle applies to government.
 Washington: Paying Down the Debt 
The Treasury will pay down debt for the first time since 2007, and the Federal Reserve decides to keep its stimulus plan in place, saying recent tax increases and spending cuts have hurt the economy. These slides show why taxes should go up. In this video, Allan Madan explains how the federal budget affects your small business; these business owners have ideas for how Washington can help. Here are five sequestration cuts that have not happened. President Obama's relationship with GOP congressional leaders hits a new low. Small-business contracts with the federal government worth more than $2 billion will open for competition in the coming months. 
 The Economy: Down, Flat, Surging
Small-business owners are more optimistic about their companies' prospects and are picking up the hiring pace, according to one report. But the April 2013 SurePayroll Small Business Scorecard showed that month-over-month hiring was down 0.2 percent and the average paycheck was flat. Personal income and spending both increased, pending home sales reached a three-year high and home prices are surging. But home ownership fell to its lowest level since 1995. The University of Michigan said consumer sentiment fell to a three-month low, but the Conference Board's index picked up. Positive same-store sales pushed the Restaurant Performance Index higher. Overall manufacturing activity declined last month. The unemployment rate fell and job-creation was solid in April.

 Entrepreneurs: Do You Have What it Takes?
Mohul Ghosh says that "love for wealth" is one of nine unmistakable symptoms of entrepreneurship. In a radio interview, an author shares his entrepreneurial journey. Sinead says today's geeks are the new rock stars. These are the top 10 billionaires who dropped out of school. Kenny Chesney explains why he's a no-shoes entrepreneur with a taste for the rum business. And if you take this entrepreneurial quiz you might find out if you have what it takes to make it big.
 Start-Up: Omaha 
It appears the new must-attend start-up conference is in Omaha. This 18-slide pitch just landed a payment start-up $16.5 million, while another start-up creates a marketplace for the curious and those who teach. TechCrunch Disrupt discovers some exciting new companies in New York. Martin Zwilling suggests seven essentials to finding the right start-up mentor. Here are the top 10 reasons to start up in college. Sam Biddle shows what it looks like when you lose all of your start-up money.
 Social Media: Do You Have a Policy? 
Facebook is losing millions of users, and apps like this may be the reason. This is what the new YouTube layout and other Google updates mean for your small business. LinkedIn now lets you add photos, videos, and comments from others. A study finds mothers of young children are more likely than the general public to use social media. Kyle Nunes explains why you should consider blogging for your business. Debbie Thomson thinks your small business may need a social media policy. A Mexican restaurant's privileged customer complains about the service and is the recipient of a social media firestorm. Twitter opens up a self-serve advertising platform to businesses, and according to Kealan Lennon, "what today's social retailers are getting right is that the most compelling content to consumers is the media created by the consumers." Living Social is hacked. A reporter's Instagram photo reveals a "near-death" experience. According to an AT&T study, two-thirds of small-business owners said they planned to spend as much or more as they did last year on digital marketing (including Web sites, social media and online advertising).
 Customer Service: Loyalty And Lady Gaga 
April was Customer Loyalty Month and Shep Hyken celebrated. This is how to make customers come back even after they return purchases. A study shows that spelling and grammar errors in shop signs lose customers. Here are seven customer-loyalty lessons you can learn from Lady Gaga. And now it's May, which is National Salad Month.
 Health Care: Surprise! 
The Affordable Care Act application form is out, and it's actually quite easy. A Stanford professor says the Act will cause millions of Americans to pay more for health insurance. Meanwhile, other experts propose $1 trillion in savings. Ron Present and Bill Goddard give advice for controlling your health care costs.
 Around The Country: More Oil in North Dakota 
A survey doubles the estimate of recoverable oil reserves in North Dakota. The Chamber of Commerce names these the most enterprising states. Local pawnshops in Daytona Beach, Fla., are unfazed by the recent drop in gold prices. The UPS Store introduces a Main Street franchise model. A small-business conference is scheduled for May 17 and 18 in New York, and Philadelphia announces its first Small Business Week.
 Around The World: The Pirate Party
Euro-area economic confidence falls more than expected, and Spain sinks deeper into recession after suffering 33 consecutive months of falling retail sales. Europe's youth employment levels are called "insane." Germany accuses France of being "Europe's biggest problem child," and France wants to woo foreigners with entrepreneur visas. Meanwhile, Italy is facing a shortage of pizza makers. Churchill will be on a new bank note. Japan's manufacturing and hiring rises. In this video, the Russian president meets with small-business owners. The Pirate Party wins three seats in the Icelandic parliament. Obama's comedy is anything but routine for the Chinese. Micro-breweries are bubbling over in South Africa. A small business expo is planned for Jamaica.
 Technology: Google Glass
Bob Cringely says things are looking up for Google Glass, and Robert Scoble says he will never again live a day without wearing it. Here's how to use it. Bring-your-own-device adoption at small businesses increased in 2012 but be careful: lawsuits may be looming. Here are 10 little-known apps entrepreneurs can't live without, 21 tips for super-charging your cloud storage and a few helpful tech upgrades for the home office. A report from National Public Radio explains why, when it comes to productivity, technology can hurt and help. This is what the voice of Alexander Graham Bell sounded like. Blackberry's chief executive believes tablets are doomed. Square updates its mobile-payments software for small restaurants. Boy, what a difference 20 years has made. This simple trick turns commercial polymer into the world's toughest fiber. Supermarkets of the future will track shopper eye movements. And this men's suit will turn transparent when the wearer lies.
 Tweet of the Week 
@jayleno - A NH man says he was conned by a carnival, losing his entire life savings at the ball toss game. Well, now he knows how #Lakers fans feel!
 The Week's Best Quote 
Jon Stow says that you must adapt and change, or your business will die: "I hope I do not seem unkind, but this week I had one of those online petition e-mails from some booksellers who were petitioning for Amazon to pay more tax. Yet I am sure the reason for their knocking Amazon was because Amazon is eating into their business. I feel sorry for the booksellers, but we cannot run our businesses as museum pieces because we will make no money."
 This Week's Question: Will you be able to live without Google Glass?

HEADLINE: David Ferrucci: Life After Watson

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: The former head of I.B.M.&#8217;s Watson project, a triumph of artificial intelligence, explains the limits to the current data-driven approach to making computers smarter and why he left Big Blue to join a hedge fund. 

 BODY:
To the degree there was a human face of Watson, the "Jeopardy!" computer champion, it was David Ferrucci. He was the I.B.M. researcher who led the development of Watson, an artificial intelligence engine. The goateed computer scientist was always articulate and at ease in front of a camera or a microphone.
Dr. Ferrucci has left I.B.M. to join the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. And the weight of the Watson-related fame, it seems, played a role. "I was so linked to the Watson achievement, and where I.B.M. was taking it, that I felt I was almost losing my identity," he said in a recent interview. 
After Watson beat the best human Jeopardy champions in 2011, its artificial intelligence technology was directed toward new challenges, like assisting doctors in making diagnoses in a research project at the Cleveland Clinic.
Dr. Ferrucci led that next-generation Watson research as well. But he went to Bridgewater at the end of last year. Bridgewater, a private company, made no announcement of its new hire. Yet word of Dr. Ferrucci's departure from I.B.M. has been circulating among scientists in the artificial intelligence field. And I caught up with him recently for an interview, supplemented by a lengthy e-mail he titled, "My Reflections."
Dr. Ferrucci, 51, said he had "a great, great career" at I.B.M., spanning 20 years, and "they paid me very well."
He said he "never imagined myself at a hedge fund," but eventually the appeal of working in a smaller environment in an entirely new field for him - applying artificial intelligence to macroeconomic modeling - won him over.
Dr. Ferrucci said the more recent work he was doing at I.B.M., called WatsonPaths, was the direction he thought artificial intelligence research needed to go to make further advances, and it was the approach he saw Bridgewater pursuing to economic modeling.
Much of artificial intelligence today, he said, focuses on mining vast amounts of data to make predictions. Those predictions are based on statistical probabilities and patterns - a certain symptom is highly correlated with a certain disease, for example.
"But in a purely data-driven approach, I can't explain my decisions," Dr. Ferrucci said. "People are so enamored with the data-driven approach that they believe correlation is sufficient."
The Big Data formula, he noted, has proved to be "incredibly powerful" for tasks like natural-language processing - a central technology behind Google search, for instance.
WatsonPaths, by contrast, builds step-by-step graphs, or paths, that trace possible causes rather than mere statistical correlations. In the case of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic project, for example, the paths go from an observation of symptoms to a conclusion about the diagnosis of a disease and treatment.
That approach is a hybrid of the Big Data tools, which sift through troves of medical literature, and logic tools to identify likely chains of inference - what humans see as logical explanations for the "why" of things. The approach is also a step in the direction of classic artificial intelligence, which relied on knowledge rules and relationships, to create so-called expert systems. The blend combines elements of what Dr. Ferrucci termed "my 30-year journey in A.I."
At Bridgewater, Dr. Ferrucci sees a similar path to modeling the economy and markets. "Their approach to investment," he wrote in his e-mail, "is based on a fundamental understanding of how the global 'economic machine' works."
Its models, he added, are "informed by but not blindly driven by the data." The opportunity, Dr. Ferrucci wrote, is to build "predictive systems that fit perfectly with my interests. How cool is it to imagine a machine that can combine deductive and inductive processes to develop, apply, refine and explain a fundamental economic theory?"
Cool, indeed. If successful, perhaps Bridgewater could share its findings with the Fed and the Treasury rather than merely trading for its own account. In the realm of policy, economic modeling and forecasting could use some help.

HEADLINE: Sorting Through the New Political Alignments in Small Business

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Issues like the Marketplace Fairness Act are changing the landscape. 

 BODY:
In a post for our colleagues at Economix on the divide between small and big - and local and global - businesses, Nancy Folbre, an economics professor, raises a number of issues important to You're The Boss readers.
In particular, she discusses the emergence of several groups, mostly progressive, that claim to represent local and independent small businesses. They include membership organizations like the American Independent Business Alliance, the Main Street Alliance, Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, as well as the Small Business Majority and the American Sustainable Business Council, which have no members. (The American Sustainability Business Council describes itself as a network of businesses and business associations.) 
It's an interesting list, in an interesting column. Ms. Folbre appears to find a connection between local and liberal, painting it in opposition to global interests represented by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "The resulting divergence in economic interests" between local and global companies, she writes, "is driving new political alignments." 
But is it? Among the issues she cites is the ability of states to collect sales taxes from online retailers that are based out of state, and in fact the Marketplace Fairness Act now seems likely to pass the Senate very soon. But Internet tax fairness, as its proponents call it, is not necessarily a battle between liberals and conservatives, although more conservatives tend to oppose it. One can support the Marketplace Fairness Act, or any number of measures intended to strengthen small, independent businesses, and still oppose, say, the Affordable Care Act or higher taxes on the wealthy. To complicate matters further, it's not necessarily a local-versus-global issue either. Much of the backing for the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, the chief lobbying coalition for the Marketplace Fairness Act (and unrelated to the Main Street Alliance), has been supplied by national and international big-box retailers that are anathema on Main Street: Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and Home Depot, among others.
Perhaps the emergence of these groups simply reflects that liberal activists - and business owners - have styled themselves in a way that they hope taps into the way small businesses resonate with many Americans. As Ms. Folbre puts it, "We think of small-business owners as men and women who invest in their own communities, work in the same building as their employees, send their children to the same schools and walk their dogs in the same neighborhood parks."
In any event, it may be a long time before these groups challenge the dominance of the conservative organizations. The groups she lists are all very small compared to the National Federation of Independent Business, which has 350,000 members, or the Chamber of Commerce, which has nearly three million small-business members, despite its often national and international orientation. (Many of those businesses - the Chamber declines to say how many - are actually members of state or local affiliates and may not necessarily buy into the Chamber's politics. Indeed, Ms. Folbre notes that nearly 60 local chambers have withdrawn from the national organization.)
We'd like to hear from readers who have heard from some these new organizations. How did you find out about them? Did you join? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: Beyond The Fence

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The opponents of immigration reform have many small complaints, but they really have one core concern. It's about control. America doesn't control its borders. Past reform efforts have not established control. Current proposals wouldn't establish effective control.
But the opponents rarely say what exactly it is they are trying to control. They talk about border security and various mechanisms to achieve that, but they rarely go into detail about what we should be so vigilant about restricting. I thought I would spell it out. 
First, immigration opponents are effectively trying to restrict the flow of conservatives into this country. In survey after survey, immigrants are found to have more traditional ideas about family structure and community than comparable Americans. They have lower incarceration rates. They place higher emphasis on career success. They have stronger work ethics. Immigrants go into poor neighborhoods and infuse them with traditional values.
When immigrant areas go bad, it's not because they have infected America with bad values. It's because America has infected them with bad values already present. So the first thing conservative opponents of reform are trying to restrict is social conservatism.
Second, immigration opponents are trying to restrict assimilation. The evidence about this is clear, too. Current immigrants enter this country because they want to realize the same dreams that inspired past waves. Study after study shows current Hispanic immigrants are picking up English at an impressive clip, roughly as quickly as earlier immigrant groups. They are making steady gains in homeownership rates, job status and social identity. By second generation, according to a Pew Research Center study released earlier this year, 61 percent of immigrants think of themselves as ''typical Americans.''
Third, immigration opponents are trying to restrict love affairs. Far from segregating themselves into their own alien subculture, today's immigrant groups seem eager to marry into mainstream American society. Among all newlyweds in 2010, 9 percent of whites married outside of their racial or ethnic group, as did 17 percent of blacks. But an astonishing 26 percent of Hispanics and 28 percent of Asians married outside their groups. They are blending into America in the most intimate way.
Fourth, immigration opponents are trying to restrict social mobility. Generation after generation, the children of immigrants are gradually better educated and more affluent than their parents.
A few years ago, the great political scientist Samuel Huntington asserted that Hispanic immigrants were not succeeding as previous immigrants had. James P. Smith of the RAND Corporation conducted the most prominent investigation into this claim and concluded: ''The concern that educational generational progress among Latino immigrants has lagged behind other immigrant groups is largely unfounded.''
Some intelligent skeptics say that mobility is fine through the second generation but stalls by the third. It is indeed harder to rise in a more chaotic and fragmented society. But one of the country's leading immigration researchers, Richard Alba of the City University of New York, calls the third generation stall ''a statistical illusion.''
Much of the research that shows the effect compares today's third-generation immigrants with today's second-generation group. But the third-generation families originally came to the U.S. decades ago, at a time when segregation was prevalent, discrimination was high and immigrants were harshly treated. You'd expect those families to progress more slowly than families that came to more welcoming conditions a generation later.
Fifth, immigration opponents are trying to restrict skills. Current reform proposals would increase high-skill immigration. Opponents of reform are trying to restrict an infusion of people most likely to start businesses and invent things.
Alba points out that, over the next decades, the retirement of the baby-boomer generation will open up a large number of positions, especially atop the labor force. He points out that the fastest-growing ethnic groups are already rising to fill these slots. Whites occupy 80 percent of the top-paying jobs among older workers. But, among younger workers, whites occupy only 67 percent of the top jobs. The work force is already more diverse the younger you go.
Finally, opponents of reform are trying to hold back the inevitable. Whether immigration reform passes or not, the United States is going to become a much more cosmopolitan country than it is now. The country will look more like the faces you see at college commencement exercises and less like the faces you see in senior citizen homes.
One crucial question is whether America will be better off in that future with today's dysfunctional immigration laws or something else? Another interesting question is whether a major political party is going to consign itself to permanent irrelevance. If conservatives defeat immigration reform, the Republicans will definitely lose control of one thing for years to come: political power.

HEADLINE: Falling Short on Fit

BYLINE: By LAURIE TARKAN

 BODY:
Only 15 months old, Vivian Andorf underwent her sixth cardiac catheterization. Her cardiologist inserted a flexible tube through a tiny artery in her leg and wended it to her heart in an attempt to treat her narrowed veins and arteries, the result of a congenital condition.
In prior procedures, the first of which she had at a mere 3 weeks old, an adult-size catheter had to be used. Catheters sized for a child, let alone an infant, were not available. The larger catheter took longer to insert and was more likely to injure her already abnormal blood vessels, said her cardiologist, Dr. Alex Golden of the Cleveland Clinic Children's Hospital. 
''It's trying to put something too large into something smaller,'' he said.
But during the sixth procedure, Vivian became just the second young patient in the country to benefit from a catheter approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in children. It is a rare success in the field of pediatric medical devices.
The development of surgical tools and medical devices designed for children lags a decade behind device development for adults. The lag, say experts, can be blamed largely on economics. The pediatric market is far smaller than the market for adults, making it difficult for companies to recoup research and development expenses for smaller devices.
''Innovation in medicine is driven by need, but also by the market,'' said Dr. Michael R. Harrison, the director emeritus of the Fetal Treatment Center and the director of the Pediatric Device Consortium, both at the University of California, San Francisco. ''Big markets have lots of folks developing devices, but small markets like the pediatrics market don't.''
Take, for example, the field of knee and hip replacements in adults. ''There's been an incredible amount of investment and talent and innovation devoted to those things,'' said Dr. Harrison, ''but essentially none to pediatric orthopedic devices.''
So for decades, pediatric surgeons and other specialists have had to make do, using adult-size devices ''off label'' in children. They might chisel out their own smaller surgical tools in workshops, or jury-rig devices to squeeze into their tiny patients. Always, they contend with the extra challenges that come with using a device that's not quite right.
''Often we end up having to dramatically modify an operation simply to be able to implant a device in a child,'' said Dr. Pedro del Nido, chairman of the department of cardiac surgery at Boston Children's Hospital.
Among the adult devices used with children are stents, defibrillators, pacemakers, artificial mitral valves, chemotherapy delivery devices, kidney dialysis systems, and metal implants that help straighten a spine or replace a piece of bone.
Young patients often have to undergo multiple operations to resize or replace devices that no longer fit or have worn out, because they were not designed for the physiological changes of childhood. While the failure rate of defibrillators in adults is extremely low, for example, it's 20 to 25 percent in children, said Dr. del Nido.
''Children have growth spurts. Their immune systems and hormones are changing,'' said Barbara D. Boyan, the dean of the engineering school at Virginia Commonwealth University. ''You need to be able to adapt to different ages, different stages of development.''
At the same time, some pediatric conditions do not occur in adults or are best treated in childhood. These conditions are often completely ignored by medical device companies.
In 2007, Congress passed the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act, authorizing the F.D.A. to offer grants to stimulate the development of pediatric devices. The agency has given $11 million in grants to several university-based consortia. These groups offer seed money to developers and provide technical advice, assistance finding investors, and advice about navigating the regulatory process.
The consortia have assisted in more than 220 projects, which are in various stages of development.
Still, some believe that the grant money could be better spent. Tim Moran, the founder of Pediaworks, the nonprofit company that created the pediatric catheter, said that there's little market data on what pediatric devices are most needed, something he hopes to change.
Mr. Moran grew interested in pediatric devices after seeing his daughter, who was born prematurely, wince or scream in pain when devices designed for adults were used in her care. Mr. Moran surveyed pediatric cardiologists to identify their greatest needs and found that the catheter was high on the list. He eventually discovered a company in Japan that was making smaller catheters and created a joint venture to develop the catheter for children and to seek approval for it in the United States.
''I'd love to see the pediatric community as a whole identify the biggest device needs in their space,'' said Mr. Moran, who plans to survey doctors in about 20 specialties about their medical device needs.
But market data may not have helped someone like Tommy Blackshaw, who was born with a condition that is rare in children, mitral valve stenosis. At 22 months, his dysfunctional heart valve needed replacement. Because the adult-size artificial mitral valve was too large to fit in the proper position, it had to be implanted above it.
About six years later, the valve had to be replaced. Dr. del Nido, Tommy's cardiologist, believes that the less than ideal placement caused his heart to weaken. Tommy's heart began to fail when he was 13, and he was told he needed a heart transplant. He got one, on Valentine's Day, and he's doing well.
''It would have been less dangerous if they had a smaller valve,'' said his mother, Sandra Blackshaw of North Andover, Mass. ''But there were no options for him.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hope Seen for Afghanistan After Coalition Exits

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN and MATTHEW ROSENBERG

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Under Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the new commander of international forces here, the American-led military coalition is no longer aiming to change Afghanistan. Its focus now is on a far more narrow goal: readying Afghan forces to withstand the Taliban regardless of the country's looming political and economic troubles.
The rest, he said in an interview, is up to the Afghans.
Perhaps unsurprisingly for someone who says he sees the glass as ''half-full,'' General Dunford laid out a case for why he believes Afghan forces will step up as the coalition's long war here moves toward an official close. 
He offered a far more positive take on the prospects for this country than many longtime Western officials here, and a less critical one than many of his predecessors had offered. They had emphasized that long-term stability would require faith in the Afghan government, which could be achieved only if the rampant corruption and widespread rights abuses were reined in.
In describing his goals for the Western military endgame in Afghanistan, General Dunford kept a tight focus on definable training and security benchmarks, leaving much of the politics out. He boiled it down to three fundamental questions: Will the Afghan troops be able to assume lead responsibility for military operations? Will the Afghan security forces be able to give security to the Afghan people nationwide for the presidential elections scheduled for next April? And, will the international troops be able to transfer all authority to the Afghans at the end of 2014, when the International Security Assistance Force mission ends?
''The answer is yes,'' to all three questions, General Dunford said, even while readily noting that there was much work ahead to reach that level of readiness.
Referring to the growth in size and capabilities of the Afghan Army, in particular, he said: ''You can accuse me of being an optimist and I'll plead guilty. But to those people who think this can't happen, I would just ask them to look at the last two or three years and ask them why they can't imagine that we'll be on the same trajectory that we've been on the last two or three years,'' he said referring to the growth in size and capabilities of the Afghan Army, in particular.
While he acknowledged that corruption and human rights failures posed challenges, he appeared to see them as less-corrosive threats to the military mission than some of his predecessors did.
''Over time we'll continue to see, in fits and starts, corruption,'' he said. ''We'll still see predatory behavior, and the only way it's going to be fixed is when the Afghan people demand that it be different and when Afghan leadership demands that it be different.''
Asked whether widespread perceptions about corruption in the police force could actively help the Taliban, or at least hurt the government, he answered, ''This is not something that we can impose.''
Even as a fierce debate is being waged in Washington about how many troops to dedicate to the Afghan mission beyond the end of the international military mission in 2014, General Dunford, rather than weighing in publicly by making an argument for specific troop levels, has taken the tack of laying out a clearly defined picture of the areas where the Afghan military will need long-term help.
He noted several trouble spots: air support and transportation for the Afghan forces, command and control capabilities and a continuing struggle with attrition in the Afghan Army. The army loses 2 percent to 2.9 percent of its soldiers every month, according to the Pentagon's most recent semiannual report to Congress in December. That added up to more than 54,000 soldiers from September 2011 to September 2012, out of a total force that has hovered at barely 190,000, putting great pressure on the military's recruiting and training operations.
He has concluded as well that plans to reduce the number of Afghan security forces -- the army and police combined -- to 228,000 after 2015 from the current target level of 352,000 are not realistic, given the threats in the country. ''The consensus now both from the Afghans and certainly from us is that we ought to sustain that for some period time to come,'' said General Dunford, referring to the 352,000 head count.
What is less clear is how such a force could be paid for. The international community, led by the United States, has agreed to pay roughly $4.1 billion in aid per year for the Afghan security forces after 2014, based on estimates of what a smaller Afghan security contingent would cost. If the Afghans want to keep a larger force, they will either have to field a cheaper army and police force or come up with more money themselves to pay for it. General Dunford suggested that the Afghans could economize, although he did not give examples of where they might find the savings.
Just months into his command, his tenure has already been marked by tensions between American officials and PresidentHamid Karzai, who has criticized American Special Operations and intelligence missions in Afghanistan. General Dunford's approach to working with Mr. Karzai so far has borne out his reputation as a direct and pragmatic Marine officer: While he has not gone out of his way to forge personal trust with the Afghan leader, as some predecessors did, neither has he pushed Mr. Karzai to reform.
His style was particularly visible when Mr. Karzai demanded that all Western forces leave Wardak Province after Afghan civilians were abused by irregular Afghan forces operating under Western supervision. Instead, General Dunford agreed to withdraw the Special Operations forces from the district where the problems occurred and transfer training responsibilities there to the Afghans. He satisfied Mr. Karzai, but left intact much of the security structure in the turbulent province.
As Afghan forces increasingly take the lead in combat operations this year, General Dunford cast it as an opportunity for the Afghan government to prove to Afghans that it is defending them and to show the Taliban that now they are fighting fellow Muslims and countrymen, he said.
The Taliban will make every effort, in his words, ''to create the perception of insecurity.'' And he warned that the Haqqani group, a well-organized and financed branch of the insurgency in Pakistan's ungoverned tribal areas, remained ''one of the most virulent strains in the insurgency.''
Still, he said he believed this year's fighting season would be a turning point: ''I think the Taliban are going to come out of the gate and they are going to run into a brick wall -- and that brick wall is not going to be the coalition, it's going to be the Afghan security forces.''

HEADLINE: Propping Up Air Travel

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
A $300 domestic airline ticket now includes about $60 in taxes -- or 20 percent of the total fare -- which pays for things like air traffic controllers, airport improvements, customs and immigration inspections and checkpoint screening.
President Obama, in his 2014 budget request, has proposed increases in many of those taxes, a move that the airline industry opposes, arguing that passengers are already overtaxed. The recipients of these taxes counter that many of these fees have not increased in years, contributing to outdated systems, flight delays and long lines.
This is not the first time similar tax increases have been proposed -- and usually rejected. But given the current fiscal climate, and the recent sequestration-imposed furloughs of air traffic controllers, some aviation experts say it is time for a broader overhaul of air travel financing and oversight.
The debate largely centers on two questions lawmakers and industry representatives will have to wrestle with in the coming months: who should pay for the essential functions of the aviation system -- travelers or all taxpayers? And could tax increases be avoided if the money collected were spent more efficiently? 
''Instead of $61 on a typical $300 domestic ticket, that could go to $75,'' said John Heimlich, chief economist at Airlines for America, an industry trade association. ''We're not getting the most out of the money we're providing already.''
The largest share of those taxes -- $3.90 per flight segment, plus a 7.5 percent ticket tax -- goes to the Federal Aviation Administration, mostly for air traffic control. The agency has been criticized recently for failing to trim 5 percent of its budget (as required by the sequestration) without causing widespread flight delays.
In response to those delays, Congress passed legislation allowing the F.A.A. more flexibility in how to make the cuts, but the agency's spending has come under scrutiny, particularly in light of the airlines' flight cutbacks.
According to Airlines for America, the number of commercial flights fell 15 percent from 2001 to 2012, while the F.A.A.'s revenue from commercial aviation grew 37 percent. The airline business has changed greatly during that time, especially as fuel prices have skyrocketed.
''The tax structure we have today for aviation is a legacy of the regulated and even the pre-jet era,'' Mr. Heimlich said. Noting the belt-tightening that carriers have undertaken, he contended that government agencies like the F.A.A. could benefit from a similar overhaul.
''I see these agencies as part of our supply chain that have not gone through the same type of restructuring,'' he said.
Mr. Obama's budget proposal would also increase the taxes air travelers pay for customs inspections, to $7.50 from $5.50 for an international flight. And the tax used to pay for immigration services would increase to $9 from $7. Yet the travel industry has complained that waiting times to enter the United States have increased, sometimes stretching to hours at busy airports. It is not clear whether all the new revenue would be used to hire additional inspectors at those airports.
Another proposed tax increase would raise the security fee to $5 per one-way trip from $2.50 per flight segment, doubling the tax paid by passengers on nonstop flights. That money goes to the Transportation Security Administration, which has been criticized by Congress, the Government Accountability Office and passengers over wasteful spending.
Most of the additional money raised by the higher security fee would be used to reduce the deficit. The remainder would shift more of the burden of paying for security screening to air travelers instead of general taxpayers.
Right now, those travelers cover less than half of the T.S.A.'s budget through the security fee, leaving taxpayers to make up the difference -- a situation some researchers say they believe leads to a lack of accountability.
''If this were all paid for by the aviation sector, there would be a strong incentive for the aviation sector to call attention to poorly justified programs and get Congress to rein them in,'' said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research firm.
While he does not support taxing air travelers to reduce the deficit, he disagrees with the airline industry's characterization of existing travel taxes as ''sin taxes,'' arguing that they are not like taxes on cigarettes or alcohol.
''That is so bogus because every one of these taxes is an aviation excise tax -- it's all paying for infrastructure,'' Mr. Poole said. ''If these taxes didn't exist, the airlines would be paying for infrastructure through more use of direct fees.''
That user fee model is more common in other countries for services like air traffic control, and given the latest turmoil at the F.A.A., there is growing support for a similar approach in the United States.
Stephen Van Beek, a member of the F.A.A. Management Advisory Council, a group appointed by the transportation secretary, said there was unanimous consent among its members that changes needed to be made to the agency's oversight and financing model.
Mr. Van Beek cited the two dozen extensions of the F.A.A.'s authority that Congress approved before passing a reauthorization bill last year, Congressional influence over which air traffic towers the agency can close and other instances of politics taking precedence over sound business decisions, saying it was time for a new approach.
''I don't know how many more examples people need in order to determine we need to reform the system,'' he said. ''Congress today basically acts as a board of directors for the F.A.A.''
Mr. Van Beek, an executive director at the transportation consulting firm LeighFisher, also pointed out that the airline industry's shift toward charging fees for things like checked bags and priority seating had affected the agency's budget, since those fees were not subject to the 7.5 percent tax.
''When you reduce overall ticket prices and you raise ancillary fees, you're actually providing less money for air traffic controllers,'' he said.
As those fees proliferate, that loss of revenue is substantial. According to Airlines for America, revenue from baggage and change fees added up to an average of $23 a passenger in the first nine months of 2012 -- jumping from $2.50 a passenger in 2000.
If the airlines had instead simply raised fares by $20, the F.A.A. would have received almost $1 billion in additional revenue last year from ticket taxes, far more than the agency recently had to cut because of the sequestration. But there is not a consensus that additional revenue is necessary.
''If you let the F.A.A. run their operation as a commercial business,'' Mr. Van Beek said, ''we think they would have enough money.''

HEADLINE: In Manhattan Real Estate, Wealth and Power Are Relatives

BYLINE: By MICHAEL GROSS. 
Michael Gross is a journalist and author of several books on real estate, including ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building.'' He is completing a book about 15 Central Park West.

 BODY:
AT 10 p.m. Friday, my wife, my dog and I will be forced to evacuate our home because the boom of a construction crane atop a luxury condominium tower going up next door might possibly destroy our building. It won't be the first time: Last October, we had to evacuate for six days after Hurricane Sandy left the boom dangling precariously over West 57th Street, a situation that drew headlines worldwide. But this time, we're being forced out merely because the city government wants to save the developer of the tower money and time.
I'm not looking for sympathy. I live near Central Park in a landmark 1909 co-op, Alwyn Court, where apartments sell for as much as $2 million. And the developer of the tower has offered each household $1,500 to pay for hotel rooms for the 22 hours we'll have to evacuate. But in the world of New York City real estate, money, power and influence are all relative. In the tower next door, known as One57, penthouses have reportedly been sold for upward of $90 million. To the people who've bought them, $1,500 is chump change. And to the people who run this city, they matter. My neighbors and I -- as I hope this story will demonstrate -- don't. 
As the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy struck the city on Oct. 29, fierce winds loosened the boom from the crane. Twisting hundreds of feet above Midtown Manhattan, it threatened several landmark buildings, including Carnegie Hall and Alwyn Court, the safety of residents, and high-pressure steam and gas lines. That evening, on 20 minutes' notice, my wife and I found ourselves dragging a hastily packed suitcase and a sopping wet dog down Central Park South, walking toward the home of a friend who'd offered us shelter. Some of our neighbors, who range from demi-celebrities to a bedridden 95-year-old living in a rent-regulated apartment, weren't so lucky. At least one ended up in a public shelter.
At first, no one thought about the cost -- financial or emotional -- of being torn from their home on a moment's notice. We knew that many had it much, much worse. Some still do. We spent nearly a week as privileged refugees, first with our friend, then in a rented apartment. Our expenses mounted. We kept what receipts we could, hoping we'd be compensated.
Five days after we were allowed back home, we contacted Extell Development Company, which is building One57.
We were asked to submit a claim for reimbursement, which was promised ''within two to three weeks.'' Two months later, we were still waiting. And when a check for $1,397.81 finally arrived in late January -- from Extell's construction company, Lend Lease -- it was for about a quarter of what we'd asked for, which included lost income, since I work from home.
''Not the phone bill from the rented apartment, not the supplies from Gracious Home, not the laundry, not the spoilage, not the loss of income or the 'wasted utilities,' '' a factotum at Lend Lease e-mailed us, elaborating the denial of our claim. Our only alternative was to sue. We gave in, and signed a release.
We thought our mini-ordeal was over.
But in March, our co-op board president was invited to a meeting to discuss another evacuation. Then the meeting was put off. We didn't know what was going on until last week, when Extell told us that the New York City Buildings Department had decreed that a replacement boom would be hoisted up to the crane, necessitating another closure of West 57th Street and a 22-hour evacuation of three adjacent buildings, including ours.
Even as the real estate market recovers -- and in New York, it merely slowed during the Great Recession, compared to so many other parts of America -- construction tower cranes still climb up and down buildings.
So why isn't Extell simply bringing its crane down, attaching its new boom, and taking it up again, instead of creating and declaring an emergency and doing it all in a day? No one has offered an official explanation, but time and money seem the likely suspects. The billionaires who have signed up for units next door presumably are eager to move in -- or, in the case of those based overseas, at least move some furniture in.
Why did Extell ignore our co-op board's questions and expressions of concern until last Thursday, when it finally agreed to meet with us? Why were our building's representatives, and our neighbors, on one side of the table, and Extell, Lend Lease and representatives of the Buildings Department on the other, as if it was us against them? Why was the Buildings Department's order to vacate not sent until 6:25 p.m. Friday, when it arrived in our board president's office in-box?
Could it be that giving us merely a week's notice would make it virtually impossible for us to protest with any effect?
The city's behavior has been disgraceful. According to a zoning-lot development agreement for the One57 project, Extell was supposed to give us 10 days' notice before filing any changes to its plans with the Buildings Department. Such notice hasn't arrived, according to our board president.
When The New York Times published a story Sunday about our forthcoming evacuation, some friends told me we were lucky that Extell had offered each Alwyn household $1,500 in compensation for the coming inconvenience. After the article appeared, Extell, on Monday, dropped a demand that we again present receipts before we can get reimbursed for that $1,500.
When Alwyn Court opened in 1909, it was touted as one of the finest and most expensive buildings in Manhattan. Now, there's a new kid on the block and it's expensive for sure. I don't know how fine it will be, but I do know that it, or the people behind it, are very influential.
''The DOB has rubber-stamped literally hundreds of after-hours variances for Extell/Lend Lease on the One57 project,'' the president of a neighboring co-op wrote to ours on Sunday. ''Extell filed some papers professing hardship and the DOB has no qualms about approving literally anything, as far as we can see.''
Moreover, while Extell has told us that it has obtained $100 million in insurance, we haven't seen any proof of it, and besides, it's not much comfort to my neighbors and me. Should anything happen to our building, an architecturally revered structure, this weekend, our loss will surely be greater than the merely material.
On an island apocryphally purchased for $24 nearly four centuries ago, the convergence of money and power is an old story. Again, I'm not asking for pity. But the handling of One57's crane is a telling tale about the disparities between relative affluence and comfort (my family's) and astronomical, Croesus-and-Midas levels of wealth (One57's). Maybe, one day, people will look up at Extell's glass tower the same way they now do Alwyn Court, but somehow I doubt it.
Extell has announced plans for another tower, 50 percent taller, half a block away, and assuming it's allowed to build that one, too, it will shortly steal One57's thunder. Big real estate rules this island, and it always will.

HEADLINE: Slowdown in Increase of Health Care Costs May Persist, Helping Wages and the Deficit

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of the economic mysteries of the last few years has been the bigger-than-expected slowdown in health spending, a trend that promises to bolster wages and help close the wide federal deficit over the long term -- but only if it persists.
Major new studies from researchers at Harvard University, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and elsewhere have concurred that at least some of the slowdown is unrelated to the recession, and might persist as the economy recovers. David M. Cutler, the Harvard health economist and former Obama adviser, estimates that, given the dynamics of the slowdown, economists might be overestimating public health spending over the next decade by as much as $770 billion. 
Between 2009 and 2011, total health spending grew at the lowest annual pace in the last five decades, at just 3.9 percent a year, although rising out-of-pocket costs have hit millions of families. In contrast, between 2000 and 2007, those annual growth figures ranged between 6.2 and 9.7 percent, according to government figures. Data from the Altarum Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Ann Arbor, Mich., suggests that the low pace of growth has continued through 2012 and early 2013.
The studies -- including some released Monday in the journal Health Affairs -- shed new light on the precise mix of factors that have led to the flattening-out.
Economists concur that the deep recession and sluggish recovery are the main reasons for slowing growth in spending. During the recession, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and thus their insurance coverage; millions more struggling families were reluctant to see a physician or undergo a procedure. But the slowdown in health costs proved steeper than forecast. It also occurred in populations whose health spending was mostly sheltered from the economic gyrations, like Medicare patients.
That led economists to surmise that other factors were at play. In new research, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the recession accounted for about three-quarters of the lower spending trajectory, with the rest attributed to other factors not directly related to the economy. Professor Cutler of Harvard calculates that the recession accounted for about 37 percent.
Among other factors, the studies found that rising out-of-pocket payments had played a major role in the decline. The proportion of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance enrolled in a plan that required a deductible climbed to about three-quarters in 2012 from about half in 2006, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found. Moreover, those deductibles -- the amount a person needs to pay before insurance steps in to cover claims -- have risen sharply. That exposes workers to a larger share of their own health costs, and generally forces them to spend less.
Thus, while economists have cheered the flattening in health spending, families have assumed more and more of the health care burden: even if households benefit from the slower growth in health costs in the long term, they might suffer in the short term as their out-of-pocket health costs rise at a painful economic time to begin with.
''The slowdown in health costs is completely unreal to average people,'' said Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ''Experts measure aggregate spending. But people's costs have gone up 140 percent over the past 10 years, while wages only went up 40 percent.''
In a new study in Health Affairs, Michael E. Chernew of the Harvard Medical School and his co-authors estimate that rising out-of-pocket payments, like deductibles and copays, account for about 20 percent of the decline in health spending.
Other major factors include lower Medicare payment rates, the less-rapid development of new medical treatments -- especially prescription drugs -- and changes in the way that insurers pay health care providers. Over the last decade, for instance, hundreds of hospitals and doctors have started to accept ''bundled payments'' for a course of treatment, rather than charging per procedure. Many health systems have also forged agreements with insurers to move away from fee-for-service medicine, instead writing contracts that compensate them for delivering less, but higher-quality care.
Policy makers in Washington consider that last change to be one of the most promising ones, though economists say they believe it is only just starting to show up in health spending statistics -- if at all. ''For a few years, it was like what Bob Solow used to say about computers and productivity growth -- you could see it everywhere but in the numbers,'' said Professor Cutler of Harvard.
Forecasters generally expect the low pace of health cost growth to continue through 2013.
But come 2014, the significant expansion of insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act will start to increase national health spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, although the underlying pace of inflation might remain low. Consolidation among medical providers also might start to push up the pace of cost growth, a more worrisome trend in the long term.
The economic recovery and falling unemployment should lead to higher spending, too. ''Some return to higher spending is baked into a stronger economy,'' said Mr. Altman of the Kaiser Family Foundation. ''That's going to be blamed on the A.C.A., and it shouldn't be.''
But health economists are hopeful that the dozens of provisions in the Affordable Care Act designed to hold down costs might kick in as other factors fade. ''My sense is that it's really gathering speed,'' Professor Cutler said of changes away from fee-for-service medicine. ''Folks were taking tentative steps before the Supreme Court decision came down, but now everybody knows it's locked in and the governors are deciding about the Medicaid expansion. If you're a hospital executive, you're now saying: 'I need to figure out how I'm going to adjust to this.' ''
Over the long term, a reduction in health inflation could be a boon for both families and the federal government. Policy makers consider rising health costs to be the biggest threat to the budget. Rising health costs have also eaten up more of workers' pay, contributing to the decline in real incomes over the last 15 years.

HEADLINE: Intervene With Western Aid

BYLINE: By GILLES DORRONSORO, ADAM BACZKO and ARTHUR QUESNAY

 BODY:
The international community has given up hope for a negotiated settlement in Syria. All talk has turned to whether rebels should be armed to hasten the fall of the Assad regime. This debate, however, is often framed as a lose-lose situation: Arms could fall into the wrong hands, but not providing them means the civil war could tip in Assad's favor.
That's a false choice. The United States and the international community must help rebel groups build a state within the area they hold or risk more radical elements hijacking the revolution and taking control of Syria. 
In our recent trips in northern Syria it was obvious that the continuation of the conflict favors radical groups and risks destabilizing the entire region. Western countries are providing very limited support to the opposition, and this disinterest is misunderstood by Syrians after the interventions in Libya and Mali.
In the meantime, Gulf countries are financing specific armed groups, further increasing fragmentation and radicalization within the insurgency. This situation favors groups like Jabhat al-Nusra -- and Syria is just one step in its internationalist, jihadist strategy -- and the regime, which tries to impose a sectarian narrative on the Syrian revolution to gain the support of minorities and the international community.
With the debate in the West focused on supplying or withholding arms to rebel groups, these important realities are being overlooked. The fear of inadvertently supporting an Islamist takeover is delaying efforts to reconstruct the state where insurgents are already in control.
This must change. Today the nascent insurgent institutions lack the resources to assert their authority. While there are courts and other civilian structures in the north that will hopefully serve as the core of a new Syrian state, these institutions remain fragile. Damascus is no longer paying the salaries of civil servants living in the liberated zones and there is no budget to sustain basic public services.
Without foreign funds to support these activities, more radical groups with foreign sponsors have a chance to step in. And Syrians are in desperate need of governance. It is a war-ravaged economy with millions of refugees and displaced persons, and we met many people this winter struggling to stay warm, find food and get healthy.
The opposition requires foreign aid. So instead of perpetuating the back and forth argument on directly arming rebel groups, the West should adopt a type of aid that doesn't face the same technical or political hurdles at home. A political consensus on civilian aid is much more likely in Washington and European capitals. And the Syrian population is sufficiently trained to redistribute the funds and deliver services at the local level.
The advantages of using Western aid to establish governing institutions in liberated areas are clear.
First, inaction is fueling anti-Western hostility. The image of the West among the people of Syria, and Muslim populations more broadly, will be greatly improved if people see foreign aid supporting their daily lives. This will also help give a future Syrian government popular backing for establishing good relations with the United States and Europe.
Second, the installation of effective civil and political organizations will marginalize the more radical groups. Indeed, the rise and strength of Jabhat al-Nusra relies heavily on the current difficulties of the insurgency to administer the distribution of food and basic supplies. Bolstering national institutions now helps ensure that extremist groups don't come out on top of the war.
And third, military progress in the coming months needs to go hand in hand with building a good governing organization that can minimize the disorder after Assad's ouster. Establishing a legal system will both contain jihadis and curtail the impulse for reprisals against the Alawites and other minorities perceived to be on the side of current rulers.
Assad will ultimately fall, but the Syria that emerges from the ashes of a civil war is undecided. The international community has an opportunity to shape the future Syria and limit the long-term downsides of the struggle's aftermath. To do so, the United States and its allies must give assistance to the opposition so it can build a government-in-waiting in insurgent-held areas before it's too late.

HEADLINE: Australian Tobacco Rules Are Challenged by Cuba

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Cuba is seeking to overturn Australia's tough tobacco-labeling rules at the World Trade Organization, the trade body said Monday, the first time that Havana has used the forum to directly confront another nation over its commercial laws.
Cuba, the world's dominant producer of fine cigars, has filed a ''request for consultations'' with Australia, Keith Rockwell, a spokesman for the W.T.O., said from Geneva, where the organization is based. 
The two nations now have 60 days to reach an agreement, he said; if they fail to resolve their differences in that time, the next step would be for Cuba to begin a formal challenge with the establishment of a dispute resolution panel.
The request was filed on Friday but made public on Monday, Mr. Rockwell said.
Cuba is joining Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in challenging Australia's tobacco-labeling laws at the W.T.O. All four nations argue that provisions of a 2011 Australian law, the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act, have created ''technical barriers'' to trade and violate intellectual property rights.
If Australia is ultimately found to have broken W.T.O. rules, it must either bring its laws into conformity or face retaliation in the form of increased duties on Australian goods.
As part of a national anti-smoking drive, Australia has passed some of the world's toughest laws on the labeling of cigars, cigarettes and other tobacco products, prohibiting ''the use of logos, brand imagery, and promotional text'' and strictly regulating the use of brand names. Tobacco products in Australia are sold in standard dark green boxes with gruesome images of people with diseases caused by smoking.
Australian and Cuban officials could not immediately be reached on Monday for comment.
Cuba, seeking to reinvigorate a stagnant economy, has in recent years allowed more free-market activity. It joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, soon after the group's founding, but has never before brought a formal challenge. It has been involved in cases brought by others, including a dispute between the spirits makers Pernod Ricard and Bacardi over U.S. rights to the Havana Club rum brand.
Cuba exported $215 million in cigars in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available, according to the National Statistics Agency. Cigar sales are handled by Habanos, a 50-50 joint venture between the Cuban state tobacco company and Altidis, a unit of Imperial Tobacco.
Habanos said exports of Cuban cigars rose in 2012 despite the economic slump in Spain and France, its top two markets, as sales to China, its No. 3 market, rose 6 percent. A U.S. embargo imposed in 1962 prohibits the import of Cuban cigars into the United States.
Emily Morris, an expert on the Cuban economy at University College London, said that overseas cigar sales make up only about 1.3 percent of Cuba's total exports and that Australia was just a small part of that. ''They're keen on trademark protection for their premium cigars,'' Ms. Morris said. ''A lot of the buying of cigars is based on the wonderful packaging.''
Cuba's willingness to bring a W.T.O. case shows that ''it has got a lot at stake in intellectual property now,'' she said, including in the pharmaceutical sector, where it earns more than $500 million a year.
The case puts Cuba in curious company in seeking to overturn a democratic country's health laws in the interest of its tobacco exports. The global tobacco industry spent millions of dollars in an unsuccessful campaign against the Australian law, and continues to resist efforts by others, including the European Union, to adopt similar laws.
Nevertheless, New Zealand officials have said they are planning to follow Australia's packaging example by sometime next year.
Victoria Burnett contributed reporting from Havana.

HEADLINE: Israel and Turkey in Talks Over Deadly Flotilla Raid

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Talks here on Monday between Israeli and Turkish officials over compensation for a deadly Israeli commando raid on a Gaza-bound flotilla almost three years ago demonstrated that while relations between the two countries are improving, they will not be as warm as they once were.
The Turkish delegation, led by the under secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Feridun Hadi Sinirlioglu, was the highest-level diplomatic mission to visit Israel since relations were frozen. But the Turks kept a low profile, and the sides put out a brief statement revealing little about the discussions other than to say that an agreement was near. 
Israeli officials and analysts say they do not see a return to the intimate Israeli-Turkish alliance of past decades, when the Israeli, Turkish and American Navies carried out joint exercises in the Mediterranean and Israeli fighter jets trained in Turkey's relatively vast airspace.
Yet bilateral trade is thriving, and in recent months Turkish exporters have started using Israel as a trade corridor, with Turkish shipping lines docking in Israeli ports, then transporting goods overland to Jordan and other Arab countries in order to bypass the bloody civil war in Syria.
''This is not so much about going back to the old alliance,'' said Gallia Lindenstrauss, an expert on Turkey at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, ''but about lowering the level of hostility between the two countries.''
Israeli officials view the trade corridor as an important, even strategic, development. Ms. Lindenstrauss said it showed Turkish recognition of Israel as a stable partner when much of the Middle East is in turmoil. Any improvement in the atmosphere between the leaders, she added, would be likely to contribute to increased cooperation at the unofficial level.
Turkey used to be Israel's closest ally in the region and its most important partner in the Muslim world. But relations began to sour over Israel's three-week offensive against the Hamas militant group controlling Gaza in the winter of 2008-9, which came after years of rocket fire by Gaza militants against southern Israel. Up to 1,400 Palestinians were killed during the campaign, hundreds of them civilians, and the prime minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accused Israel of attempted genocide.
The strategic partnership plummeted further in May 2010 when eight Turks and an American of Turkish descent were killed after Israeli commandos met resistance aboard a vessel seeking to break the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. Turkey sharply downgraded its diplomatic and military ties with Israel in September 2011, angrily expelling the Israeli ambassador after Israel refused to apologize.
President Obama brokered Turkish-Israeli reconciliation when he visited Israel in March, urging renewed cooperation between the two important American allies as the deterioration in Syria threatened to spill over and destabilize the broader region.
As part of the agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel officially apologized for operational mistakes that led to deaths in the raid and promised compensation and a further easing of restrictions on Gaza. Once the terms of compensation have been reached, Israel and Turkey are meant to normalize ties and send envoys to each other's nations.
But few here expect a drastic turnaround in military cooperation.
More likely, an Israeli official said, was a sharing of assessments and intelligence on the Syrian issue, perhaps not bilaterally, but in a regional framework, with Jordan, presided over by the United States.
''The apology was not an easy decision for Israel,'' said another Israeli official, who also asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. ''The prime minister took the decision in order to restore the relationship and create a normalcy in relations. It is our hope that the Turks will respond in kind.''
In view of the potentially explosive situation in Syria and grave concern about the chemical weapons stockpiles there, he added, ''we would like ideally to have a more open and honest conversation with the Turks about how to meet these challenges.''
At the same time, trade between the two countries peaked at $4 billion in 2011, split almost evenly between imports and exports, according to Israel's Ministry of Economy, up from $300 million in 1997 after a Free Trade Arrangement was signed. A ministry report said private trade was not affected by the flotilla episode, although government and defense contracts had dropped off. Some Israelis note that had it not happened, there could have been even greater commercial growth.
In the past, trade between the two countries was mostly defense related, but in more recent years that market has been overtaken by civilian goods. Among other things, Israel imports textiles and minerals from Turkey while Turkey imports chemicals, agricultural equipment and seeds.
One question that may be answered in part this summer is whether Turkey will go back to being a favorite destination for Israeli vacationers. All-inclusive packages to Turkey's coastal resorts attracted up to half a million Israeli tourists a year until the flotilla episode brought tourism almost to a halt.
The day after Mr. Netanyahu offered his apology, Israeli television stations sent correspondents to Antalya to check out the new luxury hotels that had opened up. Some vendors in the local markets showed off their Hebrew and said that they would welcome the Israelis back.

HEADLINE: Professor Apologizes For Remarks on Keynes

BYLINE: By NOAM COHEN

 BODY:
The Harvard professor and economics commentator Niall Ferguson issued ''an unqualified apology'' over the weekend for suggesting that John Maynard Keynes was indifferent to the long-term implications of his economic theories because Keynes was gay and had no children. 
Mr. Ferguson, who is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard, has been an outspoken critic of Keynesian economics, warning that high government deficits would hurt economic growth, rather than help it, as Keynesians argue.
The comments Mr. Ferguson apologized for came in response to an audience question on Thursday at the Strategic Investment Conference in Carlsbad, Calif., where he was a featured speaker. The questioner mentioned the familiar Keynes adage favoring immediate government intervention in the economy: ''in the long run we are all dead.''
According to a reporter for Financial Advisor, Mr. Ferguson's language described Keynes as ''effete,'' and said about his marriage to a Russian ballerina that he was more likely to be speaking with her of ''poetry'' rather than procreation.
In his apology, Mr. Ferguson stood by his criticisms of Keynesianism, but completely repudiated his reasoning last week: ''My disagreements with Keynes's economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation. It is simply false to suggest, as I did, that his approach to economic policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal life.''
That a prominent professor is apologizing for comments about Keynes more than 60 years after his death speaks to his still central role in the debate over the role of government in the economy.
Online, Mr. Ferguson's comments became a proxy for that debate.
At National Review, the opinion ranged from those who worried that his comments gave the other side an easy argument against austerity, to those like Jonah Goldberg, who wrote that Mr. Ferguson's argument was a common one. Mr. Goldberg listed the many conservative writers who had tied Keynes's views to his childlessness and gay relationships.
George Chauncey, a Yale scholar of gays in American history, in an interview emphasized that he was not weighing in on the economic arguments involved, but noted that Mr. Ferguson's comments resembled past attempts to undercut gays in public life. ''The idea that homosexuals are so self-centered that they pose a threat to the family, to the social order has become a habit of thought'' in America, he noted, reaching its peak in the 1950s.
Rather than in the world of ideas, ''the most excruciating pressure was put on gay people who were rising into senior ranks of management,'' he said, adding ''the fact that a man wasn't married was a bar to reaching the highest levels of authority of corporation.''
In his blog post, Mr. Ferguson described his comments as ''doubly stupid.''
''First, it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations,'' he wrote. And he apologized for a factual error. Referring to Keynes's marriage to Lydia Lopokova, he wrote: ''I had forgotten that Keynes's wife Lydia miscarried.''

HEADLINE: Intelligence on North Korea, and Its New Leader, Remains Elusive

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and CHOE SANG-HUN; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea. Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The black hole of North Korea intelligence gathering is getting blacker.
When President Obama and South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, meet for the first time at the White House on Tuesday, intelligence officials and outside experts say, they will be working, by necessity, from a deeply incomplete understanding of their common adversary. At a time when the United States has learned to conduct drone strikes with increasing accuracy in Pakistan, and direct cyberweapons at specific nuclear centrifuges deep under the Iranian desert, its understanding of North Korea's leadership and weapons systems has actually gotten worse.
The most recent intelligence failures included what administration officials now acknowledge was the C.I.A.'s initial judgment -- now reversed -- that the North's young new leader, Kim Jong-un, was probably more interested in economic reform than in following his father's and grandfather's ''military first'' policy of bolstering the North's missile and nuclear arsenals, and threatening to use them unless the world came to its door. 
At the same time, North Korea's ability to hide critical facts about its weapons capability has improved. Nearly three months after the North's third nuclear test dangerously escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the United States remains unable to answer the most crucial question about the blast: whether the country figured out a way to enrich uranium and dramatically speed its nuclear buildup. The North has managed to contain the telltale gases that would have provided the answer, thwarting American efforts to sniff out the evidence from Air Force sensors flown along the North Korean coast.
Since then, new mobile missile systems have appeared and then been whisked out of the view of spy satellites, leaving their whereabouts, to say nothing of their ability to reach Guam or the West Coast of the United States, uncertain. American officials said Monday that two missiles they once believed the North could launch imminently had been moved from launching sites, perhaps a sign that for now, at least, the North wants to de-escalate.
In a sign of continuing confusion, the Defense Intelligence Agency -- the Pentagon's intelligence arm -- recently declared with ''moderate confidence'' that the North can now shrink a nuclear warhead to fit onto one of those missiles, only to find its assessment disputed, in public, by both President Obama and the director of national intelligence.
''We lack uniform agreement on assessing many things in North Korea,'' the director, James R. Clapper Jr., recently told Congress in a blunt assessment of the disagreements within the intelligence world. ''Its actual nuclear capabilities are no exception.''
The depth of the inability to figure out what is happening was reflected on Thursday in an unclassified Pentagon report to Congress on North Korea's military capabilities, which read much like it had been written in the late 1980s. It also cast, by implication, significant doubt that returning to negotiations would do much good: ''In North Korea's view,'' it concluded, ''the destruction of regimes such as Ceausescu, Hussein and Qaddafi was not an inevitable consequence of repressive government, but rather of a failure to secure the necessary capabilities to defend their respective autocratic regime's survival.''
But the more immediate concern is that Kim Jong-un could follow North Korea's recent playbook and create another provocation -- akin to the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in 2010 or the recent cyberattack on South Korean banks and news media companies. It took weeks of investigation before South Korea could blame the North for those past provocations.
More broadly, the lapses also raise a question of why, 63 years after the outbreak of the Korean War -- itself a move the United States did not see coming -- gathering information about the North has, in the words of one frequent intelligence consumer, ''made Syria and Iran look like an open book.''
At the same time, Mr. Kim has stepped up efforts to collect information about South Korea, as evidenced by the recent arrest in Seoul of a North Korean homemaker who posed as a defector to the South.
''It's an open question, who has penetrated whom more effectively,'' said Gary Samore, Mr. Obama's former director for weapons of mass destruction.
North Korea has always been the hardest target, but the difficulties of figuring out what is happening now range from longstanding to brand new. The North has long been among the most brutal police states in the world, ''very good at scouting human spies,'' says one American intelligence official, ''and finishing them off fast.'' Thus, South Korean intelligence services have a hard time inserting agents. It is all but impossible for an outsider to travel unnoticed to the North, a land of many checkpoints, few cars and a lot of neighborhood informers.
Moreover, the technique that has been so useful in the case of Iran -- recruiting scientists and others at international conferences -- has been virtually impossible in the case of the North, whose officials rarely travel. When they do venture abroad, there are political officers and other minders who monitor what they do and say. Even the biggest potential bonanza -- the arrival of cellphone networks -- has been of limited use to intelligence gatherers.
And the technique used so effectively on Iran through 2010 -- cyberespionage, and ultimately an attack on the centrifuges that run its nuclear enrichment center at Natanz -- does not appear to have been as useful in North Korea. Computer use there is so limited -- as is Internet access -- that America's technological advantage has yielded fewer results, according to officials familiar with the efforts. The North, meanwhile, has become more skilled at launching cyberattacks -- some through China -- at South Korean banks and television networks, including a devastating series of intrusions in March.
But the heart of the intelligence weakness centers on Mr. Kim, who is thought to be in his late 20s. The Chinese, who regularly invited his father, Kim Jong-il, to Beijing for consultations, praise and occasional dressing-downs, contend they have had few meetings with him. The only American to have dealt with him, quite famously, is Dennis Rodman, the former basketball star, whom the F.B.I. was reported to have debriefed after he returned from a recent trip to North Korea.
''There was a time that he was trying to open up the nation with Western-style reforms,'' Japan's defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, said of Mr. Kim in an interview last week during a visit to Washington. ''We were impressed that he admires Disneyland and loves American basketball. But then he realized he could not control the country, and he moved back to the military-first policy.'' Mr. Onodera said he was worried that ''his father and his grandfather knew when to shift to 'peace mode' and shake hands; it seems that Kim Jong-un doesn't know when to put his fist down.''
In fact, in South Korea there is a theory that behind his baby-faced look and easy smile is a Machiavellian who already has top generals and party secretaries cowering at home, and is gambling that he can force Washington to accept the North as a nuclear power.
South Korean officials were surprised to conclude in recent months that despite Mr. Kim's youth and inexperience, his government and party are exerting control over the military, which many regarded as too influential and too corrupt for that to occur. By some counts, two-thirds of the North's senior generals have been demoted, replaced or shunted to less-powerful jobs; a few have been banished by the young leader. All have had to sign loyalty letters.
Yet the view that Mr. Kim has become as powerful as his father is not universal. ''Who is in charge in North Korea? It's hard to say,'' said a senior South Korean policy maker. ''How strong is Kim Jong-un? We don't know exactly. Who is giving orders in Pyongyang? Apparently, it's Kim Jong-un, but we are not sure about the inner-circle decision-making process.''
It is a measure of the varying interpretations inside the United States government that, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, the head of the Pacific Command, called Mr. Kim '' impetuous'' and ''more unpredictable'' than his father. But speaking to the same committee, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the Defense Intelligence Agency's director, called Mr. Kim a leader ''firmly in control'' who ''possesses a charisma that his father did not,'' and who understands realpolitik, including that he could not survive full-scale war.
Mr. Kim's government has also played a complex game with American intelligence agencies. He knew the West would be intensely interested in whether he tested another plutonium weapon or his first uranium weapon, the product of a new uranium-enrichment capacity that the North has only just unveiled.
But the test site was sealed to make it harder to gather atmospheric evidence. ''It's inevitable that sooner or later they will want us to know they can make a uranium weapon,'' said Mr. Samore, the former Obama adviser. ''But no one knows quite why he is waiting.'' One possible explanation for the secrecy is that the technology is not working as advertised: a combination of rookie errors and sabotage have long slowed Iran's efforts with the same technology.

HEADLINE: After Years of Battling, Bank of America and MBIA Settle Mortgage Dispute

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
8:29 p.m. | Updated
Bank of America and MBIA, the troubled bond insurer, have reached a $1.7 billion agreement to settle a long-running legal dispute over mortgage-backed securities that became troubled when the financial crisis blossomed.
The deal, which was announced on Monday, provides a lifeline to MBIA, which stood in danger of being unable to meet its obligations in a few weeks' time. And the agreement will turn Bank of America from bitter foe to equity investor in, and major lender to, the insurer. 
The battle between the two financial giants had its beginnings in transactions before the financial crisis between MBIA and two companies -- Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial -- that Bank of America acquired during the crisis.
Merrill Lynch was in a position to collect billions from the insurer -- if it had enough cash to meet its obligations.
But it seemed unlikely that MBIA could come up with the cash unless Countrywide agreed to pay billions to settle claims that it had misled the insurer regarding the quality of mortgages in securitizations insured by MBIA, and had failed to honor its obligations to repurchase those mortgages.
Now the multibillion-dollar claims the institutions had against each other will be canceled out. Under the agreement, Bank of America will pay $1.6 billion in cash to MBIA, and will lend the firm another $500 million. It also acquired warrants that, if exercised, would give the bank a 4.9 percent stake in the insurer. In addition, the bank will surrender to MBIA about $130 million in MBIA bonds.
Bank of America said the agreement would reduce its previously announced first quarter after-tax profits by $1.1 billion, or 10 cents a share, but would improve its capital position. MBIA indicated that the settlement would have little impact on its profits, but said its first-quarter results, scheduled to be released on Thursday, would be delayed.
The agreement also appears to remove any practical chance that MBIA's split into two companies will be reversed. One company, National, is taking over the municipal bond insurance policies. The other, known as MBIA Corporation, backs the insurance the company issued on securitized products and on credit-default swaps. Both remain subsidiaries of the parent, MBIA Inc.
Jay Brown, MBIA's chief executive, said the agreement ''sets the stage for National to reclaim its leadership in the U.S. public finance insurance market.''
Shares of MBIA soared on word of the settlement, rising $4.46, or 45 percent, to $14.29. Bank of America shares surged 64 cents, or 5 percent, to $12.88.
Before the settlement, it appeared that within weeks the insurer would owe as much as $3 billion to Merrill Lynch stemming from credit-default swaps issued by MBIA concerning commercial real estate transactions.
MBIA Corporation had met earlier obligations by borrowing money from National, the municipal bond part of the company.
But Benjamin Lawsky, the New York State financial services superintendent, refused to allow further loans, and it was expected that MBIA Corporation might be put into receivership before it had to pay Merrill Lynch.
In an interview, Mr. Lawsky said negotiations had been going on for more than a year, but accelerated in the last couple of weeks. ''There was a way to get to yes because everyone had claims on everyone else,'' he said. The agreement, he said ''resolves significant exposure and expensive litigation for Bank of America, while also giving MBIA a path forward.''
MBIA originally insured municipal bonds, a profitable business because few such bonds ever defaulted and municipalities buying the insurance would get AAA ratings on their bonds, saving them more in interest payments than the insurance cost because many muni bond investors were very risk-averse.
It later expanded into insuring securitizations and writing credit-default swaps, businesses in which the purchasers were more sophisticated. When the financial crisis struck, it became clear that the company had taken some very bad risks.
In 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, which later was folded into the Department of Financial Services, approved a decision by MBIA to split into the two companies. Banks and hedge funds that owned securities insured by MBIA went to court to try to reverse the split. In March, MBIA prevailed in one of those suits, as Justice Barbara R. Kapnick of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the insurance department had wide latitude to approve the split with or without much investigation.
She cited a deposition by Michael Moriarty, the then-deputy superintendent of the department, who said ''the department did not, nor do they usually, verify the financial condition of a company.'' Since that was the policy, the judge concluded she had no authority to question it, even if some information provided by the company was false.
Bank of America had vowed to appeal that decision, raising the possibility that an appellate court would order a trial that could be embarrassing to the state regulator. Under the settlement, the bank will drop that appeal.
Some MBIA legal disputes remain. Société Générale, the French bank, remains a plaintiff in the suit over the split, and that dispute seems likely to cost MBIA perhaps $200 million to settle. MBIA is also pursuing complaints against ResCap, a mortgage company previously owned by General Motors' finance arm, and against Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank. Settlement of those disputes potentially could bring in more than $500 million to MBIA.
Another suit against the MBIA split was filed by hedge funds that feared their insurance claims would not be honored. That suit is still pending, but the agreement would make it harder to pursue since all the information the bank obtained in disclosure from MBIA would be returned to the insurer.
Bank of America had bought the bonds in an effort to frustrate MBIA's effort to change their terms. By turning over the bonds to the insurer, it now seems likely MBIA can change the terms. The expectation is that MBIA will eventually resell the bonds to investors, providing cash for the company.
The money provided by Bank of America will largely be used to repay the loans National made to MBIA Corporation, solidifying National's finances.
Under the warrants, Bank of America will have the right for the next five years to purchase 9.94 million shares of MBIA for $9.59 a share. If the warrant is exercised, that would provide the insurer with another $95 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Pfizer Turning to Internet to Sell Viagra

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Pfizer has taken the unusual step of selling its erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra, to consumers on its Web site, in an effort to establish a presence in the huge online market for the popular blue pill, considered to be one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world.
Viagra is one of Pfizer's marquee drugs -- the company said it brought in more than $2 billion in sales in 2012 -- but some drug experts estimate Pfizer could be losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a prolific black market of online pharmacies that cater to men too embarrassed to buy the drug through traditional means. As of Monday, in an arrangement with CVS/pharmacy, patients in the United States with a valid prescription for Viagra are able to fill their order through the new Web site, where the sentence ''Buy real Viagra'' is featured prominently. Patients will still need to visit a doctor, but they will be spared the additional trip to the pharmacy counter. 
If Pfizer's move is successful, more drug makers could follow suit, especially for other products that treat conditions carrying social stigmas, such as weight loss. ''This could be the prelude to a vast number of products'' of medical importance being sold online, said Roger Bate, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an expert in counterfeit drugs.
But others cautioned against such predictions, saying that Viagra might be particularly well suited to online sales because of its powerful brand recognition and the widespread competition from counterfeiters.
Victor Clavelli, a marketing executive at Pfizer whose portfolio includes Viagra, said the drug appeared in about 24 million Internet searches a year, often in phrases like ''buy Viagra'' -- well in excess of the approximately eight million Viagra prescriptions written in the United States last year, according to the research firm IMS Health. ''A lot of those patients get diverted into an illegal counterfeit market,'' Mr. Clavelli said. ''Our goal is to just make sure those patients actually get the real Viagra.''
Since Viagra arrived on the market in 1998, Pfizer has sought to minimize the stigma around male impotence -- rebranded as erectile dysfunction, or E.D. -- by enlisting celebrity endorsers like the former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and encouraging men to have the ''Viagra talk'' with their doctors.
But even as men flooded doctors' offices for prescriptions for what is commonly known as ''the little blue pill,'' others turned to a vigorous black market, whose growth mirrored an explosion in online commerce. ''Viagra is one of the classics,'' said Mr. Bate. ''Diet pills for women and erectile dysfunction medicines for men are the most sought-after medicines online.''
Matthew J. Bassiur, vice president of Pfizer Global Security, said in a statement that the company had seen counterfeit medicines manufactured ''in filthy and deplorable conditions, yet some people do not realize the risks that this poses to their health and safety, our top priority.'' He added that samples of counterfeit Viagra tested by Pfizer labs had contained ''pesticides, wallboard, commercial paint and printer ink.''
''These findings,'' Mr. Bassiur said, ''motivate us to continue our aggressive global efforts to stop those who prey on unsuspecting patients.''
Pfizer said it conducted a survey in 2011 in which it evaluated 22 Web sites appearing in the top search results for the phrase ''buy Viagra.'' Chemical analyses found that about 80 percent of the pills were counterfeit. The fake Viagra pills contained only about 30 to 50 percent of the active ingredient, sildenafil citrate, compared with the actual product.
Not all medicines purchased online are fake, however -- many pharmacies, based both in the United States and abroad, require a doctor's prescription and sell valid versions of drugs. Importing drugs from other countries is technically illegal, although the federal government generally does not prosecute individuals who purchase medicines in small amounts for their own use. The problem, Mr. Bate said, is that it is difficult for consumers to distinguish the legitimate pharmacies from the illicit ones. ''For the very nervous purchaser online,'' he said, Pfizer is ''a name brand you know really well, and the chance of your buying a counterfeit is close to zero.'' He noted, however, that some cash-paying customers may balk at the purchase price. The average list price for Viagra is about $22 a pill, while many online pharmacies sell it for about $10.
Some industry analysts saw Pfizer's move as part of a continuing effort to market drugs directly to consumers, bypassing insurance companies that can be reluctant to pay for so-called lifestyle drugs or that force consumers to pay hefty co-payments. The company said about 90 percent of privately insured patients in the United States receive coverage for Viagra, and co-payments can range from $29 to $49.
Customers who buy Viagra through the Pfizer Web site get three free pills in their first prescription -- which typically consists of six pills -- and 30 percent off their second prescription.
Mr. Clavelli, the Pfizer marketing executive, said the current Viagra discount was not unique to customers who buy through the online service and had been offered to patients online and at doctors' offices for months.
Another drug maker, AstraZeneca, has a similar arrangement with an outside pharmacy to sell the breast-cancer treatment Arimidex to patients.
Viagra has about 49 percent of the market for sexual dysfunction treatments, followed by Cialis, which holds 39.7 percent, and Levitra, with 8.6 percent, according to IMS Health.

HEADLINE: Teacher Pay Hurt by Recession, Report Says

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
During the recession and its aftermath, public schools took a hit as both state coffers and local property taxes shriveled. That showed up in shrinking employment, but also in teacher salaries. 
According to a report being released Tuesday, the vast majority of teachers in the nation's largest school districts took a pay cut or saw their pay frozen at least one year between 2008 and 2012.
The report by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a nonprofit group that advocates for tougher teacher standards, looked at salary data across 41 of the country's 50 largest school districts. Average annual teacher pay increases, which included cost-of-living and contractually negotiated raises as well as increases awarded for extra years of experience, dropped from 3.6 percent in the 2008-09 school year to 1.3 percent in the 2011-12 year. (The report did not include increases that teachers may have received for extra degrees or certifications.)
Despite the downturn, some districts managed to give teachers larger pay increases. Chicago public schoolteachers, who went on strike last year, enjoyed the largest salary increases across the four-year period covered by the report, with an average 6.5 percent increase. Other districts that increased pay at higher-than-average rates during the recession and recovery period included Milwaukee, New York, Baltimore, Jefferson County in Kentucky and Fresno, Calif.
In Chicago, teachers received contractually negotiated raises of 4 percent in 2009, 2010 and 2011 as well as increases for extra years of experience. The school board voted to rescind the contractual raises in June 2011, one of several issues that triggered the strike.
''There is a coterie of people who believe that we do not deserve a raise,'' said Karen Lewis, president of the Chicago Teachers Union. She added, ''It's not a matter of the hours we swipe in or swipe out, but the work that continues for us under increasingly difficult circumstances.''
At the other end of the spectrum, pay for teachers in Albuquerque decreased from 2008-12 as the Legislature, which controls most school financing in New Mexico, did not appropriate funds for raises.
''It's a tough time being a public school employee,'' said Don Moya, chief financial officer of the Albuquerque Public Schools.
Across the country, teacher pay did not increase significantly over the last decade. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, average teacher salaries increased less than 1 percent, in inflation-adjusted terms, from 2000-12.
What's more, average teacher pay -- $56,643, according to the Department of Education -- is lower than the average pay in many other professions that require college and graduate degrees.
''I just see we're going down a road we cannot succeed in,'' said Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association.
Kate Walsh, president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, said districts should pay much higher salaries to fewer teachers.
''We think the profession needs to make more use out of really great classroom teachers,'' Ms. Walsh said, ''and pay those teachers a whole lot more money.''

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Bill to Widen Tax Collection On the Web

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan coalition in the Senate easily passed legislation on Monday to force Internet retailers to collect sales taxes for state and local governments, sending the issue to the House, where antitax forces have vowed to kill it.
But the 69-to-27 vote in the Senate will give the measure significant momentum. Hundreds of retailers are flying to Washington this week to pressure House lawmakers and counter the arguments of small-government groups, including Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, which wields great influence in the House. 
''After 20 years, there is finally light at the end of the tunnel for our brick-and-mortar businesses,'' said Representative Steve Womack, Republican of Arkansas, and the bill's House sponsor. ''Saving local retail business depends on it, and it's now up to the House to act.''
The Internet sales tax bill -- called the Marketplace Fairness Act -- is a rarity in Washington these days, a significant tax measure that has split antitax groups in Washington from reliably Republican Main Street businesses beyond the capital. That divide has given the measure at least a chance to reach President Obama, who supports it.
With Republicans in Congress equally split, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, joked Monday that C-Span watchers would see something ''historic'' and ''precedent-setting:'' ''The Senate is actually going to vote for a bill.''
The legislation would allow states to force online retailers with more than $1 million in annual out-of-state sales to collect sales taxes from all customers and remit those taxes back to state and local governments. States would have to provide software to help calculate the taxes for thousands of jurisdictions.
Its sponsors intentionally kept the bill simple -- just 11 pages in length -- to ease passage. In contrast, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation on Monday released a 568-page report to the House Ways and Means Committee on options for overhauling the tax code compiled by 11 bipartisan House working groups tackling that issue. The release was intended to push forward comprehensive tax reform, but it only underscored how difficult a task that will be in a divided Congress.
The Senate Internet tax debate revolved around advocates' arguments that applying sales taxes online is only fair, since traditional brick-and-mortar retailers must levy such taxes already. Supporters said the bill was not a tax increase but a guarantee that taxes already owed would actually be paid. The Senate, they said, was standing up for the right of states to collect taxes as they see fit.
''The first thing we have to make sure everybody understands is this isn't a tax issue,'' said Matthew Shay, chief executive of the National Retail Federation, which pushed for the legislation. ''States determine the level of sales taxes to be collected. All we want to do is make sure the taxes are collected that are due.''
But opponents say they will try to slow the process down in the House and shift the conversation to their issues: fears that the complexity of collecting the taxes will put many Internet retailers out of business or subject them to an avalanche of audits from state and local governments around the country.
In a ''Memo for the Movement,'' a coalition of 52 conservatives on Monday demanded that House Republican leaders not bring the Senate bill straight to the House floor and also said House conservatives ''should reject any bill that expands the authority of out-of-state governments to regulate businesses with regard to online taxation.''
Signers included Mr. Norquist, the keeper of the no-new-taxes pledge that almost every Republican in Washington has signed, conservative luminaries including Phyllis Schlafly and Richard Viguerie, and the heads of Heritage Action, the Heritage Foundation's political arm, the Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks.
''We're fairly confident that at the very least, we will slow this down,'' said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action. ''Then we have to make the arguments that can win.''
With conservatives in Washington organizing against it, the bill faces an uphill climb in the House, but not a steep one. The House bill already has 65 co-sponsors, almost half of them Republican, and those Republicans include veteran conservatives like Representatives Joe Barton of Texas and Spencer Bachus of Alabama. Proponents point to their own conservative supporters, including Al Cardenas, chairman of the American Conservative Union, and Arthur Laffer, a conservative economist.
The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, has said he will at least consider the measure. After the Senate's passage, Mr. Goodlatte made it clear he would take his time with the legislation and would insist on significant changes. He suggested he may force more uniformity in sales tax rates and add legal recourse for Internet retailers facing multiple audits. But he did not indicate he planned to delay the issue in his committee. Conservative voices in Washington are being countered by reliably Republican business voices from home. Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and a House conservative leader, said Monday that he was just starting to hear from both sides, including district retailers coming to his office.
Mr. Price said he was undecided on the issue, but he noted the bill would now go to the House Judiciary Committee, not the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. That itself could ease the bill's passage.

HEADLINE: Mr. Watt, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
There are many reasons to be bullish on housing. Valuations, affordability and supply and demand are moving in the right direction. But there are also causes for concern. Home sales and home prices can rise only so far given today's high level of unemployment and low level of wage gains. And millions of homeowners are still in financial distress. At the end of 2012, some 11.3 million homeowners -- nearly one-fourth of all those with a mortgage -- still owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, according to Moody's Analytics. Of those, three million are currently in or near foreclosure.
Against that backdrop, President Obama has nominated Representative Melvin Watt, a Democrat of North Carolina, to be the next director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
As a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Watt has long been a champion of homeownership and credit availability. Before credit standards were abandoned in the lending of the bubble years, careful efforts by Mr. Watt and other policy makers had prudently expanded homeownership to middle- and low-income families, without the negative consequences of the subprime era. Reviving those successful efforts, while averting the dangers, should be a priority for the next director of the agency.
As a representative from North Carolina, whose district includes parts of Charlotte, the home of Bank of America, Mr. Watt is also aware of the needs and demands of banks. He has been criticized for taking campaign donations from the financial industry, though, sadly, it is hard to find a politician who doesn't accept special-interest money. But Mr. Watt has shown a willingness to act in the public interest -- and to compromise skillfully across the aisle. During debates over the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2010, he was instrumental in passing core mortgage reforms, including rules to improve and enforce underwriting standards to protect borrowers and the public from reckless lending.
The question, of course, is whether Mr. Watt can be confirmed in a Senate where Republicans block nominees for the sake of doing so. For some time, many Republicans have insisted that the most important housing issue is the privatization of Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government control since their bailout in 2008.
The debate over the future of Fannie and Freddie is legitimate, but premature. Currently, Fannie and Freddie and other federal agencies guarantee about 90 percent of new mortgages. Banks and other private sector lenders are simply in no position to fill that role anytime soon.
A confirmation hearing should focus on the real, near-term priorities for Fannie and Freddie, especially the need to ensure the flow of ample mortgage credit and to provide relief to hard-pressed borrowers.
The current acting director, Edward DeMarco, has been slow to clarify mortgage issues that impair the banks' willingness to extend credit. He has also stood in the way of principal reductions for underwater borrowers, saying that writing off principal would be against the taxpayer interest. Mr. Watt's record indicates that he would take a smarter, more forceful approach to mortgage relief. Research by the Congressional Budget Office confirms that principal write-downs would save the government money and reduce foreclosure and delinquency rates.
Mr. Watt has what it takes to explain and carry out policies to help revive credit and provide long overdue assistance to homeowners -- if only the Senate will give him the chance.

HEADLINE: U.S. Workers Sue As Big Farms Rely On Immigrants

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
VIDALIA, Ga. -- For years, labor unions and immigrant rights activists have accused large-scale farmers, like those harvesting sweet Vidalia onions here this month, of exploiting Mexican guest workers. Working for hours on end under a punishing sun, the pickers are said to be crowded into squalid camps, driven without a break and even cheated of wages.
But as Congress weighs immigration legislation expected to expand the guest worker program, another group is increasingly crying foul -- Americans, mostly black, who live near the farms and say they want the field work but cannot get it because it is going to Mexicans. They contend that they are illegally discouraged from applying for work and treated shabbily by farmers who prefer the foreigners for their malleability.
''They like the Mexicans because they are scared and will do anything they tell them to,'' said Sherry Tomason, who worked for seven years in the fields here, then quit. Last month she and other local residents filed a federal lawsuit against a large grower of onions, Stanley Farms, alleging that it mistreated them and paid them less than it paid the Mexicans. 
The suit is one of a number of legal actions containing similar complaints against farms, including a large one in Moultrie, Ga., where Americans said they had been fired because of their race and national origin, given less desirable jobs and provided with fewer work opportunities than Mexican guest workers. Under a consent decree with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the farm, Southern Valley, agreed to make certain changes.
With local unemployment about 10 percent and the bureaucracy for hiring foreigners onerous -- guest workers have to be imported and housed and require extensive paperwork -- it would seem natural for farmers to hire from their own communities, which they did a generation ago.
In fact, the farmers say, they would dearly like to.
''We have tried to fill our labor locally,'' said Brian Stanley, an owner of Stanley Farms, which is being sued by Ms. Tomason and others. ''But we couldn't get enough workers, and that was hindering our growth. So we turned to the guest worker program.''
The vast majority of farm workers in the country are not in the guest worker program but are simply unauthorized immigrants. The plan to place those workers on a path to legal status would reduce the chances of their being exploited, the bill's sponsors say, and thereby also improve the status of Americans who feel they cannot compete against vulnerable foreigners.
Mr. Stanley, like other farmers, argues that Americans who say they want the work end up quitting because it is hard, leaving the crops to rot in the fields. But the situation is filled with cultural and racial tensions.
Even many of the Americans who feel mistreated acknowledge that the Mexicans who arrive on buses for a limited period are incredibly efficient, often working into the night seven days a week to increase their pay.
''We are not going to run all the time,'' said Henry Rhymes, who was fired -- unfairly, he says -- from Southern Valley after a week on the job. ''We are not Mexicans.''
Jon Schwalls, director of operations at Southern Valley, made a similar point.
''When Jose gets on the bus to come here from Mexico he is committed to the work,'' he said. ''It's like going into the military. He leaves his family at home. The work is hard, but he's ready. A domestic wants to know: What's the pay? What are the conditions? In these communities, I am sorry to say, there are no fathers at home, no role models for hard work. They want rewards without input.''
Such generalizations lead lawyers -- and residents -- to say there are racist undertones to the farms' policies.
''I am not arguing that agricultural work is a good job,'' said Dawson Morton, a lawyer who focuses on farm workers' rights at the Georgia Legal Services Program, a nonprofit law firm. ''I am arguing that it could be a better job. If you want experienced people, train them. Just because people are easier to supervise, agricultural employers shouldn't be able to import them. It is not true that Americans don't want the work. What the farmers are really saying is that blacks just don't want to work.''
To which J. Larry Stine, an Atlanta lawyer for Stanley Farms and other big farms, replied: ''The farmers are not racist or against Americans. They have crops to be picked, and they see that domestics just don't have their hearts in it.''
Jim Knoepp of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit group that has campaigned against the guest worker program, said that farm work, like other difficult labor, could be made attractive to Americans at reasonable cost, and that farmers should not be excused from doing so.
''There used to be lots of American pickers who moved around the country,'' he said. ''But wages have stagnated and conditions have deteriorated, and agriculture is unwilling to make these jobs attractive. Think of trash collection. That's not very appealing, either. But if you offer a decent wage and conditions, people do it.''
Cindy Hahamovitch, an expert on guest worker programs at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, said that in the 1970s about two-thirds of farm workers were Americans and a third were foreign, and that a decade later the proportion was reversed. Today, she said, the vast majority of farm workers around the country are immigrants, although not in the guest worker program.
Republicans in Congress, mindful of the Democrats' desire to bring legal status to the nation's 11 million unauthorized immigrants, have made an expansion of the guest worker program a key element of any deal. Current proposals include increasing the number and category of temporary workers to the dairy and construction industries, and increasing their stays from a matter of months to three years so that employers have the workers they say they need.
The guest workers who are planting cucumbers for Southern Valley and harvesting onions for Stanley Farms are among 10,000 holders of H-2A visas in Georgia this year and 85,000 nationally. They are generally guaranteed a minimum wage of just over $9 an hour, but are paid per piece and can boost those wages by increasing their productivity. Other workers, known as H-2B and numbering around 65,000, labor in other businesses in which there is a demand for temporary or seasonal workers, including hotels.
Employers must show that they have tried to hire Americans through advertising and other means and that they could not attract enough of them before resorting to the H-2 system. In the litigation that resulted in the consent decree with Southern Valley, the federal government argued that the effort had not been made or had been intentionally not serious. Excuses were used not to hire locals or to fire them -- training was minimal, and people were fired when they were less skilled than others who had been doing the work for years.
''You've got some people who don't work as fast as Mexicans, but they don't teach you, and it can be learned,'' said Misty Johnson, who was fired and then rehired by Southern Valley as part of the consent decree.
For the past few months, Southern Valley has been required to provide daily bus transportation to the farm and demonstrate that it was training and retaining Americans. But a recent inspection of those efforts left federal officials unimpressed.
Southern Valley officials make no secret of their belief that the consent decree -- the free bus, the orientation program they now run and the training -- is a waste of their time and money. They assert that there is no discrimination and that they would prefer to hire locals if they could.
Lawyers for the local workers say the system is rigged to favor low-cost foreign labor because, given the conditions and the pay, no one else will do it.
''If you can't find locals to do the work, why is the answer to bring in people who have little protection and not grant them legal status?'' asked Mr. Knoepp of the Southern Poverty Law Center. ''If we need them, why not bring them in and make them legal citizens with real protections? The answer is because then they wouldn't keep working in the fields given the conditions of that work. They would do something else. It doesn't have to be this way.''

HEADLINE: Officials Market French Economy to China

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- French leaders and top officials are winding up a slew of meetings with China's new leadership, an effort to market the troubled French and euro zone economies to a powerful investor. 
''More and more things are happening here,'' said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, in a speech in Hong Kong on Monday. ''The world of tomorrow is emerging in places such as Hong Kong, Shanghai or Singapore, and France is fully committed to be part of this movement.''
Mr. Fabius accompanied the French prime minister, François Hollande, on a two-day visit to Beijing and Shanghai in late April, the first visit by a leading European politician to China since President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang were officially installed as China's top leaders in March. France's finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, joined the courting with a visit to Hong Kong.
The high-level meetings reflect the eagerness of France -- and many of its euro zone neighbors -- to woo an economy that has become an increasingly important engine of global growth in recent years. Chinese purchases of Western government debt have helped beleaguered Western economies weather the global financial turmoil of recent years, while its consumers are increasingly crucial to many European and American retailers and manufacturers.
In an example of its purchasing prowess for big-ticket items, China in late April signed a deal with Airbus, the European plane manufacturer, for 60 aircraft worth at least $8 billion at list prices.
The gradual shift of China's economy away from infrastructure investment toward more domestic consumer demand, however, is expected to generate growing demand for other industries in the coming years -- with potential businesses opportunities to match.
Mr. Fabius on Monday made no secret of the fact that France is hoping to get a slice of the pie in growing sectors like health care, agricultural products, the food and beverage, and products and services that will aid urbanization -- which the new Chinese leadership has declared a key driver of future growth.
France's exports to China are currently dominated by luxury goods, aircraft and nuclear energy sectors. The rising wages and development of better social security systems that will come with China's economic rebalancing ''opens new opportunities for French companies, which they are willing to seize,'' Mr. Fabius said, adding that France's trade deficit with China currently totaled about 26 billion euros.
As part of France's efforts to attract Chinese cash, Mr. Hollande, during his visit to China last month, pledged to make it easier for Chinese business travelers, tourists and students to visit France.
On Monday, France and Hong Kong signed a bilateral working holiday program that will allow French and Hong Kong citizens aged from 18 through 30 to spend one year in the other country, and to take up employment, if necessary, to finance their stay.

HEADLINE: China's Military Is Accused by U.S. In Cyberattacks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Monday explicitly accused China's military of mounting attacks on American government computer systems and defense contractors, saying one motive could be to map ''military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis.''
While some recent estimates have more than 90 percent of cyberespionage in the United States originating in China, the accusations relayed in the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on Chinese military capabilities were remarkable in their directness. Until now the administration avoided directly accusing both the Chinese government and the People's Liberation Army of using cyberweapons against the United States in a deliberate, government-developed strategy to steal intellectual property and gain strategic advantage.
''In 2012, numerous computer systems around the world, including those owned by the U.S. government, continued to be targeted for intrusions, some of which appear to be attributable directly to the Chinese government and military,'' the nearly 100-page report said.
The report, released Monday, described China's primary goal as stealing industrial technology, but said many intrusions also seemed aimed at obtaining insights into American policy makers' thinking. It warned that the same information-gathering could easily be used for ''building a picture of U.S. network defense networks, logistics, and related military capabilities that could be exploited during a crisis.'' 
It was unclear why the administration chose the Pentagon report to make assertions that it has long declined to make at the White House. A White House official declined to say at what level the report was cleared. A senior defense official said ''this was a thoroughly coordinated report,'' but did not elaborate.
On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, criticized the report.
''China has repeatedly said that we resolutely oppose all forms of hacker attacks,'' she said. ''We're willing to carry out an even-tempered and constructive dialogue with the U.S. on the issue of Internet security. But we are firmly opposed to any groundless accusations and speculations, since they will only damage the cooperation efforts and atmosphere between the two sides to strengthen dialogue and cooperation.''
Missing from the Pentagon report was any acknowledgment of the similar abilities being developed in the United States, where billions of dollars are spent each year on cyberdefense and constructing increasingly sophisticated cyberweapons. Recently the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is also commander of the military's fast-growing Cyber Command, told Congress that he was creating more than a dozen offensive cyberunits, designed to mount attacks, when necessary, at foreign computer networks.
When the United States mounted its cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear facilities early in President Obama's first term, Mr. Obama expressed concern to aides that China and other states might use the American operations to justify their own intrusions.
But the Pentagon report describes something far more sophisticated: a China that has now leapt into the first ranks of offensive cybertechnologies. It is investing in electronic warfare capabilities in an effort to blind American satellites and other space assets, and hopes to use electronic and traditional weapons systems to gradually push the United States military presence into the mid-Pacific nearly 2,000 miles from China's coast.
The report argues that China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, commissioned last September, is the first of several carriers the country plans to deploy over the next 15 years. It said the carrier would not reach ''operational effectiveness'' for three or four years, but is already set to operate in the East and South China Seas, the site of China's territorial disputes with several neighbors, including Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The report notes a new carrier base under construction in Yuchi.
The report also detailed China's progress in developing its stealth aircraft, first tested in January 2011.
Three months ago the Obama administration would not officially confirm reports in The New York Times, based in large part on a detailed study by the computer security firm Mandiant, that identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 near Shanghai as the likely source of many of the biggest thefts of data from American companies and some government institutions.
Until Monday, the strongest critique of China had come from Thomas E. Donilon, the president's national security adviser, who said in a speech at the Asia Society in March that American companies were increasingly concerned about ''cyberintrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,'' and that ''the international community cannot tolerate such activity from any country.'' He stopped short of blaming the Chinese government for the espionage.
But government officials said the overall issue of cyberintrusions would move to the center of the United States-China relationship, and it was raised on recent trips to Beijing by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey.
To bolster its case, the report argues that cyberweapons have become integral to Chinese military strategy. It cites two major public works of military doctrine, ''Science of Strategy'' and ''Science of Campaigns,'' saying they identify ''information warfare (I.W.) as integral to achieving information superiority and an effective means for countering a stronger foe.'' But it notes that neither document ''identifies the specific criteria for employing a computer network attack against an adversary,'' though they ''advocate developing capabilities to compete in this medium.''
It is a critique the Chinese could easily level at the United States, where the Pentagon has declined to describe the conditions under which it would use offensive cyberweapons. The Iran operation was considered a covert action, run by intelligence agencies, though many techniques used to manipulate Iran's computer controllers would be common to a military program.
The Pentagon report also explicitly states that China's investments in the United States aim to bolster its own military technology. ''China continues to leverage foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic exchanges, the experience of repatriated Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial and technical espionage to increase the level of technologies and expertise available to support military research, development and acquisition.''
But the report does not address how the Obama administration should deal with that problem in an economically interconnected world where the United States encourages those investments, and its own in China, to create jobs and deepen the relationship between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies. Some experts have argued that the threat from China has been exaggerated. They point out that the Chinese government -- unlike, say, Iran or North Korea -- has such deep investments in the United States that it cannot afford to mount a crippling cyberstrike on the country.
The report estimates that China's defense budget is $135 billion to $215 billion, a large range attributable in part to the opaqueness of Chinese budgeting. While the figure is huge in Asia, the top estimate would still be less than a third of what the United States spends every year.
Some of the report's most interesting elements examine the debate inside China over whether this is a moment for the country to bide its time, focusing on internal challenges, or to directly challenge the United States and other powers in the Pacific.
But it said that ''proponents of a more active and assertive Chinese role on the world stage'' -- a group whose members it did not name -- ''have suggested that China would be better served by a firm stance in the face of U.S. or other regional pressure.''

HEADLINE: Worst of the 'What Were They Thinking?' Contracts

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
The sense that New York teams operate with Monopoly money rather than actual cash was never more prevalent than when Alex Rodriguez tore up the largest contract in American sports history, only to be handed back one by the Yankees that was even larger.
When Rodriguez opted out of his contract after the 2007 season, a great deal of posturing ensued, and Warren E. Buffett somehow got involved, but Rodriguez ended up right back where he started. Instead of finishing out the remaining three years of his deal for the $72 million he was owed, he had a new contract for 10 years and $275 million. 
As Rodriguez has declined as a player, missing significant periods of time with a series of injuries, the reality that the bill for such extreme contracts eventually comes due has set in. The embarrassment is being compounded by Rodriguez's seemingly being involved in a new scandal every few weeks.
Across the Hudson River, the Jets are being forced to deal with harsh economic realities that do not fit the widespread perception that a New York team can buy its way out of anything. Mark Sanchez, once a promising young quarterback who is now notorious mostly for ricocheting off the backside of an offensive lineman last season, seems to remain in town for the same reason Rodriguez does: guaranteed money.
The bad contracts for Rodriguez and Sanchez are just the latest examples of how the largess inherent in the New York sports world has led teams to make foolish decisions. Derek Jeter's 10-year, $189 million deal in 2001 was as good as any large contract in sports history, but the misses for New York teams have piled up.
Here is a look back at some of the worst contracts in recent New York sports history, which reveals that having a lot of money is not the same as being good with it.
Yankees
ALEX RODRIGUEZ, 2007
10 years, $275 million
The largest contract in American sports is most likely the worst even though Rodriguez carried the team in the 2009 postseason on the way to the franchise's 27th World Series title. Once the best all-around player in the game, Rodriguez now struggles to stay healthy, has seen his prodigious hitting skills diminish and has been a continual distraction for reasons that include performance-enhancing drugs, portraits of himself as a centaur and a confusing relationship with Madonna. He began his latest injury rehabilitation on Monday, his return to the lineup still indefinite.
CARL PAVANO, 2005
4 years, $39.95 million
The dollar figure was not particularly high for the Yankees, but for the money, the team got a 9-8 record, a 5.00 earned run average and possibly the first instance of a player's being shelved indefinitely with a bruised buttocks. Expected to be an ace, Pavano, above, pitched in just nine games for the Yankees after his disappointing first season. It was bad enough that his mother was actively defending him to the news media.
HONORABLE MENTION: Jason Giambi, Mark Teixeira, A. J. Burnett, Kei Igawa and many more.
Mets
JOHAN SANTANA, 2008
6 years, $137.5 million
When the Mets were playing with Bernard L. Madoff's money, spending nearly $140 million in exchange for one very good season, two O.K. seasons and the first no-hitter in franchise history may have seemed reasonable. But as the Mets have faced financial challenges in recent years, populating their roster with castoffs and unknowns, it is hard to ignore that Santana, right, will have made $75 million over the last three years of his contract to start just 21 games.
BOBBY BONILLA, 2000
1 year, $5.9 million
A special case in which the dollar figure was quite low, but the ramifications were far-reaching. To save some money when Bonilla was released before the 2000 season, the Mets asked him to accept deferred payments instead of the $5.9 million he was owed. In 2011, Bonilla received the first of those payments, and he will continue to receive annual checks for a little less than $1.2 million until 2035. In all, this creative accounting will result in Bonilla's being paid $29.8 million. This season, Bonilla, who retired in 2001, is making more than 18 players on the Mets' active roster.
HONORABLE MENTION: Jason Bay, Oliver Perez
Knicks
ALLAN HOUSTON, 2001
6 years, $100 million
This contract was so bad that when the N.B.A. created a rule allowing teams to release an unproductive player and remove his salary from their luxury tax calculation, it was immediately called the Allan Houston rule. Houston, below, an oft-injured guard, was productive for two seasons of the contract, By its end, he was not able to play at all. He was inactive for the 2005-6 season but was one of the highest-paid players in the N.B.A., at more than $19 million. That would have continued in 2006-7, but Houston retired. In a twist, Houston's retirement meant the Knicks did not use the Allan Houston rule on Allan Houston.
EDDY CURRY, 2005
6 years, $60 million
Over the first two seasons of this contract, which caused initial controversy after reports of underlying problems with the center's health, Curry was productive and seemed like a somewhat wise investment. He did not rebound well for a big man, but he could score and was still just 24. In 2007-8, he regressed mightily, and he became a punch line in the seasons that followed. He played in just 10 games over those two seasons before being released.
HONORABLE MENTION: Stephon Marbury, Jerome James
Worst of the Rest
RICK DIPIETRO, ISLANDERS, 2006
15 years, $67.5 million
From the moment the contract was signed, people started mocking its length. The young goaltender broke the franchise record for saves in a game with 56 in March 2007 but sustained a concussion later that month, the first of a series of injuries that have limited him. Since the start of the 2008-9 season, DiPietro, right, has appeared in just 50 games, and he was waived in February. The contract runs through 2021.
NEIL O'DONNELL, JETS, 1996
5 years, $25 million
O'Donnell once took the Pittsburgh Steelers to the Super Bowl, but his interception-filled day cost them a chance at victory. That did not stop the Jets from overpaying for his services. In his first season in New York, O'Donnell went 0-6. He improved to 8-6 in the second year of the contract, but that still was not enough, and he was released in favor of Vinny Testaverde. At that point, the Jets were apparently willing to admit their mistakes.

HEADLINE: HSBC Profit Surges as Restructuring Plan Gains Traction

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: The British bank HSBC said first-quarter earnings almost doubled, to $8.43 billion, after the firm benefited from reduced costs and a decline in bad debts. 

 BODY:
 8:42 a.m. | Updated 
LONDON - Job cuts, asset sales and other cost reductions paid off for the British bank HSBC as it posted first-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat analysts' expectations.
Earnings at the bank rose almost 50 percent, to $8.43 billion, compared with the $4.32 billion the bank reported in the period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a pretax profit of $8.1 billion.
"We're moving into calmer waters but there are still challenges ahead," HSBC's chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, said during a conference call with reporters. 
Like other banks, HSBC has embarked on a far-reaching cost-reduction program. Mr. Gulliver said that cost-cutting would remain on the top of the agenda this year, as the bank aimed to find an additional $1 billion in annual savings.
 Operating expenses fell 11 percent, to $9.3 billion, from $10.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012, HSBC said in a statement. HSBC plans to update investors next week about its strategy and the progress it has made with its cost-reduction program.
Mike Jennings, chief investment officer of Premier, an investment firm in Britain, described the earnings as "good," adding that the bank's efforts to reduce costs had been better than expected. "They should be able to maintain a good rate of growth compared to competitors," said Mr. Jennings, who holds HSBC stock as part of his portfolio.
Since it began a revamp in 2011, the bank has reduced costs by $4 billion, sold its unit in Panama to Bancolombia for $2.1 billion and its stake in the Chinese insurer Ping An for $9.4 billion. Last month, HSBC said it would eliminate about 1,150 jobs at branches in Britain, adding to the reduction of 30,000 positions two years ago.
A decline in bad debts also helped results. The bank had to set aside $1.2 billion for bad loans and other credit risks in the first quarter, half the $2.4 billion it did in the period a year earlier. The overall quality of the loans improved, especially in the United States and Europe, HSBC said.
Mr. Gulliver said on Tuesday that he could not rule out additional job cuts, as the economies in Britain and the rest of Europe continued to struggle. After a slower-than-anticipated start to the year, Mr. Gulliver said he expected economic growth in mainland China to gather speed in 2013.
HSBC's first-quarter earnings were helped by its business in Asia, where it generates more than half of its profit. It also recorded better performance in Europe, swinging to a profit after posting a loss in the first quarter of last year. Going forward, however, Mr. Gulliver said he expected the euro zone would contract but that the United States economy would "continue to outperform its peers."
Shares of HSBC rose 2.9 percent in London on Tuesday. The shares have gained 13 percent this year, less than shares in Barclays but more than those of Standard Chartered, which also generates most of its profit outside of Europe. 
HSBC is recovering from a set of blunders that have weighed on its earnings and reputation. Last year, it agreed to pay a $1.92 billion fine to settle charges by American authorities that the bank broke money laundering rules. The case included charges that HSBC handled money transfers worth billions of dollars for countries under United States sanctions.
The bank has also set aside more than $2 billion to compensate customers who were improperly sold some financial products.

HEADLINE: Where the Happy Talk About Corporate Culture Is Wrong

BYLINE: CLIFF OXFORD


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s important to understand the difference between Human Resources Happy and High Performance Happy. 

 BODY:
"Tell me something I don't know," is what I think every time I see another article, blog post or book on the value of happy employees. And here is what I find disturbing about these happy-employee propagandists. They are mostly off about what it takes to motivate employees and keep them happy in a fast-growth culture.
Don't get me wrong - I want happy employees, too. But I think there are two types of happiness in a work culture: Human Resources Happy and High Performance Happy. Fast-growth success has everything to do with the latter and nothing to do with the former. Unfortunately, 99 percent of the discussion and solutions are focused on Human Resources Happy. 
Here's how I define H.R. Happy: Bosses are at least superficially nice and periodically pretend to be interested in employees as people. These employees can count on birthday-cake celebrations and shallow conversations about what their hobbies are outside of work. This approach allows H.R. people to do the job they love - compliance and regulations - instead of the job they should be doing - finding and recruiting the best available talent. 
And this may work in a call-center environment or in a second-rate corporate culture where people resign themselves to the fact that they will get more if they accept being treated like children. But these H.R. Happy employees can have a rough time at fast-growth companies when they meet people who are High Performance Happy. Think of an Olympic athlete jumping into the pool for those 4:30 a.m. laps. High Performance Happy is an attitude with a skill set that says we are on a mission that is bigger than any one of us. We find our happiness in being on a world class team that is making a difference.
H.R. Happy says we should do what pleases us first - bring your dog to work! High Performance Happy says I will fight for every inch. I will be there at 4:30 a.m. no matter what and until the last dog dies. Respect is core to the success of High Performance Happy, and it is based on what you are giving not on what you are taking. For example, if one person has a sick child, we all have a sick child, and we all give more that day. And this is why High Performance Happy builds deeper bonds.
In the movie "American Beauty," Annette Bening played Carolyn, the personification of Happy H.R. Set aside her bedeviled husband, and no matter what was said to her, she felt compelled to say something positive, even though it was as phony as the eyelashes she batted. But that is what the H.R. propaganda teaches on how to build a company. Be nice to people and they will work hard for you. But , by the way, that was not the approach at successful companies like UPS and Apple, which magnify the outcomes of the high-performance elite and obliterate the happy talk.
Steve Jobs was well known for his rants about time-clock punching morons, but his high performance elite got better not bitter. Why? Apple's mission - making technology cool - was far more important than a few harsh words or even a little immaturity. And before its founder passed way, UPS was a great example of high performance elite with an almost military culture. At UPS, performance reviews were called "agent orange" because they were orange in color and dreaded if you had not met or exceeded your commitments. Back in the late '80s, UPS was disciplined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for being too hard on its management employees at its six-week, basic-training school for supervisors. I attended it, and let's just say it was taxing. The company ended the program shortly thereafter. On the other hand, UPS managers often had to be disciplined for working too many hours, week after week. Why? We truly believed that the American economy depended upon our moving packages from point A to point B.
High Performance Happy means you give employees tremendous responsibility, and they are happy to show that they are the best. You don't have to con them into doing things with a flavor-of-the-month methodology that suggests they will only perform if you make them happy first. H.R. Happy says, I want you to think that I like you. High Performance Happy says, I believe in you. Here are the guideposts for building a High Performance Happy culture.
First, you can't hide the duds the way you can in corporate America. If high performance is level 10, then duds aren't the two and threes who are quickly shown the door. The duds are the fives and sixes who are the happy slackers - the ones who do just enough to get by, but hey, they're happy! They befriend the boss, love meetings and are the first to check the scores and Facebook when they get back from lunch. Their H.R. Happy habits will do one of two things - bring the high performance elite down to the middle or push them out the door. The duds have to go. Today.
Here's what you tell the high performers. Come spend time with us if you want to do something special. Don't take it personally if you get yelled at for something you did not do. Get over it, and I am sure we will apologize when we find time. If you ask for help, we will be there. If you do not ask for help, we will assume that you are performing in a blaze of glory so be ready to show it. Don't tell us later that you were confused or did not agree with what we were doing. You can say whatever you want to whomever you want when the decision is up for discussion - and this will be encouraged in many formats, from quick huddles to day-long strategy sessions. But when the decision is made, you march with the decision and not with what makes you happy.
High Performance Happy does not like a lot of unnecessary processes and rules, which is why entrepreneurs have to let high performance people make decisions. If you trust them with your mission and with hundreds of important daily choices, you can also trust them to handle their vacation schedule, their paid time off, and the tools they need to get the job done.
High performance organizations do not hire family members. That's because it's very hard to fire family, and you have to earn your spot in a high performance lineup every day. Here is the deal: I love your work if you are making the plays. If you are not, I have to find someone who can.
In High Performance Happy, you cannot have people behaving like liberal Democrats or right-wing Republicans. It has nothing to do with politics. In fast-growth organizations, life is not fair every day, and you can't have liberals running around trying to make sure everything is equal and no one is offended. I am sorry but there are going to be days when not all is equal and someone is offended. We always try to go back and make it up, but there are times when you have to take it for the team - and not bring it up three years later at a company meeting.
But you also don't want right-wing types who really don't understand how the world works and lack the emotional intelligence to get over anything that bothers them. If they think somebody got more than they did, they stew over it every day until you give them more. Again, I am sorry, but in fast growth there are times when one group gets more than the other. "Get over it" is the natural response in a high performance environment. Of course, that would be considered the height of hypocrisy at an H.R. Happy company.
The toughest part of High Performance Happy is dealing with the exit of a high performance employee. What do you do when one of the chosen chooses to leave? First, you ask if there is an issue that you have not discussed. Then you ask if there anything you can do. If the answer to both questions is no, and the employee is just leaving to go to another team, the person exits with a thank you. No good-bye parties. No H.R. exit interviews. No farewell dinners. The person is gone, and the quicker the better.
But here's the flip side. When it comes to lay offs of high performance employees during downturns, you simply cannot do it. You have to figure out other ways. In 2001, after the dot-com crash, my information technology company lost about 20 percent of its revenue. I remember the chief financial officer came to see me with what was supposed to be good news. With some belt-tightening measures, he said, we only had to lay off 12 or 13 people. We looked at our list of folks and could find nothing but High Performance Happy.
We had just made the Inc. 500, so they had delivered, and I did not want to break the we-are-in-this-together bond. So I decided the 40 highest paid people would take a 10-percent pay cut, and we would make up the rest in travel reductions. I was not surprised when I did not hear any whining, moaning or groaning from the top 40. I was surprised when the person who would have been No. 41 came into my office and said he wanted the same cut. The next day, the H.R. director came to see me and said, "Cliff, I have had a stream of people in my office all day - team leaders, front-line people, just about every role - asking if they can take the 10-percent pay cut, too. I don't even think we need the money."
I think it was that day that I knew for sure we had a great company that was High Performance Happy.

HEADLINE: Candidate Hoping to Be First Hispanic Mayor May Be 100 Years Too Late

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: Adolfo Carri&#243;n Jr., a former Bronx borough president of Puerto Rican descent, is seeking to become New York&#8217;s first Latino mayor, though John Purroy Mitchel was descended from Spanish nobility. 

 BODY:
The demography of the New York City mayoral campaign may already have shifted under at least one candidate's prospective feat, even before November, when Adolfo Carrión Jr. hopes to be elected the city's first Hispanic mayor. 
The Race for City Hall 
Seems he may have been beaten to the title by 100 years. 
Researchers at Fordham University Preparatory School in the Bronx discovered that an alumnus, John Purroy Mitchel, the "boy mayor" who was 34 when he took office, had Hispanic roots. 
"With the mayoral race beginning to take shape, there has been a lot of talk in the media about the possibility of New York City having its first Latino mayor," said Louis DiGiorno, the archivist at Fordham Prep. "This has puzzled us here at the Prep, because as far as we are concerned, New York had its first Latin mayor almost 100 years ago: John Purroy Mitchel, Fordham Prep Class of 1894 and mayor of New York from 1914-1917."
While Mitchel was born in the Bronx, he was descended from Spanish nobility. A great-grandfather emigrated from Spain at the end of the 18th century.
"Mitchel's maternal great-grandfather was José Joaquin de Purroy, a lawyer from Spain who would settle for a time in Venezuela, where his son, Juan Bautista Purroy, was born," Mr. DiGiorno said. "Juan Bautista, the father of Mitchel's mother, Mary Purroy Mitchel, would serve for many years as the Venezuelan consul to the United States. The mayor's mother grew up in a bilingual home."
The New York Herald quoted Mitchel, at a 1913 meeting with dignitaries from the Caribbean and Central and South America, as acknowledging his roots and cultural ties to Latin America:
"I have personally a very deep interest in South America that springs of family ties and personal experience, as well as from that friendship which we all feel here for our neighbors to the south. My grandfather, John B. Purroy, was born in Venezuela and, though an American citizen, represented that government here for a number of years as its consul, and I look back as among the most pleasurable and interesting experiences of my life to my visits to South and Central America."
Beginning with the 1969 campaign, Herman Badillo, another former Bronx borough president, was billed as the first Puerto Rican candidate for mayor. Mr. Carrión, a former Bronx borough president also of Puerto Rican descent, is running in November as the Independence Party candidate and has been seeking to enter the Republican primary, too. He was unfazed about Mitchel's ancestry.
"We're big fans of Mitchel," a campaign spokesman said. "He was an anti-Tammany Hall reformer who had an independent streak and became mayor as a fusion candidate bringing together New York's various religious groups and Republicans." 
The spokesman, Thomas J. Basile, questioned the depth of Mitchel's Latino heritage, adding that it was "unlikely he or anyone else at the time viewed him as such or whether he ever had any direct, personal experience with Latino culture or communities."
"Clearly, one's 'racial' roots and one's cultural heritage are very different," the spokesman said. "Mayor Mitchel had Hispanic ancestry by virtue of a connection to Spain, but was certainly not Latino. Mitchel didn't identify himself culturally during his public life with the broader Latino population globally or in the city. It's not just about who someone's great-grandfather was but much more about how you connect not only racially but also with the culture, people and lives of those who share that common heritage. It's not just about where you're from but how you live and perceive yourself in relation to others of that heritage."
"Latino or not," Mr. Basile added, "Mitchel deserves credit for bringing people together to reform our politics and fight corruption. Both those things need to be done today a century later."

HEADLINE: The Challenges Ahead for HSBC

BYLINE: PETER THAL LARSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The chief executive has sought to make the bank simpler and smaller. The question now is how many more strings he has left to pull. 

 BODY:
HSBC is digging in for a low-interest-rate world. Economic malaise in the West has depressed demand for loans. Central bank money printing is weighing on the lender's large deposit base. With no pickup in sight, HSBC's returns depend on its ability to keep cutting costs. 
The bank's balance sheet at the end of March sums up the challenge. Gross customer loans of almost $974 billion were lower than at the end of December. Granted, the effect of the stronger dollar and the decision to earmark some businesses for sale explain the decline. HSBC's subprime loan portfolio in the United States also continues to shrink. But even then, loan growth was largely restricted to pockets of Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
This malaise comes as no surprise - it is the reason central banks are keeping interest rates low and accumulating ever-larger stockpiles of assets. HSBC's problem, however, is that it has roughly $3 in loans for every $4 of customer deposits. Low rates squeeze the margin between what it has to pay to attract those deposits and what it can charge for the loans.
Granted, quantitative easing has its benefits. Investor appetite for yield will help the bank to offload some of its unwanted American mortgages at better prices than previously anticipated. Record bond issuance powered a 31 percent revenue jump in HSBC's capital markets business. And HSBC's capital base is sufficiently strong that it can afford to increase both lending and dividends.
The cycle will turn at some point. Yet for now, HSBC's financial performance depends heavily on cost-cutting, weeding out underperforming businesses and shrinking bad debts. These three factors were largely responsible for the 34 percent jump in underlying pretax profit in the first quarter.
The question now is how many more strings HSBC has to pull. In the two years since announcing his strategy to make the bank smaller and simpler, the chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, has reduced the bank's work force by 38,000 and shed more than 50 businesses. The bank has scheduled a strategy update for May 15. The suspicion is that, at a bank of HSBC's size, there are always more costs to trim. Mr. Gulliver will have to show that he has enough fresh ideas to keep economic malaise at bay.

HEADLINE: Liberal Party Backs Catsimatidis

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The party has not been a big factor in recent elections, but if it can gain a spot on the general election ballot, John A. Catsimatidis could remain in the race for mayor even if he loses the Republican nomination. 

 BODY:
John A. Catsimatidis, the billionaire businessman and Gristedes supermarket owner running for mayor of New York City, picked up the endorsement of an obscure but potentially influential political group on Tuesday, adding another wrinkle to the Republican primary. 
The Race for City Hall
The Liberal Party, a group that once helped play kingmaker for Rudolph W. Giuliani in his runs for mayor, but has fallen on tough times of late, said it would support Mr. Catsimatidis and list him on its ballot line in the November general election. assuming, that is, the party can acquire that ballot line, which would first require a petition drive. 
If the line does come through - and Mr. Catsimatidis's $3 billion fortune could go a long way toward helping the party achieve that goal - it would allow the supermarket magnate to continue being a thorn in the side of his more establishment Republican rival, Joseph J. Lhota, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, should Mr. Lhota win the Republican nomination.
Currently, Mr. Catsimatidis is challenging Mr. Lhota in the Republican primary, and he lags behind: one recent poll put him in third place, behind another long-shot candidate, George McDonald, the president of the Doe Fund, a homeless services group. 
But the prospect of Mr. Catsimatidis's persevering past the September primary ("I'm committed to running," he said at a news conference on Tuesday) will certainly irk Mr. Lhota's camp, which remains wary of the unlimited war chest that Mr. Catsimatidis, who has opted out of the city's voluntary public financing program, could bring to bear in the race.
Moments after Mr. Catsimatidis announced his Liberal Party support, Mr. Lhota's team said Representative Peter King, an influential Republican House member from Long Island, had endorsed Mr. Lhota for mayor. 
Mr. Catsimatidis appeared to be enjoying himself at his announcement event, outside an entrance to the subway station at City Hall. "Today is a game changer," he said of the Liberal Party's endorsement, saying it would create a fusion ticket for "pro-business New Yorkers and the pro-people New Yorkers - that's what I'm all about."
"We're going to have all the people voting for us!" Mr. Catsimatidis said.
He was asked about the large sums he has contributed to the city's Republican Party committees, which some critics have labeled a de facto way of buying the party's support.
"I'm going to contribute more!" Mr. Catsimatidis said. "I'm giving far less money than Bloomberg gave." (Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also generously donated to the Republican committees when he ran for mayor on the G.O.P. line.)
Tom F. Allon, another Republican hopeful, had previously received the Liberal Party endorsement, but he abandoned his mayoral bid in March. The Liberal Party did not have a ballot line in the 2009 New York City general election. In 2001, Alan Hevesi ran for mayor with the Liberal Party's endorsement; he received less than 1 percent of the total votes cast. The party endorsed Mr. Bloomberg in 2005.
Martin I. Hassner, the executive director of the Liberal Party, delivered a stirring endorsement of Mr. Catsimatidis, leaning over his podium and speaking with an orator's cadence. 
"This is a force of nature," Mr. Hassner said of Mr. Catsimatidis. "Nobody like him around." He said the candidate had the "yearning necessary" to win the race, and called him "a very uncommon, common man." 
"By the way, he's not perfect," Mr. Hassner added. "But he'll be a mayor of the people."

HEADLINE: Guest Post | 'Sliding Into Homelessness': A Student Essay and Teaching Resources

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: An essay from a homeless young adult paired with Times reporting, discussion questions and an invitation to students to post comments and thoughts. 

 BODY:
Occasionally we collaborate with an organization called Youth Communication to feature true stories by young people that help add a new voice or angle to a topic we've covered on the blog.
So when the group - which publishes a magazine that is by and for young people in foster care in New York City - mentioned to us that May is National Foster Care Month and that five members of the magazine's staff, ranging in age from 18 to 22, became homeless in the last year, we thought it was a fitting time to post something on the topic.
Below, a short introduction by the Youth Communication staff; an essay by a student, Zakkiaya Bowen, about her experiences after leaving foster care; and finally, some questions for classroom discussion about both Ms. Bowen's piece and related Times reporting. 
As always, please preview the post to decide if it is appropriate for your students. 
 Talking About Foster Care and Youth Homelessness in the Classroom 
 By Virginia Vitzthum, editor, Represent magazine and Maria Luisa Tucker, program director and multimedia editor at Youth Communication 
Foster care is a tricky thing to talk about in a classroom. You may well have foster youth in your class and not know it. Though the reasons for going into foster care are seldom the child's fault, there is a primal shame around not having a family. 
In fact, that's how Represent, Youth Communication's magazine by and for youth in care, came into existence. 
By the early 1990s, the city's foster care population had skyrocketed to 49,000, and those children began flooding our offices at Youth Communication, where we published a magazine written by New York City high school students since 1980. 
The youth in care had stories to tell, but they hid them; so great was the stigma of being abandoned or unwanted. So in 1993, we started Represent. The platform was a safe space for our young reporters to write honestly about the foster care system and how they got there. 
Though the foster care population has decreased since then, in the past year, a new disturbing thing happened to the teenage and young adult writers at Represent. Five of them became homeless. They wrote about their struggles, including with the stigma of homelessness, for our spring issue. 
Here is one of their stories. Read about how Zakkiaya Bowen went from foster care to homelessness, then consider discussing the issues the piece raises with your students, and invite them to post a comment below.
 Sliding Into Homelessness 
By Zakkiaya Bowen
I am 21 years old and a full-time student at LaGuardia Community College, working toward a degree in writing and literature. I am a writer for Represent magazine and I work as a research analyst for an international company.
I sound like I've got it all figured it out, right? Well, I kind of do, but I'm still homeless.
Here's how it happened. As I neared my 21st birthday, I was living in a group home, starting college, and didn't have a job. So my two best post-foster-care housing options were the New York City Housing Authority and New York/New York III. 
The housing authority is a program (also known as "the projects") that allows you to pay 30 percent of your income, no matter what it is, for rent. New York/New York III is "supportive housing," that includes furnished apartments with caseworkers and social workers in the building to help residents with practical and emotional needs. New York/New York III is available to nine categories of people in New York City, including people who are mentally ill, suffer from substance abuse, living with H.I.V. or AIDS, and youth aging out of foster care up to age 26.
Three months before my 21st birthday, I applied to the housing authority but they closed my case because I didn't have a job and I couldn't pay my share of the rent. I was supposed to be receiving Social Security Supplemental Security Income, or S.S.I., because I have a condition called short bowel syndrome that requires me to go to the hospital fairly often. I showed a letter from my caseworker saying I would be getting S.S.I., but I never did get it, so the housing authority took me off the list. I later got a job, but I couldn't reapply for another six months.
I also applied for an apartment through New York/New York III one month before my 21st birthday. I got accepted and all I was doing was waiting for the landlord to call to tell me when I could move in. The director of the program told me it could be a day or a month or longer, depending on when someone moved out. I figured I was set, because I had two options.
 The Same Mistake Twice 
But when I turned 21, a spot hadn't opened up with New York/New York III. So my agency sent me to live with my mother even though I did not belong at my mother's house. I hadn't lived with my mom since I was 15 and she'd put me in foster care when I was 17. My mother agreed that I could stay with her temporarily as long as I paid the monthly cable TV/Internet/phone bill and contributed some food as well.
Things were all right at my mother's for the first month. I got a job as a research analyst, conducting surveys over the phone. I made $7.25 an hour and worked about 30 hours a week, so after taxes were taken out I brought home less than $200 a week. Because we didn't know when I'd get into the New York/New York III program, my mother helped me look for a room to rent and found one nearby in the Bronx.
I checked out the apartment, and I loved it. I planned to save up from my salary for the security deposit and first month's rent, but my mother harassed me for the $152 cable bill, even though I was never in the house and only watched television for about four hours during the month. She constantly asked me when I got paid, and how much I got paid, and it made me upset. The television that I had to pay for was on all the time, even when I got home from work at 1 or 2 a.m., and still on when I left at 6:30 a.m. for school. I was bringing food into the house, but still it was a constant money issue with her and that kept me from being able to take the apartment.
My mother was also calling me messy. I was sleeping in the living room, and there was no place to put my clothes away. Finally, she kicked me out, and I went to my brother's house. He'd just been fired, though, so I only stayed with him for two nights. I then moved in with a friend of mine. Her mother wanted me to pay her $200 a month, but when it came time, I didn't have that much after paying for my MetroCard, food and other necessary items.
 Abandoned 
I went back to my mom's, but then she said I could only sleep there on weekdays. On weekends, I had to find somewhere else to sleep. So that first weekend, I decided to sleep on the subway, riding several train lines from end to end. I had to work that weekend, so I tried to figure out where I could take a shower. 
I felt abandoned and like no one loved me. I did not want to tell my three best friends because I didn't want them to worry, so I just ate my feelings and wrote in my notebooks about my experience.
When you turn 21, you are on your own. Not having a place to sleep creates suicidal thoughts. What if you cannot handle sleeping on trains or buses or in the streets? I didn't want to be looked down on. I started sleeping on the trains because I didn't want to deal with anyone else. I found out the reason I was forced to ride trains all weekend was so that my mother could have her former boyfriend stay with her. I never went back to her house after that.
One of my friends began worrying about me and found a place for me to stay with a friend's mom. The girl's mother asked me to pay $25 a week to stay. I thought I could swing that, but then the mother said I could no longer stay because she didn't like her daughter having to let me out the door in the morning and stay up late to answer it at night. In addition, my friend's grandfather said he didn't want me there because of my sexual orientation (I'm an out lesbian). I was only there five days.
 Into a Shelter 
I packed up everything I could and went to The Door, a drop-in center that helps youth who are in care, aged out, or homeless, who need a place to hang out and feel safe. I told them I was homeless and they referred me to a couple of shelters and programs. I had more options than most because I had a job and was going to college.
On Sept. 22, I spent my first night in a homeless shelter, a women-only place in the Bronx. I saw a metal detector, security guards, and an office for signing in. There were four floors, and on each floor were several dormitories. Each big dorm room holds about 20 beds, with a locker next to each bed. There's a gymnasium, library, laundry room, basketball court, bathroom, and cafeteria on one floor.
The hallways are narrow and long, with security on each floor making sure the women are in their beds, monitoring what beds were open and were taken, and breaking up fights or other disturbances. Bathrooms have tissue all over the floors, and the shower curtains look like half-sheets. Hypodermic needles lie on the floor of the shower.
The shelter serves breakfast from 6:30 to 7:30 a.m.; lunch is from noon to 1 p.m.; and dinner is from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. They do bed checks every night at 10 p.m. If you are not in your bed by that time you lose it to the next person checking in. The only way you can come after that hour and not lose your bed is if you have a late pass. I got a late pass because my job doesn't end until 11 p.m.
Everyone entering the shelter system has to get a tuberculosis test and a psychological exam. Everybody is assigned a caseworker when they come into the shelter. They help you find ways to progress and get you longer-term housing. Franklin is an assessment shelter and you can only stay for 21 days, though some people can stay for longer in special circumstances.
 Dog-Eat-Dog World 
The residents told me, "They will take things out of your pockets while you're sleeping." So, the first night, I slept with nothing in my pockets and a pen in my hand in case I needed it as a weapon. The fact that shelter staff woke me up at 6 a.m. and served breakfast at 6:30 a.m. helped me get to psychology class on time, so that was good. My late pass meant I always had a bed when I went back there.
I really didn't have emotion when I got there. I just kept reminding myself that it was a bed and a shower. People did yell all hours of the night, and fought almost every night. There was a four-person fight one night over a phone charger. People will steal your underwear, your jackets, anything. It's a dog-eat-dog world and I got a full night of sleep only about half the time.
Guys were out in front of the shelter in big cars, waiting to persuade girls to participate in sexual acts for money. I think those men know that women in the shelter have no money, no way of getting around, are alone, are on drugs, or have children. A lady in the shelter pointed out another lady who was a prostitute - she was outside every day around the same time in heels and makeup. She would get into a car, disappear and then come back, on a schedule.
Some of the guys out front and some of the females in the shelter were dealing drugs to support themselves. Women were even selling women: Lesbian couples and aggressive lesbians were selling straight and gay women.
Because I am working, after 18 days I was transferred to a better shelter, also in the Bronx. I had heard it was horrible, but I like it. The front looks like an institution, but inside, the doors have a doorknobs, keyholes, a doorbell, a peephole, and a number, just like an apartment. The rooms are smaller, with only three people living in them and you can bring food and drinks in. I can stay here until I find an apartment. The shelter workers still help with housing, saving money, jobs, and everything else. I like my roommate and it's not that bad, but I would like more freedom. The shelter takes half of your paycheck, and gives it back when you leave, to put toward permanent housing. As if we can't save money for ourselves.
Now, I'm looking for an apartment on Craigslist and I'm also exploring faraway colleges. I recently got my learner's permit and will soon get a driver's license in preparation to live somewhere else. I've always wanted to go away to school; I've lived in New York City my whole life, and I'd like a change. I'd like a new life.
 Pairing Ms. Bowen's Story With Times Resources on Youth Foster Care and Homelessness 
Because there may be young people in your classroom who have experienced homelessness or foster care, you might simply invite your students to read Ms. Bowen's piece alone, or alongside this 2010 Times article on youth in foster care or this piece from last year on youth homelessness, then ask them to post their thoughts below. (Please remind students that our privacy policy means they cannot post their last names.)
If you choose to do more, here is some background information and suggested discussion questions:
 Foster Care: 
Nationwide, more than 400,000 young people live in foster care. They are removed from their homes when the courts determine that they've been abused or neglected by their parents, or when poverty, death, illness or other circumstances prevent their biological parents from properly caring for them. Although the government must provide foster children with basic needs, all those benefits end with a birthday. In the United States, the age at which foster youth "age out," that is, stop receiving benefits from the state, varies from 18 to 21. And that's often when foster care youth start seriously falling behind. 
This Times article makes it clear that youth in foster care do worse across many measures than other youth: 
Only half the youths who had turned 18 and "aged out" of foster care were employed by their mid-20s. Six in 10 men had been convicted of a crime, and three in four women, many of them with children of their own, were receiving some form of public assistance. Only six in 100 had completed even a community college degree.
 Youth Homelessness: 
In addition, because of the lingering effects of the recession, more young adults are living on the street in general. As the article by Susan Saulny begins:
Duane Taylor was studying the humanities in community college and living in his own place when he lost his job in a round of layoffs. Then he found, and lost, a second job. And a third.
Now, with what he calls "lowered standards" and a tenuous new position at a Jack in the Box restaurant, Mr. Taylor, 24, does not make enough to rent an apartment or share one. He sleeps on a mat in a homeless shelter, except when his sister lets him crash on her couch. 
 Discussion Questions: 
The following draw on Ms. Bowen's piece, the 2010 article about youth in foster care, and the article from last year about youth homelessness: 

        
What is your reaction to Ms. Bowen's story? What parts of it stood out for you? Why?
        
What questions does her essay raise for you? Where might you find answers?
        
What would you like to say to Ms. Bowen if you could? Why?
        
What do the essay and these two Times articles tell you about the importance, and the limits, of the current social safety net?
        
Who, according to this article, are the "two groups that need more sweeping and lasting help" from a social safety net? Why? How might a mistake made by someone in these vulnerable groups be "life-altering"?
        
What is "Connected by 25" and how did it help Cameron Anderson
        
Why, according to the article on youth homelessness, is the problem "mostly invisible"? What obstacles stand in the way of these young people getting steady work and a place to live?
        
Do any lines from these pieces seem to echo or somehow "speak to" each other? How? 
        
 How do you feel about the social safety net? In general, do you think people who get government help are sometimes "moochers" who don't really need it, or do you think most are deserving beneficiaries with no other place to turn? Why?
        
What can someone your age do about these problems? How can you help? (See the resources below for ideas.)

HEADLINE: Keynes's Biggest Mistake

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: John Maynard Keynes&#8217;s error in generalizing some of his theories has led to a resistance to apply them in appropriate circumstances, like the present, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Over the weekend, there was a kerfuffle about whether Keynesian economics ignores the long-run implications of its policies. The Harvard historian Niall Ferguson asserted that this was the case and said that it resulted from the British economist John Maynard Keynes's homosexuality. Professor Ferguson said that those without children, as is the case with most gay men and women, necessarily had less of a long-term view of the world than those with children who will live on after their death.
Professor Ferguson has apologized for his off-the-cuff comment, which was widely interpreted as being homophobic. But before this incident fades from memory, I'd like to take the opportunity to discuss the questions raised by it: Is Keynes's sexual orientation at all relevant to the interpretation of his economic theories? Does Keynesian economics completely ignore the long run? 
First of all, Keynes's sexual orientation has been known for some time, at least since publication of Michael Holroyd's biography of Lytton Strachey in 1968. Strachey was a noted biographer, an active member of the literary Bloomsbury Group and one of Keynes's lovers. 
The revelation of Keynes's homosexuality greatly excited his right-wing enemies, who have long used it to defame him and discredit his theories. A 1969 book, "Keynes at Harvard: Economic Deception as a Political Credo," contains a long chapter on the subject, which describes Keynes as "a lifelong sexual deviant." Like Professor Ferguson argued, it says that Keynes's "aversion to human conception" was a key to his economic theories, which the book likened to Bolshevism.

The author of "Keynes at Harvard" is Zygmund Dobbs, but the driving force behind it was Archibald B. Roosevelt, who founded the Veritas Foundation, which published the Dobbs book. The youngest son of Theodore Roosevelt, Archibald Roosevelt was very active in right-wing politics throughout his life, attacking both Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman for coddling communists. In 1954, Archibald Roosevelt demanded that an organization named for his father rescind an award to the United Nations under secretary Ralph Bunche because of his "close affiliation with communism."
Brad DeLong, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, has posted a long list of conservative attacks on Keynes that have used his homosexuality as a reason to reject his economic theories. But even economists who had no interest in this aspect of Keynes's life, like the economist James Buchanan, have criticized Keynesian economics for its excessively short-term focus and negative long-run consequences.
Unfortunately, Keynes himself was to a large extent responsible for giving this criticism of his work currency. That is because he titled his most important work "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money." The term "general theory" obviously implies that it is applicable at all times, in all economic situations.
This was an unfortunate error, because the core insight of Keynesian economics is that there are very special economic circumstances in which the general rules of economics don't apply and are, in fact, counterproductive.
This happens when interest rates and inflation are so low that there is no essential difference between money and bonds; money, after all, is simply a bond that pays no interest. When this happens, monetary policy becomes impotent; an increase in the money supply has no stimulative effect because it does not lead to additional spending by consumers or businesses.
Keynes called this situation a "liquidity trap." Under such circumstances, government spending can be highly stimulative because it causes money that is sitting idle in bank reserves or savings accounts to circulate and become mobilized through consumption or investment. Thus monetary policy becomes effective once again.
This is an extremely important insight that policy makers have yet to grasp, even though interest rates on Treasury bills are just a couple of basis points above zero and inflation is virtually nonexistent. Although the Federal Reserve has increased the monetary base to almost $3 trillion today from $825 billion in 2007, it has had little apparent stimulative effect.
In normal times, one would expect such an increase in the money supply to be highly inflationary and sharply raise market interest rates. That this has not happened is proof that we have been in a liquidity trap for several years. We needed a lot more government spending than we got to get the economy out of its doldrums.
Although Keynes's theory was most appropriate to the Great Depression, his followers did indeed believe in its general applicability and the Keynesian medicine was overapplied and misapplied during much of the postwar era, leading to stagflation in the 1970s. Conservatives like Professor Buchanan were right about that.
But in their rejection of Keynesian economics at a time when it needed to be rejected, conservatives threw the baby out with the bathwater and are now preventing its adoption when it is badly needed.
The criticism that Professor Ferguson implicitly leveled at Keynes of being excessively short-term oriented, therefore, has a grain of truth in it. But the much greater truth is that we are now holding the economy hostage to policies that are proper for the long-term - like stabilizing the debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio - at a time when we face special circumstances that make such policies perverse.
In short, we are suffering from an excessive long-term focus that is crippling the economy in the short run, and the short run threatens never to end.
A friendly 1984 biography of Keynes by the economist Charles H. Hession acknowledged that his sexual orientation shaped his political philosophy. His homosexuality was "an independent element in his reformist tendency; as such, he was an outsider in a heterosexual world," Professor Hession wrote.
I think this made Keynes more willing to think "outside the box," as we say today, and consider ideas that ran counter to the conventional wisdom. But there is no reason to think he had any less concern for the long-run health of the economy or society than heterosexuals. Keynes understood that the long run is simply an infinite parade of short runs.
But Keynes erred in implying a more general applicability of his theories than he should have. We suffered for this in the past when they were misapplied in inappropriate circumstances, unfortunately discrediting them and preventing their adoption now, in highly appropriate circumstances.

HEADLINE: New York State Investigating Pension-Advance Firms

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: New York&#8217;s top banking regulator has begun an investigation into pension-advance firms, the lenders that woo retirees to sign over their monthly pension checks in return for cash. 

 BODY:
New York's top banking regulator has begun an investigation into pension advance firms, the lenders that woo retirees to sign over their monthly pension checks in return for cash.
The regulator, the Department of Financial Services, sent subpoenas to 10 companies in the business on Tuesday.
Federal and state authorities say that such advances are actually loans that require customers to sign over all or a portion of their monthly pension checks in exchange for a lump-sum payment. The high-cost loans, the authorities say, threaten to erode the retirement savings of a growing number of older Americans, thrusting retirees deep into debt. 
Benjamin M. Lawsky, who heads the agency, calls the pension advances, which were the subject of an article in The New York Times, "nothing more than payday loans in sheep's clothing." The agency took the action at the urging of the office of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
The Times's review of more than two dozen loan contracts found that the loans, once fees were factored in, could come with effective interest rates from 27 to 106 percent - critical information that was not disclosed either in the ads or the contracts.
In its investigation, the Department of Financial Services is examining whether the companies have flouted state usury laws and whether the loans violate a federal law that restricts how military pensions can be used, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. The agency is also investigating whether the lenders dupe retirees into signing up for the loans by disguising the soaring interest rates, the people said.
As the baby boomer generation heads toward retirement and a growing number of older Americans shoulder crippling debt burdens, the pension advance firms are aggressively courting military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with a hard-to-resist pitch: convert tomorrow's pension income into hard cash.
Much like payday loans, which typically are aimed at lower-income borrowers, pension loans can aggravate the distress of the vulnerable elderly who already are grappling with dwindling savings.
"Using deceptive practices to cheat people out of their pensions by enrolling them in backdoor high-interest loans will not be tolerated in our state," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.
The lenders, which operate largely outside of state and federal banking regulations, are drawing fresh scrutiny. The investigation by the Department of Financial Services follows examinations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
To escape state usury laws that put a ceiling on loan rates, some pension advance firms insist their products are advances, not loans, according to the firms' Web sites and federal and state lawsuits.
The advance firms, which evolved from a fleet of different lenders, zero in on military members, according to lawyers for service members. To go after the military members, the lenders have to skirt a federal law that bars veterans from turning over pension payments to third parties. To sidestep the prohibition, the pension advance firms typically urge veterans to set up separate bank accounts controlled by the firms, where the pension checks are deposited before being sent to the lenders, according to a review of the firms' advertisements.
"These companies are literally harvesting the hard-earned pensions of seniors, military veterans and other hard-working New Yorkers," Mr. Cuomo said. He cautioned that "anyone seeking to prey on New Yorkers should know that we will use every tool at our disposal to aggressively pursue and put stop this fraud."
The pension advance firms, which largely advertise on the Internet, are in California, Florida, Delaware, Indiana, Michigan and Washington.

HEADLINE: A Humbled Kleiner Perkins Adjusts Its Strategy

BYLINE: RANDALL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: After big hits in the dot-com boom, Kleiner Perkins has been sideswiped by a series of lackluster bets in green technology and missed chances in social media. 

 BODY:
 During the dot-com boom, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital investment firm, all but minted money, making prescient early investments in Netscape Communications, Amazon.com and Google and delivering astonishing returns to investors. Along the way, it became a symbol of Silicon Valley.
But the firm has hit a rough patch over the last decade, frustrated by unsuccessful forays into clean technology and by a catch-up effort to take later-stage stakes in social media companies.
Kleiner has held a series of status-report meetings with its outside investors this year, acknowledging that recent fund performance "wasn't great," one attendee said. "They really believed green tech was going to be the next big technology wave," this investor added.
Kleiner has also cut some management fees and reorganized its investment approach, eliminating three "silos" that separated teams making investments in clean technology, health care and technology. The firm has added more investing partners with digital expertise, like the former Twitter executive Mike Abbott, after it missed the early window on hot media start-ups like Facebook and Twitter and jumped in later at higher valuations. 
A spokeswoman for Kleiner, which manages $7 billion, said the firm's partners declined to comment.
The latest setback is the fading fortunes of Fisker Automotive, the green-car start-up backed by Kleiner that has laid off much of its work force and hired bankruptcy advisers.
At a Congressional hearing last month, Republican members of a House oversight committee asked witnesses from Fisker and the Energy Department whether Democratic political contributions and influence of Kleiner partners, led by the Obama adviser John Doerr, had helped Fisker gain $192 million in government green-energy loans.
While the questions were clearly partisan, the spotlight on Kleiner added a new level of public criticism to a reputational injury that has been building for several years, denting Kleiner's status as one of the top technology venture capital firms.
Some experts predict Fisker could become one of the biggest venture-capital losses ever. Fisker has raised $1.1 billion in venture financing, the most for any clean-technology start-up, compared with $848 million for Solyndra, the solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, according to the Cleantech Group, which tracks such investments.
Kleiner investors say that three venture funds the firm raised in 1994, 1996 and 1999 - which contained Juniper Networks, Amazon and Google - delivered staggering returns. The 1994 fund delivered 32 times the investors' money, the 1996 fund 17 times, and 1999, six times. But since then, they note, funds raised in 2000 and 2004 have been unprofitable. A $1 billion fund raised in 2008 devoted to clean technology is also showing losses, one investor says.
"They had stellar returns for years, but their reputation has been tarnished by performance of late," said Nancy Lambert, a former private banker at Citigroup who is now an independent adviser to wealthy families and foundations. "It doesn't seem like investors are turning away, they're just more cautious."
Kleiner's investors have included top universities like Harvard and Yale, the Ford Foundation and certain venture capital funds-of-funds.
The firm's reputation was also dented last year when a junior partner, Ellen Pao, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit. She contended that the firm improperly retaliated against her after she complained about being pressured into a sexual relationship by a colleague, resulting in lower compensation and poor performance reviews.
Kleiner has denied all the claims and said that it chose not to promote her based on valid "performance concerns."
The shift in Kleiner's fortunes is emblematic of the venture capital business as a whole, where the titanic returns from the late-1990s dot-com bubble have ebbed, and investor dollars flowing into new funds have slowed as well.
"The days of huge returns in venture are long gone," said Scott Ryles, a longtime Silicon Valley banker who has led two Kleiner-backed companies.
Venture funds returned 35.7 percent annually in the decade ending in 2000, but they lost 1.9 percent annually in the decade ending in 2010, according to data compiled by Cambridge Associates for the National Venture Capital Association.
As a result, annual commitments to venture funds have fallen from $56.1 billion in the four years ending in 2001, to $17.3 billion in the four years ending in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data compiled by the association.
Founded in 1972, Kleiner scored big early returns on Tandem Computers, a maker of processors used by banks and brokerage firms, and Genentech, the biotechnology start-up whose initial public offering electrified the stock market in 1980. The firm cashed in on a spate of hot Internet offerings, led by Netscape and Amazon, during the dot-com bubble.
About five years after the bubble burst, clean technology became Kleiner's marquee strategy. Kleiner hired Al Gore, the former vice president, soon after his 2006 film about global warming, "An Inconvenient Truth," won two Oscars. A member of President Obama's economic recovery advisory board, Mr. Doerr has advocated for government policies and subsidies favoring clean-technology innovation.
"Going green is bigger than the Internet," Mr. Doerr said in 2007. "It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century."
Kleiner has invested in 88 clean-technology companies since 1999, more than any other venture firm, according to the Cleantech Group. They include the personal-transport device Segway, the fuel-cell developer Bloom Energy and the utility smart-grid provider Silver Spring Networks, which went public in March.
In funds raised in 2006, 2008 and 2010, green technology was one of three main strategies, under the aegis of the general partners Ray Lane and Bill Joy - who have since both become partners emeritus. While still committed to clean technology, Kleiner has played down the sector and sought to make less expensive investments within it.
Some of the clean technology bets, like the Mascoma Corporation, a specialized ethanol start-up, and Sundrop Fuels, a developer of biogasoline, require plants that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Pavel Molchanov, a biofuels analyst at Raymond James. In March, Mascoma withdrew plans for a stock offering first filed in September 2011, citing market conditions.
The green-technology portfolio has had its share of flops. Think Global, a Norwegian electric-car company, failed in 2011. Kleiner's investment in MiaSolé, a solar-panel producer, was wiped out when the company was sold to a Chinese clean-energy company at the end of last year. Plans have stalled for V-Vehicle, a plastic-car company later renamed Next Autoworks, which also had backing from Google Ventures and T. Boone Pickens.
Because Kleiner did not invest in earlier clean-technology blowups like Solyndra and Range Fuels, which also received government loans, Fisker presents a new level of public criticism. At the House hearing on April 24, Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Fisker's founder and former executive chairman, Henrik Fisker, about Kleiner's ability to help obtain government loans.
Kleiner Perkins has helped raise "over $2 million in political contributions in the 2008 election cycle, most of which went to Democrats including President Obama," Mr. Jordan said. He asked if that, or Mr. Doerr's role as an Obama adviser, helped Fisker "to get a loan, get taxpayer money from the Department of Energy?"
Mr. Fisker denied "any undue political favors or anything like that," and noted that it was Mr. Lane, not Mr. Doerr, who had served as Kleiner's representative on the Fisker board.
As it focused on green technology, Kleiner lost ground to some rivals like Accel Partners and Greylock Partners, which made early investments in Facebook, which Kleiner missed. The firm seemed to address the issue in late 2010 by hiring Mary Meeker, the former Morgan Stanley Internet analyst known as the "Queen of the Net" during the bubble.
Ms. Meeker has led a $1 billion digital growth fund started in 2011 that has made about 25 later-stage bets including several hot social media start-ups, putting Kleiner in that game but at higher valuations.
While a bet on Facebook is up slightly, its shares of the game developer Zynga are down sharply. Kleiner's biggest current holding, in Twitter, is valued at more than double Kleiner's cost, and the fund is up so far over all, a person briefed on the fund said.
Some of Kleiner's later clean-technology investments have a more digital focus, like Nest Labs, which makes smart thermostats, OPower, which offers energy-efficiency strategies for utility customers, and Clean Power Finance, which finances solar-power installations.
But one of its largest investments, at more than $100 million, is Fisker. In mid-April, the Energy Department seized $21 million from a Fisker reserve account about 10 days before a scheduled loan repayment. Fisker is seeking new funds. But with its car production stalled since mid-2012, any outcome is likely to shred the value of Kleiner's stake.

HEADLINE: Pondering a Berkshire Without Buffett

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Warren E. Buffett rejects the notion that Berkshire Hathaway will go the way of Teledyne. | Bank of America has reached a $1.7 billion agreement with the bond insurer MBIA. | A crowd of young men gathered on Monday in Union Square in Manhattan to buy and sell bitcoins. | The most recent episode of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; provided a lesson in ad agency deal-making, circa 1968. 

 BODY:
At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren E. Buffett rejected the notion that the company would go the way of Teledyne, a conglomerate that was broken up after its leader, Henry E. Singleton, stepped down as chief executive. Mr. Singleton, who might be called the Buffett of his time, decided Teledyne had become too big and unwieldy for a single manager to effectively oversee and expand, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. A breakup of Berkshire, "I'm convinced would create a poorer result," Mr. Buffett said.
But Charles Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, acknowledged a truism: "You look at companies that got really big in the world, the record is not very good. We think we'll do a little better than the giants in the past. Maybe we have a better system." The question, Mr. Sorkin writes, is how much is "a little better"? As Mr. Buffett put it, "There's no question that we cannot do as well as in the past, and size does matter." 
Following Mr. Buffett will not be easy. "Mr. Buffett's successor will have to be not just a great investor and operator, which is difficult enough, but a legendary one that people will rally around," Mr. Sorkin writes. "As time passes, and Berkshire looks more like the conglomerate that it is without the special ingredient that is Mr. Buffett, it is likely to become more challenging for his successor."
BANK OF AMERICA AND MBIA SETTLE MORTGAGE DISPUTE | Bank of America has reached a $1.7 billion agreement to settle a long-running legal dispute with the bond insurer MBIA over mortgage-backed securities that grew troubled. Under the deal, announced on Monday, Bank of America will pay $1.6 billion in cash to MBIA and lend the firm another $500 million. The bank also acquired warrants that could give it a 4.9 percent stake in the insurer, which was in danger of being unable to meet its obligations in a few weeks' time. The agreement cancels out the multibillion-dollar claims the institutions had against each other, dating to the financial crisis.
Shares of MBIA rose 45 percent on word of the settlement. Bank of America shares surged 5 percent.
In a separate matter, Bank of America faces a fresh legal headache. New York's attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, plans to sue Bank of America and Wells Fargo over claims they breached the terms of a $26 billion settlement intended to stop foreclosure abuses. Mr. Schneiderman on Monday said the banks did not follow guidelines for fielding and processing requests from homeowners trying to modify their mortgages.
A BITCOIN BUTTONWOOD | A crowd of young men gathered on Monday in Union Square in Manhattan to buy and sell bitcoins, the digital crypto-currency. "The men - and there were only men - were brought together by an online posting from Josh Rossi, 31, a bitcoin aficionado who works in technology at the World Trade Financial Group," Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook.
Reasoning that the online venues for buying and selling bitcoins had become too expensive and time consuming, Mr. Rossi proposed what he called Project Buttonwood, a reference to where the New York Stock Exchange had its beginning in 1792. "If I want to buy a hamburger, I want to be able to sell my bitcoins and get my money immediately so I can buy that hamburger," said Mr. Rossi.
ON THE AGENDA | Walt Disney and Whole Foods report earnings on Tuesday evening. The European Commission has a conference on economic and monetary reform. Bill Gates is on Bloomberg TV at 8:30 a.m. The SALT conference kicks off in Las Vegas.
'MAD MEN' AND CORPORATE FINANCE | The most recent episode of "Mad Men" provided a lesson in advertising agency deal-making, circa 1968, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced writes. (Warning to readers: spoiler alert.) The episode involves Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce's weighing a potential initial public offering, and "banker proposes selling 400,000 shares to the public at $9 a share. Given Sterling Cooper's existing 1.5 million outstanding shares, that would have valued the agency at $17.1 million - or about $114.4 million in today's dollars," Mr. de la Merced writes.
"By May 1968, when the episode is set, seven ad agencies had held initial stock offerings, according to Ad Age. Among them were Wells Rich Greene and Papert, Koenig, Lois," Mr. de la Merced continues. "Behind the flood of offerings was the booming '60s stock market, which prompted bankers to seek ever more companies to pitch to investors. Services companies like ad agencies became hot commodities, playing off the allure of Madison Avenue and its mad admen."

HEADLINE: Shorter Hours, but Not for Truckers and Temps

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the decline in weekly hours worked shows a big drop for retail, which may be influenced by the coming health mandate. Trucking and temp help services, however, have increased the length of the average worker&#8217;s weekly hours. 

 BODY:
One of the more disappointing data points in last Friday's jobs report was the decline in average weekly hours worked, which fell to 34.4 hours in April from 34.6 hours in March. It's not clear what was behind the decline, which occurred in multiple industries across the private sector. (The monthly jobs report does not include the length of the workweek for government workers.) 
In a note to clients, Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, observed that hours in the retail sector had trended down for the last year, though the numbers had been noisy month-to-month.
"The relatively poor performance of average hours worked in the retail sector looks odd when we consider that the gains in retail employment in the second half of last year were unusually strong," he writes. "Normally, we would expect employment and hours worked to be going in the same direction."
There are different ways to interpret this. One is that, as Mr. Ashworth notes, retailers might be increasingly relying on part-time help to avoid an Affordable Care Act provision that requires businesses with at least 50 full-timers to provide health insurance or pay a penalty (a requirement that kicks in next year, but is based on employment levels this year). 
Blessed with more data on their customers, businesses may also be hewing more closely to the idiosyncrasies of consumer demand and staying open longer - and it's easier to schedule a staff for longer hours of operation if individual employees are working in shorter shifts, according to Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
Strangely enough, food services and drinking establishments, which are among those making the most noise about the Affordable Care Act employer mandate, do not seem to have cut down their hours in recent months. That may be because workers in this sector already work relatively short hours (25.6 weekly hours on average for the latest month of data, versus 31.4 weekly hours in retail), Mr. Ashworth says.
Not all sectors have been paring back hours.
Truck transportation, which has been raising compensation for its workers, has also been expanding their weekly hours:
And perhaps most strikingly, hours for temp workers have also increased over a different time horizon - not over the last few months, but over the last few years. Temp workers now put in more hours than they did during the prerecession boom years, and their average workweek is now longer than that for the overall private sector. Historically, these provisional workers logged fewer hours than their permanent counterparts.
These trends may speak to employers' continued reluctance to make the commitment to permanent hires, even as demand picks up.

HEADLINE: GE Capital Puts On a Lending Roadshow

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
GE CAPITAL this week is embarking on an elaborate advertising campaign with Slate.com featuring a six-month roadshow across the United States meant to stimulate its lending to midsize businesses.
According to research done by the National Center for the Middle Market at Ohio State University, businesses with revenue of $10 million to $1 billion account for more than 43 million jobs in the United States and one-third of the national private sector gross domestic product. GE Capital underwrites the center, founded in 2011. Steven Winoker, who follows General Electric for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, called lending to middle-market businesses a ''profitable business and a core business'' for GE Capital, adding that it was ''probably better at originating this kind of business than its competitors because of its industrial heritage.''
According to Mr. Winoker, GE Capital generated 47 percent of total earnings for General Electric last year, up from 28 percent in 2009; he also said commercial lending and leasing -- a large part of which is to midsize businesses -- was responsible for about a third of GE Capital's profit last year. 
Mr. Winoker said G.E. generally had a ''more advanced view of advertising and marketing and is more aggressive in its approach to marketing than most industrial companies, from its heritage of owning'' NBC Universal, whose sale to Comcast was completed last year.
Nicholas P. Heymann, who follows G.E. for William Blair & Company, said that one factor behind the campaign might be possible changes in banking regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank law's stress test for 2013 that could limit major banks' ability to lend to smaller businesses.
''Some of GE Capital's highest returns on investment come from its middle-market lending portfolio,'' he said. ''If there are changes from a regulatory standpoint, GE Capital wants to be optimally positioned to take advantage of any void that may be created from restricted money center bank lending.''
The campaign -- which began Monday in Kansas City, Mo., and is considered native advertising, or content sponsored by advertisers -- is the most elaborate initiative created by SlateCustom, the custom-publishing arm of Slate.com, the online magazine. Previous native advertising on Slate.com included a campaign by the Dairy Council, which looked at the impact of last year's drought on dairy farmers, and distribution of a video promoting Coca-Cola's anti-obesity campaign.
Ian Forrest, vice president of global marketing at GE Capital, said his company had run traditional banner advertising on Slate.com for the last two years. ''The performance worked really well against our core target audience -- middle-market, C-level executives,'' he said.
He also said the new roadshow, a collaboration jointly developed by GE Capital and Slate.com, was aimed at providing a ''holistic, 360-degree view of the middle-market opportunity,'' and also to ''touch customers, prospective customers, employees and policy makers, to start a dialogue and discussion.'' Another goal, he added, is to motivate legislators to pass new regulations in support of middle-market business growth.
''The Roadshow for Growth'' entails a bus tour through various cities across the United States. After Kansas City, it moves on to St. Louis, Indianapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York, Dallas, Atlanta and Los Angeles, among others. It will end in Columbus, Ohio, in late October.
At each stop, the roadshow will host different events, like town hall discussions, conversations with the city's mayor, and visits with middle-market businesses. In Kansas City on Monday, for example, there was a meeting with Mayor Sly James and a town hall session with GE Capital employees, while the Chicago visit on Thursday is to include a discussion moderated by Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate Group, and featuring Mayor Rahm Emanuel and economist Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Obama administration.
Daily blog posts, video and commentary on the roadshow will be published on a special Web site, roadshow.slate.com. The Web site is being promoted as a ''sponsored section'' on slate.com.
Lindsay Nelson, vice president of integrated programs for Slate.com, said her company had gone to ''great lengths'' to make it clear to readers that the roadshow's online section was ''a special section brought to you by GE Capital, SlateCustom, National Center for the Middle Market,'' via a note on the site and a separate pop-up message.
This disclaimer is no doubt meant to avoid controversy like that generated in January when The Atlantic ran a story on its Web site about the Church of Scientology that resembled its regular content, though it was labeled ''sponsored content.''
Mr. Forrest said GE Capital would promote the roadshow on Slate.com, various G.E. Web sites, and through digital advertising on Web sites of Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg. He said the total budget for the roadshow would be between $1.5 million and $2 million.
According to Kantar Media, GE Capital's advertising expenditures in the last five years ranged from a low of $4.3 million in 2008 to a high of $58 million in 2010; last year's spending was $9.3 million, almost $2 million of which was for Internet display advertising.
Loren Ghiglione, a professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, said the collaboration between Slate.com and GE Capital raised the question of ''what it will do to the reputation of Slate.''
The program's aim to motivate legislators to pass new regulations supporting middle-market businesses ''sounds like lobbying to me. I don't think that journalism and lobbying are the same thing,'' he said.
Sharmila C. Chatterjee, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who studies business-to-business marketing, called the roadshow a ''very nice way for GE Capital to connect with customers, establish credibility and gain their trust, three very important things in the day of information bombardment.''
She warned, though, that if the initiative was ''hijacked by interest groups and gets politicized, the goal will not be fulfilled.''

A California judge has opened the door for the American International Group to pursue a fraud claim of more than $7 billion against Bank of America for losses it suffered on mortgage securities sold under duress after the federal government rescued A.I.G. in 2008.
The ruling, issued late Monday, is a setback for Bank of America, which has been trying to rid itself of numerous legal claims from investors who bought mortgage securities issued by the bank's Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units. In the California case, in which A.I.G., the giant insurance company, sued Bank of America over fraudulent mortgage securities, the bank had argued that A.I.G. had no standing to sue because it had transferred that right when it sold the instruments to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the fall of 2008. 
Mariana R. Pfaelzer, a federal judge in the central district of California, disagreed. She sided with A.I.G. in a ruling that also raised questions about the role of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the wake of its efforts to contain the huge damage from the financial crisis that erupted when Lehman Brothers was forced into bankruptcy in September 2008.
A.I.G. said in a statement, ''As a result of the court's decision, A.I.G. is able to pursue its full damages claim against Bank of America.''
Asked to comment on the judge's decision, Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said the court ruling allowed it to ''pursue additional discovery before the matter is fully decided.'' He added that the bank believed it has strong defenses to A.I.G.'s accusations.
New York Fed officials, testifying earlier on behalf of Bank of America, maintained that they had intended to receive the rights to bring fraud claims related to the mortgage securities purchased by Maiden Lane II, the investment vehicle set up to complete the A.I.G. bailout.
But in depositions in March, Fed officials could produce no evidence that the fraud claims had been specifically transferred under the deal, as required under New York law. Judge Pfaelzer wrote: ''To the extent that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York intended for Maiden Lane II to acquire these claims, its intentions were not expressed to A.I.G.''
The Fed's view on who held the legal claims for fraudulent mortgages in Maiden Lane II has shifted over time. In October 2011, Thomas C. Baxter Jr., the general counsel at the New York Fed, said in a letter to A.I.G. that he and his colleagues ''agree that A.I.G. has the right to seek damages'' under securities laws for the instruments it sold to Maiden Lane II.
But after A.I.G. sued Bank of America, that opinion changed. Last December, James M. Mahoney, a vice president at the New York Fed who said he had principal responsibility for the Maiden Lane II transaction, testified that the New York Fed intended to receive litigation claims associated with the troubled mortgage securities. Bank of America filed Mr. Mahoney's testimony in support of its position that A.I.G. had no standing to sue.
Yet in a deposition three months later, Mr. Mahoney was asked if he could recall discussing the assignment of fraud claims from A.I.G. to the Fed. He answered: ''No, I do not.''
The New York Fed never filed any claims against banks relating to the A.I.G. rescue that might have benefited taxpayers. New York Fed officials agreed to testify on behalf of Bank of America as part of a confidential settlement with the bank that came to light in February. Under the terms of the deal, the New York Fed released Bank of America from all fraud claims on mortgage securities the Fed had bought.
A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment on the ruling. Previously, the New York Fed said it had agreed to testify in the case because doing so helped it obtain the best possible settlement for Maiden Lane II.
While Judge Pfaelzer's ruling added to the legal claims faced by Bank of America, it emerged after the bank successfully disposed of several others. On Monday, in the latest such effort, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to settle a long-running dispute with MBIA, a mortgage bond insurer.
The bank could erase another claim on May 30 if a judge in New York State court allows an $8.5 billion settlement struck between Countrywide and a group of big investors in 2011 to be completed. Investors objecting to the deal say the amount of the settlement is insufficient.
The California judge's finding that A.I.G. has standing to sue Bank of America may also be bad news for other banks that sold troubled mortgage securities to the insurer. A.I.G. has not yet sued other institutions related to the securities that went into Maiden Lane II; at least $11 billion in losses involve other banks.
''We are eager to start discovery,'' said Michael Carlinsky, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who led the arguments for A.I.G., ''and get the case before a jury.''

HEADLINE: A Trans-Atlantic Deal for Africa

BYLINE: By K.Y. AMOAKO, DANIEL HAMILTON and EVELINE HERFKENS

 BODY:
The Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership proposed between the United States and the European Union promises a welcome boost to North Atlantic economies. But if the partnership diverts trade from elsewhere it could leave others in the cold: Much depends on its design and the way the U.S. and the E.U. handle the multiple trade agreements that each has with third countries and regions.
The United States and the E.U. would do well to send an early signal that the T.T.I.P. is about open markets by harmonizing their current hodgepodge of trade preference mechanisms for low-income African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world, accounts for a minuscule 2 percent of world trade. 
This marginalization of the region is holding back its development at a time when its economic governance is rapidly improving. Sub-Saharan Africa needs generous access to developed consumer markets to spur investment in labor-intensive export sectors that can spark growth and contribute to its successful economic transformation.
Both the United States and the European Union give trade preferences for (some) products from (some) countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
The E.U. provides duty-free and quota-free access to its markets for all products -- but only to the 27 least-developed countries in the region. It also offers less generous access to former colonies through preferential deals.
The U.S. scheme benefits 40 of the 48 countries in the region, but excludes key agricultural products (such as cotton) that African countries can produce competitively.
These schemes may look good on paper, but they are actually underutilized because of their administrative complexity and outdated rules. Local content requirements are too high, and the rules of origin required for product eligibility were created decades before the development of today's value chains, which involve many countries specializing in fragmented tasks. Moreover, the U.S. and the E.U. use different methods to define origin, forcing exporters to cope with a myriad of rules.
It is difficult to justify a North Atlantic trade deal in which the participants have differing rules for developing countries. What foreign policy interest is served, for example, if the E.U. and the U.S. provide different access to Kenya's products? All relatively poor sub-Saharan countries should benefit equally.
The United States and the European Union should harmonize their trade preference schemes for sub-Saharan Africa as part of their partnership pact.
The scheme should cover all products, since excluding just a few could encompass most products that these countries can produce competitively. Rules of origin need to be relevant, simple and flexible for beneficiaries to be able to use the schemes and benefit from the growth of value chains.
Such value chains have virtually bypassed the region so far, but they hold considerable potential for less-developed African countries. It is much easier for these countries to develop capabilities in a narrow range of tasks than in integrated production of entire products or processes.
Updating these rules to the realities of 21st century production networks is long overdue. This should be an essential part of the T.T.I.P., but early signs point to the negotiations being complex and protracted.
But sub-Saharan Africa cannot wait. As an interim solution the European Union and the United States could recognize each other's origin regime. If an import is eligible for preferential treatment in America, it should be also in Europe, and vice versa.
By acting now, the United States and the European Union would also demonstrate that T.T.I.P. is about opening markets rather than diverting trade.
K.Y. Amaoko is the founding president of the African Center for Economic Transformation. Daniel Hamilton directs the Center for Trans-Atlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins's School of Advanced International Studies. Eveline Herfkens is former development minister of the Netherlands and founder of the U.N. Millennium Campaign.

HEADLINE: World Trade Organization Chooses Its First Latin American Leader

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Roberto Carvalho de Azevêdo of Brazil will be the next leader of the World Trade Organization, a Brazilian official said Tuesday, and will take the reins at a time when the group is fighting to remain relevant.
Representatives of the 159 W.T.O. member states, meeting in Geneva, reached consensus on Mr. Azevêdo late Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian foreign ministry said. The organization was scheduled to make an official announcement on Wednesday. 
Mr. Azevêdo, a career diplomat and Brazil's permanent representative to the W.T.O., would be the sixth person and the first Latin American to lead the global trade body since its creation in 1995. He beat out seven other candidates for the position, including the other finalist, the former Mexican trade minister Herminio Blanco Mendoza, who had the backing of the European Union.
Mr. Azevêdo has said that his goal at the organization is ''to build bridges among my peers in Geneva.'' In the end, his candidacy appealed to a number of developing countries, which saw his final opponent, Mr. Blanco -- who holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago -- as a favorite of the United States and other wealthy nations.
The current chief, Pascal Lamy, took office in 2005 and will step down after his second four-year term expires Sept. 1.
Petros Mavroidis, a professor of trade law at Columbia University in New York, noted that Mr. Azevêdo had an insider's knowledge of how the W.T.O. worked, something he said might help him work out ''a face-saving compromise'' over the deadlocked Doha round of trade negotiations. But Mr. Mavroidis also said he was surprised that the group, facing existential doubts, had not chosen someone with more political weight, ''someone like Bill Clinton.''
''They haven't delivered anything for years,'' Mr. Mavroidis said. ''Mr. Azevêdo is a skillful ambassador, but I think you need someone to shake the place up. And I don't know if he's the one to do it.''
Mr. Azevêdo takes over at a time when the W.T.O. -- established as a forum for setting global trade rules, reducing barriers to commerce and settling disputes -- appears to have lost its way. Early optimism about the Doha round, which began in 2001 and which many had hoped would be the organization's crowning achievement, has long since faded.
Mr. Lamy, a Frenchman, initially earned high marks for his efforts on the Doha round, but nations' disagreements on agricultural subsidies, tariffs on manufactured goods and developing countries' access to global markets, coupled with the onset of the global financial crisis, effectively killed the appetite for a global pact. Instead, major trading nations have been bargaining over deals at the regional and bilateral levels.
One of the most ambitious regional proposals is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to link the United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Japan and others. More recently, the United States and the European Union have also signaled interest in a free trade agreement.
The technical complexity of both proposals, as well as opposition from numerous special interests, probably means that years of negotiations lie ahead before either yields fruit.
Some economists argue that the rapid growth of developing nations like China, Brazil and India has left the W.T.O. hopelessly out of date.
Michael Punke, the U.S. ambassador to the W.T.O., called last month for its members to make an all-out effort to take at least a small step toward regaining momentum for a multilateral deal at a trade ministers' meeting set for Bali in December.
''Absent a course correction, the current path of talks would lead directly to failure at Bali,'' Mr. Punke warned. ''And if Bali fails, it is hard to imagine how Doha can succeed.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China's Explosion in Electronic Retailing

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Chinese consumers shop online, using gadgets like smartphones and tablets, more frequently than their counterparts elsewhere, according to a report released Tuesday by the consulting firm PwC. 
The findings, which are based on a survey of more than 11,000 online shoppers in 11 countries, underline the speed at which China has emerged as one of the world's most wired retail markets.
Online shopping, nearly nonexistent in China as recently as five years ago, has emerged as a major sales channel for retailers, with combined sales of about 1.3 trillion renminbi, or $211 billion, last year, said Carrie Yu, China and Asia Pacific retail and consumer expert at PwC in Hong Kong.
''Things are happening very fast here,'' Ms. Yu said. ''E-tailing has become a major focus for C.E.O.'s across all segments of retailing, whether it's electrical goods, luxury goods or even groceries.''
The explosive growth of electronic shopping in China has led to the country's emergence as one of the world's busiest online shopping markets, both in terms of overall sales volumes and in terms of the frequency with which consumers shop online, Ms. Yu said.
In China, 58 percent of respondents in the PwC report said they shopped online at least once a week, for example. That percentage was by far the highest of any of the countries covered in the PwC survey. By comparison, only 42 percent of U.S. respondents, 41 percent of those in Britain, and 29 percent of German respondents said they shopped online at least once a week. The percentage was lowest in France, where only 13 percent said they made online purchases once or more a week.
Chinese consumers are also significantly more likely than their counterparts in other parts of the world to use smartphones or tablets, rather than PCs, to make online purchases. More than one third of Chinese online shoppers used such devices, about double the global average, the PwC report found.
The quest for lower prices has been a main driver of online shopping around the world in recent years, especially in the half-decade since the global financial crisis, when consumers in many parts of the world became more eager to save money, Ms. Yu said.
In China, however, the growth of online shopping has been given several extra kicks.
The economy has continued to grow rapidly; wages have risen; and the country's online population has ballooned along with better communications networks and the easy availability of online devices.
''In a nation where many other sectors are rapidly expanding, e-tailing stands out for its astonishing growth,'' McKinsey wrote in a report published in March.
According to McKinsey, China was the world's second-largest e-tailing market, after the United States, in 2011, with sales totaling $120 billion -- well above the $107 billion in Japan, and more than twice those recorded in Britain, for example. By 2012, China came ''very close to equaling the United States for the top spot'' in terms of e-tailing volumes, McKinsey added.

HEADLINE: Rubio Disputes Report On Immigration Bill Costs

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, aggressively pushed back Tuesday against a Heritage Foundation report that estimated new immigration legislation would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion by using the foundation's longstanding support for dynamic scoring -- which takes into account projected economic growth when determining the cost of legislation -- as a cudgel against it.
''Heritage, I think, is the king of dynamic scoring, and in many respects we've advocated for dynamic scoring here because of the positions that they've taken,'' Mr. Rubio, a chief author of the legislation, told reporters. ''They are the only group that's looked at this issue and reached the conclusion they've reached. Everybody else who has analyzed immigration reform understands that if you do it, and we do it right, it will be a net positive for our economy.'' 
The Heritage Foundation analysis released Monday found that the immigration legislation, which offers a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country, would produce a ''lifetime fiscal deficit'' of at least $6.3 trillion -- an amount calculated by assuming that immigrants would receive $9.4 trillion in government benefits and services, while paying only $3.1 trillion in taxes.
Critics say the analysis does not account for the economic benefits that would arise from taking millions of people out of a shadow economy. A similar analysis by the conservative group helped scuttle earlier attempts at overhauling immigration laws.
Mr. Rubio is a protégé and close friend of Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina senator and new president of the Heritage Foundation. While Mr. Rubio's office has been reluctant to take on Mr. DeMint directly, he and his staff have spent weeks indirectly rebutting the Heritage Foundation's expected economic analysis, arguing that the public benefits of an immigration overhaul would outweigh any cost-related concerns.
With the Heritage study finally out, Mr. Rubio pressed his case even more forcefully.
''Their argument is based on a single premise, which I think is flawed,'' he said. ''That is these people are disproportionately poor because they have no education and they will be poor for the rest of their lives in the U.S. Quite frankly, that's not the immigration experience in the U.S. That's certainly not my family's experience in the U.S.''
Officials at the Heritage Foundation dismissed the criticism. ''The dynamic scoring complaint is merely an attempt to distract from the entirely valid and incontrovertible finding of our report: that amnesty will cost taxpayers at least an additional $6.3 trillion in government benefits,'' the organization said.
As part of Mr. Rubio's effort to shore up support for his immigration bill, he met in his Senate office Tuesday afternoon with about 20 grass-roots conservative leaders who are largely supportive of the overhaul. Several attendees said Mr. Rubio had told them that he expected the bill that reaches the president's desk to be more conservative than the current legislation.
''He feels that in the markup and committee process, the bill probably needs to move to the right, not the left, and that it may move further to the right if it gets out of the Senate and over to the House,'' said Colin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring, a conservative grass-roots public policy organization.
On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will take up the legislation. As of Tuesday evening, the filing deadline for amendments, more than 50 (and counting) had been filed -- including one from Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the committee chairman, that would allow American citizens in committed long-term, same-sex relationships to sponsor their foreign partners for green cards.
Mr. Rubio had long anticipated the Heritage Foundation analysis and had taken pains to try to head it off. In a letter last month to David S. Addington, the group's vice president for research, Mr. Rubio urged the foundation to continue its history of ''pro-growth economic policy and analysis'' by using dynamic scoring when considering an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.
''As I consider the potential impact of immigration reform, I am keenly aware that there will be budgetary impacts when illegal immigrants begin to access citizenship beginning 13 years after immigration reform is enacted,'' Mr. Rubio wrote.
''However, I also believe that immigration reform that shifts the mix of legal immigration away from family-based toward highly skilled/merit-based combined with bringing millions of undocumented aliens out of the underground economy will improve the labor market, increase entrepreneurship and create jobs, leading to a net increase in economic growth and reducing the deficit.''
Mr. Rubio's argument, outlined in his letter, underscores an unlikely debate raging in conservative circles. Dynamic scoring has long been an article of faith among Republicans, who have used it to justify tax cuts, arguing that the cuts will add less to the federal deficit than estimated -- or even pay for themselves -- by spurring economic growth and generating tax receipts.
In fact, the Republicans considered it a coup in March when Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, successfully offered a nonbinding resolution that calls on the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation to produce a dynamic score when estimating tax legislation.

HEADLINE: Melanie Meyers

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Ms. Meyers, 53, is a partner at the law firm Fried Frank, specializing in land use. She represents several large developers, including the Related Companies, Forest City Ratner and the Rudin Management Company.
Before joining Fried Frank in 2003, Ms. Meyers served as general counsel for the New York City Planning Department.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. Tell me a little about what a land-use lawyer does.
A. I represent developers in a few different ways: they either are looking at or buying properties. They're assessing the development potential of properties, and so we help them in trying to figure out what they're acquiring or what they have, what additional development opportunities they have and how they might create a better asset out of the properties that they have.
I work a lot in actually undertaking land-use changes and approvals for projects.
Q. You were a practicing architect. Why did you not stay in that field?
A. I love architecture, and I like every architect who I work with. What I was interested in was much more how a building fits within its context, how it contributes to the infrastructure of the city. I'm a little less interested in the details of the building itself.
Q. How many projects are you working on?
A. When I do the list, I end up with 15 to 18 to 22, depending on the day.
There certainly was a slowdown after the financial crisis, but we've been progressively busier and busier.
Q. Let's talk about some of your projects, starting with Hudson Yards on the Far West Side.
A. We represent the Related Companies on the western rail yards, and our firm as a whole represented Related from the beginning to the end.
We represented them on the original designation. What they are acquiring or will be acquiring at that time were two very large properties, some of which hadn't been zoned yet. They were planning on doing about eight million square feet, primarily residential development, on a site that was zoned for a quarter of that and only for manufacturing and commercial uses. We created an entire section of the zoning resolution that would allow for the property to be rezoned and to be developed.
Q. How about Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn?
A. It was actually a state project that wasn't subject to zoning, but because it wasn't subject to zoning we actually had to create a different design framework -- so effectively creating design guidelines for the overall build-out of the project, and continuing to work with them on the implementation of the project. It's another one of those projects that's going to last forever.
They're working on the first residential building, and that's actually under construction. They're doing it as a modular building, so they're potentially transforming the way that buildings are built in the city.
Q. Did that cause complications?
A. From a lawyer's standpoint, I was pretty happy that we developed a framework that was flexible enough to go from traditional development to modular development without having to change the basic design structure.
Q. There have been complications in other projects, like the mixed-use redevelopment at St. Vincent's hospital in the West Village.
A. This is a project with the Rudin family, and we represented them through the land-use process. It was a very specific and detailed approval. We needed a series of special permits and rezoning for the area. That was a project in a landmark district.
I spent a lot of time working on solving very specific problems. We think that the overall project that came out really is terrific and preserves a number of historic resources, provides open space and brings the health care component back to the Village.
We're still working on refining the open space area that's being developed. They're bringing in a memorial component for the AIDS and H.I.V. epidemic.
Q. What trends are we seeing in city zoning?
A. The city has had some thought about zoning, particularly in this administration. One of the things that they've done -- and Hudson Yards was the biggest example -- they really thought about how zoning works in a very comprehensive way, how it works with open space and how it works with infrastructure. It used zoning to really create a neighborhood from the ground up.
Q. What do you do in your free time?
A. I have a rather unhealthy obsession with tennis -- I play three or four times a week. I started, unfortunately, in my 40s, so it's kind of a wasted effort.

During the dot-com boom, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital investment firm, all but minted money, making prescient early investments in Netscape Communications, Amazon.com and Google and delivering astonishing returns to investors. Along the way, it became a symbol of Silicon Valley.
But the firm has hit a rough patch over the last decade, frustrated by unsuccessful forays into clean technology and by a catch-up effort to take later-stage stakes in social media companies.
Kleiner has held a series of status-report meetings with its outside investors this year, acknowledging that recent fund performance ''wasn't great,'' one attendee said. ''They really believed green tech was going to be the next big technology wave,'' this investor added.
Kleiner has also cut some management fees and reorganized its investment approach, eliminating three ''silos'' that separated teams making investments in clean technology, health care and technology. The firm has added more investing partners with digital expertise, like the former Twitter executive Mike Abbott, after it missed the early window on hot media start-ups like Facebook and Twitter and jumped in later at higher valuations. 
A spokeswoman for Kleiner, which manages $7 billion, said the firm's partners declined to comment.
The latest setback is the fading fortunes of Fisker Automotive, the green-car start-up backed by Kleiner that has laid off much of its work force and hired bankruptcy advisers.
At a Congressional hearing last month, Republican members of a House oversight committee asked witnesses from Fisker and the Energy Department whether Democratic political contributions and influence of Kleiner partners, led by the Obama adviser John Doerr, had helped Fisker gain $192 million in government green-energy loans.
While the questions were clearly partisan, the spotlight on Kleiner added a new level of public criticism to a reputational injury that has been building for several years, denting Kleiner's status as one of the top technology venture capital firms.
Some experts predict Fisker could become one of the biggest venture-capital losses ever. Fisker has raised $1.1 billion in venture financing, the most for any clean-technology start-up, compared with $848 million for Solyndra, the solar-panel maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, according to the Cleantech Group, which tracks such investments.
Kleiner investors say that three venture funds the firm raised in 1994, 1996 and 1999 -- which contained Juniper Networks, Amazon and Google -- delivered staggering returns. The 1994 fund delivered 32 times the investors' money, the 1996 fund 17 times, and 1999, six times. But since then, they note, funds raised in 2000 and 2004 have been unprofitable. A $1 billion fund raised in 2008 devoted to clean technology is also showing losses, one investor says.
''They had stellar returns for years, but their reputation has been tarnished by performance of late,'' said Nancy Lambert, a former private banker at Citigroup who is now an independent adviser to wealthy families and foundations. ''It doesn't seem like investors are turning away, they're just more cautious.''
Kleiner's investors have included top universities like Harvard and Yale, the Ford Foundation and certain venture capital funds-of-funds.
The firm's reputation was also dented last year when a junior partner, Ellen Pao, filed a sex discrimination lawsuit. She contended that the firm improperly retaliated against her after she complained about being pressured into a sexual relationship by a colleague, resulting in lower compensation and poor performance reviews.
Kleiner has denied all the claims and said that it chose not to promote her based on valid ''performance concerns.''
The shift in Kleiner's fortunes is emblematic of the venture capital business as a whole, where the titanic returns from the late-1990s dot-com bubble have ebbed, and investor dollars flowing into new funds have slowed as well.
''The days of huge returns in venture are long gone,'' said Scott Ryles, a longtime Silicon Valley banker who has led two Kleiner-backed companies.
Venture funds returned 35.7 percent annually in the decade ending in 2000, but they lost 1.9 percent annually in the decade ending in 2010, according to data compiled by Cambridge Associates for the National Venture Capital Association.
As a result, annual commitments to venture funds have fallen from $56.1 billion in the four years ending in 2001, to $17.3 billion in the four years ending in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters data compiled by the association.
Founded in 1972, Kleiner scored big early returns on Tandem Computers, a maker of processors used by banks and brokerage firms, and Genentech, the biotechnology start-up whose initial public offering electrified the stock market in 1980. The firm cashed in on a spate of hot Internet offerings, led by Netscape and Amazon, during the dot-com bubble.
About five years after the bubble burst, clean technology became Kleiner's marquee strategy. Kleiner hired Al Gore, the former vice president, soon after his 2006 film about global warming, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' won two Oscars. A member of President Obama's economic recovery advisory board, Mr. Doerr has advocated for government policies and subsidies favoring clean-technology innovation.
''Going green is bigger than the Internet,'' Mr. Doerr said in 2007. ''It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.''
Kleiner has invested in 88 clean-technology companies since 1999, more than any other venture firm, according to the Cleantech Group. They include the personal-transport device Segway, the fuel-cell developer Bloom Energy and the utility smart-grid provider Silver Spring Networks, which went public in March.
In funds raised in 2006, 2008 and 2010, green technology was one of three main strategies, under the aegis of the general partners Ray Lane and Bill Joy -- who have since both become partners emeritus. While still committed to clean technology, Kleiner has played down the sector and sought to make less expensive investments within it.
Some of the clean technology bets, like the Mascoma Corporation, a specialized ethanol start-up, and Sundrop Fuels, a developer of biogasoline, require plants that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Pavel Molchanov, a biofuels analyst at Raymond James. In March, Mascoma withdrew plans for a stock offering first filed in September 2011, citing market conditions.
The green-technology portfolio has had its share of flops. Think Global, a Norwegian electric-car company, failed in 2011. Kleiner's investment in MiaSolé, a solar-panel producer, was wiped out when the company was sold to a Chinese clean-energy company at the end of last year. Plans have stalled for V-Vehicle, a plastic-car company later renamed Next Autoworks, which also had backing from Google Ventures and T. Boone Pickens.
Because Kleiner did not invest in earlier clean-technology blowups like Solyndra and Range Fuels, which also received government loans, Fisker presents a new level of public criticism. At the House hearing on April 24, Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, asked Fisker's founder and former executive chairman, Henrik Fisker, about Kleiner's ability to help obtain government loans.
Kleiner Perkins has helped raise ''over $2 million in political contributions in the 2008 election cycle, most of which went to Democrats including President Obama,'' Mr. Jordan said. He asked if that, or Mr. Doerr's role as an Obama adviser, helped Fisker ''to get a loan, get taxpayer money from the Department of Energy?''
Mr. Fisker denied ''any undue political favors or anything like that,'' and noted that it was Mr. Lane, not Mr. Doerr, who had served as Kleiner's representative on the Fisker board.
As it focused on green technology, Kleiner lost ground to some rivals like Accel Partners and Greylock Partners, which made early investments in Facebook, which Kleiner missed. The firm seemed to address the issue in late 2010 by hiring Mary Meeker, the former Morgan Stanley Internet analyst known as the ''Queen of the Net'' during the bubble.
Ms. Meeker has led a $1 billion digital growth fund started in 2011 that has made about 25 later-stage bets including several hot social media start-ups, putting Kleiner in that game but at higher valuations.
While a bet on Facebook is up slightly, its shares of the game developer Zynga are down sharply. Kleiner's biggest current holding, in Twitter, is valued at more than double Kleiner's cost, and the fund is up so far over all, a person briefed on the fund said.
Some of Kleiner's later clean-technology investments have a more digital focus, like Nest Labs, which makes smart thermostats, OPower, which offers energy-efficiency strategies for utility customers, and Clean Power Finance, which finances solar-power installations.
But one of its largest investments, at more than $100 million, is Fisker. In mid-April, the Energy Department seized $21 million from a Fisker reserve account about 10 days before a scheduled loan repayment. Fisker is seeking new funds. But with its car production stalled since mid-2012, any outcome is likely to shred the value of Kleiner's stake.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Cuts Ties With Key North Korean Bank

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and NICK CUMMING-BRUCE

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The state-controlled Bank of China said on Tuesday that it had ended all dealings with a key North Korean bank in what appeared to be the strongest public Chinese response yet to North Korea's willingness to brush aside warnings from Beijing and push ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Chinese analysts said the Bank of China's move carried clear diplomatic significance at a time when the Obama administration has been urging China to limit its longtime support for the North Korean government. The Bank of China's action also dovetails with a longstanding American effort to target the North Korean government's access to foreign currency. Most countries' banks already refuse to have any financial dealings with North Korea, making the Bank of China's role particularly important. 
''I personally don't believe that this would have been a business decision by the bank alone, and it's probably a signal from the government to reflect its views on North Korea,'' said Cai Jian, a professor and the deputy director of the Center for Korean Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
''This appears to be a step by the government to show that it's willing to cooperate with the international community in strengthening sanctions or perhaps taking steps against illicit North Korean financial transactions,'' he said.
Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat in Washington who is now a vice president of the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, said the Chinese government was responding to a recent United Nations resolution imposing further sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear and ballistic missile tests and was not responding to American pressure. He noted that the Chinese government had recently encouraged state-controlled enterprises to follow the resolution in their dealings with North Korea.
''This is, I think, one of the concrete actions taken by China, that we will surely follow what the U.N. requires,'' he said in a telephone interview.
In another sign of international pressure on North Korea, the United Nations announced Tuesday that it had appointed a prominent Australian jurist to lead a panel tasked with investigating human rights abuses and possible crimes against humanity in North Korea ''with a view to ensuring full accountability.''
Michael Kirby, a former Australian high court judge and legal reformer, will lead the human rights panel, a Commission of Inquiry, the United Nations Human Rights Council said in a statement released in Geneva. Its other members will be a Serbian human rights campaigner, Sonja Biserko, and Marzuki Darusman, who is already serving as a United Nations investigator monitoring North Korea.
Key issues for the panel include North Korea's network of political prison camps, believed by human rights organizations to hold up to 200,000 people; the state's manipulation of access to food as a tool of political repression; and enforced disappearances, including abductions of Japanese. All such abuses may constitute crimes against humanity, Mr. Darusman said in a report to the Human Rights Council in March.
In a single-sentence statement on Tuesday afternoon, the Bank of China said it has ''already issued a bank account closing notice to North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank, and has ceased accepting funds transfer business related to this bank account.''
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to say whether money in the account would be frozen or returned to North Korea. The spokeswoman, who insisted that her name not be used in keeping with bank policy, said the account had been closed by the end of April.
The Bank of China was the overseas banking arm of China's central bank until the 1980s and is still majority-owned by the Chinese government, playing an important role in diplomatic and financial policy.
A succession of United States administrations has pressed China for many years to rein in the nuclear program of North Korea, a client state that China has long supported financially and diplomatically as a bulwark against South Korea and the American military forces based there. China has been reluctant until now to join international sanctions against North Korea, but there have been growing signs of dissatisfaction among Chinese intellectuals and possibly Chinese officials about the extent to which the North has shrugged off warnings and pushed ahead with tests in recent months of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
The United States Treasury imposed sanctions in March on the North Korean Foreign Trade Bank after accusing it of involvement in nuclear proliferation. Tom Donilon, the White House national security adviser, called at the time for China to stop conducting ''business as usual'' with North Korea.
Mr. Cai said that the move by the Bank of China appeared to be ''predominantly symbolic,'' but later added, ''It could have practical consequences, because North Korea is already under such heavy international sanctions, and China is such an important economic channel for it.
''If China narrows the door to North Korea, then its economic operations or financial flows could be affected,'' he said. ''But primarily this appears to be a way of China showing its views about their behavior, so that North Korea is more likely to rethink its actions.''
The United Nations commission intends to document abuses as a way of pressuring North Korea's leaders to improve conditions for the country's 24 million people. Officials have few expectations that the North will grant access to the commission members, but Mr. Darusman said in March that an international inquiry ''affords a measure of protection, especially when coupled with the prospect of future criminal investigations and the deterrent effect such a prospect may have on individual perpetrators.''

HEADLINE: A Historic Textile Mill Begins a New Chapter

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
After a complicated 20-year effort to save a redbrick mill in North Carolina that was once considered the largest in the world for textiles and that played a significant role in the South's textile history, the plant is finally moving toward a new life as a multiuse complex.
The Loray Mill, which for decades produced fabric for car tires, last month began a $40 million conversion project that will create 190 apartments in its six stories, as well as several floors of shops and restaurants. The mill, which was the site of an famous labor strike in the 1920s, is in the city of Gastonia, a former industrial hub outside of Charlotte.
To the delight of preservationists, the development team of JBS Ventures, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., and Camden Management Partners, of Atlanta, will retain much of the original 600,000-square-feet structure of the complex. This first phase of the redevelopment will reinvent about 450,000 square feet of the mill, including the main section, which dates to 1902. 
Gastonia officials, too, say there's a lot to like about a project that continues decades of effort to remake a longtime industrial center as a bedroom community of Charlotte, which is just 30 minutes away. At the very least, they say that a redeveloped Loray (pronounced LOW-ray) could revitalize its immediate neighborhood, whose sidewalk-lined blocks once bustled with mill workers but have long since grown quiet. The mill is on the west side of town in a primarily residential area where boarded-up buildings dot the main commercial drag.
''When you put this many apartments and businesses in an area where there's been so much disinvestment, it's enough to create its own weather,'' said Jack Kiser, Gastonia's senior executive for special projects. ''It will have a catalytic effect.''
In many ways, the project, which is to be completed in 2014, is lucky even to be under way. Dozens of other mills, which went up in the central part of the state around the turn of the last century, as textile businesses relocated to North Carolina from New England, have fallen into ruin or been razed.
Loray Mill has seen several development proposals come and go since 1994, when Firestone, which had owned it since the Great Depression, shut the mill down and left for a more modern plant in a nearby community. Firestone has, however, continued some operations in a smaller building toward the rear of the property.
An early condo plan for the mill failed, and in the late 1990s, Firestone was poised to demolish the building, which features a 140-foot tower that is the tallest in Gastonia. But the company ultimately donated it to Preservation North Carolina, a nonprofit group, which paid its power bills and hired security guards while marketing the property, according to Myrick Howard, president of the preservation group.
''This was by far the most time-consuming project I have ever worked on,'' added Mr. Howard, who estimated his group had helped save 700 buildings across the state since the 1970s.
In 2003, the current developers approached Preservation North Carolina about buying the property, with its arched windows and open floors lined with columns, but the team struggled to line up financing. Then, the recession hit, sapping public financing for the project and derailing efforts once again.
Today, Berkadia, a lender, is providing a $22 million loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration. Most of the balance is coming from two investors: Chevron, through federal preservation tax credits, and the health care provider Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which is taking advantage of state tax credits that encourage mill conversions.
The developers are also supplying equity, said Billy Hughes, a JBS principal, though he declined to specify the amount. The sale price of the mill was $660,000.
While the building's industrial legacy may be part of its draw, it has also stoked some local opposition. In 1929, Loray was the site of a violent labor strike that lasted for months and resulted in two deaths, including that of Orville Aderholt, Gastonia's police chief, and Ella Mae Wiggins, a union organizer and protest singer.
Even as leftover machinery was being removed from the mill in April, an older resident told Mr. Hughes the mill had tarnished Gastonia's name and should be torn down, according to Mr. Hughes.
''This project has lived 1,000 lives,'' said Mr. Hughes, whose previous development credits include the Johnston Mill Lofts, for which he also partnered with Camden. That 330-unit rental complex is in a former production facility for cotton fabric in Columbus, Georgia.
The Loray project will take place in two phases. The first and larger phase will target the mill's oldest part, which includes the tower. The 190 apartments will start at 1,000 square feet each and will be spread across the top four floors.
The apartments will play up the mill's industrial heritage, with exposed trusses on 16-foot ceilings, although concrete will be poured atop wood floors to muffle tenant footsteps, Mr. Hughes said.
Prices haven't been set yet, but the nearby Armstrong Apartments, a recently redeveloped 1921 building with 18 units, rented its one-bedrooms for $600 a month and achieved full occupancy after only a few weeks of leasing this spring, according to Dewey Anderson, its developer.
The complex will also have 34,000 square feet of amenity space, including a fitness center and outdoor pool. The retail spaces at Loray will occupy 79,000 square feet on the bottom two floors. A market, dry cleaner and coffee shop will probably be among the 15 tenants, though none have signed up yet.
Loray will also have a 6,000-square-foot public ''memorial hall'' with mill mementos, including looms, weaving machines and old photos, Mr. Hughes said.
A restaurant could be tucked into the tower, though ''there really needs to be a synergistic fit for our residents,'' said Mr. Hughes, who added that asking rents for the commercial spaces were still being determined.
Retail rents in Gastonia range from $12 to $20 a square foot, though that is usually for ground-level berths in strip malls on busy streets, unlike Loray's setup, said Jerry Roche, owner of Centra Properties, a local commercial brokerage. The mill is on a quiet street of modest homes with open porches, although it does have plenty of parking in lots surrounding the property.
In the project's second phase, the developer will focus on a 150,000-square-foot wing built in the 1920s, with a renovation to cost at least $15 million. The ratio of homes to stores in this phase has not yet been set.
The property isn't totally shedding its industrial past. Firestone will continue to coat its tire fabric in a low-slung 200,000-square-foot building at the rear of the property, company officials said. Some apartment windows will gaze out at the complex, though a new 12-foot wall will screen views from the pool deck, Mr. Hughes said.
What effect the new complex might have on the surrounding blocks is up for debate. Gastonia officials, citing their own research, say the neighborhood will benefit from about $330 million in new investment in the area, though that won't come to fruition for three decades.
But others worry the mill's somewhat isolated location could work against it. ''The west side of Gastonia still has a long ways to go,'' said Mr. Roche, the broker and a 28-year resident of the region.
Still, Mr. Roche said, most of the community is rooting for something to happen at a site that has long languished. ''This is an important project for the city,'' Mr. Roche said, ''and we wish them the very, very, very best.''

HEADLINE: As Price of Nuclear Energy Drops, a Wisconsin Plant Is Shut

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Kewaunee nuclear power plant in Wisconsin shut down for the last time on Tuesday, but it is preparing to break new ground for the American nuclear industry.
It may go to sleep, Snow White-style, for 50 years, to be awakened when its radioactivity has subsided. Or it may be dismantled in the next decade or so. In either case, the responsibility and the expense, probably near $1 billion, will be borne for the first time by a for-profit company, not a regulated utility.
The Kewaunee plant, which opened in 1974, was sold in 2005 to Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., by its owners, the Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Wisconsin Power and Light. In the past, the lengthy decommissioning process that nuclear power requires was in the hands of local companies, which have had the option to go to a public service commission and ask for a rate increase to pay for the job if it proved unexpectedly difficult. 
But Kewaunee was a ''merchant'' plant, a sort of free agent on the grid, selling its electricity on contract, at a price set by the market, not by the government.
Dominion says it has reserved enough money to do the job, and a big enough bank account if the reserve fund does not suffice. So far, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission agrees, although a commission expert said the actual budget was open to question. But ''when you try to do any of these calculations beyond seven years, I'll be frank with you,'' said Michael Dusaniwskyj, an economist with the commission. ''It's a shot in the dark.''
The variables for Kewaunee, which is about 35 miles southeast of Green Bay, include the amount it can win in a legal dispute with the Energy Department, which was supposed to start taking away the spent fuel more than a decade ago but will not begin doing so for many years to come. Other factors are the scrap value of the tons of steel and copper in its equipment and structure, and the rate of return it can earn, above inflation, on the $578 million reserve Dominion has set aside.
Three Wisconsin state agencies said they had had no jurisdiction since the public service commission approved the sale of Kewaunee eight years ago. That does not mean that no one is concerned.
''It's a strange situation for sure, for Wisconsin, which has very little to do with a decision made by another entity, and it's going to be around for another 60 years,'' said Charles Higley, the director of the Citizens Utility Board, a nonprofit agency that seeks to represent residential consumers, farmers and small businesses before the public service commission.
But the chief nuclear officer of Dominion, David A. Heacock, said his company projected that the money on hand would be enough, even before recovering money from the Energy Department, which it estimates could amount to $350 million, or the income from the sale of scrap metal.
Still, the retirement comes at a time of rapid cost inflation. Last month, Mr. Dusaniwskyj told stock analysts in a conference call organized by UBS Investment Research that the utilities' estimate of the cost of decommissioning was rising 8 to 9 percent a year, pushed by the cost of burying the lightly contaminated concrete and steel. That cost could change markedly in coming years, depending on whether more low-level radioactive waste dumps open.
Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a letter sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday that several reactor owners had recently filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those documents indicated that their plants were worth far less than previously assumed, since the market price of the electricity they produced had dropped sharply because of low natural gas prices. (That is what made Kewaunee unprofitable.)
Earlier this year, he pointed out, the owners of the Crystal River 3 plant in Florida decided to retire it rather than repair its containment structure, because of unfavorable economics. Industry experts say that several reactors are operating at a loss while their owners wait for the glut of natural gas to disappear. How long that will be, and how many will last, is not clear.
''Once these old nuclear reactors shut down -- as we're seeing now -- it will take 60 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to decontaminate them,'' Mr. Markey said in a statement. ''Taxpayers should have assurances that these nuclear relics don't outlive their corporate owners and their ability to fund nuclear cleanup costs, leaving ordinary Americans to foot the bill.''
The concern is relatively new because in the past, reactors were locally owned, so their economic benefits -- or their costs -- accrued for a population that a utility could appeal to for money if it ran short. Mr. Heacock noted, however, that this was never assured. A public service commission might tell such a utility, ''you collected the money already, you figure out how to make it work, or go to your shareholders for the difference,'' he said.
Dominion filed plans in February to shut down the reactor. Mr. Heacock said that the experience of another company, Energy Solutions, which is decommissioning Commonwealth Edison's old Zion reactors north of Chicago, was that it might be cheaper to do the job in the next decade or so.
Decommissioning Kewaunee will require equipment that is available now, and also human skills, including the intimate knowledge gained by workers who have been at the site for years. ''After 10 years, people knowledgeable about the plant were no longer around,'' he said of the Zion reactors.

HEADLINE: Australian Central Bank Cuts Key Rate to Historic Low

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Australian central bank dropped its key interest rate to a record-low 2.75 percent Tuesday, becoming the latest central bank in recent weeks to try to stimulate growth. 
Few analysts had expected the central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, to deliver a rate cut at its policy meeting, and the reduction, by a quarter of a percentage point, prompted the Australian dollar to decline about half a cent against the U.S. dollar, to $1.019.
In a statement accompanying the rate decision, Glenn Stevens, the central bank's governor, struck a sanguine note about the global economy, saying it was ''likely to record growth a little below trend this year before picking up next year,'' with the United States currently on a path of moderate expansion and China's growth running at a robust pace. And although commodity prices -- which are important to resource-rich Australia -- have moderated in recent months, they ''remain high by historical standards,'' he added.
Still, unemployment has edged up despite a string of rate cuts in recent years, and investment in mining, a major source of economic activity, is projected to peak this year.
A persistently strong Australian dollar has weighed on the economy. The currency has climbed against the U.S. dollar for much of the past 12 years, with only a brief slump after the Lehman Brothers collapse in late 2008, and reached parity with the U.S. dollar for the first time since 1982 in late 2010. It has been worth more than $1 for much of the time since then.
The exchange rate's strength over the past 18 months, Mr. Stevens said, ''is unusual, given the decline in export prices and interest rates during that time.'' The central bank thus decided that ''a further decline in the cash rate was appropriate to encourage sustainable growth in the economy,'' he continued.
The fact that inflation in Australia, at 2.5 percent during the first quarter of this year, remains within the central bank's comfort level also provided the leeway for a reduction in interest rates, analysts said. The rate cut Tuesday was the seventh by the Australian central bank since November 2011 and took the total reduction in borrowing costs to 2 percentage points.
''Further easing looks unlikely at the moment,'' analysts at Standard Chartered said in a research note, adding that the central bank was likely to wait for more data before making further moves. ''However, continued sluggishness in both the domestic and global economies will increase the risk of a rate cut, inflation permitting,'' they said.
The Australian move follows recent efforts in several other regions and countries to prop up growth. Both the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of India lowered borrowing costs last week in a bid to bolster growth, which has been flagging. And in Japan, the central bank and the government have announced spending plans and asset purchases and have promised measures to attract investment in an effort to combat deflation and reignite growth.

HEADLINE: New York Investigates Advances On Pensions

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
New York's top banking regulator has begun an investigation into pension advance firms, the lenders that woo retirees to sign over their monthly pension checks in return for cash.
The regulator, the Department of Financial Services, sent subpoenas to 10 companies in the business on Tuesday.
Federal and state authorities say that such advances are actually loans that require customers to sign over all or a portion of their monthly pension checks in exchange for a lump-sum payment. The high-cost loans, the authorities say, threaten to erode the retirement savings of a growing number of older Americans, thrusting retirees deep into debt. 
Benjamin M. Lawsky, who heads the agency, calls the pension advances, which were the subject of an article in The New York Times, ''nothing more than payday loans in sheep's clothing.'' The agency took the action at the urging of the office of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
The Times's review of more than two dozen loan contracts found that the loans, once fees were factored in, could come with effective interest rates from 27 to 106 percent -- critical information that was not disclosed either in the ads or the contracts.
In its investigation, the Department of Financial Services is examining whether the companies have flouted state usury laws and whether the loans violate a federal law that restricts how military pensions can be used, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. The agency is also investigating whether the lenders dupe retirees into signing up for the loans by disguising the soaring interest rates, the people said.
As the baby boomer generation heads toward retirement and a growing number of older Americans shoulder crippling debt burdens, the pension advance firms are aggressively courting military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with a hard-to-resist pitch: convert tomorrow's pension income into hard cash.
Much like payday loans, which typically are aimed at lower-income borrowers, pension loans can aggravate the distress of the vulnerable elderly who already are grappling with dwindling savings.
''Using deceptive practices to cheat people out of their pensions by enrolling them in backdoor high-interest loans will not be tolerated in our state,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.
The lenders, which operate largely outside of state and federal banking regulations, are drawing fresh scrutiny. The investigation by the Department of Financial Services follows examinations by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Senate's Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
To escape state usury laws that put a ceiling on loan rates, some pension advance firms insist their products are advances, not loans, according to the firms' Web sites and federal and state lawsuits.
The advance firms, which evolved from a fleet of different lenders, zero in on military members, according to lawyers for service members. To go after the military members, the lenders have to skirt a federal law that bars veterans from turning over pension payments to third parties. To sidestep the prohibition, the pension advance firms typically urge veterans to set up separate bank accounts controlled by the firms, where the pension checks are deposited before being sent to the lenders, according to a review of the firms' advertisements.
''These companies are literally harvesting the hard-earned pensions of seniors, military veterans and other hard-working New Yorkers,'' Mr. Cuomo said. He cautioned that ''anyone seeking to prey on New Yorkers should know that we will use every tool at our disposal to aggressively pursue and put stop this fraud.''
The pension advance firms, which largely advertise on the Internet, are in California, Florida, Delaware, Indiana, Michigan and Washington.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Start-Up Diplomacy

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE. 
David Rohde, a columnist for Reuters and The Atlantic and a former New York Times reporter, is the author of ''Beyond War: Reimagining American Influence in a New Middle East.''

 BODY:
IN 2011, a group of American high-tech executives and angel investors traveled to North Africa as part of an innovative State Department economic development program. Local entrepreneurs flocked to workshops in Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, where the Americans judged their business proposals and encouraged them to open start-ups. The initiative embodied the ''economic statecraft'' at the heart of Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton's vision for American foreign policy.
But the program turned out to be so poorly financed that it had no prize for the winners. Embarrassed delegates cobbled one together: an internship at a start-up incubator in Detroit. 
Today, the Middle East is an economic powder keg. About 60 percent of the Arab world's population is under the age of 30; millions of jobs are needed or already high unemployment levels will explode.
The Obama administration's efforts in the region should be more economic than military. ''The United States government has done a terrible job of focusing on economic issues in the Middle East,'' Thomas R. Nides, a former deputy secretary of state, told me recently. ''You have huge youth unemployment and no hope.''
This argument is hardly new. ''To succeed, the Arab political awakening must also be an economic awakening,'' Mrs. Clinton said, more than a year ago. ''Economic policy is foreign policy,'' her successor, John Kerry, said this week.
Last month he asked Congress to approve the creation of a $580 million ''incentive fund'' that would reward countries in the Middle East and North Africa for enacting reforms that foster market-based economies, democratic norms, independent courts and civil societies. But Mrs. Clinton's proposal for a similar fund received scant support last year from a Congress that was understandably focused on domestic issues. With the sequester now in effect, Mr. Kerry's request could suffer the same fate.
After Iraq and Afghanistan, it's no longer politically feasible to sponsor vast development initiatives with little regard for whether they create self-sustaining growth for the region. We must find innovative ways to conduct economic statecraft in an age of austerity. The incentive fund -- a small fraction of the $1.2 trillion Washington has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan -- is a good start.
Some countries in the region have had success implementing, on their own, the kinds of reforms the fund would encourage. Over the past decade, Turkey has carried out a harsh International Monetary Fund economic reform program, opened its economy and attracted foreign investment as part of its effort to join the European Union. Today, few Turkish business owners care if the country is part of the union. In 2011, Turkey boasted a faster growing economy than any other European nation.
And in the West Bank, the economic and security reforms of Salam Fayyad, who recently resigned as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, deserve much praise.
Mr. Kerry should also focus aid in areas where viable markets and partners exist. Tareq Maayah, a Palestinian engineer who runs a West Bank high-tech firm, said $100,000 from the United States Agency for International Development helped his firm gain a tryout with Hewlett-Packard. Today, his company writes software for Cisco, Hewlett-Packard and Alcatel-Lucent, with no government assistance.
Ahmed El Alfi, an Egyptian-American Silicon Valley venture capital investor, said American officials could ''do a lot more'' at little cost. Mr. Alfi, who began a high-tech incubator in Cairo, said Egyptian start-ups clamor for access to American investors. ''Have a weekly call for companies from the region doing 10-minute presentations to American companies,'' he suggested.
Finally, Mr. Kerry should emphasize to American companies that investment opportunities exist in the region, particularly in infrastructure, energy and aviation. Chinese firms exported an estimated $150 billion to the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, twice as much as American firms.
Of course, some countries in the region are too unstable for American private investment. But in others, public-private initiatives that foster trade, investment and job creation with little taxpayer funding could be expanded. The high-tech entrepreneurship delegations started by Mrs. Clinton should be increased and properly funded. Wealthy Persian Gulf countries should be asked to finance a regional bank for small and medium-size enterprises.
Perhaps most important, we should stop thinking we can transform societies overnight. Even if the United States perfectly executes its policies and programs, they alone will not stabilize countries. We need viable local partners. Nations must transform themselves.
We should scale back our ambitions and concentrate on long-term economics. By trying to do fewer things over longer periods, we will achieve more.

HEADLINE: China and Cyberwar

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Despite denials from Beijing, there seems little doubt that China's computer hackers are engaged in an aggressive and increasingly threatening campaign of cyberespionage directed at a range of government and private systems in the United States, including the power grid and telecommunications networks. 
The Obama administration had carefully avoided naming a specific culprit. Now it has. In the Pentagon's annual report to Congress on China, the Chinese government and, in particular, the Chinese military are explicitly accused of mounting attacks on United States government computer systems and defense contractors in a systematic effort to steal intellectual property and gain strategic advantage.
The report adds urgency to talks expected to begin in July with the Chinese about cyberissues. It does not discuss America's own considerable investment in disruptive computer capabilities. These, too, must be on the agenda.
China's ambitions have been discussed on a background basis by senior officials and were the subject of an earlier report by the computer security firm Mandiant that was disclosed by The Times in February. The new report to Congress adds depth and detail. Its clear purpose is to increase pressure on China to rein in its hackers, who Mandiant has said, are largely run by Chinese Army officers or are contractors working for military commands.
But for anyone broadly interested in the possibility of a global disruption caused by government-directed hackers, the report suffers from one conspicuous omission: It does not address America's own role in the expanding world of cyberwarfare nor that of other countries with active programs, like Russia, Britain and Israel. The report said that the primary goal of China's cyberattacks on the United States was to steal industrial technology but that many intrusions were designed to obtain insights into American policy makers' thinking. The report also warned that information gathered on American defense networks, logistics and military capabilities could be exploited during a crisis.
The United States has spent billions of dollars defending its computer networks, as it should. But, increasingly, it is also investing billions more in offensive capabilities, including malware that can disrupt an adversary's networks like the American-Israel Stuxnet virus did to Iran's nuclear program in 2010. Cyber is one of the few growth areas in the military budget; Congress and the Obama administration will need to take care that the Pentagon is not exploiting the China threat to boost the budget even more to make up for other reductions.
One positive development is that China, after considerable resistance, now seems willing to discuss cyberissues with the United States. The Americans seem intent on keeping the focus on persuading Chinese officials to end attacks on commercial and economic interests and to understand that, if they don't, it would damage relations with the United States. It would be a mistake not to also engage China, and other countries as well, on military-related issues, including what constitutes cyberaggression and how governments should respond. The world does not need a cyber arms race.

HEADLINE: Gains at Disney Parks Help Lift Profit

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The Magic Kingdom is on fire.
Strength in all of the Walt Disney Company's primary businesses -- theme parks, cable television, movies, consumer products -- helped the entertainment conglomerate increase its quarterly profit by 32 percent from a year earlier, to $1.51 billion. Revenue climbed 10 percent, to $10.55 billion.
The financial results, reported on Tuesday, revealed a couple of smaller weak spots, namely the ABC broadcast network and Disney's video game division. But the company's performance as a whole beat rivals like Comcast, Time Warner and Viacom. 
Disney shares, which closed at $66.07 on Tuesday, have risen 51 percent over the last year. ''The company is obviously hitting on almost all cylinders,'' Jessica Reif Cohen, a senior analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on a conference call on Tuesday.
Reasons for growth included the improving economy; expanded theme parks in Florida, California and Hong Kong; a stabilizing moviemaking operation; the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment; and climbing merchandise sales, particularly for Disney Channel-related products. The company also benefited from a calendar quirk that moved part of the New Year's and Easter holidays into the quarter.
Operating income at Media Networks, a division that includes ESPN, totaled $1.86 billion in the quarter, an 8 percent improvement from the year-earlier period. During the quarter, which ended on March 30, ESPN benefited from increased ad sales and a reduction in revenue deferrals as required by certain affiliate contracts.
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts reported operating income of $383 million, a 73 percent increase. New attractions -- a ''Cars''-themed area in California, a Fantasyland expansion in Florida -- helped Disney's North American parks deliver an 8 percent increase in attendance and a 10 percent increase in per-capita spending on items like food. A new cruise ship, the Fantasy, also lifted the division's results.
In the year-ago quarter, Disney's movie studio lost money as it struggled with runaway costs tied to the science-fiction debacle ''John Carter.'' On Tuesday Walt Disney Studios, citing the successful release of ''Oz the Great and Powerful,'' reported operating income of $118 million. Disney said that prerelease marketing expenses for the July arrival of ''The Lone Ranger'' may affect coming results, however.
Iron Man and other Marvel-related merchandise contributed to operating income of $200 million at Disney's consumer products unit, a 35 percent increase.
Over all, Disney reported earnings of 79 cents a share for the quarter, an increase of 36 percent from 58 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 76 cents a share. Including one-time gains from tax benefits and the sale of a business, Disney had earnings in the current quarter of 83 cents a share.
With so much going right for the company, Disney's two troubled areas -- broadcast television and video games -- stood out like sore thumbs. But each of those businesses has a relatively small impact on Disney's performance.
Broadcast operating income fell 40 percent, to $138 million, as lower ratings (and thus ad revenue) and higher programming costs at the struggling ABC network offset sturdier financial results at Disney's local TV stations. ''We could use a few more new hits, and hits that we own,'' Robert A. Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive, said of ABC on a conference call.
Mr. Iger added that he is ''more than reasonably encouraged'' by ABC's planned shows for the fall and called ABC's managers ''a great team.''
Disney's interactive division, which includes Disney.com and video games, lost $54 million in the quarter, an improvement from a loss of $70 million. Disney continues to hope that a turnaround is on the horizon for its video game business. On Monday the company announced an exclusive multiyear deal with Electronic Arts to produce Star Wars games.
Disney is also preparing to introduce Infinity, an ambitious video game and toy initiative that it hopes will be its version of Skylanders, an Activision Blizzard product that has generated more than $1 billion in global sales since its 2011 arrival. Infinity was initially supposed to arrive in June but was delayed and is now scheduled for release in August.

HEADLINE: Yanking Broadband From Slow Lane

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
It has been almost two decades since @Home Network offered perhaps the first broadband plan in the country. It was right after the 1996 Telecommunications Act allowed cable companies to get into the business. Milo Medin, one of @Home's co-founders, still recalls the price of the pioneering service, offered to residents of Fremont, Calif.: $34.95 a month -- $51.85 in today's money -- for a maximum speed of 10 megabits per second. The memory inspires not a little frustration about the Internet's progress since then: 17 years after @Home plugged in its first customer, the residents of Kansas City pay Time Warner, their local cable company, $46.90 for a 3 Mbps connection and $55.40 for a top speed of 15 Mbps.
''At that time the United States was a leader in broadband,'' Mr. Medin recalled. Today, he lamented, ''I don't see anybody arguing that the U.S. is anything but mediocre.''
These days, Mr. Medin leads Google's effort to deploy superspeedy 1 gigabit-per-second networks -- 100 times faster than the 10 Mbps plans @Home introduced long ago -- in several cities around the country, starting in Kansas City last fall. 
Most of the nation's innovation today relies on a broadband connection. Yet broadband seems to be the one area of the information economy that has not followed Moore's law, named after the proposition by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore that the power of digital devices would roughly double every couple of years, radically expanding their capability and driving down their cost.
''Internet access is constraining what people can do,'' Mr. Medin said. ''This puts American companies at a disadvantage. It puts Google in a place where we can't innovate as well as we could.''
President Obama has made much of this deficit. In 2010 his administration introduced a National Broadband Plan that promised a path of rapid deployment of high-speed networks, offering 100 million households affordable access to connections of 100 Mbps or more.
''We will not succeed by standing still, or even moving at our current pace,'' Julius Genachowski, Mr. Obama's first chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told Congress at the time. Yet most Americans are still stuck in the Internet slow lane, far from the frontier of our possibilities. And the main roadblock remains much the same as it has been for years: a lack of competition.
Last week, President Obama nominated Tom Wheeler, a veteran lobbyist for the telecommunications industry, to succeed Mr. Genachowski. He has his job cut out for him: achieving fast universal broadband requires figuring out how to shake up the oligopolies that run the nation's high-speed Internet.
There has been progress lately. The F.C.C. points out that more fiber-optic cable has been laid in the United States than in Europe in the last two years. According to Akamai, the nation's average broadband download speed is about 7.4 Mbps per second, about twice as fast as it was two years ago. This puts the nation in eighth place in the world, up from 22nd in 2009.
Still, speeds in the United States remain behind those in the world's most connected countries, like South Korea, Japan and Switzerland. Equally importantly, American broadband, at an average price of $6.14 per Mbps, is more expensive than in most other developed nations.
This has little to do with the actual cost of moving bits. The price of transporting data wholesale across the Internet has fallen to about $1.57 per Mbps, down from $1,200 when Mr. Medin was helping start @Home. And high prices discourage Americans from opting for higher speeds. Though 10 Mbps broadband is available in 90 percent of homes around the country, and four out of five homes have access to 100 Mbps service, last year only 28 percent of homes that had access to broadband at a speed above 6 Mbps actually bought it.
What's most worrying is that the handful of companies offering high-speed broadband to American consumers may have little incentive to expand their networks, increase their speeds and lower their prices.
According to the F.C.C.'s latest calculation, under one-third of American homes are in areas where at least two wireline companies offer broadband speeds of 10 Mbps or higher. Even including the spottier service offered by wireless providers, which tends to come with strict data caps limiting use, the share is less than half.
That means that in most American neighborhoods, consumers are stuck with a broadband monopoly. And monopolies don't strive to offer the best, cheapest service. Rather, they use speed as a tool to discriminate by price -- coaxing consumers who are willing to pay for high-speed broadband into more costly and profitable tiers.
Blair Levin, who headed the F.C.C.'s broadband initiative until three years ago and is now at the Aspen Institute, traces the roots of broadband's limits to telephone companies' decision, back in the 1990s, not to match cable's costly investments in fiber, trusting that their DSL service would be an adequate competitor.
But DSL couldn't follow cable past 3 Mbps. Verizon did eventually get on the ball -- investing in its FiOS fiber network, which is expected to reach 17 million homes when it is completed. But that's the exception.
''Given cable's lead and its ability to counterstrike if the telcos upgrade, the telcos don't have a winning strategy that involves a better network,'' Mr. Levin said, suggesting that the industries will focus on drawing profit from existing networks rather than investing much in expanding them. ''Both cable and the telcos are better off with a harvest strategy, and both sides would lose if one starts an upgrade cycle.''
The preferred strategy seems to involve more cooperation than competition. In 2011, Verizon tried to cobble together agreements with the nation's major cable firms to jointly market each others' services -- offering itself as the wireless complement to cable's wireline plans. It was foiled only because the Justice Department slapped the deals down as anticompetitive.
Mr. Genachowski contends that broadband deployment is on the right track. He points to the growing number of high-speed broadband deployments like Google Fiber and municipal projects around the country, as well as to AT&T's announcement that it will expand the footprint of its U-verse network -- the number of homes to which service is available -- to 33 million. This uses fiber part of the way and, AT&T claims, can attain up to 75 Mbps.
It probably will take an outsider like Google to transform the industry. Its assertion that it can turn a profit selling 1 Gbps service for $70 ($120 with a TV plan) offers an entirely new horizon for broadband development. It has plans under way to take the service to Austin, Tex., and Provo, Utah. And it is spurring a domino chain of investments.
''As someone who is stuck with 1 Mbps broadband at one house due to where it is located, it's a huge inhibitor,'' said Brad Feld, a longtime investor in digital start-ups from Boulder, Colo., who bought a residence in Kansas City's first plugged-in neighborhood to house inspired entrepreneurs free. ''At this point I have no idea what the breakthrough applications will be, but I look forward to experimenting with some stuff and figuring it out.'' Several cities, including Chattanooga, Tenn., and Seattle, are starting their own gigabit plans, potentially forcing the dominant cable and phone companies to respond. Shortly after Google's fiber started operating in Kansas City, Time Warner increased speeds across the city, offering its first 100 Mbps service in the country. After Google said last month it would build a 1 Gbps network in Austin, AT&T said it would build one too.
Yet the challenge remains: monopolies have a high instinct for self-preservation. And more than half a dozen states have passed legislation limiting municipalities from building public broadband networks in competition with private businesses. South Carolina passed its version last year. A similar bill narrowly failed in Georgia.
Supporting these bills, of course, are the nation's cable and telephone companies.

HEADLINE: Replanting the Rust Belt

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
Pittsburgh in springtime is an edible city.
Blossoms spangle the pear trees on the streets, the hills are covered with maples in leaf and vigorous spring greens like knotweed and dandelions push up through cracked asphalt.
''See that?'' said Cavan Patterson, gesturing to a vast abandoned truck depot across from his foraging and food supply business on Butler Street, Wild Purveyors. ''Japanese knotweed would grow like crazy there,'' he said. ''It seems to love vacant lots.''
Wild Purveyors's knotweed (it tastes like asparagus but grassier), along with the first morels of the season, were on menus at Pittsburgh's most ambitious restaurants that night.
Mr. Patterson, a former mortgage salesman, and his brother, Tom, who has degrees in horticulture and mycology from Penn State, never planned to make a living in the food world. But because of the flourishing restaurant scene here, they spend their days in the countryside gathering mushrooms and weeds, retrieving wheels of cheese from Amish farmhouse cellars and hauling saddles of goat literally from farm to table. 
Until recently, the American food revolution seemed to bypass this region, leaping from Chicago to Philadelphia without making stops in places like Toledo, Cleveland, Akron and Pittsburgh.
These cities of the Rust Belt, which edges around the Great Lakes from Buffalo to Detroit, are linked in many ways: by a shared history of industry, by a network of defunct canals and decaying railroads, and by thousands of acres of farmland.
Now, the region is linked by a group of educated, ambitious chefs who are building a new kind of network. Its scale is tiny compared with the steel and shipbuilding empires of the region's past. But they are nonetheless convinced that an interdependent web of chefs, butchers, farmers, millers, bakers and brewers will help bring the local landscape back into balance.
To that end, they are cooking sustainably, supporting agriculture and raising families -- all while making world-class food with a strong sense of place. One hundred and thirty miles northwest of Pittsburgh, in Cleveland, the chef Jonathon Sawyer has nudged along a transformation since he and his wife, Amelia, opened the Greenhouse Tavern in 2009. The imaginative, approachable, precisely flavored dishes he pulls off there have helped Cleveland make the transition from bratwurst and braciole to broccoli escabeche, duck zampone and Ohio-raised strip steaks with shallot mignonnette.
Mr. Sawyer lived and cooked in New York City for five years, working for the chef Charlie Palmer, before he and his wife decided to raise their children back in their hometown.
But he was determined that if he came back, it would be partly to help the city transcend its Rust Belt reputation.
''When I was young, Cleveland was famous as the place where the lake caught fire,'' he said, referring to oily trash on the polluted Cuyahoga River that burned in 1969.
''I wasn't going to let Cleveland be the Soviet Union of food: 10 years behind the action,'' he said. So he took the action to Cleveland, following local pioneers like Michael Symon and Zack Bruell.
But bringing trendy food to Cleveland, as Mr. Sawyer did by opening Noodlecat, a ramen shop, in 2011, isn't the real game. Convinced that the relationship between chefs and farmers is one of the keys to bringing the city and the region back to life, Mr. Sawyer has cooked and coaxed a new local food system into being.
It connects mushroom farms, bean gardens, Italian bakeries, Amish dairies, noodle makers, butchers and the basement and backyard of his own house. (One is full of fermenting vinegars; the other, of chickens that produce fresh eggs for the restaurant.)
''He forages for people,'' said Chris Thaxton, an organic garlic farmer with her husband, Fred, in nearby Hudson who was one of Mr. Sawyer's first suppliers.
At his restaurant, Mr. Sawyer acts as a career counselor and culinary educator as much as a chef; all the 60-plus staff members are listed by name on the menu, and he encourages them to pursue their own ventures.
Cooperation among chefs -- not the competition that is the norm elsewhere -- is central to a thriving food scene, he said. ''These cities have to be places where people want to live and work after graduation, and one of the things they want is good food,'' he said. ''Otherwise, the brain drain to the coasts will just go on.''
Although nobody in this verdant region much likes the label ''Rust Belt,'' Mr. Sawyer has adopted ''Rust Belt Revival'' as shorthand for what he's trying to do there. (It's also a Twitter hashtag he uses often: #rustbeltrevival.)
He was nurturing that revival on a recent spring morning in the farmland south of Cleveland, tramping through fields, listening to experienced farmers and offering advice to new ones. Since 1999, the National Park Service has been fostering sustainable farming inside Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Through a program called Countryside Initiative, a dozen farms -- most of them more than 100 years old -- have been restored, then leased to people who are willing to live there and work the land sustainably.
Daniel Greenfield, who grows produce for the Greenhouse Tavern, has been farming there for seven years. In his past life, he was a teacher and has a Ph.D. in environmental education. ''Now it stands for post hole digger,'' he said ruefully, referring to the fences he spends much of his time on, fending off predators from his alluring blueberry bushes.
But with steady demand from chefs and the 100 members of the farm's Community Supported Agriculture program, Greenfield Berry Farm has proved that a small farm can support a family and also a big-city restaurant.
At the next stop, Mark Trapp had just begun turning over the soil on his brand-new farm, driving a team of draft horses that he bought from a nearby Amish family. (The numerous Amish communities in the region are a resource for newcomers who want to reintroduce traditional farming methods here.) He plans to grow grains like spelt and farro alongside more traditional crops like onions and beets. Between the rows, spikes of a thick weed called hog cress poked up. ''We pay $5 a pound for that at the restaurant,'' Mr. Sawyer said encouragingly. ''But don't wait too long, because it turns bitter in the heat.''
Mr. Trapp's partner, Emily Stefanak, who commutes from the farm to her job as a registered nurse in Cleveland, showed off a lively litter of 6-week-old Tamworth piglets. ''They're being hams for you,'' she said to Mr. Sawyer as they climbed over each other to stick their snouts into his broad palms.
''Yes,'' he said, smiling. ''And soon they'll be hams for you.''
Chefs and farmers say that Ohio and Pennsylvania share high state and popular support for new farms. The Ohio Ecological Food and Farm Association and Cleveland's farmers' markets are robust partners for chefs. And the huge annual meeting of the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture is one of the few events that brings experienced Amish farmers and new ''English'' farmers together. ''That's what they call us at the conference,'' Cavan Patterson said.
Mr. Patterson is more than a purveyor; he is a one-man hub of information, encouragement and ingredients for Pittsburgh's new farm-to-table chefs. Traditionally, the city's claims to food fame were the pierogi and Primanti Bros., makers of mouth-stretching Italian sandwiches. ''Ten years ago, if you ordered a salad in this city, it came with French fries in it,'' he said.
Pittsburgh has come a long way.
''If you had told me 10 years ago that I could open a restaurant in this city without a steak on the menu, I wouldn't have believed it,'' said Trevett Hooper, the chef and owner of Legume in the Oakland neighborhood. Stinging nettle pesto, dandelion greens, and -- yes -- pierogi, topped with house-made kimchi and sausage were on the menu in late April.
Mr. Hooper is a leader in sustainable, seasonal cooking here, but he is not alone. The nose-to-tail chef Justin Severino is making revolutionary salumi like Negroni-flavored dry sausage (with juniper, Campari and blood orange zest) and molasses-cured ham with ginger. Kevin Sousa, a chef with a molecular bent who is also a Pittsburgh native, has opened four restaurants here in three years and is headed next to Braddock, a former mill town a few miles farther along the Monongahela that has lost 90 percent of its population since the 1920s.
For chefs like Mr. Hooper and Mr. Sawyer, using local food year-round is more than a trend-driven experiment; it is a way to rebuild the region. Building an economically and environmentally sustainable food system from scratch seems ambitious for a restaurant kitchen, but these chefs put boundless energy and study into the project, one dish at a time.
In September, the local corn Mr. Hooper can buy is juicy and sweet; in February, once the cobs have been dried, he grinds kernels into fragrant polenta. He learned how to treat the dried kernels with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) so that in April, the corn can be transformed again -- into hominy for a goat pozole. (He also makes tempeh from scratch, with local soybeans and spores he orders online.)
''The question is always: How can we use something we have, that was grown by someone we know, in a different and delicious way?'' he said.
To serve this kind of food, a restaurant needs customers who understand the realities of cooking seasonally and locally. ''It isn't always pretty,'' he said. Spring was in the air that night, but local asparagus was still a month away. ''I'm not going to serve asparagus, but what do I say: 'Instead, have this bok choy that's been fermenting for six months?' ''
Mr. Sawyer's favorite way of extending the life of local food is a vast vinegar experiment, using wine dregs from the restaurant, beer brands abandoned by local distributors and whatever else he decides to pour in, like garlic, soy sauce or apple cider. There are salty ones and herbal ones, funky ones and sweet ones that make lovely cocktails.
''It's partly to wean ourselves off lemons and limes,'' he said, pointing out that citrus fruits are relatively recent arrivals in the region's kitchens; traditional cooks achieved tartness in other ways. ''But mostly because it's fun.''

HEADLINE: Gains at Disney Parks Help Lift Profit

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The Magic Kingdom is on fire.
Strength in all of the Walt Disney Company's primary businesses -- theme parks, cable television, movies, consumer products -- helped the entertainment conglomerate increase its quarterly profit by 32 percent from a year earlier, to $1.51 billion. Revenue climbed 10 percent, to $10.55 billion.
The financial results, reported on Tuesday, revealed a couple of smaller weak spots, namely the ABC broadcast network and Disney's video game division. But the company's performance as a whole beat rivals like Comcast, Time Warner and Viacom. 
Disney shares, which closed at $66.07 on Tuesday, have risen 51 percent over the last year. ''The company is obviously hitting on almost all cylinders,'' Jessica Reif Cohen, a senior analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said on a conference call on Tuesday.
Reasons for growth included the improving economy; expanded theme parks in Florida, California and Hong Kong; a stabilizing moviemaking operation; the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment; and climbing merchandise sales, particularly for Disney Channel-related products. The company also benefited from a calendar quirk that moved part of the New Year's and Easter holidays into the quarter.
Operating income at Media Networks, a division that includes ESPN, totaled $1.86 billion in the quarter, an 8 percent improvement from the year-earlier period. During the quarter, which ended on March 30, ESPN benefited from increased ad sales and a reduction in revenue deferrals as required by certain affiliate contracts.
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts reported operating income of $383 million, a 73 percent increase. New attractions -- a ''Cars''-themed area in California, a Fantasyland expansion in Florida -- helped Disney's North American parks deliver an 8 percent increase in attendance and a 10 percent increase in per-capita spending on items like food. A new cruise ship, the Fantasy, also lifted the division's results.
In the year-ago quarter, Disney's movie studio lost money as it struggled with runaway costs tied to the science-fiction debacle ''John Carter.'' On Tuesday Walt Disney Studios, citing the successful release of ''Oz the Great and Powerful,'' reported operating income of $118 million. Disney said that prerelease marketing expenses for the July arrival of ''The Lone Ranger'' may affect coming results, however.
Iron Man and other Marvel-related merchandise contributed to operating income of $200 million at Disney's consumer products unit, a 35 percent increase.
Over all, Disney reported earnings of 79 cents a share for the quarter, an increase of 36 percent from 58 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 76 cents a share. Including one-time gains from tax benefits and the sale of a business, Disney had earnings in the current quarter of 83 cents a share.
With so much going right for the company, Disney's two troubled areas -- broadcast television and video games -- stood out like sore thumbs. But each of those businesses has a relatively small impact on Disney's performance.
Broadcast operating income fell 40 percent, to $138 million, as lower ratings (and thus ad revenue) and higher programming costs at the struggling ABC network offset sturdier financial results at Disney's local TV stations. ''We could use a few more new hits, and hits that we own,'' Robert A. Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive, said of ABC on a conference call.
Mr. Iger added that he is ''more than reasonably encouraged'' by ABC's planned shows for the fall and called ABC's managers ''a great team.''
Disney's interactive division, which includes Disney.com and video games, lost $54 million in the quarter, an improvement from a loss of $70 million. Disney continues to hope that a turnaround is on the horizon for its video game business. On Monday the company announced an exclusive multiyear deal with Electronic Arts to produce Star Wars games.
Disney is also preparing to introduce Infinity, an ambitious video game and toy initiative that it hopes will be its version of Skylanders, an Activision Blizzard product that has generated more than $1 billion in global sales since its 2011 arrival. Infinity was initially supposed to arrive in June but was delayed and is now scheduled for release in August.

HEADLINE: Yanking Broadband From Slow Lane

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
It has been almost two decades since @Home Network offered perhaps the first broadband plan in the country. It was right after the 1996 Telecommunications Act allowed cable companies to get into the business. Milo Medin, one of @Home's co-founders, still recalls the price of the pioneering service, offered to residents of Fremont, Calif.: $34.95 a month -- $51.85 in today's money -- for a maximum speed of 10 megabits per second. The memory inspires not a little frustration about the Internet's progress since then: 17 years after @Home plugged in its first customer, the residents of Kansas City pay Time Warner, their local cable company, $46.90 for a 3 Mbps connection and $55.40 for a top speed of 15 Mbps.
''At that time the United States was a leader in broadband,'' Mr. Medin recalled. Today, he lamented, ''I don't see anybody arguing that the U.S. is anything but mediocre.''
These days, Mr. Medin leads Google's effort to deploy superspeedy 1 gigabit-per-second networks -- 100 times faster than the 10 Mbps plans @Home introduced long ago -- in several cities around the country, starting in Kansas City last fall. 
Most of the nation's innovation today relies on a broadband connection. Yet broadband seems to be the one area of the information economy that has not followed Moore's law, named after the proposition by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore that the power of digital devices would roughly double every couple of years, radically expanding their capability and driving down their cost.
''Internet access is constraining what people can do,'' Mr. Medin said. ''This puts American companies at a disadvantage. It puts Google in a place where we can't innovate as well as we could.''
President Obama has made much of this deficit. In 2010 his administration introduced a National Broadband Plan that promised a path of rapid deployment of high-speed networks, offering 100 million households affordable access to connections of 100 Mbps or more.
''We will not succeed by standing still, or even moving at our current pace,'' Julius Genachowski, Mr. Obama's first chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told Congress at the time. Yet most Americans are still stuck in the Internet slow lane, far from the frontier of our possibilities. And the main roadblock remains much the same as it has been for years: a lack of competition.
Last week, President Obama nominated Tom Wheeler, a veteran lobbyist for the telecommunications industry, to succeed Mr. Genachowski. He has his job cut out for him: achieving fast universal broadband requires figuring out how to shake up the oligopolies that run the nation's high-speed Internet.
There has been progress lately. The F.C.C. points out that more fiber-optic cable has been laid in the United States than in Europe in the last two years. According to Akamai, the nation's average broadband download speed is about 7.4 Mbps per second, about twice as fast as it was two years ago. This puts the nation in eighth place in the world, up from 22nd in 2009.
Still, speeds in the United States remain behind those in the world's most connected countries, like South Korea, Japan and Switzerland. Equally importantly, American broadband, at an average price of $6.14 per Mbps, is more expensive than in most other developed nations.
This has little to do with the actual cost of moving bits. The price of transporting data wholesale across the Internet has fallen to about $1.57 per Mbps, down from $1,200 when Mr. Medin was helping start @Home. And high prices discourage Americans from opting for higher speeds. Though 10 Mbps broadband is available in 90 percent of homes around the country, and four out of five homes have access to 100 Mbps service, last year only 28 percent of homes that had access to broadband at a speed above 6 Mbps actually bought it.
What's most worrying is that the handful of companies offering high-speed broadband to American consumers may have little incentive to expand their networks, increase their speeds and lower their prices.
According to the F.C.C.'s latest calculation, under one-third of American homes are in areas where at least two wireline companies offer broadband speeds of 10 Mbps or higher. Even including the spottier service offered by wireless providers, which tends to come with strict data caps limiting use, the share is less than half.
That means that in most American neighborhoods, consumers are stuck with a broadband monopoly. And monopolies don't strive to offer the best, cheapest service. Rather, they use speed as a tool to discriminate by price -- coaxing consumers who are willing to pay for high-speed broadband into more costly and profitable tiers.
Blair Levin, who headed the F.C.C.'s broadband initiative until three years ago and is now at the Aspen Institute, traces the roots of broadband's limits to telephone companies' decision, back in the 1990s, not to match cable's costly investments in fiber, trusting that their DSL service would be an adequate competitor.
But DSL couldn't follow cable past 3 Mbps. Verizon did eventually get on the ball -- investing in its FiOS fiber network, which is expected to reach 17 million homes when it is completed. But that's the exception.
''Given cable's lead and its ability to counterstrike if the telcos upgrade, the telcos don't have a winning strategy that involves a better network,'' Mr. Levin said, suggesting that the industries will focus on drawing profit from existing networks rather than investing much in expanding them. ''Both cable and the telcos are better off with a harvest strategy, and both sides would lose if one starts an upgrade cycle.''
The preferred strategy seems to involve more cooperation than competition. In 2011, Verizon tried to cobble together agreements with the nation's major cable firms to jointly market each others' services -- offering itself as the wireless complement to cable's wireline plans. It was foiled only because the Justice Department slapped the deals down as anticompetitive.
Mr. Genachowski contends that broadband deployment is on the right track. He points to the growing number of high-speed broadband deployments like Google Fiber and municipal projects around the country, as well as to AT&T's announcement that it will expand the footprint of its U-verse network -- the number of homes to which service is available -- to 33 million. This uses fiber part of the way and, AT&T claims, can attain up to 75 Mbps.
It probably will take an outsider like Google to transform the industry. Its assertion that it can turn a profit selling 1 Gbps service for $70 ($120 with a TV plan) offers an entirely new horizon for broadband development. It has plans under way to take the service to Austin, Tex., and Provo, Utah. And it is spurring a domino chain of investments.
''As someone who is stuck with 1 Mbps broadband at one house due to where it is located, it's a huge inhibitor,'' said Brad Feld, a longtime investor in digital start-ups from Boulder, Colo., who bought a residence in Kansas City's first plugged-in neighborhood to house inspired entrepreneurs free. ''At this point I have no idea what the breakthrough applications will be, but I look forward to experimenting with some stuff and figuring it out.'' Several cities, including Chattanooga, Tenn., and Seattle, are starting their own gigabit plans, potentially forcing the dominant cable and phone companies to respond. Shortly after Google's fiber started operating in Kansas City, Time Warner increased speeds across the city, offering its first 100 Mbps service in the country. After Google said last month it would build a 1 Gbps network in Austin, AT&T said it would build one too.
Yet the challenge remains: monopolies have a high instinct for self-preservation. And more than half a dozen states have passed legislation limiting municipalities from building public broadband networks in competition with private businesses. South Carolina passed its version last year. A similar bill narrowly failed in Georgia.
Supporting these bills, of course, are the nation's cable and telephone companies.

New attractions -- a ''Cars''-themed area in California, a Fantasyland expansion in Florida -- helped Disney's North American parks deliver an 8 percent increase in attendance and a 10 percent increase in per-capita spending on items like food. A new cruise ship, the Fantasy, also lifted the division's results.
In the year-ago quarter, Disney's movie studio lost money as it struggled with runaway costs tied to the science-fiction debacle ''John Carter.'' On Tuesday Walt Disney Studios, citing the successful release of ''Oz the Great and Powerful,'' reported operating income of $118 million. Disney said that prerelease marketing expenses for the July arrival of ''The Lone Ranger'' may affect coming results, however.
Iron Man and other Marvel-related merchandise contributed to operating income of $200 million at Disney's consumer products unit, a 35 percent increase.
Over all, Disney reported earnings of 79 cents a share for the quarter, an increase of 36 percent from 58 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 76 cents a share. Including one-time gains from tax benefits and the sale of a business, Disney had earnings in the current quarter of 83 cents a share.
With so much going right for the company, Disney's two troubled areas -- broadcast television and video games -- stood out like sore thumbs. But each of those businesses has a relatively small impact on Disney's performance.
Broadcast operating income fell 40 percent, to $138 million, as lower ratings (and thus ad revenue) and higher programming costs at the struggling ABC network offset sturdier financial results at Disney's local TV stations. ''We could use a few more new hits, and hits that we own,'' Robert A. Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive, said of ABC on a conference call.
Mr. Iger added that he is ''more than reasonably encouraged'' by ABC's planned shows for the fall and called ABC's managers ''a great team.''
Disney's interactive division, which includes Disney.com and video games, lost $54 million in the quarter, an improvement from a loss of $70 million. Disney continues to hope that a turnaround is on the horizon for its video game business. On Monday the company announced an exclusive multiyear deal with Electronic Arts to produce Star Wars games.
Disney is also preparing to introduce Infinity, an ambitious video game and toy initiative that it hopes will be its version of Skylanders, an Activision Blizzard product that has generated more than $1 billion in global sales since its 2011 arrival. Infinity was initially supposed to arrive in June but was delayed and is now scheduled for release in August.

HEADLINE: Yanking Broadband From Slow Lane

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
It has been almost two decades since @Home Network offered perhaps the first broadband plan in the country. It was right after the 1996 Telecommunications Act allowed cable companies to get into the business. Milo Medin, one of @Home's co-founders, still recalls the price of the pioneering service, offered to residents of Fremont, Calif.: $34.95 a month -- $51.85 in today's money -- for a maximum speed of 10 megabits per second. The memory inspires not a little frustration about the Internet's progress since then: 17 years after @Home plugged in its first customer, the residents of Kansas City pay Time Warner, their local cable company, $46.90 for a 3 Mbps connection and $55.40 for a top speed of 15 Mbps.
''At that time the United States was a leader in broadband,'' Mr. Medin recalled. Today, he lamented, ''I don't see anybody arguing that the U.S. is anything but mediocre.''
These days, Mr. Medin leads Google's effort to deploy superspeedy 1 gigabit-per-second networks -- 100 times faster than the 10 Mbps plans @Home introduced long ago -- in several cities around the country, starting in Kansas City last fall. 
Most of the nation's innovation today relies on a broadband connection. Yet broadband seems to be the one area of the information economy that has not followed Moore's law, named after the proposition by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore that the power of digital devices would roughly double every couple of years, radically expanding their capability and driving down their cost.
''Internet access is constraining what people can do,'' Mr. Medin said. ''This puts American companies at a disadvantage. It puts Google in a place where we can't innovate as well as we could.''
President Obama has made much of this deficit. In 2010 his administration introduced a National Broadband Plan that promised a path of rapid deployment of high-speed networks, offering 100 million households affordable access to connections of 100 Mbps or more.
''We will not succeed by standing still, or even moving at our current pace,'' Julius Genachowski, Mr. Obama's first chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, told Congress at the time. Yet most Americans are still stuck in the Internet slow lane, far from the frontier of our possibilities. And the main roadblock remains much the same as it has been for years: a lack of competition.
Last week, President Obama nominated Tom Wheeler, a veteran lobbyist for the telecommunications industry, to succeed Mr. Genachowski. He has his job cut out for him: achieving fast universal broadband requires figuring out how to shake up the oligopolies that run the nation's high-speed Internet.
There has been progress lately. The F.C.C. points out that more fiber-optic cable has been laid in the United States than in Europe in the last two years. According to Akamai, the nation's average broadband download speed is about 7.4 Mbps per second, about twice as fast as it was two years ago. This puts the nation in eighth place in the world, up from 22nd in 2009.
Still, speeds in the United States remain behind those in the world's most connected countries, like South Korea, Japan and Switzerland. Equally importantly, American broadband, at an average price of $6.14 per Mbps, is more expensive than in most other developed nations.
This has little to do with the actual cost of moving bits. The price of transporting data wholesale across the Internet has fallen to about $1.57 per Mbps, down from $1,200 when Mr. Medin was helping start @Home. And high prices discourage Americans from opting for higher speeds. Though 10 Mbps broadband is available in 90 percent of homes around the country, and four out of five homes have access to 100 Mbps service, last year only 28 percent of homes that had access to broadband at a speed above 6 Mbps actually bought it.
What's most worrying is that the handful of companies offering high-speed broadband to American consumers may have little incentive to expand their networks, increase their speeds and lower their prices.
According to the F.C.C.'s latest calculation, under one-third of American homes are in areas where at least two wireline companies offer broadband speeds of 10 Mbps or higher. Even including the spottier service offered by wireless providers, which tends to come with strict data caps limiting use, the share is less than half.
That means that in most American neighborhoods, consumers are stuck with a broadband monopoly. And monopolies don't strive to offer the best, cheapest service. Rather, they use speed as a tool to discriminate by price -- coaxing consumers who are willing to pay for high-speed broadband into more costly and profitable tiers.
Blair Levin, who headed the F.C.C.'s broadband initiative until three years ago and is now at the Aspen Institute, traces the roots of broadband's limits to telephone companies' decision, back in the 1990s, not to match cable's costly investments in fiber, trusting that their DSL service would be an adequate competitor.
But DSL couldn't follow cable past 3 Mbps. Verizon did eventually get on the ball -- investing in its FiOS fiber network, which is expected to reach 17 million homes when it is completed. But that's the exception.
''Given cable's lead and its ability to counterstrike if the telcos upgrade, the telcos don't have a winning strategy that involves a better network,'' Mr. Levin said, suggesting that the industries will focus on drawing profit from existing networks rather than investing much in expanding them. ''Both cable and the telcos are better off with a harvest strategy, and both sides would lose if one starts an upgrade cycle.''
The preferred strategy seems to involve more cooperation than competition. In 2011, Verizon tried to cobble together agreements with the nation's major cable firms to jointly market each others' services -- offering itself as the wireless complement to cable's wireline plans. It was foiled only because the Justice Department slapped the deals down as anticompetitive.
Mr. Genachowski contends that broadband deployment is on the right track. He points to the growing number of high-speed broadband deployments like Google Fiber and municipal projects around the country, as well as to AT&T's announcement that it will expand the footprint of its U-verse network -- the number of homes to which service is available -- to 33 million. This uses fiber part of the way and, AT&T claims, can attain up to 75 Mbps.
It probably will take an outsider like Google to transform the industry. Its assertion that it can turn a profit selling 1 Gbps service for $70 ($120 with a TV plan) offers an entirely new horizon for broadband development. It has plans under way to take the service to Austin, Tex., and Provo, Utah. And it is spurring a domino chain of investments.
''As someone who is stuck with 1 Mbps broadband at one house due to where it is located, it's a huge inhibitor,'' said Brad Feld, a longtime investor in digital start-ups from Boulder, Colo., who bought a residence in Kansas City's first plugged-in neighborhood to house inspired entrepreneurs free. ''At this point I have no idea what the breakthrough applications will be, but I look forward to experimenting with some stuff and figuring it out.'' Several cities, including Chattanooga, Tenn., and Seattle, are starting their own gigabit plans, potentially forcing the dominant cable and phone companies to respond. Shortly after Google's fiber started operating in Kansas City, Time Warner increased speeds across the city, offering its first 100 Mbps service in the country. After Google said last month it would build a 1 Gbps network in Austin, AT&T said it would build one too.
Yet the challenge remains: monopolies have a high instinct for self-preservation. And more than half a dozen states have passed legislation limiting municipalities from building public broadband networks in competition with private businesses. South Carolina passed its version last year. A similar bill narrowly failed in Georgia.
Supporting these bills, of course, are the nation's cable and telephone companies.

HEADLINE: What Job-Sharing Brings

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: For employers, there are benefits and costs to replacing full-time employees with part-time ones, and the Affordable Care Act will provide an interesting case study in how this plays out, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
When employer costs are taken into account, it is unclear whether jobs are something that can be efficiently shared. 
The idea behind work-sharing is that employers have a certain amount of work that needs to be done, and that the work can be divided by many employees working a few hours each or a few employees working many hours each. If hours per employee could be limited, by this logic employers would have to hire more employees to get the same amount of work done. 
American labor law has traditionally placed some limits on employee hours, such as overtime regulations. While the recent Affordable Care Act does not strictly limit hours per employee, beginning next year it gives employers a strong push toward part-time employment by levying a significant fee per full-time employee and exempting part-time employees from the fee.
A number of employers have said they would change some work schedules to part time from full time to avoid some Affordable Care Act fees. Because part-time workers generally have fewer benefits than full-time employees, this could save employers a considerable sum. From the work-sharing perspective, the part-time employee exemption by itself would be expected to increase employment, because employers would have to hire more people (probably on a part-time basis) to complete work their employees used to accomplish when full time.
But it is possible that work-sharing would reduce employment rather than increase it, because it prevents employers from accomplishing their tasks at minimum cost, adding administrative and coordination expenses. Higher costs for employers may put them out of business, or at least reduce the scale of their business. When companies reduce the scale of their activities, that means fewer employees.

It is also possible that work-sharing would reduce employment by making jobs less attractive to people who desire full-time work. One reason that people sometimes justify commuting long distances to work or enrolling in demanding training programs - trucking and nursing are two such occupations - is that they expect to recoup those cost by taking advantages of opportunities to earn extra by working long hours.
Work-sharing proponents have credited Germany's comparative low unemployment rate to its adoption of a work-sharing program, because the program encourages German employers to reduce employee hours rather than lay workers off. Work-sharing proponents may be right, although Germany carried out a number of labor-market reforms at the same time, such as allowing businesses to use temporary workers more easily.
As the Affordable Care Act suddenly pushes business toward part-time employment, we economists will have an unusual opportunity to learn whether cutting employee hours creates jobs, or destroys them.

HIGHLIGHT: The U.S. considers Internet surveillance; harsh tactics in Nigeria; a Brazilian will lead the W.T.O.; and Aboriginal artwork goes back to Australia. 

 BODY:
 NEWS The Obama administration, resolving years of internal debate, is on the verge of backing a F.B.I. plan for a sweeping overhaul of surveillance laws that would make it easier to wiretap people who communicate using the Internet rather than by traditional phone services, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. Charlie Savage reports from Washington. 
The Nigerian military's harsh tactics have curtailed militant attacks in the north, a stronghold of Boko Haram, but at a huge cost and with likely repercussions. Adam Nossiter reports from Maiduguri, Nigeria.
Trained to battle Israel, Hezbollah's Lebanese Shiite guerrillas are pushing into a very different fight, against fellow Arab Muslims in Syria trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad. Anne Barnard reports from Beirut.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday criticized a Pentagon report that explicitly accused China's military of staging attacks on the computer systems of the American government and military contractors. Keith Bradsher reports from Hong Kong.
A Spanish court on Tuesday dropped a subpoena for Princess Cristina, the younger daughter of King Juan Carlos, in an embezzlement case that has tarnished the monarchy. Raphael Minder reports from Madrid.
The state-controlled Bank of China said on Tuesday that it had ended all dealings with a key North Korean bank in what appeared to be the strongest public Chinese response yet to North Korea's willingness to brush aside warnings from Beijing and push ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Keith Bradsher reports from Hong Kong.
The European Union's halting effort to create a more unified banking system, which many experts consider necessary for avoiding future financial crises, received fresh impetus on Tuesday. James Kanter reports from Brussels and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.
Roberto Carvalho de Azevêdo of Brazil will be the next leader of the World Trade Organization, a Brazilian official said Tuesday, and will take the reins at a time when the group is fighting to remain relevant. David Jolly reports from Paris.
 ARTS In a homecoming sweetened with poetic justice, a collection of drawings and paintings by Aboriginal children living in a settlement camp in the 1940s and 1950s will be returned to Australia. Felicia R. Lee reports.
 SPORTS Chuck Blazer, who was provisionally banned from all soccer activities on Monday, is just the latest FIFA executive to leave or be banned after allegations of misconduct. Rob Hughes writes from London.

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
The Pentagon released a survey on Tuesday estimating that 26,000 people in the armed forces were sexually assaulted last year, up from 19,000 in 2010, prompting an angry President Obama and Congress to demand action, Jennifer Steinhauer reports. Just two days after the officer in charge of sexual assault prevention programs for the Air Force was arrested and charged with sexual battery, Mr. Obama expressed visible exasperation with the Pentagon's attempts to bring sexual assault under control.
 

        
The Obama administration is on the verge of backing the Federal Bureau of Investigation's plan for a sweeping overhaul of surveillance laws that would make it easier to wiretap people who communicate using the Internet, Charlie Savage reports. It is most likely to set off a debate over the future of Internet privacy and freedom.

        
The Heritage Foundation released a report on Monday estimating that immigration legislation would produce a "lifetime fiscal deficit" of at least $6.3 trillion,Ashley Parker reports. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a chief author of the legislation, aggressively pushed back against the report, saying, "Everybody else who has analyzed immigration understands that if you do it, and we do it right, it will be a net positive for our economy."

        
Congressional Republicans say the testimony thata State Department official is expected to give Wednesday will be a damning indictment of the administration's handling of the September attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Jeremy W. Peters and Eric Schmitt report. But much of what the witness is expected to say raises questions that have already been addressed in previous hearings and in a critical report by the State Department, the writers report.
 Happenings in Washington 

        
President Obama will meet with electric utility chief executives to discuss lessons learned from Hurricane Sandy as another hurricane season approaches.

        
He will then link up with a group of Asian-American and Pacific Islander leaders for a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.

        
In the evening, Mr. Obama will have dinner at the Jefferson Hotel with members of the House Democratic leadership.

HEADLINE: Can Technology and Tourism Sustain Mexico's Sea Turtles?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: In a new documentary, students explore efforts to conserve endangered sea turtles in a region focused on fishing. 

 BODY:
Sea turtles have roamed the oceans for close to 200 million years, surviving assaults that doomed the dinosaurs. Around the world different species now face threats ranging from coastal building to poaching and drowning in fish nets.
The latest hot spot for turtle trouble is Magdalena Bay, an 870-square-mile haven for whales, dolphins, sea birds and five species of sea turtles tucked along the Pacific coast of Mexico's Baja Peninsula north of the tourist hub of Cabo San Lucas. Forces large and small are converging on small-scale fishing operations in the bay, towns like Puerto Adolfo López Mateos (see map), and nearby ocean waters, with the goal of cutting turtle deaths while sustaining incomes.
I encourage you to watch a new 15-minute film, "¡Viva la Tortuga! Meshing Conservation and Culture in Magdalena Bay," to learn more:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
This is the third in a prize-winning series of short documentaries on sustainable use of the world's living resources created by Pace University students in a course I co-teach with Prof. Maria Luskay. (I posted on the previous two films, on shrimp farming and cork forests.) 
Our latest effort had its debut last night on the Pace campus in Pleasantville, N.Y., and there's a public screening and discussion at the Manhattan campus at 4 p.m. today. You can join a Twitter discussion about the issues and the film using the tag #PaceBaja.
The documentary chronicles how communities that once depended on sea turtle poaching and other activities depleting the region's rich natural resources are now testing a new economic model, one built around fishing with turtle conservation in mind and tourism focused on the area's extraordinary marine life.
The short film provides an intimate portrait of Grupo Tortuguero, a coalition of groups in the region working to balance economic advancement with environmental protection and striving to create a better life for both the community and the endangered sea turtles.
The course blog, managed by Adam Yogel, has covered the students' learning process in shooting and editing the film but also kept track of relevant news, including the decision by United States fisheries officials to single out loggerhead deaths in this part of Mexico in a January report to Congress on improving international fisheries management.
The prime concern is a recent spike in loggerhead losses associated with gill-net fishing in ocean waters near Magdalena Bay. The barrier beach separating the bay and ocean there is sometimes called "Playa de Los Muertos" - the beach of the dead - because it is so littered with turtle remains and other dead marine life. 
Mexican officials have been in quiet discussions with American marine fisheries agencies and with some biologists studying turtle deaths in Baja, but publicly have pushed back, questioning whether fishing is the cause of the pulse of recent loggerhead deaths.
Just last week, several Mexican newspapers carried stories quoting officials asserting that other threats, including toxic algae, could be to blame.
As Yogel reported a few days ago, conservation groups have ramped up pressure, petitioning American fisheries agency to impose trade sanctions.
Most exciting to me is evidence that innovation, both in new business models and fishing gear, can make a big difference. Watch the sections of the film on the work of RED Sustainable Travel, which now employs fishermen part of the year to run turtle surveys involving visiting students and tourists. We used this group for our trip and give it high marks. (We paid full price.)
The fishing innovation is stringing LED lights on gill nets, a technique developed and tested by John Wang of the University of Hawaii and studied in the field by Jesse Senko of Arizona State University. (A five-minute version of the documentary focuses on his project.)
Here's an illustration showing that method taken from an animation produced for our film by Lou Guarneri:
There's more to come, including a Google+ Hangout on Air with Wallace J. Nichols, a turtle biologist and founder of Grupo Tortuguero who was a vital source for our project. Also please read the students' reflections on the filmmaking process in an EarthDesk post by team member Megan Spaulding.

HEADLINE: ING Plans I.P.O. of European Insurance Unit

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Dutch financial services firm ING Group said on Wednesday that it was planning an initial public offering of its European insurance business in 2014. 

 BODY:
 7:17 a.m. | Updated 
The Dutch financial services firm ING Group said on Wednesday that it was planning an initial public offering of its European insurance business in 2014. 
The offering is the latest effort by ING to repay a 10 billion euro ($13.1 billion) bailout from local taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis.
Last week, ING also raised about $1.3 billion by selling a stake in its American division, and it has also sold several of its global businesses in recent months to repay the Dutch government.
The disposals helped to increase its first-quarter net income, which more than doubled, to $2.4 billion, compared with the period a year earlier.
"ING has demonstrated steady progress so far this year on the group's restructuring, culminating with the successful I.P.O. of our U.S. insurance business," ING's departing chief executive, Jan Hommen, said in a statement. "We are now accelerating preparations for the base case of an I.P.O. of our European insurance company."

HEADLINE: Calpers Calls JPMorgan's Combined Top Roles a 'Fundamental Conflict'

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: To Anne Simpson, the Calpers pension plan&#8217;s director for corporate governance, the move is rooted in the belief that systemically important institutions need plenty of oversight. 

 BODY:
As shareholders consider whether to press for splitting JPMorgan Chase's top two roles, one big investor has made it very clear where it stands.
Calpers, the big California public pension plan, plans to vote in favor of a nonbinding proposal to split JPMorgan's chief executive and chairman roles, both of which are now held by Jamie Dimon. 
 To Anne Simpson, the pension plan's director for corporate governance, the move is rooted in the belief that systemically important institutions need plenty of oversight. And it is a conviction that developed even before the country's two biggest proxy advisory firms - Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass, Lewis & Company - recommended that shareholders vote in favor of a split.
"There's a fundamental conflict in combining the roles of chairman and C.E.O.," she told DealBook in an interview on Tuesday. "It's all thrown into stark relief when you're dealing with a company that's too big to fail."
Both proxy advisory firms also recommended withholding votes for or voting against several of JPMorgan's directors, particularly those on the bank's risk committee. Ms. Simpson said Calpers was reviewing its potential votes on the matter.
The issue of a split at the top has been a chief concern for Calpers for some time. To Ms. Simpson, the board's single most important job is to oversee its chief executive. Vesting one person with both roles weakens that mission.
"If the person leading that oversight is the overseen, it's a fundamentally flawed system," she said.
It is of special importance when the chief executive is as confident as Mr. Dimon, Ms. Simpson added.
Calpers first met with him to discuss splitting the roles in 2010. At that meeting and in other conversations, JPMorgan emphasized that it had top-notch risk management systems that would keep the business in check.
Nevertheless, Calpers voted to split the JPMorgan roles at last year's shareholder meeting, which took place even before the disclosure of the multibillion-dollar trading loss at the bank's chief investment office. That incident, which racked up about $6 billion in losses, has only reinforced the need for tighter oversight in Calpers's view.
The trading loss also reinforced to Ms. Simpson another belief: that the nation's biggest banks must have tighter oversight in the wake of the financial crisis. The possibility of a large institution risking collapse, even despite new rules meant to forestall another 2008-type government bailout, means that bank boards must be strengthened significantly, she said.
Calpers has not focused solely on JPMorgan. It has held conversations with several large institutions, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. The former now keeps the chairman and chief executive roles separate; the latter reached a pact with shareholders earlier this year to keep the status quo.
"This is simply an inappropriate model for a major financial institution," she said. "This is something of systemic importance."

HEADLINE: The Foreign Bribery Law Comes to Wall Street

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: A recent case involving an affiliate of a New York brokerage firm shows the bevy of laws, including the Travel Act of 1961, that prosecutors are using in pursuing bribery charges. 

 BODY:
It was almost inevitable that the government's crackdown on bribery would hit a Wall Street firm. 
Federal prosecutors filed charges on Tuesday against two brokers working for Direct Access Partners, a Miami-based affiliate of a New York brokerage firm. In an interesting twist, the government also charged a foreign official, something not done under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the law that is applied to such bribery cases these days.
The three defendants were arrested on May 3 in Miami and will make their way to Manhattan to appear in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
A criminal complaint accuses two brokers, Tomas Clarke and Jose Alejandro Hurtado, of using bribery to obtain the securities investment business of the Venezuela's state-controlled development bank, Banco de Desarrollo Economico y Social de Venezuela, or Bandes. The complaint says the two funneled about $5 million in kickbacks to a vice president of the bank, Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez. 
The charges include not only violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act but also the Travel Act and the money laundering statute. This shows how aggressive federal prosecutors have become in pursuing foreign bribery cases by using two laws originally intended to focus on organized crime.
The prosecution grew out suspicious transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission found during an inspection in 2010 of the New York brokerage firm. A particularly noticeable trade involved the Venezuelan development bank buying and selling almost $100 million of the same bonds in a single day that resulted in markups generating more than $10 million in profits. That type of round-trip trading is a major red flag for possible fraud and led to a broader investigation.
According to an affidavit filed with the Justice Department's criminal complaint, the government found evidence of Mr. Clarke and Mr. Hurtado making payments to Ms. Gonzalez in a number of different ways, including by commissions paid to her husband and via two wire transfers between Swiss bank accounts. Two spreadsheets attached to e-mails sent to Ms. Gonzalez outlined the payments due to her from the commissions generated by the bank's trading. 
Another spreadsheet from Mr. Hurtado to Ms. Gonzalez listed the amount of income taxes he wanted reimbursed for the portion of the commission that he received and then kicked back to her.
As the S.E.C. noted in filing parallel civil fraud charges against Mr. Clarke, Mr. Hurtado and two others, the defendants showed there is no honor among thieves. In the spreadsheets sent to Ms. Gonzalez, they deliberately underreported the amount of the commission they received from the trading, thus reducing her share of the profits.
Ms. Gonzalez is not charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but Mr. Clarke and Mr. Hurtado are. 
While the law allows prosecutors to pursue Americans they believe paid bribes, foreign officials do not come under the law as any prosecution of them is usually left to their own governments. It is often the case that a foreign government would be unwilling to extradite one of its own officials to the United States to face charges.
The Justice Department, however, took a much more aggressive approach in this case by charging Ms. Gonzalez with violating other federal statutes that permit the prosecution of any defendant, including foreign officials. 
Congress adopted the Travel Act in 1961 at the request of Robert F. Kennedy, then the attorney general, to aid in the government's fight against organized crime that spread across a number of states. The title of the law is something of a misnomer because it does not actually require any travel but covers the use of "any facility in interstate or foreign commerce."
In addition to the usual crimes of violence associated with organized crime, the statute allows for a federal prosecution of conduct involving a violation of state bribery laws.
The charges against Ms. Gonzalez claim that the kickbacks she received violated New York State's , and that the wiring of money between the Swiss bank accounts brings this crime under the Travel Act.
The money laundering charges are also built on the transfer of money, and under this law, the government has to prove the transfers were the "proceeds" of "specified unlawful activity." In a neat trick to get around the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act's limitation on not charging the foreign official, the government is only claiming that the act was violated as the predicate crime generating the proceeds, which were then transferred to Ms. Gonzalez's Swiss bank account.
The benefit of a money laundering charge is the substantial penalty available for a violation: up to 20 years in federal prison. This increases the pressure on the defendants to cooperate because a conviction for money laundering brings with it a much higher recommended sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines than a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the Travel Act.
The Justice Department has been pursuing a growing number of cases under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has been increasingly focusing on individuals over their roles in paying bribes to foreign officials. The prosecution of Ms. Gonzalez for directing the trades through a Wall Street firm sends a message that those officials are not necessarily immune from prosecution in the United States because prosecutors can use other laws that do not have the same limitations.

HEADLINE: Errors Afflict More Checks Issued to Aid Homeowners

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Almost 100,000 homeowners got checks for less than they were owed under the settlement with the nation&#8217;s biggest banks. 

 BODY:
 8:58 p.m. | Updated 
At least these checks cleared.
Three weeks after checks sent to homeowners as compensation for foreclosure abuses were rejected for insufficient funds, the consulting firm at the center of the mishap erred again: a fresh round of checks was written for the wrong amounts.
In recent days, according to officials briefed on the matter, Rust Consulting issued nearly 100,000 checks for less than the homeowners were owed. The mistake potentially cheated consumers out of millions of dollars they were owed under a deal reached between the government and the nation's biggest banks.
Federal regulators ordered Rust to fix its mistake. And in a statement, Rust said late Wednesday that it had "corrected the error and plans to mail supplemental checks to affected borrowers as soon as May 17." It attributed the mistake to a "clerical error." 
 But the developments cast another harsh spotlight on Rust, which had been selected as the distributor of checks for the $3.6 billion settlement deal that regulators struck with the banks. The continued problems with Rust also raised questions about the government's oversight of the firm and the wisdom of hiring it in the first place.
What's more, some homeowners complain the problem is broader than Rust has acknowledged. Jennifer Lawson, whose husband is on active duty with the Navy, said she was stunned when she received a check on April 19 for $600. Under the terms of the settlement deal, Ms. Lawson expected thousands of dollars in compensation for her foreclosure.
"First we are wrongfully tossed out of our home while serving this country and then we get basically no money," Ms. Lawson said.
The problems have alarmed Capitol Hill and prompted investigations into the settlement.
"This is the worst settlement I have seen in my life," said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, who has opened an investigation into problems with the settlement, including the use of Rust.
With more than 50 federal contracts to its name, and its own political action committee spreading campaign donations across Washington, Rust has become a favored middleman for class-action lawsuits and government settlements.
In the foreclosure settlement case, in which regulators accused 13 lenders of wrongful evictions and other abuses, Rust appeared to be the logical choice. In fact, when executives from some banks suggested a different consulting firm for the foreclosure settlement, regulators balked, according to people briefed on the matter. The regulators instead suggested that the banks hire Rust.
But problems emerged soon after the settlement was announced in January. The consulting firm, officials said, was initially slow to alert borrowers to expected payments. Then, the officials say, Rust delayed the checks for weeks as it struggled to gear up for the payments.
Once Rust issued the first round of checks in April, it failed to move money into the bank account used for the settlement. The decision prevented some homeowners from cashing their checks.
Rust played down the mistake at first, saying in a private e-mail to banks that the "perceived issues" with a handful of checks lack "merit," according to a copy of the e-mail reviewed by The New York Times.
But, in effect, the checks bounced. And after the incident, Rust lost significant credibility with the regulators, officials said.
More recently, homeowners have complained about clerical errors at Rust, problems like checks sent to the wrong addresses or issued to deceased borrowers.
Norma Gammon, 54, said she thought things could not get much worse after her home in Evansville, Ind., was sold at foreclosure auction in June. But then she started dealing with Rust. After contacting Rust at least six times to update her address, Ms. Gammon said, she learned that the firm had sent the check to her foreclosed property. To receive another payment, Ms. Gammon has to fill out a new form. But Rust says the form has been sent three times, apparently to the wrong address.
"It's so frustrating that I just want to cry," she said.
The firm's latest mistake - sending out checks in the wrong amounts - could also prove difficult to remedy.
The problem stems from last week, when Rust issued checks to customers of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Unlike the other banks involved in the settlement, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's foreclosures were not subjected to a long independent assessment by outside auditors. As such, the banks agreed to pay some of its customers an extra sum.
But Rust, according to the officials briefed on the matter, failed to follow the payout plan. Instead, it issued checks to customers of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley based on a metric adopted by the 11 other banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The misstep deprived some homeowners of thousands of dollars. For example, some Goldman and Morgan customers in bankruptcy who were wrongfully evicted deserved a $4,650 check. They received $3,750 instead.
The problem was wide-ranging. About 96,000 of the 220,000 Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs customers received the wrong amount, according to regulators. It most likely affected every borrower who was entitled to more money under the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley plan.
Regulators detected the problem on Tuesday, when a concerned borrower called the Federal Reserve to complain, according to a person briefed on the matter. The Fed then ordered Rust to devise a solution.
Rather than cancel the checks, Rust decided to issue a second round of payments to the harmed consumers. In a statement, the Fed instructed borrowers to "cash both the original checks and the supplemental check." It also noted that "Rust has determined that the error was limited to borrowers whose mortgages were serviced by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley."
But anecdotal evidence suggested that Rust had encountered separate problems, beyond Goldman and Morgan. Housing advocates point to the case of Ms. Lawson.
Under a federal law, banks are required to obtain court orders before foreclosing on active-duty members like Ms. Lawson's husband. Some military members who were wrongfully evicted are eligible to receive up to $125,000 in compensation through the settlement. Ms. Lawson, whose home near Jacksonville, Fla., was sold at a foreclosure auction in 2010, said the "piddling amount" of $600 was an injustice.
Mr. Cummings, the congressman from Maryland, also notes that Rust does not include an explanation of what homeowners are owed under the settlement.
"Borrowers are not being told how their compensation under the settlement is determined," he said, "so it's impossible for them to know whether they are receiving the correct amount, which just adds insult to injury."
Regulators have noted that many consumers have seemingly had no trouble cashing their checks. By the end of Tuesday, regulators say, homeowners successfully cashed or deposited about two million checks, or slightly more than half of the total checks issued.
Still, that leaves nearly two million people who have either delayed cashing the check or have had problems doing so. Cynthia Singerman, a staff lawyer with Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said that some of the problems morphed from seemingly simple clerical fixes into a persistent problem for struggling homeowners.
One of Ms. Singerman's clients whose home in Pleasanton, Calif., is in foreclosure cannot cash the $1,000 check she received from Rust in April. The problem, Ms. Singerman said, is that the check is made out to the homeowner's husband, who died more than three years ago.

HEADLINE: Eisman Is Gloomy on Canadian Housing

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Steven Eisman, the hedge fund manager who rose to prominence in the financial crisis after betting against mortgages in the United States, has turned his attention to Canada. 

 BODY:
The hedge fund manager Steven Eisman rose to prominence in the financial crisis after betting against mortgages in the United States. On Wednesday, he turned his focus to Canada.
Mr. Eisman, whose wager against subprime mortgages was described in "The Big Short" by Michael Lewis, warned on Wednesday of weakness in the Canadian housing market and said lenders were vulnerable. 
Speaking at the 18th Annual Sohn Investment Conference in Manhattan, Mr. Eisman, founder of Emrys Partners, said the rise in Canadian home prices in recent years was being fueled by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, a mortgage finance entity that guarantees half of the country's mortgages.
The corporation's mortgage portfolio, Mr. Eisman said, is approaching a $600 billion cap recently imposed by the government, raising questions about whether it can continue supporting the market.
"When something gets that big, even governments get nervous," he said.
What is more, he said, mortgage-underwriting standards are beginning to tighten. It's a worrisome situation for banks, which hold "zero" capital against loans guaranteed by the mortgage finance giant, Mr. Eisman said.
"It's like owning a sovereign bond," he said. "We know where that got us."
He focused in particular on the Home Capital Group, a mortgage originator specializing in "nonprime" loans. Mr. Eisman said half of the company's $8.8 billion portfolio of these loans dated to the last two years, when prices were relatively high.
But Mr. Eisman was much more upbeat about the situation in the United States.
He singled out Ocwen Financial as a mortgage company that seemed undervalued, arguing that it would generate more than $1 billion of cash flow next year. The company's stock, he said, represents a "powerful" and "counterintuitive" bet on housing.
Ocwen's stock climbed as much as 3 percent after the remarks, and then gave up some gains to close up 1.6 percent, at $39.76 a share.
"Once in a while you come across a stock that is just completely and utterly mispriced, and that company is Ocwen," he said.

HEADLINE: In California, Push for Diversity in College Starts Earlier

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Universities are working to diversify their student bodies in states like California, which has eliminated race-conscious admissions. 

 BODY:
As the future of affirmative action in college admissions is being considered by the Supreme Court, my colleague Richard Pérez-Peña describes how universities are working to diversify their student bodies in states like California, which has eliminated race-conscious admissions: 
Those states have tried a series of new approaches to choosing students, giving applicants a leg up for overcoming disadvantages like poverty, language barriers, low-performing schools and troubled neighborhoods. That process has drawn heavy scrutiny, but in California, it is only half of a two-pronged approach. Disadvantaged students in poor neighborhoods, like Erick Ramirez, a senior at Anaheim High School, are benefiting from the state university systems' growing efforts to cultivate applicants starting in middle school.
"We've worked very hard to widen the pipeline, and there is still an enormous need to do more," said Mark G. Yudof, president of the University of California system.

The results of California's efforts offer some measure of satisfaction to supporters and critics alike. Both sides hail the U.C. system's strides toward economic - and not just racial - diversity; opponents of affirmative action claim that as vindication of their argument that it primarily benefits middle-class minority members. Supporters of race-conscious admissions acknowledge that the system has reversed the initial decline in black and Hispanic enrollment, though they say that is not enough. Whatever the merits of race-blind admissions, gifted poor and minority students are less likely than others to take the right classes to be eligible for college admission, to take the SAT or ACT, to get academic help when they need it, to fill out complex forms properly or to apply to competitive colleges.
So California's public universities, and some of their counterparts around the country, have embedded themselves deeply in disadvantaged communities, working with schools, students and parents to identify promising teenagers and get more of them into college.

HEADLINE: If Practice Makes Perfect, Why Don't Companies Practice More?

BYLINE: BRYAN BURKHART


HIGHLIGHT: Once a year, someone would say, &#8220;Maybe we should do some training.&#8221; 

 BODY:
In his terrific book "Outliers," Malcolm Gladwell writes about the importance of practice and, specifically, the necessity of completing 10,000 hours of practice in a particular field to become proficient. This makes sense to me. Everything I did before starting in business taught me that practice was essential to achieving success. In school, I had two or three exams each semester, but I went to class every day. Moreover, I had voluminous amounts of homework each night to refine my skills in a particular subject. In football, there were 10 games in a season, but nearly 100 practices.
Why is it that, in business, no one ever practices? 
At my previous company, practice was viewed as an afterthought. Once a year, someone would say, "Maybe we should do some training." Heads would nod, and the person who had come up with the idea would arrange for a third-party specialist to come in to conduct training for a particular group within the company. Members of that group would shuffle into the room, help themselves to the coffee and bagels, nod politely to the instructor as a lesson was presented and then shuffle out at the end - knowing that they would not be subjected to practice or training again until the next year. Every day was a game, and excellence was expected despite the utter absence of practice.
I view this as a massive opportunity. If most companies put their "players" on the "field" without the benefit of practice, surely those that put real emphasis on practice would gain a distinct advantage. Here's what we're doing at H.Bloom:
SEED Program
We introduced our SEED Program at the beginning of 2011. The program recruits people who aspire to run their own business but know that they need to learn the basics. We bring these ambitious folks into one of our already-existing markets and have them rotate through all aspects of the business: buying, production, delivery, account-management, sales and customer service. Those who graduate have the opportunity to move to a different city to open and run a new H.Bloom market. Today, four of our five markets are run by SEED graduates, and we have another three SEED participants in rotation now, hoping for their chance to open and lead a new market.
The SEED Program for market managers has worked so well that we are starting a SEED Program for sales people. I alluded to this possibility in a previous post, and I am happy to report that it is happening. Even more exciting, the ambitious person I interviewed in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago has accepted our offer and is moving to New York City to be our first Sales-SEED participant. We expect to start the program by the end of May with a group of people who will engage in a three-to-six-month program that consists of daily lead-generation activities, weekly sales training, on-the-ground training in our New York market and monthly classes with members of our executive team. Successful graduates will have the opportunity to move to a new market and lead our sales efforts there.
H.Bloom University
At the end of last year, we started H.Bloom University. While the SEED Program is focused on training people to take on a new role, H.Bloom University is meant to refine the skills of people in their current roles. We are running two tracks, and a few other tracks are under development:
Sales
Our entire sales team meets monthly, by video conference, to work on specific sales skills. One of our sales managers leads each of the sessions. Training classes have included: time management, building a sales pipeline, cold calling and using Salesforce. The instructor builds a slide deck to present and oversees a skills workshop for each participant.
Management
One of the most fulfilling aspects of my job is leading the monthly management classes. Again, these are done by video conference. I do two each month on the same topic: one for our market managers and one for our sales managers. I split the group to ensure that each person's face can show up on the video screen - we use Adobe Connect to facilitate the conference, and a session of six people is about the maximum for getting ideal user engagement.
Recent classes have covered communication, feedback, expectation/goal setting, inspection of results and data-driven decision-making (which I will cover in more detail in my next post). I come up with the topic, and then our head of talent, Rebekah Rombom, finds reading material that is germane to the coming discussion. Recent readings have included chapters from Jim Collins "Good to Great" and Kenneth Blanchard's "The One Minute Manager."
This week, I'll be reviewing our profit-and-loss statement in detail, walking through the things I look at in the income statement and the levers we can flip to improve the economics of our business. At the end of each class, I make an assignment (based on feedback I got from our Dallas manager, Julie Schiller, a former school teacher, who told me that retention of lessons is highest when an assignment is given immediately after a class so that students have the chance to put the new information into practice). We then schedule a follow-up for each attendee to present their work for that assignment to the group.
Operations and Floral Design
Rebekah is developing a program for these two position-types. We expect to start the programs for our operations team members and floral designers by the end of the year.
Engineers
We've engaged with a third party to help arrange customized training classes for our software engineers. I'll have more to discuss on this topic after the first sessions are held.
We've really just gotten started with our efforts. I don't think we do it well yet or with the frequency that I'd like. But I do believe we have identified an opportunity to build a fundamental advantage in our business.

HEADLINE: One Perspective on the Best Places to Retire

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The financial Web site Bankrate has compiled a list of best states for retirement, based on what makes financial sense. 

 BODY:
When people dream of places where they'd like to retire, chances are that North Dakota is not at the top of the list. Or South Dakota, for that matter. 
Not that there's anything wrong with those states. It's just that prospective retirees tend to think more about warmer climates. North Dakota, by one measure, is the coldest state in the continental United States. Bismarck, the state's capital, just had a blizzard in April.
Yet, the state makes a list of the 10 "unexpectedly best" states for retirement, according to Bankrate.com. The top 10 states, in descending order, are Tennessee, Louisiana, South Dakota, Kentucky, Mississippi, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Nebraska and North Dakota.
The financial Web site crunched a variety of data on the cost of living, taxes, health care, crime and climate to come up with the ranking. Access to health care, for instance, was measured by the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people, using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
By that measure, North Dakota scores well - it has five beds available for every 1,000 people, which ties it for second place nationally. So "if you can handle the cold," Bankrate says, it may be a good place to consider.
Other states on the list are notably warmer, like Alabama and Mississippi.
Chris Kahn, a statistics analyst with Bankrate, said any sort of relative ranking was bound to draw criticism because people had different ideas about what they wanted in retirement. But the point of the list, he said, is to have people on fixed incomes - as many retirees are - consider what areas might actually make financial sense.
"Florida is beautiful, and so is Arizona," he said, naming two states known for their warm climates and retirees. "But if you're on a fixed income, looking at other factors is a smart thing to do."
There will always be tradeoffs. Tennessee, for instance, has the second lowest cost of living, an attractive climate and scores well on access to health care, too. The drawback is a relatively high crime rate, Bankrate said.
Some people might prefer California, despite its higher cost of living. The state ranks fourth on Bankrate's list of "bad" states for retirement. So if you choose to go there, "have your financial house in order before you go," he said.
You can check Bankrate's full list to see where your preferred stateranks.
What do you think is the most important factor in choosing a location for your retirement?

HEADLINE: Mark Sanford and the Future of Marriage

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What his victory says about the prospects for &#8220;neo-Victorian morality.&#8221; 

 BODY:
While watching Mark Sanford win election to the House of Representatives last night, I thought back to a piece Megan McArdle wrote during the Supreme Court's gay marriage deliberations earlier this year, in which she made the case that the battle over same-sex unions would ultimately strengthen "the forces of staid, bourgeois sexual morality," and tip American society in a kind of "neo-Victorian" direction. Once gay couples are assimilated into the institution of marriage, she argued, it could become easier for upper-middle class liberals to preach what they already tend to practice, and promote stronger marital norms:
The 1970s were an open revolt against the idea of the dutiful pair bond, in favor of a life of perpetual infatuation. The elites led the way-and now they're leading it back. Compare Newt Gingrich or John McCain to the new generation of Republican hopefuls. Jindal, Ryan, Christie, Rubio . . . all of them are married to their first wives. Jindal met his wife in high school, Christie in college. By their age, McCain was preparing for his first divorce, and Gingrich was just a few years from his second. 
Meanwhile, it's becoming increasingly impossible to ignore the disastrous collapse of marriage outside the elite. It turns out that there aren't a diverse array of good ways to raise a child, as the progressive academics of the 1970s had suggested. Or at least, if there are, they don't include having children with an array of men you're not willing to marry, and who will subsequently drift in and out of your life. And that, in post-sexual revolution America, is increasingly the norm in many areas.
.... When traditional marriage, with its expectations of monogamy and longevity, no longer means excluding gays, expect it to get more popular among affluent urbanites. To be sure, it's already popular -affluent urbanites are now quite conservative in their personal marital habits. They've just been reluctant to shame those who don't follow suit. But with marriage freed from the culture-war baggage, we now have an opening for change. Think it can't happen? Consider the cigarette. It was shocking for a woman to smoke on in public in 1880, nearly mandatory in 1940, and increasingly shocking in 2013 (for either gender). I wouldn't be surprised to see out-of-wedlock childbearing follow a similar course.
This is something I would very much like to believe, but have trouble actually seeing happening in the near term. Indeed, if anything I think liberalism is drifting in the opposite direction as gay marriage's triumph grows more likely: Whether it's liberal publications running arguments for polygamy or earnest center-left wonks hoping that the same-sex marriage debate will ultimately lead to less moralizing about unwed births and "more practical conversation(s) about how to best support America's increasingly nontraditional family units," the sense on the left seems to be that marriage's decline is entirely driven by economic trends and thus is more or less inevitable, and that the bourgeois stability of the current upper class makes sense as a lifestyle choice without being a norm that's worth imposing on a society with as much family diversity as ours. This liberalism isn't libertine, and it clearly prefers pair bonding to "perpetual infatuation." But the preference for stability feels mostly like a matter of rational self-interest, with no real moral energy behind it - and for the kind of remoralization that McArdle is envisioning, energy is what you need.
But it isn't just the drift of liberalism that makes me doubt the neo-Victorian scenario; it's the drift (for now) of conservatism as well. One could imagine a world where the advance of gay marriage, and the apparent failure of traditionalist arguments on the issue, inspired social conservatives to seek both a more comprehensive pro-marriage agenda and less compromised standard bearers for that cause. But for now that doesn't seem to be happening: Instead we live in a world where the same South Carolina voters who handed their primary to the thrice-married Newt Gingrich just held their noses and voted for Sanford, who famously ditched not only his wife but also his gubernatorial duties while pursuing an adulterous affair.
I'm not particularly surprised by that outcome: Sanford was the G.O.P. candidate in a conservative district, and voting on party rather than character is usually the path of least resistance for partisans on both sides. But the fact that South Carolina Republicans took that path, and made his swift and shameless comeback a success, is still a useful indicator of where the energy is on the right - and it emphatically isn't with people who see the decline of marriage as a bigger issue for conservatism and America than the precise balance of power in the House of Representatives. Again, the preference among conservatives is obviously for stable marriages and family values and so forth - for the example set by the figures McArdle lists, rather than for Sanford-style shenanigans. But there apparently isn't enough passion behind that preference at the moment to induce Republican voters to sacrifice even a single House seat on its behalf.
Times change, passions change, and I wouldn't write so much about this issue if I didn't think it was possible for marriage norms to shift in a more conservative direction. But while the upper class's current preference for traditional-ish arrangements may be a necessary condition for that shift, it's a long way from being sufficient, and indeed could just as easily breed complacency instead. For now, at least, I don't look at left and right and see the beginnings of a neo-Victorian moment. I see a liberalism that feels triumphant about gay marriage and complacent about the institution's overall decline, and a conservatism that, lacking an obvious way forward, seems half-inclined to just give up the fight.

HEADLINE: Where Private School Is Not a Privilege

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: How does BRAC, the world&#8217;s largest NGO, educate more than 1.25 million of the world&#8217;s poorest children for free &#8212; and do a better job than government? 

 BODY:
In the United States, private school is generally a privilege of the rich. But in poorer nations, particularly in Africa and South Asia, families of all social classes send their children to private school. The private schools within reach of the poor, however - usually a single classroom a woman runs in her house - are not a big improvement. But two school systems - Bridge International Academies in Kenya and BRAC in Bangladesh - are offering something different: they are making decent education accessible to the world's poorest on a giant scale. 
Both BRAC and Bridge are large and getting larger. BRAC has more than 1.25 million children in its schools in Bangladesh and six other countries, and it is expanding. Bridge is smaller, with 50,000 children, but it is only four years old, and it is opening a new school in Kenya every 2.5 days and is moving into other countries. BRAC puts its schools mainly in remote rural villages, Bridge in urban slums. They both serve the poor - and serve them relatively well. But that is about all they have in common.

The two school systems have diametrically opposing philosophies, methods and business models. Anyone familiar with the debate in the United States about American education would recognize these polar opposites. Bridge is a for-profit company which draws income solely from school fees; to be profitable it must keep class size at 50 or larger. One of its investors is Pearson, the media and education company whose tests have proven so controversial in New York. Bridge relies on standardization and technology. At 11 a.m. for example, every single second-grade teacher in every Bridge academy will be teaching the exact same lesson, supplied with a word-for-word script from Bridge headquarters delivered by Nook e-reader.
I will write more about Bridge schools in my next column in two weeks. This week I want to explore the BRAC model - one that gives teachers almost complete autonomy, looks for small classrooms, combines various ages in one class, is Montessori-like in its methods, pays little attention to standardized tests and emphasizes soft skills.
BRAC used to be an acronym for Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, but now the letters stand alone. It was founded in 1972 to provide relief after Bangladesh's war of liberation. Although you've probably never heard of it, BRAC is the largest nongovernmental organization in the world, with some 100,000 employees, and it services reach 110 million people. "Small is beautiful, but big is necessary," Mushtaque Chowdhury, the vice chair of BRAC, often says.
BRAC does everything: health, microfinance, agriculture, water. BRAC gets some of its budget from donations, largely from rich-country development agencies like Britain's DFID or AusAid. But most of its money comes from its businesses. Dairy farmers needed milk chilling stations, so BRAC built them; BRAC dairy now has 22 percent of Bangladesh's milk market. BRAC's programs needed Internet connections; BRACnet is now one of the country's largest Internet service providers. In Bangladesh, BRAC is large enough and comprehensive enough to be akin to a parallel government.
And since 1985, it has run schools - the largest secular nongovernmental educational system in the world. (See here for a rather treacly BRAC video about its schools). It has more than 700,000 students in primary schools in Bangladesh and also runs networks of schools in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Uganda, South Sudan and Sierra Leone - some 40,000 schools in total. And BRAC schools host a parade of visitors who go back to their countries and adapt what they saw - BRAC doesn't even keep count of these schools it inspired.
In 1984, 40 percent of Bangladesh's primary-school-age children were not in school. Girls, particularly - of girls who did start first grade, only 2 percent of them were still in school by fifth grade.
Many students were kept at home to work. School interferes with seasonal harvesting, an activity of both girls and boys. But girls' labor - fetching water, taking care of younger siblings - was a daily necessity. Parents weighed the value of that labor against what girls were getting from school. In most cases, school offered little - classes of 50 or 60 students, teachers who showed up only occasionally, scant materials.
In addition, most villages did not have a school - children had to walk to other villages, and many parents did not consider the walk to be safe, especially for girls. Parents also were wary of male teachers - sometimes with good reason.
Other groups of children were often kept home: disabled children, ethnic minorities who were the object of discrimination, and children whose parents had never gone to school themselves.
BRAC decided to get those children into school. "The government put in about $30 per student per year," said Maria May, program manager of BRAC's social innovation lab. "So BRAC said, O.K., let's find a model that delivers better results for that $30 per year."
In 1985, BRAC opened 22 one-room primary schools, admitting children who dropped out of primary school or had reached the starting age limit of 8. BRAC actually spends $20 per student per year. School buildings are rudimentary, with bamboo walls and corrugated tin roofs. All BRAC's programs rely on workers hired locally at very low salaries, and so this became the way to find teachers as well. BRAC hires a woman from each village to teach, pays her a stipend and gives her two weeks of training before she starts, and ongoing training every month - 140 days in total over 4 years. A supervisor will stop in once or twice a week to watch a lesson and talk to parents in the village, asking if they have any complaints or comments.
Early on, said May, parents had to pay a small amount to send their child to a BRAC school. "At that point, this was a way to have local accountability for the teacher - parents would be very angry if she didn't show up. But it didn't work very well. There were very poor families." Now BRAC schools are free, with textbooks, storybooks, slates, notebooks and educational materials such as math toys all included. (Public schools, by contrast, while supposedly free, charge parents numerous fees.)
BRAC designed its school system to address all the reasons children didn't attend schools. Teachers are female. The schools aggressively recruit girls, who make up two-thirds of the student body. Ethnic minorities study in their own language for the first few years; disabled children receive free surgery and medical devices. Each village has a school; "the school goes to the children; the children don't come to the school," said Safiqul Islam, BRAC's director of education. The teacher starts first grade with a group of 30 or so children of different ages and stays with the group all the way through primary school, covering the 5-year curriculum in 4 years. The children then go into government secondary schools, and the teacher starts over with a new group.
To allow children to do chores, the school day is short - three to four hours each day. But there are few days off, so children actually spend more time in class than in public schools. The village sets the schedule, so that children are home for harvesting.
Teaching in BRAC schools is very different from the rote memorization that characterizes the public schools in Bangladesh (and most poor countries). BRAC schools use some rote learning, but also lots of singing, dancing, drawing, games, individual attention, group study and Montessori-style work with educational toys.
In the first three years in a BRAC school, moreover, children spend a lot of time not on core subjects, but things BRAC deems important: confidence building, working with others, gender rights, nutrition, hygiene. In core subjects, children take monthly tests, but they are usually not told of the results - they are informal tests designed to help the teacher understand the students' skills and weaknesses. And the national exams? "We do not bother with them," said Islam. In the students' final year they focus for three months on Bangladesh's national exams. "We try to tell the student, 'you know enough - just answer the questions,'" he said.
To outsiders, this model seems unlikely to succeed: surely disadvantaged children need more qualified teachers, not village women who might or might not have finished high school. But BRAC is good at getting high-quality work from local people who lack formal qualifications, and Islam said that it was no different with teachers. "There are a lot of educated women in the villages who do not have employment," he said. "When they get it, it is seriously empowering." One objective measure is that BRAC teachers show up for class - their absentee rate is less than 5 percent.
An evaluation (pdf) of BRAC students' scores on government tests found that teachers' levels of education did not affect their students' performance - but experience did; the longer the teacher has been teaching, the higher the students' test scores.
BRAC students, in fact, do better than their public-school counterparts. "It is well known that in terms of infrastructure of the schools, and academic qualification and salary of the teachers the government schools are much ahead of the BRAC nonformal schools," the evaluation said (p 51). "But BRAC nonformal schools surpassed their government counterparts in continuous teacher training, supervision of schools and classroom teaching quality. Class size is also much smaller in BRAC system. Studies show that due to the above, teaching-learning provision in BRAC nonformal schools is much better than the government schools."
BRAC students are more likely to complete fifth grade - in 2004, 94 percent did, as opposed to 67 percent of public school students. (The BRAC number is now about 99 percent.) On government tests, BRAC students do about 10 percent better than public school students - impressive, given that their population is the most marginalized.
But doing better than government schools is not a very high standard. Astudy (pdf) in 2006 said that BRAC has improved rural learning, but "has not yet achieved the quality to which [BRAC] aspires." Test results indicate the "low quality of learning."
Still, BRAC students otherwise would likely have no education at all. School quality is an issue everywhere. As governments are putting more and more children in school, they are now turning to the more difficult question: how do you make their time there worthwhile? In difficult circumstances, BRAC makes a huge difference in children's lives. In two weeks, I will show how Bridge International Academy, the anti-BRAC, does the same.

HEADLINE: An Ethnic Map

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on how the politics of immigration reform are shaping the Republican Party. 

 BODY:
David Brooks: On Tuesday I was on a panel with Representative Xavier Becerra, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, and Janet Murguía, who is the head of the National Council of La Raza.
Gail Collins: David, you are always just coming back from a panel. You fill me with awe, respect and a deep sense of exhaustion.
David: They both told very moving stories about their family backgrounds - their parents working away without the benefit of much education and then living to see their own children rise to positions of national leadership.
Now both my parents have advanced degrees. Do you realize what a burden that is for me in these circumstances? What kind of inspiring stories am I supposed to tell? Watching my father trudge through the snow to the annual convention of the Modern Language Association? Never knowing where my next Philip Larkin poem was going to come from? 
Gail: Too bad your parents went to school in the 20th century. If you were a child with two advanced-degree parents now, you'd probably have moving stories of being left home alone while they were waiting tables on the overnight shift to pay back their student loans.
David: You have to go back three generations to get to my immigrant forebears and unfortunately even my great-grandfather opened a butcher shop and seems to have immediately made money hand over fist. I wonder if there is a place to rent some wretchedness just to fill out the family lore?
I hope you're not now going to top me with some awesome story of suffering and overcoming great odds.
Gail: Well, I did grow up on the west side of Cincinnati. Which was regarded as a severe social handicap by people on the east side. Fortunately, I never noticed since nobody in my neighborhood ever left the block.
David: Anyway, I was hoping we could talk about immigration and immigration reform.
Gail: I have a sinking feeling this is going to be one of those conversations where we fail to disagree, which is so much less exciting. I don't suppose you'd rather fight about Social Security again?
David: When I was a kid my grandfather drew me an ethnic map of his neighborhood. Some buildings were dominated by Finns, some by Norwegians, some by Germans. He made all sorts of ethnic distinctions that we don't think to make today. When immigration works, ethnicity drops from the foreground to the background over time. It stops being a public destiny and starts being a private source of meaning.
Others disagree, but I think the current wave of immigration is going to end up working out like past waves, which is wonderful news for this country.
Gail: Obviously I agree. However, it'd be a lot easier for the newcomers to find the American dream if we could juice up the economy with some infrastructure spending and improve early childhood education. But that's another economic fight, and I can tell you don't want to go down that road right now.
David: I do worry about immigration reform, though. I think the proposal emerging in the Senate is a no-brainer. It increases high-skill immigration. It brings people out of the shadows. It's got to be better than what we have. Is that your basic take?
Gail: Yes. Of course it took Mitt Romney getting drubbed in the Latino and Asian communities to get Republicans interested in the issue.
David: But I worry about the proposal's prospects in Congress. If this were still the same old Republican Party of Reagan, then things would be fine. But the corporate wing is much weaker and the populist wing is much stronger. The struggle within the party for control is now playing out as a struggle over immigration policy. A few weeks ago I would have said the bill had a 70 percent chance of passage. Now I'm down to 50.
Gail: It's been a long time since I gave a 50 percent chance to any piece of legislation larger than renaming a post office. I'd say 35 or 40 percent.
David: I must say I admire Marco Rubio's role in all this. He's taken a bold position. He's really staked his political future on it. And he's getting beaten up on the right. If he can hold the Gang of Eight together and then add about six or seven Republican Senators, then this thing has a chance.
Gail: On the other side of the picture, you have Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is currently trying to take the credit for destroying gun control while vowing to do the same thing to immigration reform. Cruz is a great example of how the Tea Party affects the Republican senators. Every six years during election season they're in the right wing's pocket. Witness John McCain. In 2005, he sponsored a similar immigration bill. In 2010 he was running for re-nomination against a Tea Party type, and suddenly he's talking about illegal immigrants murdering people and running "complete the danged fence" ads.
But once they're safely re-elected they remember how much they hate the Tea Party's dogmatic craziness. Now McCain is back to the old mavericky 2000 version. That's partly because he doesn't have an election coming up. But I think he's also been driven to the center by his loathing for Ted Cruz. You don't often see such a combination of irritating personality, insane political convictions and total implacability in one so young.
So I think it's very possible immigration reform will pass the Senate handily, if only because so many people are eager to disappoint Cruz and Company. But the real problem, on this as on so very many things, is the House of Representatives.
David: The Republicans in the House will either kill it amid turmoil and street-fighting, or else they will try to break it up into a bunch of little bills. If that happens, maybe we can get to a conference committee and the party leaderships can muscle it through.
Gail: Well, at least they'll allow a conference committee to happen. That's more than the Republicans would do on the budget.
David: But I have to confess the prospects are worrying. Usually a committed minority can destroy a complex compromise bill fashioned by a broad majority. I wonder if some Democrats would actually prefer to see Republicans kill it, knowing that it would essentially mean political suicide for the opposing party for years to come.
Gail: Well, some Democrats certainly might have that thought in the back of their mind, but most of them genuinely want to get this done. No fair blaming the immigration bill's peril on the party that's been solidly behind it from the beginning.
If immigration reform passes, it'll be a big victory for sanity - nobody really believes it's healthy for a country to have millions and millions of undocumented noncitizens living in the shadows. But it'll also be a sign that the Republican Party has gotten tired of letting the Tea Party push it around. If the bill goes down, the Republicans' failure will be about a whole lot more than the fate of the Hispanic vote.

HEADLINE: Wheels: The Supercar Cops Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Dubai adds more supercars to its police fleet, and the Monkeemobile creator, Dean Jeffries, died on Sunday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Rich playboys eager for some spirited supercar driving in the United Arab Emirate of Dubai might want to reconsider pushing their expensive automotive toys into triple digit speeds. The Dubai police are well-equipped to catch up. Already famous for having Ferrari and Lamborghini police cars, Dubai recently added a few more supercars to its fleet, including an Aston Martin One-77, a Mercedes-Benz SLS and a Bentley Continental GT. Officers who drive the cars have to receive special training to learn how to handle them safely. (The Kjaleej Times) 
 Texas is truck country, and Chevrolet has announced that it will offer a Texas Edition of the 2014 Silverado. It won't be the first Texas-themed truck from Chevy, but in a state where truck sales are as much a cultural phenomenon as an economic one, the line makes sense. Very similar to the Custom Sport model that will be available in other states, the Texas Edition Silverado will include special badging, 20-inch wheels, body-colored mirrors and door handles, a tow package and a locking rear differential. But wearing Lone Star badging comes at a price: about $2,000, give or take, depending upon the base trim level of the truck that's being Tex-ified. (Pickuptrucks.com)
 Subaru is making a move to increase production at its Lafayette, Ind., plant. After five straight years of record sales in America, the Japanese automaker invested $400 million into the plant to expand production from 200,000 to a planned 300,000 vehicles per year. The company said it would need to hire 900 workers to build Imprezas. The expansion is expected to begin producing more cars by 2016. (Automotive News
 The name Dean Jeffries may not be all that familiar, but many people will recall the flamboyantly customized 1966 Pontiac GTO the Monkees drove on their television show. Jeffries, who built and painted the Monkeemobile and a lot of other custom cars, died Sunday at the age of 80. Along with stunt driving in several movies, Mr. Jeffries' credits include the first Shelby Cobra paint job, the script on James Dean's Porsche 550 Spyder, the customized Chrysler Imperial from the "Green Hornet" television series and a number of dune buggies and concept cars.

HEADLINE: Stock Markets Rise, but Half of Americans Don't Benefit

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The share of Americans who have money invested in stocks has been falling in recent years. 

 BODY:
The stock market has been doing well, reaching new nominal highs in recent weeks. Economists have been arguing that such equity gains make people feel richer, which might encourage consumers to pick up their spending despite their stagnant wages and recent tax increases. 
One possible problem with this hopeful story: the share of Americans who actually have money invested in stocks has been falling in recent years.
In its annual Economy and Finance survey, conducted April 4-14, Gallup found that 52 percent of Americans said they (personally or jointly with a spouse) owned stock outright or as part of a mutual fund or self-directed retirement account. That's not statistically different from the share last year (53 percent), but is down substantially from pre-recession levels. It's also the lowest recorded share since Gallup started asking this question in 1998. 
Lydia Saad of Gallup suggests that Americans' withdrawal from the stock market may be "more a function of their ability to buy it, than of whether its value is soaring," and notes that high unemployment seems to correlate with low stock ownership rates.
I wonder also whether the experience of the financial crisis may frighten Americans away from riskier assets like equities for a while, long after the unemployment rate has returned to more normal levels. Research from Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel about the so-called "Depression babies" found that people who had experienced low stock market returns throughout their lives are less willing to take on financial risk, are less likely to take part in the stock market and invest a lower fraction of their liquid assets in stocks if they do take part.
There aresigns that the appetite for risk is returning among more sophisticated investors and institutions, but that may not extend to the median American, who did not not recover as quickly or as fully (if at all) as the finance industry did.
Gallup also found, by the way, that recent declines in equity ownership had been largest among 30- to-49-year-olds and among middle-income Americans. The employed also had sharper declines than those who were not employed, although the latter started from a much lower base.

HEADLINE: Republicans, Reporters, Drug Addicts and an Orphaned Mural

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Building Blocks: A building at 54 West 40th Street has been a place of second lives and second chances. 

 BODY:
Having a hard time imagining a palatial Republican Club in the middle of blue Manhattan - with a sumptuous main lounge, fireplaces at either end, that offers a panorama of Bryant Park through its great windows, and an oak-trimmed dining room where each of the pilasters is topped by an "RC" crest? 
Would it sound more like a New York story if we told you that the Republicans reluctantly turned the clubhouse over to a bunch of journalists, after which the building was used by a drug-rehabilitation program that installed a mural, depicting the path out of addiction, along the curving grand staircase on which luminaries of the Republican Party once trod? 
That's 54 West 40th Street: a place of second lives and second chances.
As the 20th century opened, it was the site of St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church, which is now on the Upper West Side. In 1902, the Republican Club - a social group with a political bent suggested by its name - built an ornate 11-story clubhouse on the church site, which it occupied from 1903 until 1961, when the structure was sold to the Overseas Press Club.
In financial distress, the press group sold the property in 1973 to the Daytop Village rehabilitation organization. ("Drug Addicts Yield to Persuasion," if you've ever wondered how it got that name.)
Daytop was all about second lives, and it commissioned a monumental mural, "Ascent," by the artist Lumen Martin Winter (1908-1982). The allegorical mural depicted a journey from hope, through despair, and back into hope. The segments unfolded as one climbed the stairs. The happy ending came when one arrived at the second floor.
More recently, as Daytop faced its own financial crisis, brought on in part by declining Medicaid reimbursements, it reached an agreement to sell the building to Eric Hadar, the co-founder and chairman of the Allied Partners real estate concern. Mr. Hadar is no stranger to second lives, having battled addiction himself until entering treatment in 2008 after he was arrested for possessing drugs.
Mr. Hadar and Daytop settled on a purchase price of $26.5 million in 2010. A closing was scheduled for 2011. Daytop's money troubles were mounting. The organization asked Mr. Hadar if he would release his deposit so that Daytop could use the money. He was counseled against doing so, he recalled, but his "personal affinity" for the work of Daytop overruled common sense. After all, Mr. Hadar said, "The only scenario under which I could have lost money would have been if they filed for bankruptcy." He smiled a bit ruefully at the recollection.
Because that's just what Daytop did, in April 2012, a move that effectively voided the sale agreement. "We rejected it because the market had moved upward since the contract was signed," said Michael C. Dailey, the chief executive of Daytop. 
Then who should emerge as the strongest suitor but Mr. Hadar? He agreed again to buy the building - this time for $32 million. "My philosophy was that the building had increased in value," Mr. Hadar said, "but I had no carrying costs. In my mind, though it seemed like I was paying an added $5 million, I didn't feel as if it was the end of the world. While I was a little disappointed, I was pleased that it would allow Daytop to go forward."
Mr. Dailey said he was gratefully astonished by Mr. Hadar's negotiating posture. "He stepped up with an unexpected degree of both cooperation and fellowship," Mr. Dailey said. Daytop was so impressed with Mr. Hadar's collegiality - and his decision not to sue - that it invited him to join the board. He accepted.
Mr. Hadar was not acting from pure philanthropic impulse. He already owned an abutting building, 50 West 40th Street, so he now controls a site on Bryant Park that could accommodate an apartment and hotel tower of more than 40 stories. The views promise to be spectacular. That project is likely to involve tearing down No. 54 and all but the facade of No. 50.
For the time being, however, Mr. Hadar is content to renovate No. 54, which he has leased to WeWork, which will run it as collaborative office space for individuals and small businesses. Mr. Hadar said WeWork was sharing the cost of the $9 million renovation. The lease runs 15 years, though Mr. Hadar can exercise an option in 2020 to redevelop the entire site.
What is not yet settled is the fate of "Ascent."
While certainly not the equal of Tintoretto's murals for the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice, Mr. Winter's mural is a consequential work by an artist who had a number of important commissions: the monumental bas-relief at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Paul the Apostle on Columbus Avenue, the mural "Titans" at United Nations headquarters, a mosaic mural of the Annunciation in the Catholic chapel at the United States Air Force Academy, and two murals for A.F.L.-C.I.O. headquarters in Washington, "Labor Omnia Vincit" and "Labor Is Life."
For the Daytop mural, Mr. Winter painted representational figures in a crosshatched pattern that makes them seem to float against fantastic geometric patterns. The work is on canvas, so it can be removed. But Daytop has no room for it in its new headquarters, 204 West 40th Street, and has yet to find a recipient interested in such a site-specific mural. So it is still unclear whether "Ascent" will eventually have a second life.

HEADLINE: Lhota Facing Anger After He Likens Port Authority Police to 'Mall Cops'

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Area police unions condemned Joseph J. Lhota&#8217;s comment that Port Authority police officers &#8220;are nothing more than mall cops,&#8221; and the fallout could include lost support for his candidacy for mayor. 

 BODY:
It was a simple question about improving airport security, the kind that candidates for mayor field up to three times a day at campaign forums across New York City.
But a flippant reply from Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican, has unleashed an unusually angry and biting reaction from the region's police officers, inflaming a group that Mr. Lhota has long viewed as a natural political ally.
The episode was the first real blunder of his four-month-old campaign. 
In his answer at a forum on Tuesday night, Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of New York's public transit agency, said he had long harbored reservations about the quality of the police officers for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, who are responsible for securing the region's three major airports.

 "Quite honestly, and I know I will get in trouble for saying this, they are nothing more than mall cops," Mr. Lhota said, to scattered applause from the audience at Pace University in Lower Manhattan.
He went on to complain that Port Authority officers, who police a number of high-profile facilities like the Port Authority Bus Terminal, earned higher pay than the city's police officers.
Mr. Lhota's prediction of fallout was correct: Twitter erupted over his tart assessment, and by Wednesday morning, unions representing police officers in much of the New York region, as well as Mr. Lhota's Republican rivals, roundly condemned his words as deeply insensitive and inaccurate.
"Mr. Lhota's remarks are an insult to every man and woman who put their lives on the line every day as a police officer," said James Carver, president of the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association.
The Port Authority police force lost 37 officers at the World Trade Center site on Sept. 11, 2001, a figure that many police union officials cited as they denounced Mr. Lhota's comments.
"I've had 9/11 widows call me this morning," said Paul Nunziato, president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association. "They are not pleased at all."
In a show of solidarity, even the head of the powerful union representing the New York Police Department's officers weighed in, disapprovingly.
 "On 9/11 we searched together for 23 N.Y.P.D. officers and 37 P.A.P.D. officers who sacrificed their own lives while evacuating others to safety," Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said in a statement, referring to the two police forces. 
"If that doesn't speak to professional policing, then I don't know what does," Mr. Lynch added.
On Wednesday morning, Mr. Lhota issued an apology. "I regret my unfortunate characterization of the Port Authority Police Department," he said. "It was an inappropriate answer that does not accurately reflect the hard work of its officers." 
It was an unexpected headache for Mr. Lhota, the son of a New York City police lieutenant and a longtime deputy in the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was a defender of the police throughout his tenure. 
As deputy mayor for operations, Mr. Lhota himself raced to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Later, he said he had developed cancer from exposure to materials at ground zero.
In that sense, he would seem a friend of the region's police officers. But the fierce response to his statements at the forum suggested that he had squandered at least some of that good will.
His remarks left political analysts scratching their heads; appealing to police officers and their families has long figured into the political calculus of any Republican seeking to be mayor. 
Mr. Lhota's chief Republican rival, John A. Catsimatidis, quickly pounced, issuing a personal jab at Mr. Lhota. "It's sad that the son of an N.Y.P.D. lieutenant would take verbal shots at the Port Authority police or any law enforcement organization," he said. "As mayor, I would support law enforcement, not knock it down."
George T. McDonald, another Republican candidate, went a step further, listing by name all 37 Port Authority police officers who died on Sept. 11 in an e-mail demanding that Mr. Lhota apologize. 
Mr. Lhota's apology, forceful as it was, did not satisfy Mr. Nunziato, of the Port Authority police union.
"What is his apology worth to the children of these cops or the widows?" he asked.
"Oh, I'm sorry," Mr. Nunziato said, his voice rising as he mocked Mr. Lhota. "I don't think he has a chance to be mayor of New York City and I would certainly be out there campaigning against him if he ever got close."

HEADLINE: Critic of Immigration Proposal Cited Lower I.Q. of Immigrants in Dissertation

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER and KITTY BENNETT


HIGHLIGHT: A co-author of a new Heritage Foundation study highly critical of the Senate&#8217;s bipartisan immigration proposal also wrote a doctoral dissertation in which he argued that immigrants generally have an I.Q. that is &#8220;substantially lower than that of the white native population.&#8221; 

 BODY:
A co-author of a new Heritage Foundation study highly critical of the Senate's bipartisan immigration proposal also wrote a doctoral dissertation in which he argued that immigrants generally had an I.Q. that was "substantially lower than that of the white native population."
Jason Richwine, who joined the Heritage Foundation in 2012 as a senior policy analyst after receiving his doctorate in public policy from Harvard University in 2009, focused his dissertation, "I.Q. and Immigration Policy," on his view that the lower intelligence of immigrants should be considered when drafting immigration policy. 
A summary of Mr. Richwine's dissertation, first reported by The Washington Post, says:
"The statistical construct known as IQ can reliably estimate general mental ability, or intelligence. The average IQ of immigrants in the United States is substantially lower than that of the white native population, and the difference is likely to persist over several generations. The consequences are a lack of socioeconomic assimilation among low-IQ immigrant groups, more underclass behavior, less social trust, and an increase in the proportion of unskilled workers in the American labor market. Selecting high-IQ immigrants would ameliorate these problems in the U.S., while at the same time benefiting smart potential immigrants who lack educational access in their home countries."
In a section titled "The Immigrant I.Q. Deficit," Mr. Richwine writes, "Immigrants living in the U.S. today do not have the same level of cognitive ability as natives."
He concludes that section with the belief that Hispanics are not likely to catch up to their non-Hispanic counterparts. 
"No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach I.Q. parity with whites, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-I.Q. children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against," he writes. "From the perspective of Americans alive today, the low average I.Q. of Hispanics is effectively permanent."
He argues that I.Q. should be used as a "selection factor" in admitting immigrants into the country, and he says that he is unsure whether "the deficit" is a factor of genes, environment, or both.
 "Today's immigrants are not as intelligent on average as white natives," he writes in his concluding section. "The I.Q. difference between the two groups is large enough to have substantial negative effects on the economy and on American society."
His assertions quickly drew attention in the closely watched immigration fight on Wednesday, and the Heritage Foundation immediately sought to distance itself from the academic paper.
"This is not a work product of the Heritage Foundation," Mike Gonzalez, vice president of communications for the organization, said in an e-mail statement. "Its findings in no way reflect the positions of the Heritage Foundation. Nor do the findings affect the conclusions of our study on the cost of amnesty to the U.S. taxpayer."
The Heritage Foundation study is at the center of a split among conservatives about how to proceed on immigration, and a similar study helped kill earlier efforts at an immigration overhaul. The new study concluded that the plan would cost taxpayers $6.3 trillion, by calculating that immigrants would receive $9.4 trillion in government benefits and services, while paying only $3.1 trillion in taxes. It has already come under significant scrutiny and criticism, including from prominent conservatives like Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and an author of the immigration legislation.
Mr. Richwine is no stranger to controversy. In a 2012 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, in response to a fight over collective bargaining in Wisconsin, Mr. Richwine argued that public workers were overpaid.
"When the public pay debate began to simmer two years ago, we were among the few analysts to show that many public employees - federal, state and local, including public school teachers - are paid more than what their skills would merit in the private economy," he wrote. "Our core insight was that public-sector pensions are several times more generous than typical private-sector plans, but this generosity is obscured by accounting assumptions that allow governments to contribute far less to pension plans than private employers must."
He also has written previously about how he believes I.Q. and immigration are intertwined. In a 2009 article in Forbes, Mr. Richwine held up Indian-Americans as "the model minority."

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts Senate Race, Democrat Has Strong Lead

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: In the special Senate election in Massachusetts, Representative Edward J. Markey, the Democratic nominee, starts with a strong lead over Gabriel Gomez, the Republican, according to a new poll from Suffolk University. 

 BODY:
In the special Senate election in Massachusetts, Representative Edward J. Markey, the Democratic nominee, is starting with a strong lead over Gabriel Gomez, the Republican, according to a new poll from Suffolk University. 
Taken Saturday through Tuesday, the poll of people likely to vote in the June 25 special election showed Mr. Markey with 52 percent and Mr. Gomez with 35 percent, with 11 percent undecided. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
"The numbers are pretty ominous" for Mr. Gomez, said David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. "There aren't a lot of weak spots for Markey." 
One of the most positive signs for Mr. Markey is that Massachusetts voters hold an overwhelmingly favorable view of President Obama, both personally and in how he is doing his job. And most voters there say they believe that Mr. Markey will support the president, although he recently opposed a proposal by Mr. Obama that would lower Social Security benefits by changing the formula used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments. 
Mr. Markey, who was first elected to Congress in 1976, is better known than Mr. Gomez, a private equity investor and former member of the Navy SEALs who is a newcomer on the political scene. Fully one-third of the voters said they did not know enough about Mr. Gomez to express an opinion on him.
Mr. Paleologos said that Mr. Gomez had yet to win over independents, especially men, who voted for other candidates in last week's Republican primary. "They probably will come to Gomez eventually, but we're not picking up an instant warming of those voters to him now," he said.
And yet, in a state where Scott P. Brown, a Republican, pulled off an upset victory for the Senate in 2010, no one is counting Mr. Gomez out. From the minute he was declared the winner of the primary, he has cast Mr. Markey as a relic and raised questions about campaign donations Mr. Markey accepted from industry groups that he regulates.
On the question of which candidate is more likely to change the way Congress works, Mr. Gomez beat Mr. Markey in the Suffolk poll by six percentage points. And on the question of which candidate can better help turn around the economy, far and away the most important issue to voters, Mr. Gomez trailed Mr. Markey by six percentage points.
But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Gomez can attract the kind of financial donations that Mr. Brown received; Mr. Markey is doing his best to try to limit that money by calling on Mr. Gomez to sign a pledge that would penalize a candidate if outside special interests ran television ads on his behalf. So far, Mr. Gomez has refused to sign it.
The special election is to fill the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry, the Democrat who stepped down to become secretary of state. The poll found that the third-party candidate, Richard Heos, of the Twelve Visions Party, drew one percent of the vote.
An earlier version of this post misstated the last name of the third-party candidate in the special Senate election in Massachusetts. He is Richard Heos, not Hoes.

HEADLINE: Republicans, Addicts And a Building's Evolution

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Having a hard time imagining a palatial Republican Club in the middle of blue Manhattan -- with a sumptuous main lounge, fireplaces at either end, that offers a panorama of Bryant Park through its great windows, and an oak-trimmed dining room where each of the pilasters is topped by an ''RC'' crest?
Would it sound more like a New York story if we told you that the Republicans reluctantly turned the clubhouse over to a bunch of journalists, after which the building was used by a drug-rehabilitation program that installed a mural, depicting the path out of addiction, along the curving grand staircase on which luminaries of the Republican Party once trod? 
That's 54 West 40th Street: a place of second lives and second chances.
As the 20th century opened, it was the site of St. Ignatius of Antioch Episcopal Church, which is now on the Upper West Side. In 1902, the Republican Club -- a social group with a political bent suggested by its name -- built an ornate 11-story clubhouse on the church site, which it occupied from 1903 until 1961, when the structure was sold to the Overseas Press Club.
In financial distress, the press group sold the property in 1973 to the Daytop Village rehabilitation organization. (The name comes from ''Drug Addicts Yield to Persuasion.'')
Daytop was all about second lives, and it commissioned a monumental mural, ''Ascent,'' by the artist Lumen Martin Winter. The allegorical mural depicted a journey from hope, through despair, and back into hope. The segments unfolded as one climbed the stairs. The happy ending came when one arrived at the second floor.
More recently, as Daytop faced its own financial crisis, brought on in part by declining Medicaid reimbursements, it reached an agreement to sell the building to Eric Hadar, the co-founder and chairman of the Allied Partners real estate concern. He is no stranger to second lives, having battled addiction until entering treatment in 2008 after a drug possession arrest.
Mr. Hadar and Daytop settled on a purchase price of $26.5 million in 2010. A closing was scheduled for 2011. Daytop's money troubles were mounting. The organization asked Mr. Hadar if he would release his deposit so Daytop could use the money. He was counseled against doing so, he recalled, but his ''personal affinity'' for the work of Daytop overruled common sense. After all, Mr. Hadar said, ''the only scenario under which I could have lost money would have been if they filed for bankruptcy.'' He smiled a bit ruefully at the recollection.
Because that's just what Daytop did, in April 2012. It also canceled the existing sale agreement in order to get more money out of the property, said Michael C. Dailey, the chief executive of Daytop.
Then who should emerge as the strongest suitor? Mr. Hadar. He agreed again to buy the building -- this time for $32 million. ''My philosophy was that the building had increased in value,'' Mr. Hadar said, ''but I had no carrying costs. In my mind, though it seemed like I was paying an added $5 million, I didn't feel as if it was the end of the world. While I was a little disappointed, I was pleased that it would allow Daytop to go forward.''
Mr. Dailey said he was gratefully astonished by Mr. Hadar's negotiating posture. ''He stepped up with an unexpected degree of both cooperation and fellowship,'' Mr. Dailey said. Daytop was so impressed with Mr. Hadar's collegiality -- and his decision not to sue -- that it invited him to join the board. He accepted.
Mr. Hadar was not acting from pure philanthropic impulse. He already owned an abutting building, 50 West 40th Street, so he now controls a site on Bryant Park that could accommodate an apartment and hotel tower of more than 40 stories. The views promise to be spectacular. That project is likely to involve tearing down No. 54 and all but the facade of No. 50.
For the time being, however, Mr. Hadar is content to renovate No. 54, which he has leased to WeWork, which will run it as collaborative office space for individuals and small businesses. Mr. Hadar said WeWork was sharing the cost of the $9 million renovation. The lease runs 15 years, though Mr. Hadar can exercise an option in 2020 to redevelop the entire site.
What is not yet settled is the fate of ''Ascent.''
While certainly not the equal of Tintoretto's murals for the Scuola Grande di San Rocco in Venice, Mr. Winter's mural is a consequential work by an artist who had a number of important commissions: the monumental bas-relief at the Roman Catholic Church of St. Paul the Apostle on Columbus Avenue, the mural ''Titans'' at the United Nations headquarters, a mosaic mural of the Annunciation in the Catholic chapel at the United States Air Force Academy, and two murals for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. headquarters in Washington, ''Labor Omnia Vincit'' and ''Labor Is Life.''
For the Daytop mural, Mr. Winter painted representational figures in a crosshatched pattern that makes them seem to float against fantastic geometric patterns. The work is on canvas, so it can be removed. But Daytop has no room for it in its new headquarters, 204 West 40th Street, and has yet to find a recipient interested in such a site-specific mural. So it is still unclear whether ''Ascent'' will eventually have a second life.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The 700-Doll Question

BYLINE: By JO MAEDER. 
Jo Maeder is the author of ''When I Married My Mother'' and ''Opposites Attack.''

 BODY:
Ten years ago, when my mother was in the throes of dementia, I left New York, bought a home in North Carolina near my brother, and moved her in with me.
Mama Jo, as she was known, was a hoarder who had been living in Virginia with a collection of more than 700 dolls that she referred to as her ''little people.'' So I turned the largest space in the house into the doll room: 400 square feet of floor-to-ceiling dolls that rendered most visitors speechless.
After she died, a friend assured me that I'd get through the process of ''liberating'' those little people the same way I got through my mother's harrowing decline.
''With a lot of praying?'' I asked. 
''No,'' she replied. ''With a lot of Ativan.''
As a child, I went from dolls to ponies to boys. By the time I was an adult, I thought the dolls were creepy. But when Mama Jo died in 2006, I had become fond of them again. Still, I wasn't what you might call a C.D.L., or Crazy Doll Lady.
When a dealer offered me $35,000 for the collection, I turned it down and dismissed the idea that there was anything wrong with me. I needed to keep the dolls on hand while I wrote a memoir about my caregiving adventure. Then my editor thought they might be useful in promoting the book, and when it was optioned to be a movie, the producer loved them. Unfortunately, the option vanished. But a new agent suggested I keep the dolls to promote the paperback. There was always a rational reason.
Or not so rational. Mama Jo and I had been estranged for more than 30 years. It wasn't until I became her full-time caregiver that we fell madly in love. The doll room was a shrine to her, the dolls an extension of her. And I wasn't ready to let her go.
Before she died, I videotaped her talking about her collection. ''How do you feel about the dolls now?'' I asked her.
She beamed. ''I hope they all stay together,'' she said.
Add that to the list of reasons to keep them.
Six years after her death, they were still with me, and I was still in North Carolina.
I had made countless trips to New York, staying several months at a time. I helped a beloved elderly aunt who lived there, saw good friends and hoped that a new love or job would appear to keep me there permanently. Back ''home,'' I felt like an interloping Yankee, and yet, unexpectedly, I discovered I was growing as attached to the South as I had to the dolls.
I couldn't seem to make a decision about anything. And when I did, I immediately regretted it and blamed the dolls (a k a ''the damn dolls''). Everything would be fine if I could move back to New York, I told myself. But how do you sell a house with a room that resembles the set of a horror movie?
''They're holding me hostage!'' I complained to anyone who would listen.
The doll collection spanned four generations of my family.
One of the dolls, a Ludwig Greiner, was made before the Civil War. There were antique bisque dolls and modern plastic ones, in various colors and nationalities. They ranged in size from one-inch Frozen Charlies to three-foot-tall Playpals.
My plan was to hold onto the ones that had been made and costumed by gifted family members. I would keep a few that were made of wax (my great-aunt Gladys MacDowell was renowned for them) and cloth (my grandmother had made them during World War II when dolls stopped being produced), and some that had coconuts for heads (made by my great-grandmother).
That seemed reasonable, didn't it? After all, they were heirlooms. And maybe I'd keep a few more. Could I really let go of Sonny and Cher?
I knew this was a ridiculous thing to agonize about when there was real suffering in the world. But when I mentioned it to others, I often heard echoes of my own dilemma. One man told me that after spending a long time grappling with what to do with the Hummel figurines he inherited from his mother, he had finally decided to display them. Someone else admitted that although she was desperately in need of money to care for her disabled husband, she couldn't bear to sell her late father's valuable tool collection. ''I built a shed for them,'' she told me.
I watched ''Antiques Roadshow'' and wondered how many people ended up selling their valuable treasures, and how many more couldn't bring themselves to part with something so special. How many marriages had been strained by the problem I was struggling with? (Sell it. Keep it. Sell it!)
My memoir went out of print as I worked on three other books my agent couldn't sell. I was living Hemingway's famous words about going broke two ways, ''gradually and then suddenly.'' My I.R.A. was evaporating.
And then one day I looked at the dolls and saw $35,000 flashing in bright green neon.
Think again.
Thanks to the recession, dealers and auction houses were no longer scooping up collections the way they had before. Not only that, but people tend to buy the toys of their youth in their 30s, 40s and 50s, and Mama Jo's dolls, I was told, were ''aging out.'' Our local doll museum, like others across the country, was on the verge of collapse.
One doll lover came for a look. ''Honey, you should have taken that money,'' he said. ''You were standing on the edge of the ledge of the canyon.'' He made a karate-chopping motion in the air with his hand.
I prayed. I saw a therapist. I consulted an astrologer. Finally, after a shamanic healing, I became unstuck. Maybe I was just ready to let go of my grief.
My first step on the road to recovery was to have the entire collection photographed. The dolls will stay together forever, Mama Jo -- in four photo albums.
I opened a shop (really more of an adoption service) on the collectibles site Ruby Lane and began listing the dolls one at a time. It was far more involved and emotional than I anticipated, but it also infused my life with a certain girly fun I hadn't known was missing.
The dolls are now scattered across the globe, from Russia to New Zealand. I've made a few bucks, but I am far richer for the new friendships I have formed. My brother has been selling some of the dolls on eBay, and we've grown closer too.
And Mama Jo's House of Dolls has its own Facebook page, where new ''moms'' post photos. So the dolls are staying together virtually.
A year after my shamanic encounter, I'm too busy for long visits to Manhattan, much less to consider moving or to be confused. I have reissued my memoir under my own imprint, and suddenly it's a Kindle best seller. More books are on the way. My I.R.A. is growing again.
Once I'm free of most of the dolls, I hope a real person will take their place. One I can talk to, who won't just stare back at me.
But most surprising, I've joined the local doll club. I tell myself that would make Mama Jo even happier than if I had kept the dolls together.
I had no idea how much more I would come to love her and learn from her after she was gone. And for that I have the dolls to thank.

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Group's Political Effort Raises Uproar

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA and ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
''Move fast and break things'' has been the motto at Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, embodying the Silicon Valley ethos of unapologetically finding new ways to solve old problems. His latest foray into politics in Washington, however, might be characterized as ''Move fast, play hardball and be prepared for blowback.''
Fwd.Us, the new nonprofit advocacy group created by Mr. Zuckerberg and several technology executives and investors to push for an overhaul of immigration law, has bankrolled television ads endorsing the conservative stands taken by three lawmakers, prompting an outcry from liberal groups and a call to withhold advertisements from Facebook.
The uproar, some say, will be a lesson for Silicon Valley companies as they try to influence emotional political issues like immigration. But the group's supporters brashly say they were ready for the reaction. 
''Our advertising decisions are being made by a very smart team of political operatives who know that passing major reform will require some different and innovative tactics,'' Jim Breyer, a venture capitalist with Accel Partners and a contributor to the cause, said in an e-mailed statement. ''I'm proud to support Fwd.Us as they work to pass comprehensive immigration reform.''
The group has faced the most vocal criticism for television advertisements sponsored by its two subsidiaries, which are known as Americans for Conservative Action and Council for American Job Growth. One of those spots takes swipes at President Obama's health policies. Another lauds the Keystone XL pipeline, fiercely opposed by many environmental groups.
Those TV spots, which ran in several states for a week, prompted strong reaction from a coalition of liberal organizations that includes the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and MoveOn.org. They announced earlier this week that they would suspend buying advertisements on Facebook, which they acknowledged was meant to send a message and would have little economic impact on the company.
Cathy Duvall, director of strategic partnerships at the Sierra Club, said her group was especially disappointed to see the technology industry adopt a strategy that was more typical of old-fashioned, brass-knuckled Washington lobbying.
''When the ads came out they were politics as usual and divisive and pitting one issue against another,'' Ms. Duvall said. ''We were really surprised that Silicon Valley would be moving into the political space by doing the worst of business-as-usual politics.''
Fwd.Us, like other industry-backed interest groups, has said very little about how much money it has raised and from whom, except to name contributors on its Web site. It would say only that it spent in the ''seven figures'' on the television spots.
The ads are particularly surprising considering some of the other backers. John Doerr, a venture capitalist, is known for his investments in clean technology companies, and his wife, Ann, has been a major donor to environmental causes.
Reid Hoffman has described himself as ''progressive'' in an essay posted recently on LinkedIn, a company that he founded.
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, in 2010 backed an effort not to roll back California's global warming law. None of them returned calls and e-mails requesting comment for this article, referring instead to Fwd.Us operatives in Washington.
''We recognize that not everyone will always agree with or be pleased by our strategy,'' said Kate Hansen, a spokeswoman for Fwd.Us. ''Fwd.Us remains totally committed to support a bipartisan policy agenda that will boot the knowledge economy, including comprehensive immigration reform.''
For his part, Mr. Zuckerberg has covered his political bases. He recently held a fund-raiser for Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., and Facebook has hired several former White House and Congressional aides to work in its Washington office.
Mr. Zuckerberg has declined requests to be interviewed about Fwd.Us.
Jim Manley, a former chief spokesman for Senate majority leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that the ads may have achieved their goal, but that Mr. Zuckerberg should learn from the negative reaction.
''He is finding out it can be very, very problematic to get your company involved in hot-button social issues,'' said Mr. Manley, who now directs the communications practice at the Washington lobbying and public relations firm Quinn Gillespie. ''There is going to be blowback. You are going to pay a price for it.''
Fwd.Us has been openly criticized by others in Silicon Valley. Josh Miller, founder of a start-up called Branch, denounced what he called the group's ''questionable lobbying practices'' and said he was disappointed that the group had not been transparent about its intentions.
''More discouragingly, the leaders of the technology industry (and of FWD.us) have built their careers on bringing meaningful change to the world,'' he wrote in a BuzzFeed opinion piece. ''They should be doing the same in Washington.''
Vinod Khosla, a venture capitalist who finances clean energy companies and who was once a major partner at Mr. Doerr's investment firm, said on Twitter over the weekend: ''Will Fwd.us prostitute climate destruction & other values to get a few engineers hired & get immigration reform?''
One advocacy group called CredoAction, based in San Francisco, tried to use Facebook ads to draw attention to the Keystone XL pipeline TV spot sponsored by Fwd.Us. The ads were prohibited by Facebook officials, because the company's terms of service prohibit using Mr. Zuckerberg's image in another organization's ad. A coalition of organizations has also created a Facebook group to agitate against Fwd.Us.
Still, others say the ads signal a calculated pragmatism. Fwd.Us is led by experienced political operatives, including Joe Lockhart, a former Clinton Administration official, and Rob Jesmer, a former Republican Senate political adviser. One executive involved in the effort said the advertisements were vetted with executives backing it -- and that the executives realized before they were shown that they might alienate certain liberal audiences. But the group made a decision to back both Democrats and Republicans who support the immigration bill in order to get it passed.
''We did not just fall off the turnip truck,'' the executive said. ''There are a lot of people involved in these organizations that have been involved in politics for a really long time.''
The group e-mailed statements from prominent backers, including a former Facebook executive, Chamath Palihapitiya, who argued that Fwd.Us needs to be ''disruptive'' in politics, as in commerce.
''In order to push Washington to do something different and pass major legislation like comprehensive immigration reform, groups like Fwd.Us can't just do the same thing and expect different results,'' he said. ''As part of our work, we're using a wide variety of tactics, some of which may ruffle some feathers, but we believe the passage of the bill will be worth it.''

HEADLINE: Errors Afflict More Checks Issued to Aid Homeowners

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
8:58 p.m. | Updated At least these checks cleared.
Three weeks after checks sent to homeowners as compensation for foreclosure abuses were rejected for insufficient funds, the consulting firm at the center of the mishap erred again: a fresh round of checks was written for the wrong amounts.
In recent days, according to officials briefed on the matter, Rust Consulting issued nearly 100,000 checks for less than the homeowners were owed. The mistake potentially cheated consumers out of millions of dollars they were owed under a deal reached between the government and the nation's biggest banks.
Federal regulators ordered Rust to fix its mistake. And in a statement, Rust said late Wednesday that it had ''corrected the error and plans to mail supplemental checks to affected borrowers as soon as May 17.'' It attributed the mistake to a ''clerical error.'' 
But the developments cast another harsh spotlight on Rust, which had been selected as the distributor of checks for the $3.6 billion settlement deal that regulators struck with the banks. The continued problems with Rust also raised questions about the government's oversight of the firm and the wisdom of hiring it in the first place.
What's more, some homeowners complain the problem is broader than Rust has acknowledged. Jennifer Lawson, whose husband is on active duty with the Navy, said she was stunned when she received a check on April 19 for $600. Under the terms of the settlement deal, Ms. Lawson expected thousands of dollars in compensation for her foreclosure.
''First we are wrongfully tossed out of our home while serving this country and then we get basically no money,'' Ms. Lawson said.
The problems have alarmed Capitol Hill and prompted investigations into the settlement.
''This is the worst settlement I have seen in my life,'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, who has opened an investigation into problems with the settlement, including the use of Rust.
With more than 50 federal contracts to its name, and its own political action committee spreading campaign donations across Washington, Rust has become a favored middleman for class-action lawsuits and government settlements.
In the foreclosure settlement case, in which regulators accused 13 lenders of wrongful evictions and other abuses, Rust appeared to be the logical choice. In fact, when executives from some banks suggested a different consulting firm for the foreclosure settlement, regulators balked, according to people briefed on the matter. The regulators instead suggested that the banks hire Rust.
But problems emerged soon after the settlement was announced in January. The consulting firm, officials said, was initially slow to alert borrowers to expected payments. Then, the officials say, Rust delayed the checks for weeks as it struggled to gear up for the payments.
Once Rust issued the first round of checks in April, it failed to move money into the bank account used for the settlement. The decision prevented some homeowners from cashing their checks.
Rust played down the mistake at first, saying in a private e-mail to banks that the ''perceived issues'' with a handful of checks lack ''merit,'' according to a copy of the e-mail reviewed by The New York Times.
But, in effect, the checks bounced. And after the incident, Rust lost significant credibility with the regulators, officials said.
More recently, homeowners have complained about clerical errors at Rust, problems like checks sent to the wrong addresses or issued to deceased borrowers.
Norma Gammon, 54, said she thought things could not get much worse after her home in Evansville, Ind., was sold at foreclosure auction in June. But then she started dealing with Rust. After contacting Rust at least six times to update her address, Ms. Gammon said, she learned that the firm had sent the check to her foreclosed property. To receive another payment, Ms. Gammon has to fill out a new form. But Rust says the form has been sent three times, apparently to the wrong address.
''It's so frustrating that I just want to cry,'' she said.
The firm's latest mistake -- sending out checks in the wrong amounts -- could also prove difficult to remedy.
The problem stems from last week, when Rust issued checks to customers of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Unlike the other banks involved in the settlement, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley's foreclosures were not subjected to a long independent assessment by outside auditors. As such, the banks agreed to pay some of its customers an extra sum.
But Rust, according to the officials briefed on the matter, failed to follow the payout plan. Instead, it issued checks to customers of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley based on a metric adopted by the 11 other banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The misstep deprived some homeowners of thousands of dollars. For example, some Goldman and Morgan customers in bankruptcy who were wrongfully evicted deserved a $4,650 check. They received $3,750 instead.
The problem was wide-ranging. About 96,000 of the 220,000 Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs customers received the wrong amount, according to regulators. It most likely affected every borrower who was entitled to more money under the Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley plan.
Regulators detected the problem on Tuesday, when a concerned borrower called the Federal Reserve to complain, according to a person briefed on the matter. The Fed then ordered Rust to devise a solution.
Rather than cancel the checks, Rust decided to issue a second round of payments to the harmed consumers. In a statement, the Fed instructed borrowers to ''cash both the original checks and the supplemental check.'' It also noted that ''Rust has determined that the error was limited to borrowers whose mortgages were serviced by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.''
But anecdotal evidence suggested that Rust had encountered separate problems, beyond Goldman and Morgan. Housing advocates point to the case of Ms. Lawson.
Under a federal law, banks are required to obtain court orders before foreclosing on active-duty members like Ms. Lawson's husband. Some military members who were wrongfully evicted are eligible to receive up to $125,000 in compensation through the settlement. Ms. Lawson, whose home near Jacksonville, Fla., was sold at a foreclosure auction in 2010, said the ''piddling amount'' of $600 was an injustice.
Mr. Cummings, the congressman from Maryland, also notes that Rust does not include an explanation of what homeowners are owed under the settlement.
''Borrowers are not being told how their compensation under the settlement is determined,'' he said, ''so it's impossible for them to know whether they are receiving the correct amount, which just adds insult to injury.''
Regulators have noted that many consumers have seemingly had no trouble cashing their checks. By the end of Tuesday, regulators say, homeowners successfully cashed or deposited about two million checks, or slightly more than half of the total checks issued.
Still, that leaves nearly two million people who have either delayed cashing the check or have had problems doing so. Cynthia Singerman, a staff lawyer with Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, said that some of the problems morphed from seemingly simple clerical fixes into a persistent problem for struggling homeowners.
One of Ms. Singerman's clients whose home in Pleasanton, Calif., is in foreclosure cannot cash the $1,000 check she received from Rust in April. The problem, Ms. Singerman said, is that the check is made out to the homeowner's husband, who died more than three years ago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Asia-Pacific Nations Push to Rein in Rising Currencies

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- For many countries, inflows of cash would be a blessing. But incoming money has proved to be too much of a good thing in parts of the Asia-Pacific region, pushing currencies to uncomfortably high levels just as economic growth is tapering off. 
For many months, policy makers across the region have deployed a range of tools to try to dampen the adverse effects that can come when too much money flows into an economy. The latest example came Wednesday, when the central bank in New Zealand confirmed it had been selling New Zealand dollars on the currency markets in recent weeks to try to stem the sharp rise the kiwi has staged over the past two years.
The central bank governor, Graeme Wheeler, speaking in regular twice-yearly testimony to Parliament, did not say how much money had been deployed. Still, the acknowledgement spotlighted the discomfort that is being felt in the many parts of the region that have seen their currencies soar over the past few years.
On Tuesday, the central bank in Australia hinted at its unease with the Australian currency's strength -- the Australian dollar is hovering near multiyear highs -- which it cited as an important reason for an interest rate cut that took borrowing costs in the country to a record low.
The Thai finance minister also recently voiced his concern that the Thai baht was too strong. In the Philippines, the central bank cut a key interest rate in late April in a move that analysts said was aimed in part at reversing some of the gains the peso had made in recent years.
For export-dependent countries, in particular, strong currencies can be a significant burden, because they make locally made goods and services more expensive for overseas customers.
''The strength of the Australian dollar has been a real pain for the country's manufacturing and tourism sectors,'' said Klaus Baader, a regional economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong.
A string of rate cuts by the Australian central bank over the past 18 months has failed to weaken the currency, he added, because Australia's robust economic fundamentals, low public-sector debt and strong investment returns, relative to those in other developed economies, continue to make it an attractive destination for overseas cash.
The same applies to many parts of emerging Asia, whose growth rates and interest rates easily top those in the West.
Years of aggressive monetary easing in the United States, meanwhile, mean that there is more cash looking for yields -- some of which has flowed into promising markets in Asia and elsewhere.
Similar plans for large-scale asset purchases by the Japanese central bank raise the prospect that the phenomenon will intensify this year as Japanese investors, too, join the search for returns outside their home country, many analysts say.
That, said Frederic Neumann, a co-head of Asian economics at HSBC in Hong Kong, raises the likelihood of more efforts by policy makers across the region to rein in lingering currency and asset price pressures.
''South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia -- all have already tried to restrict lending because of the rapid inflow of cash,'' he said. ''I think we will see more of this over the coming two years.''

HEADLINE: Emphasis on Deficit Reduction Is Seen by Economists as Impeding Recovery

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The nation's unemployment rate would probably be nearly a point lower, roughly 6.5 percent, and economic growth almost two points higher this year if Washington had not cut spending and raised taxes as it has since 2011, according to private-sector and government economists.
After two years in which President Obama and Republicans in Congress have fought to a draw over their clashing approaches to job creation and budget deficits, the consensus about the result is clear: Immediate deficit reduction is a drag on full economic recovery.
Hardly a day goes by when either government analysts or the macroeconomists and financial forecasters who advise investors and businesses do not report on the latest signs of economic growth -- in housing, consumer spending, business investment. And then they add that things would be better but for the fiscal policy out of Washington. Tax increases and especially spending cuts, these critics say, take money from an economy that still needs some stimulus now, and is getting it only through the expansionary monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. 
''Fiscal tightening is hurting,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, wrote to clients recently. The investment bank Jefferies wrote of ''ongoing fiscal mismanagement'' in its midyear report on Tuesday, and noted that while the recovery and expansion would be four years old next month, reduced government spending ''has detracted from growth in five of past seven quarters.''
That period roughly coincides with the time that Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans have shared governance since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, promising an immediate $100 billion in spending cuts. Republicans did not get that much then, but the series of budget compromises with the president since -- while not so great as they wanted -- will soon reduce annual discretionary spending for domestic and military programs to the lowest level in half a century.
As for revenues, Mr. Obama forced Republicans to acquiesce in January to higher taxes from wealthy Americans. But worse, in the macroeconomists' view, both parties agreed not to extend a two-year-old cut in Americans' payroll taxes for Social Security, reducing their spending money.
In all this time, the president has fought unsuccessfully to combine deficit reduction, including spending cuts and tax increases, with spending increases and targeted tax cuts for job-creation initiatives in areas like infrastructure, manufacturing, research and education. That is a formula closer to what the economists propose. But Republicans have insisted on spending cuts alone and smaller government as the key to economic growth.
The results, Mr. Obama has taken to saying, despite his complicity, are ''self-inflicted wounds.''
''The only way the problem does get fixed is if both parties sit down and they say, 'How are we going to make sure that we're reducing our deficit sensibly?' '' he said last week at a news conference. ''How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education, basic research -- all the things that are going to help us grow?''
Mr. Obama added, ''I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common-sense solutions.''
Speaker John A. Boehner stood by the Republicans' policies during a session Tuesday with reporters. ''After four years of mediocre job creation, it's obvious that we don't need more tax hikes and more government spending,'' he said. ''We need smarter policies to make America more competitive and expand opportunities for everyone in our country.''
''We're the ones pushing this town to do the right thing when it comes to the economy and jobs,'' Mr. Boehner added.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy for the central bank, noted signs of improvement in the private sector last week in a statement. ''But fiscal policy is restraining economic growth,'' it added, echoing public comments that Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has made for months. In April, the International Monetary Fund said the United States would achieve further growth ''in the face of a very strong, indeed overly strong, fiscal consolidation.''
Thursday will capture as plainly as any day lately the differing approaches of Mr. Obama and Republicans toward the economy and government's role.
Mr. Obama plans to travel to Austin, Tex., to visit technology students, workers and entrepreneurs and promote his ideas to support efforts like theirs -- the kind of initiatives that Republicans have blocked.
House Republicans expect to pass a measure that would allow the Treasury to ''prioritize'' debt payments if Congress and Mr. Obama cannot agree this year to increase the nation's debt ceiling so the Treasury can keep borrowing money to pay all creditors. Under the bill, as tax receipts came in, the first priority would be paying creditors -- like China, Democratic opponents argue -- and second would be Social Security checks. But the measure would likely die in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
The ''prioritization'' proposal first arose in 2011 from among the most conservative House Republicans, those who were driving hardest against the White House on raising the debt ceiling and expressing unconcern about default, but it has now become mainstream in the House ranks.
Economists and financial analysts generally dismiss the idea as unworkable if not dangerous, and count on Democrats to block it. Gregory Daco, a senior principal economist at IHS Global Insight, said the Republicans' proposal was the kind that caused his clients to ignore the fiscal policy out of Washington, and rely instead on the Fed to buttress the recovery.
''Whenever I talk to our customers or clients, they sort of brush off everything that's related to fiscal policy,'' Mr. Daco said. ''The view is, 'Oh, it doesn't matter.' That's what I hear a lot.''
''What we try to convey is that it does matter,'' he said. ''It is important in terms of growth. It's also important in terms of confidence.''
He noted that the economy was much stronger than Europe's largely because the United States initially opted for stimulus measures and allowed deficits to increase when the recession and financial crisis hit five years ago. European governments pursued austerity policies to cut their debts, further stalling economic activity and in turn inflating deficits.
The more recent austerity policies here are helping to bring annual deficits down, as a new report of the Congressional Budget Office shows, after four years of trillion-dollar shortfalls. Yet many analysts would prefer that the measures had been timed for when the economy is strong and unemployment below 7 percent.
''While I agree that the U.S. must get its fiscal house in order,'' Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds, wrote, ''I join the likes of the I.M.F. in cautioning that too much austerity, too soon, is likely counterproductive.''

(PHOTOGRAPH BY CHRISTOPHER GREGORY/THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHARTS: Fiscal Policies Take a Toll: According to estimates by Moody's Analytics, recent fiscal tightening through budget cuts and tax increases will slow economic growth for 2013 by about 1.2 percentage points and prevent the unemployment rate from falling to 6.1 percent by the end of the year. Several other economists and forecasters, including Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisers and IHS Global Insight, have come to similar conclusions. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics

HEADLINE: Foes Suggest A Tradeoff If Pipeline Is Approved

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's first major environmental decision of his second term could be to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, profoundly disappointing environmental advocates who have made the project a symbolic test of the president's seriousness on climate change.
But could some kind of deal be in the offing -- a major climate policy announcement on, for example, power plant regulation or renewable energy incentives -- to ease the sting of the pipeline approval? 
White House and State Department officials insist a pipeline ruling will be made strictly on whether the 1,700-mile project is in the economic, environmental and security interests of the United States. They say the pipeline is not a fundamental piece of the nation's climate policy nor is it a political bargaining chip to trade for other measures.
Administration officials have described the pipeline as a relatively simple permit application on an infrastructure project to transport oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.
But to many environmentalists, including some of the president's most active campaign supporters, the issue has huge symbolic and political importance.
For that reason, the approaching decision -- expected some time this summer or early fall -- offers the president a rare opportunity to set the parameters of the energy debate for the rest of his term and cement his legacy as the first president to seriously address climate change.
''Presidents don't get many opportunities to make big dramatic announcements,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a former energy adviser in the Clinton White House and now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. ''If and when he announces approval of Keystone, he has a once-in-a-term teachable moment on climate.''
Mr. Bledsoe suggested that the president use the opportunity to announce a new regime of regulation for existing coal-fired power plants, which account for a third of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.
Others suggest Mr. Obama could tie the decision to a renewed push on a national clean energy standard, requiring that a set proportion of the nation's electricity be produced from carbon-free sources by a given year. One former administration official even suggested an interesting formula -- 18 percent by 2018. In 2011, renewable power -- solar, wind and hydro -- produced 13 percent of America's electricity.
There are a number of problems with such proposals, however.
First, pipeline opponents say there is no possible deal that could compensate for the environmental damage created by the construction of the pipeline and expanded development of the Canadian oil sands. They have described the pipeline as a fuse to one of the biggest carbon bombs on the planet, and said that extracting and burning all the oil in the Alberta oil sands would mean the game was over for global climate.
''Approving the pipeline would be a deep self-inflicted wound on the Obama administration, greater than anything else he has done,'' said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club and a leader of the antipipeline movement. ''This was not inherited from the Bush administration and it can't be passed off to his successor. It really is Obama's alone. Whatever damage the decision would do to the environmental movement pales in comparison to the damage it would do to his own legacy.''
Mr. Brune and other environmental advocates say that Mr. Obama should veto the pipeline and pursue climate-friendly policies for their own sakes, not as part of some political deal. The danger to the climate of continuing on the current path demands strong steps like curbing coal-fired power and supporting renewable alternatives, he said.
''It's hard to argue we should be developing new fossil fuel sources,'' said Mr. Brune, who was arrested outside the White House at a Keystone protest earlier this year, ''but particularly such a carbon-intensive source as the Canadian tar sands.''
There are other difficulties. Last year the Environmental Protection Agency proposed limiting carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, effectively foreclosing construction of any new coal-burning facilities. But just last month the E.P.A. delayed the proposed rule, saying it needed to respond to public and industry concerns.
It is unlikely the administration will take on the far more contentious and costly project of curbing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants until the new plant rule is completed, or at least much further along than it is now. This week, Gina McCarthy, who is awaiting confirmation as the new E.P.A. administrator, told Senate Republicans in a written submission that the agency ''is not currently developing any existing-source G.H.G. regulations.'' G.H.G. is shorthand for greenhouse gas.
A clean energy standard, also known as a renewable portfolio standard, also presents problems. About 30 states already have such rules in place, with different targets and timelines. To impose such a regimen nationally, however, requires Congressional action, which is unlikely. A clean energy proposal last year from former Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, went nowhere and there is even less enthusiasm in the current Congress.
''The president can't do a clean energy standard on his own,'' said Robert Dillon, spokesman for Senator Lisa Murkowski, the senior Republican from Alaska on the Energy and Natural Resources committee. ''He can't just order utilities to buy a certain amount of renewable energy.''
He asked, ''Is the goal to make energy cleaner? Or just to subsidize certain favored sectors of the renewable energy industry like wind and solar?''
Another possibility could be for Mr. Obama to extract promises from Canada to make development and transport of the oil less harmful to the environment.
But Canadian officials bristle at such suggestions, saying Alberta has had a carbon tax in place since 2007 (although it is quite small) and that some of the proceeds are diverted to development of alternative energy. They also say overall carbon emissions from oil sands mining have dropped 26 percent a barrel since 1990 and will fall further. And Canada's overall greenhouse gas reduction target -- 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 -- is the same as that of the United States.
''None of the environmental initiatives we have put in place were done to get the pipeline approved,'' Alison Redford, the premier of Alberta, said in a recent visit to Washington to lobby for Keystone. ''Anything we do has not and will not be done based on a quid pro quo.''

HEADLINE: Bill to Halt Iran's Access To Its Cash Is Introduced

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Seeking to escalate pressure on Iran, a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation on Wednesday that would deny the Iranian government access to its foreign exchange reserves parked in the banks of other countries, estimated to be worth as much as $100 billion, mostly in euros.
The legislation, which has strong support, would be the first major new sanction confronting Iran since its inconclusive round of negotiations with the big powers last month on its disputed nuclear program. Despite Iran's repeated denial, the West suspects it is aiming to be able to build nuclear weapons. 
The United States and the European Union have enacted a broad range of economic sanctions aimed at pressuring Iran in those negotiations, but sponsors of the legislation contend that Iran is not bargaining in good faith while it continues to enrich uranium.
Part of the reason, they say, is that Iran has been able to work around the worst effects of the sanctions by tapping its foreign currency reserves overseas, which are largely beyond the reach of current restrictions.
''Closing the foreign currency loophole in our sanctions policy is critical in our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability,'' the sponsors, led by Senator Mark Steven Kirk, an Illinois Republican, and Senator Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said in a statement on the new legislation, which they called ''the Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act.''
It would impose severe penalties on any foreign financial institution that conducts foreign exchange transactions on behalf of Iran's central bank or other Iranian entity that is already blacklisted by other sanctions. It would also be retroactive to Thursday, regardless of the passage date.
Supporters of the legislation contended it sent a significant message of bipartisan resolve to Iran at a time when the efficacy of the sanctions strategy has been increasingly called into question, largely because it has not dissuaded Iran from continuing to enrich uranium.
''The strong support the bill enjoys from Senate Democrats demonstrates that Congress does not accept the argument advanced by some that pressure should be relieved,'' said Mark Dubowitz, the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington group that has advocated for more sanctions.
''It also demonstrates that the Obama administration understands that Iran cannot be allowed to exploit loopholes in international sanctions while it refuses to agree to a negotiated settlement over its nuclear program,'' he said.
Blocking Iran's access to billions of dollars' worth of its own money in foreign markets could cause significant complications for the country, where presidential elections are set for next month and the economy's troubles are a major issue.
Sanctions already in place have basically halved sales of oil, Iran's most important export, contributed to surging inflation, caused shortages of imports and sharply reduced the value of the national currency, the rial. Foreign exchange reserves are considered an important pillar in keeping the rial from collapse.
Critics said the new legislation risked further alienating Iranians who suspect that the sanctions' true purpose is not to pressure Iran in the nuclear negotiations, but to cause an economic implosion that would lead to regime change. Instead of forcing leaders to be more flexible on the issue, critics say, the legislation could harden their positions.
''When we've cemented a sanctions escalation path, we're creating a trajectory toward actual confrontation,'' said Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council, a Washington group that opposes sanctions. Some Iranian leaders, he said, see the sanctions ''as a train that can only go in one direction and has no brakes.''
Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation, said the timing of the bill also could send the wrong signal to Iranian leaders, who he contended are already scrambling because of the sanctions imposed so far -- despite their projection of defiance.

HEADLINE: With Bleak Job Prospects, Parents and Their Children Buy Into Franchises

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
Late one night in January 2012, Paige Palmer called her mother at home, crying. She was entering her final semester as a communications major at St. Mary's College of California in Moraga, and neither she nor her friends were finding work. The job market was terrifying.
''In this culture, your whole life is planned out until you graduate from university,'' Ms. Palmer, 22, said. ''That time had come, and I didn't know what was at the end of the tunnel.''
Ms. Palmer's concerns found a receptive audience in her stepfather, Tony Uzzi. In June 2010, after 25 years in the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Uzzi, 55, was laid off from his job as senior vice president for sales at a pharmaceutical company based in Switzerland.
He spent a year playing golf and trying to start a consulting career, but he grew bored; going back to the corporate world was not really an option. ''Not a lot of attractive job offers came my way,'' he said. ''None. I was 53. I had been making several hundred thousand dollars a year, and no one wanted to pay me that.'' 
Eight months later, Mr. Uzzi and Ms. Palmer put down $130,000 of Mr. Uzzi's money to open in Mission Viejo, Calif., a franchise of Nurse Next Door, a home health care service based in Vancouver, British Columbia.
With that, they joined a growing number of parent-child partners who have responded to poor job prospects by buying franchises together. During the first month in operation, Mr. Uzzi said, they took in $23,000 in revenue, a first-month record for Nurse Next Door. Six months later, he said, they were averaging about twice that amount.
Concrete figures on multigenerational franchises are hard to come by. But anecdotal evidence suggests they are becoming increasingly common for job-seeking parents and children who have an entrepreneurial urge but not the experience or confidence to start a business alone.
Rick Bisio, a franchise consultant in Bradenton Beach, Fla., and the author of ''The Educated Franchisee,'' said that 10 to 20 percent of the franchisees he places start as parent-child pairs and that the number has risen since the economic turmoil.
An analysis by The Associated Press found that in 2011, 53.6 percent of those with bachelor's degrees under age 25 were jobless or underemployed, compared with 41 percent in 2000. And according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average length of unemployment for workers over 55 has risen to more than a year.
''In the U.S., the economy has been rough since 2008,'' said John DeHart, co-founder and chief executive of Nurse Next Door. ''You have a lot of seasoned executives getting packages, and they're looking for new careers. And you have this disproportionately high unemployment in the under-25 group. With that you get the dad/grad trend.''
Mr. DeHart said that four of the 11 franchises his company has opened in the United States in the past year have combined parents and recent graduates.
Larry Leonard is one such older worker who turned to opening a franchise with his children after a job loss. Mr. Leonard, 59, had been in the steel business for 38 years when he was ''down-sized'' from his job as president of a small steel company in Chicago Heights, Ill.
After an executive search firm told him it would take at least eight months to find another job, he and his family turned to CPR Cell Phone Repair, a telephone- and tablet-repair franchiser. The expected cost for the first store is about $125,000, said Mr. Leonard, who bought the rights to open eight stores over the next five years.
His wife, Paula, will run the front desk, Mr. Leonard said, while his older son, Russell, 29, will be responsible for marketing; his younger son, Philip, 27, for technology; and his daughter, Carolyn, 24, for social media. That division of labor is common among multigenerational franchisees, with parents typically handling jobs that require local connections and the children taking care of day-to-day operations and online marketing.
''I thought, I'm going to be 60 and if I could spend the last five to 10 years of my working life building up a company that would help me in retirement and help my children, I would investigate,'' Mr. Leonard said from a soon-to-open branch in Orland Park, Ill. ''We could make $30,000 to $50,000 per store in profit. It will take a few stores to match my old salary, but I'm building for the future, not just for today.''
Laid off parents and their unemployed children are often attracted to franchising because it offers easy-to-follow systems. But that guiding hand has a price. The overall cost of opening a franchise can range from roughly $50,000 for a pet-services store to $445,000 for a restaurant, according to data from the industry magazine Franchise Business Review.
In addition, franchisees usually pay 5 to 8 percent of their revenue in royalty fees to the franchiser, said Eric Stites, chief executive of Franchise Business Review. ''While franchising can be profitable, it's a long-term investment,'' Mr. Stites said. ''Most franchisees will need seven to 10 years or longer to grow a successful business to a point where they can potentially sell it and make a solid return on their investment, and clearly, there are no guarantees.''
When Greg Galvez, now 52, took early retirement from his job as general manager of imported beverages at Coca-Cola after a 2011 reorganization, he bought the rights to open Proshred Security document-shredding franchises in Georgia. He operates his first in Norcross, Ga. with the help of his 16-year-old twins, who may join the business full time after college.
Mr. Galvez said the company's training and software were helpful -- ''the operating process is there in a box,'' he said -- and his work at Coca-Cola, including helping to introduce Mexican Coke to the United States, provided useful experience. But he said his big-company background did not teach him how to find and approach a local market. ''The clients' needs are evolving all the time, and I'm lacking that insight,'' he said. ''At a large company you can buy research, but in a start-up you can't. It's a lot more trial and error.''
The family dynamic can also be tricky. When Millie Vazquez's two adult children, Julio, 30, and Alvaro, 34, moved back home several years ago and were looking for work, she decided to open a third Blimpie franchise in Paterson, N.J., not far from her first two.
She quickly ran into trouble with her sons, who wanted to create off-menu sandwiches and go outside the Blimpie system in other ways. As she fought with Alvaro, who was managing the store, she says his hair began to fall out from stress: ''At one point it got so bad, I said to Alvaro, 'You know what? You're fired.' ''
After leaving briefly, Alvaro returned and the two brothers retook the Blimpie training program; the store is now ''a gold mine,'' Ms. Vazquez said.
For Ms. Palmer at Nurse Next Door, moving from the freedom of college to a job that required her to be constantly on call was a difficult transition. ''When we're home for dinner, do we talk about business?'' she said. ''This isn't a normal 9-to-5 job.''
In the end, though, she said that taking on the responsibility had been worth it. The franchise, which opened in September, is on course for $500,000 in first-year revenue, Mr. Uzzi said.
Meanwhile, many of Ms. Palmer's college friends have not stopped looking for work.
''All of my friends have left the area in search of jobs,'' she said. ''Or they're baby-sitting.''

HEADLINE: City Council Approves Bill Mandating Sick-Day Pay

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The New York City Council, after years of impassioned debate, approved a bill on Wednesday that will require many businesses to offer paid time off to sick employees.
The bill passed 45 to 3. It was the result of a compromise between the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who had long held up a vote on the measure, and the bill's advocates, which included powerful unions.
Ms. Quinn, a Democrat who is running for mayor, had faced a quandary over whether to support some version of paid sick leave legislation, which is opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an important ally, and by many business leaders, whom she has tried to court in her campaign. 
Since 2010, Ms. Quinn had said that the bill's original version, which would have required businesses with at least five employees to provide five days of paid sick leave a year, would put an undue burden on small companies at a time when New York's economy was still shaky.
In March, after council members hatched a plan to force a floor vote on the bill, a move that would have undermined Ms. Quinn's authority, she reached a compromise with the bill's advocates.
The mandate will not take effect until April 1, 2014. Between then and Oct. 1, 2015, only businesses with at least 20 employees will be required to provide five paid sick days. After that, the mandate will extend to businesses with at least 15 employees. Manufacturing businesses will be exempt. The bill also allows for the regulation to be postponed if the city's economy worsens, as measured by an index published by the Federal Reserve.
Ms. Quinn's office has said the final bill will guarantee paid sick days to nearly one million workers. Mr. Bloomberg was expected to veto the bill, but Ms. Quinn said there were enough votes to override his objection.
At a City Hall rally on Wednesday, the bill's supporters said that they were happy the measure was being passed, even if it did not include everything they had wanted, and expressed gratitude to Ms. Quinn. ''We will continue to push for coverage of all size employers to create a level-playing field, but this new law is a huge step,'' said Nancy Rankin, a vice president of the Community Service Society.
Ms. Quinn thanked the advocates for listening to the concerns of small businesses and revising the bill to make it less onerous on them. ''This is not just a great day for workers,''she said. ''It is a great example of how we can bring people together through the legislative process.''
Even as the rally was going on, a spokesman for Bill de Blasio, the public advocate and one of Ms. Quinn's rivals in the Democratic primary, issued a statement belittling her role in the bill's passage.
''Today is a step forward, but it's one that has come years late because of Speaker Quinn's obstruction,'' Mr. de Blasio said in the statement, adding, ''I'll continue fighting until all families have this fundamental right.''
During a news conference later, reporters pressed Ms. Quinn about Mr. de Blasio's criticism and the opposition to the bill by Mr. Bloomberg and members of the business community. ''Obviously you can't always get everyone to agree,'' she said. ''We'll just have to respectfully disagree.''

HEADLINE: Ferguson's Move Shakes Soccer, and Business

BYLINE: By ROB HUGHES

 BODY:
LONDON -- The sudden announcement on Wednesday that Alex Ferguson will retire in two weeks' time after almost 27 years as manager of Manchester United has shaken its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, to say nothing of its effect around the sporting world.
The club's share price fell as much as 3.5 percent in early trading in New York within hours of the statement from Britain though it recovered some and was down 1.44 percent in afternoon trading. The decline reflects how much of a business sports has become, and how much Ferguson has meant to United's dominant position in the global game.
''It is the right time,'' he said Wednesday in Manchester.
At 71, he faces a hip operation in the coming weeks, and he has served his time with a club where he has built, and ruthlessly rebuilt, the playing squad five times to sustain its leading position atop the English Premier League and remain competitive in Europe. 
But it is beyond the playing field where the club has grown. Forbes magazine rates United and the Spanish giant Real Madrid as the two clubs whose $3 billion valuation makes them by far the greatest sporting franchises in the world.
Follow the market in New York, stop off in Macao where the Manchester United sports store fills acres, witness the popularity of the team in Shanghai or Singapore, and you get some idea of the economic power -- larger than some nations' entire gross domestic products -- of this gargantuan enterprise.
''Manchester United has been transformed as a football club under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson,'' Dan Jones, a partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said Wednesday. ''Financially, the last 26 years have coincided with a wider revolution in English football with massive investment in the game and the growth of the Premier League, particularly driven by domestic and international broadcast deals.''
The reality is that soccer is more than any business. Its power, which crosses borders and cultures, derives from its essence on the field, and that is where, undoubtedly, Ferguson has been monstrously successful among his peers.
Ferguson, however, did not make Manchester United great. He revived it. He gave it back what Matt Busby, another Scot also from working class roots, achieved between 1945 and 1971 when Busby's irrepressible spirit rebuilt a club out of the ruins of war, and then rebuilt his team after an airplane crash in Munich in 1958 decimated the best squad he ever built.
That catastrophe, and United's re-emergence from it, built the legend and the worldwide fame of the club. But toward the end of the Busby years it faded, and no man could turn the club around and re-establish it until Ferguson was appointed the team manager and coach in November 1986.
There are players on his team today who were not born the day that Ferguson, with his fiery temperament, his winning mentality, and his aggressive, attacking style began that revival.
Certainly, the business, now owned by the Glazer Family in Florida is global. Surely, one man is not the whole reason for its global popularity. But without Ferguson, the club's future resembles the situation in the post-Busby years.
Hence the immediate reaction on the stock market. Hence the statement from the owners when the club first was floated on the exchange last August. ''Any successor to our current manager,'' it warned, '' may not be as successful as our current manager.''
It is unlikely anyone will ever surpass the length of time Ferguson has managed at one club. But names of possible successors quickly popped up.
One man touted to be the possible next United manager has been José Mourinho, the simmering Portuguese coach who is expected to leave the helm of Real Madrid soon.
Coincidentally, Madrid knocked United out of the Champions League this season.
Mourinho has been viewed as negotiating his way back to Chelsea, his former club. But he made what was widely seen as an audition to be Ferguson's successor when they met in the Champions League, though questions about Mourinho's behavior might prevent him from getting the United job.
Bobby Charlton, the former great player of United who remains one of its directors, questioned whether a man who once stuck his finger in the eye of a fellow coach in a sideline argument at Barcelona had the dignity required to be the figurehead of a Manchester United.
If not Mourinho, the speculation points toward David Moyes as another possible successor. He is a fellow Scot, drawn from the same city, Glasgow, where Ferguson learned his values and his work ethic as the son of a trade union official in the Govan shipyard six decades ago.
Moyes shares that tough upbringing, and has shown his ability to manage players in a 10-year tenure at the Everton Football Club. What Moyes lacks, however, is European experience; he has built a competitive team on a strained budget, but it is a team without a trophy during his reign.
Ferguson has seldom missed a day on the training field, much less a night in the competitive arena, whereas a coach his teams accumulated 49 trophies -- including 13 seasons as England's champion but only two, in 1999 and 2008, as the Champions League winner.
Ferguson's reign makes him the most successful manager and coach -- rolled into one -- that the sport has ever seen. It is difficult to think of any comparable tenure in sports, politics or business during his time at United.
''The biggest challenge?'' he once said. ''Managing change.''
A man of volatile temperament -- sometimes a bully, often a father figure -- he built and ruthlessly rebuilt five squads of players over more than a quarter of a century. One player, Ryan Giggs, grew up from a 14-year-old apprentice to a winger who is still running on Ferguson's first team, through all the triumphs and the rebuilding. Giggs is almost 40 now, and still under Ferguson's wing.
Ferguson's style was defined by his giving youth its chance and clinging to experienced players while they still gave him value. But above all, he is a manager driven by a single goal: to win.
Ferguson, knighted in the British custom for outstanding service to his ''industry, faces surgery when this season is done.
He may not admit it, but he has just steered a team nowhere near the best squads in his reign to the title he vowed to regain the moment the neighbor, Manchester City, took it from him on goal difference a year ago.
His desire to go out on top was insatiable, but the reality this year is that no English team was good enough to even make it to the quarterfinals of the Champions League. Ferguson knows that Champions League success is the measuring stick in modern soccer.
Whoever replaces him will have to take that challenge on, because United, owned by the Glazers, an American family, is a multibillion-dollar franchise that markets itself around the globe as being among the biggest and the best.
Ferguson's career was stamped with success even before he moved south from Scotland to Manchester on Nov. 6, 1986. He had galvanized Aberdeen, in the very north of Scotland, to break the Celtic vs. Rangers monopoly of Scottish soccer, and it was the vigor of that team, the attacking style of it, that brought ''Fiery Fergie'' to the attention of United.
The question Manchester had then, and may have about Moyes now, was whether he could manage the egos of some of the world's highest-paid athletes. Could he persuade players who became millionaires in their teenage years to play as a team, to train as a team, and to go through whatever pain or glory the manager demanded of them as a team?
Ferguson almost failed at the start. He was given something that his successor may not get -- time -- to build and nurture a squad that stands the test of time.
That is so rare in European club soccer that no one today even comes close to the length of Ferguson's 27-year stay as a top manager.
The German Bundesliga at the moment is regarded as the pillar of stability in an impatient global scene. Jupp Heynckes will coach Bayern Munich against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium in London in the all-German Champions League final on May 25.
Heynckes, who is four years younger than Ferguson and has completed 50 years in the professional game, has had 13 top jobs in his coaching career -- in Germany, Spain and Portugal -- in the same period of time in which Ferguson has moved just once, from Aberdeen to the institution of United.
''It is important to leave an organization in the strongest possible shape,'' Ferguson said Wednesday, ''and I believe I have done that.''
He talked about the balance of youth and experience in the squad, about the training facilities that are second-to-none in the world, about the systems in place for his successor.
What he did not address was the steel required of the next man in his seat. Many years ago, before Ferguson came south to the job, Busby -- who had built up United from the end of World War II to the most renowned force in club soccer -- remained on the board of directors.
It was always said that Busby's presence around Old Trafford Stadium -- he started managing United in 1945, and finished in 1971 -- was an intimidating factor to the managers who tried and failed to pick up his baton.
Ferguson's successor will have to live with him on the board, and no matter how well-intentioned or how paternal the outgoing giant of his trade will conduct himself in his new role, the new manager will need nerves of steel not to wilt in the shadow.
The bar is set terrifyingly -- or inspirationally -- high.

HEADLINE: An Industry Man for the F.C.C.

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
President Obama has picked a former telecommunications lobbyist and campaign fund-raiser to serve as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, raising serious questions about his 2007 pledge that corporate lobbyists would not finance his campaign or run his administration. 
When Mr. Obama announced the nomination of Tom Wheeler last week, he said Mr. Wheeler's knowledge of the industry would help ensure that ''we're staying at the cutting-edge of an industry that again and again we've revolutionized here in America.'' Some prominent former government officials have endorsed Mr. Wheeler and say he would make telecommunications more competitive.
There is no question that Mr. Wheeler, who was chief executive of the National Cable Television Association for five years and the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association for 12 years before becoming a venture capitalist, understands the industry. The question is whether his long career representing the interests of telecommunications companies would make it hard for him to be an independent and fair regulator when consumers have few choices and pay high prices for cellphone, cable TV and broadband services.
He was also a big ''bundler'' for Mr. Obama in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, which means that he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from relatives, friends and business associates. Political campaigns disclose their donors, but they are not required to disclose which of them were recruited by bundlers like Mr. Wheeler. Given his background, it is almost certain that he raised money from people whose companies he would regulate, creating potential conflicts of interest.
Mr. Wheeler's supporters argue that he backed the modest net neutrality rules the F.C.C. adopted in 2010 to prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against content that competes with their own. (Verizon has challenged the regulation in court.) But he has also suggested that federal regulators should merely impose conditions on AT&T's 2011 bid to buy T-Mobile, which, thankfully, was blocked by the Obama administration because it would have left only three national cellphone companies. Before Mr. Wheeler is confirmed by the Senate, he and Mr. Obama's campaign should disclose how much money he raised from telecommunications executives and explain how he would make sure that those relationships would not influence his decisions at the F.C.C.
Among the agency's tasks is improving wireless and broadband services, which are dominated by a handful of companies. How would he, for instance, use auctions of electromagnetic airwaves, which are currently controlled by TV broadcasters, to get new and smaller companies to provide innovative Internet and video services?
Surveys by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show that a smaller proportion of Americans have high-speed Internet service at home and pay far more for it than consumers in nations like South Korea, France and Canada. Mr. Obama has said that he wants the United States to lead the world in telecommunications technology. The next chairman of the F.C.C. will need to have credibility and vision to carry that out.

HEADLINE: Next W.T.O. Head Wants a New Look at Body's Role

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Roberto Carvalho de Azevêdo, the next head of the World Trade Organization, said on Wednesday that the institution needed to adapt as the United States and other nations turn away from the multilateral forum to regional trade agreements.
But doubts persist among officials involved in international policy that he will be able to conclude negotiations for a global trade agreement that will lower trade barriers and address new issues of trade in services and the Internet. 
''We've tried for three years to convince ourselves that minor adjustments could give us a way out,'' Mr. Azevêdo, a Brazilian, said by telephone from Geneva, where he was formally recommended to W.T.O. members on Wednesday. ''Now, I'm convinced that we have to change the approach. We have to ask what is actually doable.''
The so-called Doha Round of negotiations, which began 12 years ago, hit the rocks in 2008 over questions of trade in industrial goods and protecting small farmers from cheap food imports. The talks have been essentially dormant since 2011.
The first step to restarting the Doha Round ''is very clear,'' Mr. Azevêdo said, ''starting with success in Bali,'' where W.T.O. ministers meet in December. Officials hope to achieve at least token success in streamlining customs procedures and ending export subsidies. Accomplishing that, he said, would provide both substance and ''much-needed confidence'' that the W.T.O. can get the job done.
Failure to move forward on the Doha Round ''is paralyzing the whole system,'' he said. But there is more to the trade body than just those talks, he said: ''We need to look at the W.T.O. trade agenda; we haven't done that in a long time.''
There are trade-related issues ''that we don't talk about,'' he said, things like climate change, energy, renewable fuels. ''We have to decide whether those areas are amenable to discussion.
''I don't think you can just throw away the progress we've made over the last 12 years,'' Mr. Azevêdo said. ''We need to go deeper in some areas and less deep in others. We have to be more sophisticated, more flexible and more pragmatic.''
Pankaj Ghemawat, a professor of global strategy at the IESE Business School in Madrid, said he feared that Mr. Azevêdo's status as an insider and conciliator could work against him in the current situation, where ''Doha isn't just stalled; it's got negative momentum.''
''He bills himself as a consensus builder,'' Professor Ghemawat said, ''but there's a question about how far you can get with that. The W.T.O. has 159 members, so it's a little like herding cats. You do need some steel to get things done, especially in the tricky situation he's inheriting.''
The breakdown of the Doha Round has led the United States and others to focus on breaking down barriers at the regional level, an approach that could redraw the map of global commerce outside the W.T.O. framework. The Obama administration is negotiating with partners in the Asia-Pacific region on a deal that would effectively bring Australia, Japan and others into the North American Free Trade Agreement. It has also reached out to Europe, opening the way for exploratory talks on a trans-Atlantic bloc. So far, both proposals would exclude China, Brazil, India and other developing nations.
Mr. Azevêdo played down the significance of the United States' turn toward bilateral and regional deals, saying: ''This is not news, we've always had these types of deals. The problem is that they're not happening at the W.T.O. But all the members want the Doha Round to move.''
Others think the outlook is even more bleak. ''Undoing the damage of the last few years will take much more than a new W.T.O. head,'' said Simon J. Evenett, a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. ''What is needed is a reset, something that can only come from the national capitals.''
''Doha is dead,'' Professor Evenett said. ''Anyone who wants to revive it has to face the fact that the regional deals now have so much momentum.''
Kevin P. Gallagher, a professor of international relations at Boston University who studies trade and investment policy, said Mr. Azevêdo faced ''a tall order'' in restoring Doha to the front line of trade discussions.
The proposed Asia-Pacific and European deals, with the United States as a fulcrum, have created ''a Balkanization of global trade policy,'' he said. But the regional trade deals are not nearly as valuable for the world economy as multilateral deals would be, he added.
''We've abandoned multilateralism,'' he said.
Mr. Azevêdo would succeed the current director general, Pascal Lamy, who is stepping down in September after serving two four-year terms. A 55-year-old career diplomat who has been part of Brazil's team in Geneva since 1997, Mr. Azevêdo bested eight other candidates, including the former Mexican trade minister Herminio Blanco, a University of Chicago economist who some had cast as a proxy for the rich countries.
Mr. Azevêdo rebutted suggestions that he was the developing world's candidate, noting that he had the support of a majority of the 159-member body in every round of voting and garnered support from both rich and poor countries and from all across the world.
''The next director general has to be a representative of the whole membership,'' he said. ''There cannot be a north-south divide.''
His long tenure has given him a mastery of W.T.O. minutiae. Susan C. Schwab, a former United States trade representative whose team spent ''hours and hours across the table from him,'' described Mr. Azevêdo as ''a brilliant tactician and negotiator.''
Ms. Schwab said Mr. Azevêdo was taking over an institution that is increasingly seen as unable to deliver. ''The good news is that after the financial crisis in 2008, the world did not descend into a spiral of protectionism,'' Ms. Schwab said. ''The bad news is that there hasn't been a major trade deal since the Uruguay Round in 1993. So the world is playing by old rules.''

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Zuckerberg's Lobbying Group Is Criticized Over Tactics

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The advocacy group Fwd.Us, created by Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg and others, has shocked some liberals with its tactics in a campaign to support immigration reform, Somini Sengupta and Eric Lipton report in The New York Times. 

 BODY:
The advocacy group Fwd.Us, created by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and others, has shocked some liberals with its tactics in a campaign to support immigration reform, Somini Sengupta and Eric Lipton report in The New York Times. 
The uproar, some say, will be a lesson for Silicon Valley companies as they try to influence emotional political issues like immigration. But the group's supporters brashly say they were ready for the reaction.
"Our advertising decisions are being made by a very smart team of political operatives who know that passing major reform will require some different and innovative tactics," James W. Breyer, a venture capitalist with Accel Partners and a contributor to the cause, said in an e-mailed statement. "I'm proud to support Fwd.Us as they work to pass comprehensive immigration reform." 
The group has faced the most vocal criticism for television advertisements sponsored by its two subsidiaries, Americans for Conservative Action and Council for American Job Growth. One of those spots takes swipes at President Obama's health policies. Another lauds the Keystone XL pipeline, fiercely opposed by many environmental groups.
Those TV spots, which ran in several states for a week, drew strong reaction from a coalition of liberal organizations that includes the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and MoveOn.org. They announced this week that they would suspend buying advertisements on Facebook, which they acknowledged was intended to send a message and would have little economic effect on the company.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Step Into the Limelight

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund faithful gather in Las Vegas for two annual conferences. | The firm responsible for sending checks to homeowners as compensation for foreclosure abuses has erred again. | Tesla will stop detailing how many reservations exist for its cars. | More debate on whether Jamie Dimon should remain both C.E.O. and chairman of JPMorgan Chase. 

 BODY:
In two separate events in Las Vegas and New York on Wednesday, the hedge fund faithful gathered to hear investment advice and rub elbows with some of the biggest names in the industry. The newer of the two events, the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or SALT, is a Wall Street schmooze-fest in Sin City that lets the world's richest investors mingle with funds peddling their services, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Overseeing the star-studded event is Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund impresario, or, as Mr. Lattman puts it, a P.T. Barnum in a Ferragamo tie. "In a gilded industry that has preferred to stay below the radar, Mr. Scaramucci embraces the white-hot center of it all." 
Mr. Scaramucci, a relentless and ubiquitous self-promoter, has built his $4.6 billion firm, SkyBridge Capital, on the belief that hedge funds are not just the domain of institutional investors and the ultrawealthy. But the "fund of funds" model has its critics, especially as hedge funds have lagged behind stocks in recent years. "Hedge funds tend to be a losing game for most investors," said Mebane T. Faber, co-founder of Cambria Investment Management. "With fund of funds, it is even more of a losing game because of the layers upon layers of fees." Still, Skybridge's main fund returned 20.2 percent last year net of fees, handily outperforming the S.& P 500.
The scene in Manhattan at the 18th Annual Sohn Investment Conference, which raised money for pediatric cancer, was comparatively low-key. The hedge fund manager Steven Eisman, who rose to prominence in the financial crisis after betting against mortgages in the United States, made a gloomy argument about housing in Canada. David Einhorn, something of a rock star on Wall Street, spoke positively about Oil States International, a company that provides services to oil and gas companies - but he acknowledged that another investor, Barry Rosenstein, had stolen his thunder some days earlier by disclosing a stake in the company. And William A. Ackman, a hedge fund manager who has had his share of drama in recent months, gave a subdued presentation about Procter & Gamble, one of his biggest holdings.
MORE ERRORS IN CHECKS FOR HOMEOWNERS | "Three weeks after checks sent to homeowners as compensation for foreclosure abuses were rejected for insufficient funds, the consulting firm at the center of the mishap erred again: a fresh round of checks was written for the wrong amounts," Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. "In recent days, according to officials briefed on the matter, Rust Consulting issued nearly 100,000 checks for less than the homeowners were owed. The mistake potentially cheated consumers out of millions of dollars they were owed under a deal reached between the government and the nation's biggest banks."
Rust, which was ordered to fix its mistake, said in a statement that it had "corrected the error and plans to mail supplemental checks to affected borrowers as soon as May 17" and attributed the mistake to a "clerical error." But the developments put the company in another harsh spotlight. And some homeowners say the problem is broader than Rust has acknowledged.
TESLA'S DISAPPEARING DATA | In the past, Tesla Motors has regularly disclosed the number of reservations that existed for its cars at the end of each quarter, giving the public an idea of the demand for the vehicles. But on Wednesday, the company said it would no longer provide that data, saying it was "no longer a meaningful metric." The company's doubters "think there may not be that many buyers of Tesla's cars beyond the electric car enthusiasts who have swooped in early. As a result, an early surge in sales could soon wane, they argue," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "The skeptics may conclude that the decision to pull the reservation data is a sign that new orders aren't coming in at a strong rate."
ON THE AGENDA | The Carlyle Group reports earnings before the market opens. Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management is on Bloomberg TV at 11 a.m. Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors is on CNBC at 12:30 p.m.
DEBATING GOVERNANCE AT JPMORGAN | Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase have had plenty of outside input as they ponder whether to vote to strip Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, of his chairman role. Simon Johnson, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, writes on the Economix blog on Thursday that shareholders and the public would be well served by separating the roles. "JPMorgan Chase undoubtedly has a serious problem from a shareholder perspective that needs to be addressed through strengthening board oversight," he writes.
But all this criticism seems like a "Jamie Dimon lynch mob" to Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who writes in an essay in The New York Times: "I have studied corporate governance for 35 years, and I have come across no evidence to suggest that anything would be gained by separating those roles. While the model can work on occasion, it is surely no panacea that ensures good economic results or good governance."

HEADLINE: What Happens in Vegas for Hedge Funds

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The SALT hedge fund conference is an ideas conference, a Wall Street bacchanal and a power-networking event. It is also a place to absorb the musings of senior Wall Street money managers and Washington politicos. 

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS - The SALT hedge fund conference, held over four days at the Bellagio resort, is a lot of things - it's an ideas conference, a Wall Street bacchanal, a power-networking event.
It is also, with its vaunted lineup of speakers on stage in the hotel's grand ballroom, a place to absorb the musings of senior Wall Street money managers and Washington politicos. On Wednesday and Thursday, panelists weighed in on varied topics including the risks of situation in Syria and investment opportunities in the shipping industry.
 A keynote speaker at the conference was John Paulson, the billionaire manager who has recently absorbed steep losses across a number of his strategies. Mr. Paulson urged investors to have a long-term horizon and stick with hedge funds even through rough patches. "Don't focus on weekly or monthly returns," he said. 
Speakers at the SALT conference, unsurprisingly, did not focus on the mediocre investment performance of hedge funds. (Hedge fund averages have underperformed the broad stock market indexes over the last four years.) The industry's hefty fees were also, for the most part, a topic non grata. But in a panel on the evolution of hedge funds, Jane Buchan, chief executive of the Pacific Alternative Asset Management Company, expressed surprise that hedge fund fees continued to rise. "I keep waiting for fees to go down, but they're only going up," she said.
There was much focus on fixed-income trading strategies, which have been among the hottest hedge fund sectors. A panel on the mortgage securities included Joshua Birnbaum, the former Goldman Sachs trader at the center of the bank's hugely profitable and controversial negative bet on mortgages during the financial crisis. Mr. Birnbaum, now the chief investment officer of the hedge fund Tilden Park Capital Management, said that the market had gone through a fundamental change in how managers analyze mortgage-backed securities.
In the period after the financial crisis, Mr. Birnbaum said, investors were making money by blindly plowing money into deeply distressed mortgage securities.
"People were trading just on price and weren't even running prepayment or default vectors," he said."Today, the macro trade is not as good as it was, but on a micro level" - meaning selecting individual bonds - "there is a lot more to gain by things that you can analyze." 
On Thursday, a panel of stock pickers discussed their best ideas. Leon Cooperman, the chairman of Omega Advisors, promoted Monitise, a British electronic payments company. John Burbank, the chief investment officer of Passport Capital, said he liked Chinese Internet companies. Oscar Shafer, the chairman of Rivulet Capital, recommended Hertz, citing the consolidation in the rental car company.
In a session on the global economic environment, Michael Novogratz, the president of Fortress Investment Group, said that Japan was the world's most exciting place to invest, with the opportunity to make huge profits there. He also joked about the country's revolving-door leadership.
"I moved to Japan in 1992," Mr. Novogratz said. "I think they have had 25 prime ministers since then, and they all look alike and act alike and it's very difficult to tell one from the next."
He said that his outlook on the troubled euro zone remained grim. "I am optimistic about many things, but Europe is not one of them," said Mr. Novogratz, who, in a sea of dark suits, won the unofficial SALT fashion award with a snazzy all-white ensemble a la the author Tom Wolfe.
On Wednesday night, attendees put concerns about Washington gridlock and Wall Street regulation aside at a Latin-themed poolside fiesta.
Guests feasted on chile-infused Kobe beef tacos while tossing back tequila shots passed around by skimpily clad waitresses. Showgirls danced on podiums. Men lined up at the cigar station, where a man was making freshly rolled Dominican stogies.
Yet the conference center was filled up at 8 the next morning for a rollicking session featuring the Republican operative Karl Rove and former Representative Barney Frank debating policy. The panel's moderator asked whom they would like to see as the Federal Reserve's next chairman.
"Milton Friedman," Mr. Rove quickly responded. "But he's dead."

HEADLINE: Goldman's Cohn Can't Escape the 'Squid'

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, said Wall Street still faced a challenge in explaining its role in the lives of everyday people. 

 BODY:
Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, was sitting on stage at a conference in Manhattan on Thursday when the speaker introducing him cracked a joke. 
Perhaps Mr. Cohn could expound on "aquatic" topics, said Jeff Gooch, the chief executive of MarkitSERV, before an audience of financial professionals. (It was a reference, as Mr. Gooch confirmed later, to a Rolling Stone article in 2009 that called Goldman a "vampire squid.")
There was silence in the room. Mr. Cohn shifted in his seat. 
The comment, though lighthearted, was a reminder of the work that Goldman has been doing to rebuild trust in the wake of the financial crisis. Having been seen by many as a symbol of Wall Street greed, the firm has undertaken a public-relations recovery.
"The industry does have a challenge to try and get that ultimate client to understand better what services we provide, why they ultimately need us and where we come into play in their life," Mr. Cohn said during the "fireside chat," part of a conference on financial markets reform sponsored by the data provider Markit.
By "ultimate client," Mr. Cohn meant, for example, a worker with a pension, whose life is touched by Wall Street indirectly. 
The theme Mr. Cohn kept returning to was the primacy of clients. Asked what his daily routine looked like, his answer was simple.
"The most important thing I do is deal with clients, client situations and opportunities for the firm," he said.
Mr. Cohn, a former trader, also said he had become a "better listener."
Still, Mr. Cohn retains something of an edge. When his father asks him how the market is doing, Mr. Cohn sometimes responds, "Which one?" even though he knows it's unlikely his father would inquire about one of the many esoteric markets he works in, he said.
The crisis-era perception of Goldman apparently has not completely faded, judging by some of the comments at the gathering.
Kevin Gould, the president and co-founder of Markit, noted - pointedly - that Mr. Cohn was not wearing cufflinks.
"It's just a random shirt that I picked," Mr. Cohn explained. "Whatever the top of the pile was this morning."

HEADLINE: The Obligations of Obamacare Opponents

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Do supporters of &#8220;repeal and replace&#8221; have a moral duty to let Obamacare be implemented? 

 BODY:
While following the continuingdebate over the Oregon Medicaid study, I was struck by this passage from Aaron Carroll and Austrin Frakt's rejoinder to skeptics of Medicaid expansion:
... going forward, we certainly think it is reasonable to continue to discuss how Medicaid might evolve. That's fine. But, as we do so, we would hope that poor Americans would be afforded the greater access to the financial and mental and physical benefits of coverage for health care that Medicaid (in some form) would provide. We spend a great deal assisting wealthier Americans to do the same, through the preferential tax treatment of employer-sponsored plans, as well as through Medicare. All of that can and should be examined too. But by what reasonable moral calculus is it just to not extend medical financial assistance to the poor as we do so?
Let us be clear, we recognize that those who object to Medicaid expansion have also stated they want to assist the poor. They just have other ideas of how to do so. Fine. Our question is, which is stronger evidence that you want to help poor Americans, that you will support Medicaid expansion while inviting continued conversation about how to make the program more efficient and effective? Or by blocking expansion and offering alternatives, alternatives that will take well beyond 2014 to enact and implement, if they ever are? 
For, one way to justify doing nothing is to continually suggest something else.
These are reasonable questions to ask, and they raise issues that anyone to the right of center should be willing to wrestle with - especially anyone who combines doubts about Obamacare with skepticism about the Republican Party's willingness to offer policy alternatives. Frakt and Carroll's point about the existing system's bias toward comprehensive plans for the well-off is particularly well-taken, and it's precisely why I don't think it's just to reject or undermine the new health care law without being willing to offer an alternative. The fact that the G.O.P. isn't really offering such an alternative at the moment clearly makes the case for repeal weaker than it otherwise might be, and it makes the case for resistance weaker as well: If their own party can't find a way to unite around an Obamacare replacement, the Republican governors and legislatures fighting the Medicaid expansion will, indeed, probably just end up disadvantaging their own citizens while achieving nothing except delay.
All of this leaves right-of-center policy wonks in a morally complicated spot, perpetually aware (or hopefully perpetually aware) that their ideas are potentially just a fig leaf for a party that doesn't really want to support them, and an excuse for perpetuating an unfair status quo.
But even so I can't follow Frakt and Carroll all the way to their conclusion, because it "solves" this moral conundrum with a political and intellectual abdication. This is not some modest pilot program or experimental initiative that we're debating, after all: It's a massive reorganization of a hugely important sector of the American economy at a time when our economic and fiscal challenges are not exactly slight. And saying "if you agree there are unfairnesses in the current health care system, then you must agree to try out our $1 trillion program while we continue the debate" is just not a recipe for sound policymaking, no matter how dysfunctional the opposition party is at the moment.
That's because America rarely just "tries out" major expansions of the welfare state: Rather, our history strongly suggests that programs in motion tend to stay in motion, and that the best time to change a potentially-dysfunctional system is before it gets entrenched - before interest groups organize themselves around perpetuating those dysfunctions, before voters become accustomed to the program's guarantees, and before the political system learns to take its existence for granted and turns to other debates instead. Whereas once something becomes the Way We Redistribute, it's both hard to pare back and harder to propose alternatives, no matter what the data ultimately show about the program's actual effectiveness.
It's true, as Frakt and Carroll note, that no alternative reform is likely to be implemented as quickly as Obamacare itself. But it's also true that if you favor a substantially-different alternative, cheering on the law's full implementation while participating in a "conversation about how to make [it] more efficient and effective" is likely to lead to that alternative being passed sometime around the Fourth of Never. And this reality means, in turn, that for all the dilemmas that the current state of the Republican Party creates for thoughtful opponents of the new health care law, they still have an obligation to oppose.

HEADLINE: The Problem With Corporate Governance at JPMorgan Chase

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase shareholders have an opportunity to strength the company&#8217;s corporate governance, but whether they&#8217;ll take advantage is uncertain, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
Some proponents of the current American version of corporate capitalism contend that if there is a problem with the way our largest companies are run, shareholders will take care of it - by putting pressure on directors, sometimes voting them out. Shareholders are not supposed to replace chief executives directly but apply pressure to the board to improve oversight and produce management change when appropriate. 
In contrast, critics like to point out that owners - including small shareholders, pension funds and large mutual funds - seem unable to exercise even a modicum of control over many of today's larger corporations, particularly the largest financial institutions. 
The situation at JPMorgan Chase, in the run-up to its annual meeting on May 21, is an interesting test case with regard to two specific decisions: whether Jamie Dimon should continue to serve as both chief executive and chairman, and whether three members (David Cote, Ellen Futter and James Crown) of the risk committee of the board should be voted out.
Two proxy advisory firms - Glass, Lewis & Company and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. - have called for JPMorgan Chase shareholders to vote against the recommendations of management on both issues. Leading shareholders have apparently not yet made up their minds - and are being lobbied hard by supporters of Mr. Dimon to resist change. Mr. Dimon likes being chief executive and chairman and very much wants to keep things that way.

The interests of shareholders would be better served by following the advice of Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services. (Glass Lewis is also recommending that the three members of the board's audit committee be replaced; I support that suggestion.)
Changing board governance is not a panacea at any company. An independent chairman can be an effective constraint on a chief executive, but many chairmen lack the stature or experience to play that role. And the risk committee of a big bank will always be constrained by the knowledge and ability of board members, very few of whom understand the risks in large financial institutions today. (There is a process of certifying that board members have relevant expertise; it is meaningless.)
Still, JPMorgan Chase undoubtedly has a serious problem from a shareholder perspective that needs to be addressed through strengthening board oversight.
Exhibit A in this discussion is the recent report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the chairman, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, its ranking minority member, into the so-called London Whale trades that lost more than $6 billion. This report finds repeated failures in risk management at the highest levels within the company. 
As Senator McCain put it (see the second statement): 
JPMorgan executives ignored a series of alarms that went off as the bank's Chief Investment Office breached one risk limit after another. Rather than ratchet back the risk, JPMorgan personnel challenged and re-engineered the risk controls to silence the alarms.
The report itself is more than 300 pages and the exhibits run around 500 pages. For a concise statement of the core issues, I recommend this analysis by Bart Naylor of Public Citizen focusing on Exhibit 46 and explaining how JPMorgan Chase executives were gaming regulatory constraints to drive up their stock price (and presumably bonuses). 
Specifically, the bank's senior management changed how they calculated the risk of their positions so that they could reduce the amount of equity funding they needed. This allowed them to increase their leverage (borrowing relative to assets) as well as their risk - without this risk actually showing up in a report. 
Mr. Dimon says he did not know this was going on, but even his denial is a concession that his management system completely broke down. 
JPMorgan Chase's policy, as stated to shareholders in its annual report, required risk limits to be taken seriously, with senior management responsible for signing off on high-level model changes. It is not unreasonable for shareholders to expect Mr. Dimon himself would take these risk limits seriously. And where was board oversight in this entire process?
For further detail, you can read the summary opening statement by Senator Levin (the first statement on the subcommittee's Web page). Or try this somewhat more colorful and even emotional assessment by Matt Levine, a commentator who does not usually agree with people like Senator Levin, Mr. Naylor, and me that very large banks can pose serious danger to society (caution: Mr. Levine's language is not suitable for family members too young to have a brokerage account). 
Or, if you are a JPMorgan Chase shareholder, read the full report - or at least the executive summary. And wonder about whether a handful of traders and one inexperienced risk officer (with questionable authority) can effectively oversee a complex derivatives portfolio that grew tenfold over a period of months (with a notional value eventually in the trillions of dollars). How can a member of the board's risk committee without financial services expertise possibly spot the risks and ensure management is keeping the bank out of trouble?
Senator McCain makes the link to the important broader policy issue on Page 3 in his opening statement: 
This bank appears to have entertained - indeed, embraced - the idea that it was quote "too big to fail." In fact, with regard to how it managed the derivatives that are the subject of today's hearing, it seems to have developed a business model based on that notion.
Whether shareholders should be bothered by a firm's being too big to fail is an interesting question. If this status purely confers a subsidy - in the form of taxpayer support when things go badly - then we should expect shareholders to be quite excited by the prospect.
Unfortunately for shareholders, the JPMorgan Chase case demonstrates that the distortion of incentives also means it is much harder to control what goes on at a large complex financial company. From 2000 through the end of 2012, the stock was down 15 percent; midsize banks have done much better over this time period. You can call this "too big to manage," but it is more likely that executives and traders on the inside are doing well, so it is really outsiders (e.g., shareholders, as well as taxpayers) who are doing badly.
The London Whale losses did not bring down the company, but shareholders still have cause to want change. When planes almost collide at an airport, we do not say, "there was no actual accident, so that means the system works well." Instead, our reaction is along the lines of, "What went wrong?" and "How can we prevent this from happening again?"
But at JPMorgan Chase, it is business as usual, despite reports of further regulatory investigations into other areas of the bank, including whether it helped manipulate interest rates and commodities prices and whether it was honest with shareholders and regulators about the London Whale big bets on derivatives. 
What is likely to happen on or before May 21? Large shareholders will not want to rock the boat, and the prospect of continuing too-big-to-fail subsidies is too alluring. Mr. Dimon and his board will get another chance. 
That will be good news for Mr. Dimon and his directors, but bad news for the rest of us, again. And JPMorgan Chase's shareholders will likely not do so well, once more.

HEADLINE: The Latest G.O.P. Temper Tantrum

BYLINE: ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Republican senators boycotted the vote for the president&#8217;s E.P.A. nominee. 

 BODY:
Moments before a scheduled vote on Thursday on the nomination of Gina McCarthy to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Republican members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee announced a boycott. One result was to delay her confirmation, which still seems virtually certain since Democrats control the committee as well as the full Senate. The other result was to make the Republicans look not only vindictive but supremely childish. 
Their stated reason for the boycott was that Ms. McCarthy, who had already been bombarded in earlier hearings with 1,079 questions, spoken and written, had not sufficiently answered what Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican and ringleader of the group, called 5 important "transparency requests." What was really transparent was the Republicans' true motive. They detest E.P.A. and the regulatory authority it possesses (authority granted to it, by the way, by Congress) to clean up the air and water and, in general, take steps to safeguard public health. The transparency issue was merely cover for deep-seated ideological objections to the agency's basic mission.

A case in point was the request that the agency undertake "whole economy" cost-benefits analysis of its rules and regulations. Ms. McCarthy had earlier replied that the agency already conducts detailed, peer-reviewed analyses of those rules. So what more do Mr. Vitter and his colleagues expect? They want the agency to superimpose on its own reviews an industry-friendly cost-benefit model that - in addition to adding new layers of bureaucratic red tape - could also lead to weaker regulation. Their other requests would impose similarly time-consuming and non-essential burdens.
Few people saw this boycott coming, In fact, the questioning of Ms. McCarthy when she recently appeared before the committee was gentle, even pro-forma. What happened? One line of reasoning is that a couple of true Tea Partiers - Marco Rubio and Rand Paul - have lately been raising loud objections to Ms. McCarthy's aggressive (and thoroughly proper) use of Clean Air Act to impose tough new regulations on mercury and other emissions from power plants - and that Republicans on the committee have felt obliged to knuckle under.
In any case, the Senate Republicans are now beginning to act and sound just like the House Republicans who have spent the last two years trying to undermine the E.P.A. at every turn. What's truly dumb about this charade is that Ms. McCarthy is not an ideologue. She is tough, she believes deeply in the country's basic environmental statutes. But she is also known as a good listener and negotiator, has served with distinction in key environmental posts in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and, more to the point, has broad backing among mainstream Republicans - the sort of Republicans who no longer exist in the House and, it appears, are headed swiftly for extinction in the Senate.

HEADLINE: In Malaysia's Election, a Free Press Was Elusive

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: Limits on a free press in Malaysia undercut the nation&#8217;s claims to have held a free and fair election, critics say. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - American presidents have built-in advantages when running for re-election. Corporations and other interest groups tend to give financially to their cause to stay in the good graces of the leadership. The president enjoys the bully pulpit that comes with being in the White House. Throw a healthy economy into the mix, and it's an almost unbeatable combination.
Some of the same could be said halfway around the world in Malaysia, except the leadership there enjoys even more pronounced advantages that helped propel it to victory Sunday: control over an economy that is riding a wave of economic prosperity with a growth rate of over 5 percent last year, the government's perceived influence over some of the most influential media outlets - and a willingness to act against those that don't fall into line. 
In the run-up to Sunday's voting, there were numerous allegations that Web sites giving voice to the opposition were the victim of cyberattacks. According to the group Human Rights Watch, one online site that is critical of the government, Malaysiakini, could not be accessed from within Malaysia in the two weeks leading to the elections, or readers experienced significant slowdowns while accessing the site.
The group also said that at least three other sites - Radio Free Malaysia, Radio Free Sarawak and Sarawak Report - experienced what appeared to have been cyberattacks in which the sites were overwhelmed with traffic, curtailing access for nearly a week before the election.
There is no conclusive evidence that the government or its supporters were behind such disruptions, but the timing and targets naturally raise questions. As Human Rights Watch noted, Radio Free Sarawak and the Sarawak Report "frequently report on government corruption and criticize government policies affecting rural residents." The group said the government was obligated to prevent such attacks from happening to assure free elections.
While Sunday's election kept the governing National Front coalition in power, it was left with a weakened majority in Parliament. Since then, the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, has said the elections were marred by fraud and that his coalition would challenge the results of some races, my colleague Joe Cochrane reports.
But the Malaysian authorities have been cracking down on members of the opposition who are raising such issues. As the Brisbane Times reports, the police this week arrested two bloggers, one of whom tweeted a claim that the police were protecting phantom voters in contested election districts.
"We will continue monitoring social media and we will not rest until those who circulate racial postings online are detained," said Syed Ismail, the director of the Commercial Crime Investigation Department. "Anyone who tries to instill hate and compromise public safety will face the music."
The government has reason to be defensive: the rise of social media in Malaysia was viewed as one of the primary reasons why the National Front and the incumbent prime minister, Najib Razak, have struggled to retain control over the country. The social media have allowed Malaysians access to news reporting outside government control and influence.
On Thursday, Western news outlets highlighted reports about a Wednesday night rally that drew tens of thousands to hear Mr. Anwar, the opposition leader, accuse the Malaysian government of having "stolen the election." But on the Web site of the New Straits Times, Malaysia's most influential newspaper and one viewed as regularly toeing the government line, the election stories that were highlighted were "Accept the People's Verdict, Says Azmin," "White House Congratulates Malaysia on Election" and "Call to Accept the Election Outcome."

HEADLINE: Soccer Coach's Departure Trumps British News

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The retirement of the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, after a quarter-century reign, is the number one talking point in Britain this week and has prompted tributes from the country&#8217;s top politicians. 

 BODY:
LONDON - In a week that saw the state opening of Parliament and an intensified debate over membership in the European Union, another news item dominated Thursday's headlines in Britain - the retirement of a veteran soccer coach.
He is not just any soccer coach. He is Sir Alex Ferguson, an irascible Scot whose 26-year reign at Manchester United secured the English club's position as one of the world's most successful and popular teams. 
If you are not a soccer fan, you may have missed Jack Bell's articles at The Goal blog, in which Andy Roxburgh, the New York Red Bulls sporting director, praises the leadership qualities of his former teammate. Jack also reports on the feverish speculation about possible successors to fill the 71-year-old's oversized boots.
But this is about more than soccer. It is about who will lead what has become a $3 billion global brand, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange and has an official fan base in more than 200 countries.
As English fans like to say, soccer is not a matter of life and death; it's more important than that.
My colleague Sam Borden writes that tributes have been flowing in from far beyond Britain for the man who went to United in 1986 when the club that was struggling for a foothold in England, let alone the global stage.
"Ferguson's style - intense, irascible, determined and single-minded - was not always popular with players (who might be dropped from the lineup before a big game)," Sam writes, "or the news media (who often were chastised for asking questions), but his results were undeniable."
British television viewers have become accustomed to deciphering Ferguson's cryptic comments on the game, delivered in the broad working-class brogue of his native Glasgow.
Since he announced his retirement on Wednesday, "Fergie" has been described as a Renaissance man, as comfortable in the company of politicians as among his players in the locker room.
"He also seems to be very well-connected and know everyone in the world of politics, horse racing, sport and wine," according to Angus Deayton, a television presenter and Manchester United fan.
Prime Minister David Cameron posted his congratulations on Twitter, along with the hope that Ferguson's departure would help the club he supports, Aston Villa.
Sir Alex Ferguson's achievement at #MUFC has been exceptional. Hopefully his retirement will make life a little easier for my team #AVFC
- David Cameron (@David_Cameron)8 May 13
Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party of which Ferguson was a lifelong supporter, posted, "Proud man. Great manager. Staunch Labour Party supporter. Sir Alex Ferguson will never be forgotten."
In a list of things that "not everybody knows," the BBC reported that Ferguson had once run a pub, had started his working life as a toolmaker and served as a labor union official.
He once revealed that he had a fascination for American politics and the assassination of John F. Kennedy and that he kept a copy of the late President's autopsy report at his bedside.
Ferguson is associated with coining a string of soccer slang terms, including "hairdryer treatment" to describe the way he dealt with wayward players and sports journalists.
"Players talk of the moment a switch is flicked in Fergie's head, he presses his face close to you and emits a terrifying torrent of abuse," according to the BBC.
His description of the final tense moments of a match as "squeaky-bum time" entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2005.
After a career in which he was described as possibly the greatest soccer manager of all time, the impact of his departure went beyond the sporting world.
When the news of his retirement hit the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Manchester United dipped by as much 4.5 percent.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
President Obama's reputation and Democratic hopes to put Hillary Rodham Clinton in the White House in 2016 are "hanging in the balance" after a veteran diplomat said he was demoted in Libya for challenging the Obama administration's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in Benghazi and its version of events, Scott Shane, Jeremy W. Peters and Eric Schmitt write.
 

        
Seeking to change a military court system that has unsuccessfully relied on commanders to handle allegations of sexual assault in the military, Senator Kirsten E. Gillebrand, Democrat of New York, is set to introduce legislation that would give military prosecutors more power to prosecute the cases, a move that is certain to ruffle feathers at the Pentagon, Jennifer Steinhauer writes.

        
Economists believe Washington's obsession with reducing the federal deficit via austerity measures is a drag on the economic recovery, undermining growth and driving up unemployment, Jackie Calmes and Jonathan Weisman report.

        
The credibility of a study critical of the immigration overhaul proposed in the Senate is in question after it surfaced that one of the co-authors asserted in 2009 that Hispanics have a lower I.Q. than whites, Ashley Parker and Julia Preston write.

        
Facing the possibility that President Obama could approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, opponents of the project are pushing for a tradeoff, like stronger policies on energy and climate change, John M. Broder writes.
 Happening in Washington: 

        
Economic data expected Thursday include employment data for April and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by wholesale trade inventories for March and weekly mortgage rates.

        
The House Committee on Homeland Security will hold a hearing on the Boston bombings at 9 a.m.

        
At 9:15 a.m., the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works will meet to consider the nomination of Gina McCarthy to be the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

        
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Srikanth Srinivasan's nomination to be a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington during a meeting at 10 a.m.

        
At the same time, a subpanel of the Senate Committee on Appropriations will consider the Department of Agriculture's 2014 budget proposal with testimony from Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, and the agency's budget officer and inspector general.

        
At 10 a.m., families of members of the Navy's SEAL Team 6 and military experts will talk about the government's roles in the deadly helicopter crash that followed the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.

        
At 8 a.m., Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is set to meet with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who introduced a bill to help sexual assault victims in the military.

HEADLINE: Separated by Age and by Continent, but United by Spirit to Survive

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com; Twitter: @jimdwyernyt

 BODY:
The two men grew up on separate continents, speaking their own languages. One was not yet 20; the other was bearing down on 100.
Yet within half an hour of meeting each other this week for the first time, Henry Kabiyona and Sol Rosenkranz knew each other's stories before the words reached their lips.
First, Henry. 
Rwanda, 1994.
The Kabiyona family tries but cannot outrun a genocide of Tutsi people: the Hutu government has ordered 500,000 machetes to butcher them.
The family is gathered in its dining room with relatives to pool and divide food before dispersing into the countryside, when the Hutu paramilitarists, known as the Interahamwe, burst into the house. They kill every last man, woman and child they find.
But not twin baby boys, age 9 months.
''They said, 'Don't kill those two kids, it's a curse to kill twins, and they will not have not have food anyway or anyone to take care of them,' '' Mr. Kabiyona, 19, said.
Mr. Rosenkranz, 95, broke in, recognizing the tactic.
''So they will die anyway,'' he said.
Mr. Kabyiona nodded. ''No one to feed them,'' he added. ''They will not have anything. They say, 'They will die of hunger.' ''
And yet, they didn't.
One of them became Henry Kabiyona, tall, gentlemanly, a student of history, economics and geography.
On Wednesday, he sat over lunch with Mr. Rosenkranz, a Polish Jew who survived Hitler's genocide. They were one of five such pairs, of youth and age, African and European, who met at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in Lower Manhattan. All had been early in their journeys when they escaped organized extermination.
They swapped stories not of death, but of keeping on.
Originally from Krosniewice in Poland, Mr. Rosenkranz spent time in six concentration camps -- two each in Poland, Germany and Czechoslovakia. At one point he organized an escape; on recapture, four of the six people in his family died in Birkenau. He and one brother were sent away and survived.
How?
''I don't know how,'' Mr. Rosenkranz said. ''Luck. Faith. Perseverance.''
''Luck,'' Mr. Kabiyona said.
''We were days marching on the road, without a crumb, without a drop of water,'' Mr. Rosenkranz said.
''No drinks a'tall,'' Mr. Kabiyona said.
How did the Kabiyona twins make it?
''I don't know how I survived,'' Mr. Kabiyona said.
After the slaughter, a grandmother arrived at their home, but saw no sign of the babies or another member of the household, Mr. Kabiyona explained: ''She didn't find our house girl with the dead bodies.'' The housekeeper, Sharamanzi, had hidden during the killings, then run off with the babies. In time, they went to the grandmother.
Henry and his brother, Eric, live in Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village in rural Rwanda, with about 500 others orphaned since 1994. Genocide, a civil war, AIDs and poverty have culled so many adults that 1.2 million Rwandans -- about 15 percent of the population -- are orphans, according to the Rwandan government.
Agahozo Shalom was created by Anne Heyman, who was raised in South Africa and worked in New York as an assistant district attorney, after she heard Rwanda described in a 2005 lecture as being bereft of hope because there was no systematic way to take care of orphans. ''It popped out of my head: they should build youth villages,'' Ms. Heyman said.
After World War II, Israel absorbed tens of thousands of children who were orphaned by the Holocaust and war, and set up youth villages as a way to nurture and educate them.
''There was a systematic way to take care of orphans,'' Ms. Heyman said. She researched the practices in those villages, raised money, won the support of the Rwandan government, acquired 144 acres and built small houses. Since December 2008, the village has accepted 125 boys and girls per year, without regard to ethnicity, religion, health status or educational aptitude. They raise a little more than a third of their own food, and they study.
Henry, Eric, and three other residents of the village -- Pascaline Niyigena, Yvonne Uwamahoro and Afra Uwase A Benie -- came to New York to help raise money for the village. But they also made time to visit the Holocaust survivors, who, besides Mr. Rosenkranz, included Toby Levy, Sally Frishberg, Fanya Gottesfield Heller and Leon Gleicher.
They all seemed mightily impressed with one another: describing their pasts, but talking about what was ahead. ''Henry has a tremendous future,'' Mr. Rosenkranz said. ''All he has to do is persevere. And not lose faith.''

HEADLINE: Karzai Says U.S. Bases Can Stay, Raising Some Eyebrows in West

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROSENBERG; Sharifullah Sahak contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghanistan is ready to let the United States and its allies keep military bases here after the end of the NATO combat mission next year, President Hamid Karzai said on Thursday, offering a concrete public signal that foreign troops would remain welcome in the coming years.
The United States and Afghanistan are negotiating a security agreement that would allow American forces to stay here beyond the end of 2014, and Mr. Karzai said the Obama administration had asked for nine bases spread across the country. 
''We agree to give them these bases,'' Mr. Karzai told students during a speech at Kabul University. ''We consider our relations with the United States beyond 2014 to be positive for Afghanistan.''
The American reaction, though, was far less positive than one would expect. Officials characterized Mr. Karzai's comments as premature at best, and said they appeared to reflect the Afghan government's desire for a larger force than the United States is likely to be willing to commit.
The Obama administration has yet to decide how large a force it would like to keep in Afghanistan, but administration officials have signaled that it is unlikely to total more than 10,000 service members. They said it was more important now to hash out a range of issues, like whether American troops would continue to have legal immunity in Afghanistan after next year, than to talk about the specifics of where troops would be based.
The American officials also stressed that no matter the final number of troops, the United States envisions using Afghan bases -- not its own -- to house its forces.
''As President Obama has made clear, we do not seek permanent military bases in Afghanistan,'' the American Embassy said in a statement. Any deal would ''address access to, and use of, Afghan facilities by U.S. forces.''
Still, the officials seemed relieved that the comments were generally positive, especially in light of more recent statements from Mr. Karzai, like his suggestion -- weeks after demanding that Special Operations forces leave an entire province -- that both the American-led coalition and the Taliban were working to destabilize the government.
The United States, for its part, has unleashed its share of public salvos. In January, days before Mr. Karzai was to visit Washington, administration officials said that one option after 2014 was simply to leave no American forces in Afghanistan -- a move that some officials worry would leave the government unable to contain the Taliban.
Yet even as the discussion has heated and cooled, officials in Kabul and Washington have repeatedly stressed that both sides want a deal and a post-2014 troop presence, even if no one can yet say what it would look like.
Mr. Karzai offered a glimpse of his thinking in his speech on Thursday at Kabul University, saying he was ready to agree to American bases in Kabul and Kandahar, the country's two biggest cities, and at Bagram, north of Kabul, the current site of one of the largest coalition bases in Afghanistan.
He also said the United States wanted two bases in Herat Province, which borders Iran, and others in the north, east and south of Afghanistan.
At the same time, Mr. Karzai said he wanted more clarity from Western countries and from NATO as a whole about what they planned to contribute to Afghanistan after next year.
So far, Germany, which has more than 4,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, is the only major NATO member to have made a firm offer of troops after 2014. It said last month that it was prepared to keep 600 to 800 soldiers here until 2017 to train Afghan forces.
''At first, they said that they are all leaving in 2014, and now every one of them is coming one by one and saying, 'We are not leaving,' '' Mr. Karzai said.
''We know that they are not leaving, and so we are insisting that we have our own words with them,'' he said, adding that he wanted an overall agreement with NATO in addition to any agreements with individual countries.
He also laid out conditions for the United States and its allies. ''America should strengthen their efforts to bring peace, fundamentally strengthen the security forces of Afghanistan, should give us strong support in strengthening the economy of Afghanistan and rebuild our economic foundations, such as dams, electricity, roads,'' he said.
The conditions, said American and NATO officials in Kabul, were basically what the West has been trying to accomplish through billions in development aid over the past 12 years.
Officials said that aid would continue, although the amounts given were likely to be reduced over time. And the Afghan government would have to live up to its commitments to battle corruption and run a more open government for the aid to keep flowing.
Mr. Karzai did not address those issues in his speech. But he did highlight financial pledges he recently secured on a trip to Europe. He said Finland, where he signed a partnership deal, had agreed to provide $30 million in aid each year, though he did not say for how long.
Denmark, meanwhile, has agreed to give Afghanistan $100 million over the coming five years and more aid in the 10 years after that, he said.

HEADLINE: Started At the Bottom

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Not long ago, I devoted a column to the mostly upper-middle-class students at elite universities -- the empirical kids. I thought it would be interesting to devote a column to students who at least started at the other end of the social scale. So the Times researcher Anne Snyder and I interviewed a bunch of young people whom we had met earlier through the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.
Edgar Leon's background was pretty typical. Both of his parents immigrated from Mexico. His mom does janitorial work in Chicago, while his dad commuted to Indiana to fix railroad lines. 
These young people have been shaped by their awesome life trajectories, from poor neighborhoods, to college, to internships on Capitol Hill. Cristi Privado is the last of seven children and the only one to graduate from high school. Kimberly Lopez has a brother and a sister who dropped out of school in the 9th and 10th grades. Her sister got pregnant at 16. ''I got lucky,'' Kimberly explained.
None of them had pressuring parents who organized their children's lives for success. ''College was more of an encouragement in my home, less a given,'' Edgar recalled.
Almost all of them experienced a life-altering move when they were teenagers. Reuben Kapp benefited from a school choice program that enabled him to move from an urban Michigan high school to a suburban one. ''I'm a big believer in school choice,'' he said. ''If it wasn't for choice, I wouldn't be here.'' Cristi's parents took her from a poorly performing middle school and moved to Greenville, S.C. At her new school there, she fell in with the smart kids. She developed a taste for country music. She ended up as class president.
She was not babied in school. ''Until I got to D.C., I never heard the word mentor. When I got here, it seemed that everybody has one,'' Cristi joked.
Like several of the others, she was discouraged from applying to a competitive college. Cristi said her guidance counselor mentioned that her own son had been rejected by Clemson so Cristi shouldn't apply. ''That made me definitely want to apply.''
In college and at internships, they found a new world. ''My mom and dad always worked the third shift. It dawned on me that some people leave work at 5 p.m.,'' Edgar remembered.
Edgar lived at home while going to DePaul, commuting 45 minutes each way. ''I was just going to class and going to work,'' he noted, uncomplainingly. Cristi's father died a month before graduation. She had to finish the term through her grief.
Most of the students had some trouble gelling with the whiter, richer student body in college and hung out mostly with fellow Hispanics. ''We love our culture,'' said Reuben. ''That's what makes our group stronger and bonds us together.'' Now they seem to flow fluidly across cultural lines.
We met them as they were finishing a stint as Congressional staffers, often answering the phones and hearing the public rage about everything from the sequester to immigration reform.
All of them have experienced culture shock in coming to Washington. Kimberly observed, ''I feel that here people will do whatever it takes to get to the top. It was really overwhelming at the beginning. Are they being sincere? I could never tell.'' Edgar echoed that: ''Everyone is on a mission. People are all about networking. How can we use each other to get what we want? Maybe there's a lack of genuineness?''
Still, most wanted to stay in politics. As Kimberly put it: ''I really want to go back to Delaware and seek elective office, whether it is local office or national office. To be president would be really cool.''
The economy has been bad during their adult lives, but they've been shooting upward. Anne Snyder and I both came away with the impression that they have fewer anxieties than the more affluent students or empirical kids, less of a fear that one false move can lead to disaster.
They seemed both hardy and a bit naïve, made more resilient by reality but not jaded by it. Their conversational styles were enthusiastic, grateful, direct and earnest. They seemed to us unself-conscious about how they present themselves -- unironic, matter of fact, sincere and un-meta -- not tripping in loops of self-awareness. They also have a less methodical sense of the exact steps you have to take to make it in the world.
Their ambitions were perpetually sandwiched by their affections. ''I know people who move across the country for a job. They see their family once or twice a year. I could never do that,'' Kimberly remarked.
Without even being asked, almost all of them burst into rhapsodies about their country. ''I love the United States,'' Reuben explained. ''I have a lot of pride in the United States. I'm not a hockey fan, but when the American team is playing I go crazy.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Wants Voters to Decide on Full-Scale Casinos

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Offering up some details on a promised plan for legalizing full-scale casinos in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Thursday he would push for a statewide voter referendum this fall, despite uncertain electoral prospects, while also suggesting that his patience had worn thin with some gaming-friendly Indian tribes upstate.
Mr. Cuomo has made expanding gambling a central part of his economic plans, particularly for upstate New York, envisioning seven Las Vegas-style casinos with table games like craps, high-end hotels, and the endless buffets that fuel avid gamblers. Mr. Cuomo has insisted that the first three resorts be outside the New York City area though the exact locations proposed for those casinos are still not known. 
On Thursday, however, Mr. Cuomo defined six upstate regions that could compete for them, including two areas where local Indian tribes have disputed exclusivity compacts with the state involving gambling.
In particular, Mr. Cuomo cited the Seneca Nation, which he said has been withholding some $500 million owed the state from its casinos because of a disagreement over expanded slot-machine gambling at racetracks inside their exclusive region. That includes a swath of western New York. Another tribe, the St. Regis Mohawks on the New York-Canadian border, also had ''a contract that was not in good standing,'' according to Mr. Cuomo.
And while Mr. Cuomo said that his administration would honor the exclusivity deals if pacts could be reached with the tribes over those disputes, he added that time for such negotiations seemed to be running out.
''The answer at some point is either yes or no,'' he said.
That answer did not seem to be forthcoming on Thursday. Susan Asquith, a spokeswoman for the Senecas, said the tribe was prohibited from speaking on issues regarding proposed gambling in their region because of legal proceedings involving the state. David Staddon, a St. Regis Mohawk Tribe spokesman, said his council did not ''have sufficient time to review the issue'' and make a comment.
Mr. Cuomo seemed to offer a little more leeway for the Oneida Indian Nation, which runs the popular Turning Stone resort in central New York, suggesting that the Oneidas could negotiate to acquire exclusive rights in that region, which includes big cities like Syracuse. Ray Halbritter, the Oneida Nation representative, did not comment on that issue, but said the tribe respected Mr. Cuomo's grasp of ''the complexities of the issues.''
At a news conference, the governor gave details on who would pick the casino locations, proposing a selection commission of real estate and finance professionals. He did not say who would choose the committee, but said it would not be the Legislature. ''We do not want a politically determined outcome,'' he said.
That hope -- no politics -- may be a long shot. Amending the State Constitution this year to allow for the legalization of full-scale casinos would require both houses of the Legislature to pass bills this session -- both did last year, as well -- followed by voter approval in November. Last week, Mr. Cuomo suggested that the voter referendum might be delayed until 2014 to capitalize on enthusiasm for casinos from upstate voters and turnout for the governor's race.
On Thursday, however, he said he was willing to take a chance on voters in the fall. ''The problem of pushing it off a year is you're pushing it off a year,'' he said. ''We need jobs in upstate New York, and economic activity in upstate New York, like we need oxygen.''
Polls have been mixed on the outlook for casinos. In April, the Siena Research Institute reported that 49 percent of voters approved of non-Indian casinos, with 44 percent opposed. But there is less support in New York City, where turnout this fall could be high because of a mayoral race. The governor said his argument to city voters would focus on new money for education that casino revenue would provide, even if no casinos would initially be in the city. Likewise, Mr. Cuomo said he would ask upstate legislators to focus on education funds and the potential for new jobs for New Yorkers, even if there was no guarantee that a casino would land in a particular district.
The Legislature's regular session runs until late June, though other issues also demand attention, like campaign finance and election reform. If the casino bills were passed, a statewide campaign, which the governor said he would be active in, would follow. For his money, Mr. Cuomo believes that New Yorkers want to gamble, if only because -- as he notes -- they already are.
''It's not a question of should we have gaming or should we not have gaming,'' said Mr. Cuomo, referring to racinos and other gambling outlets already operating in the state. ''The question really is should we recognize the reality of our situation and fully participate?''

HEADLINE: A New Kind of Audience For a Retired Braves Star

BYLINE: By MIKE TIERNEY

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Before Chipper Jones stepped up, the traditional chant accompanying the tomahawk chop at Atlanta Braves games broke out.
The opening notes of his signature song, Ozzy Osbourne's ''Crazy Train,'' blasted through the speakers.
But this time, Jones was stepping up not to the plate, but to a microphone at Emory University. Admittedly not much for speechmaking and on the unfamiliar terrain of a college campus, he was nonetheless a hit as guest speaker Thursday at Emory's Class Day, a prelude to commencement exercises Monday. 
Newly retired after two decades with the Braves, Jones recently attended his first Masters golf tournament, played at exclusive Augusta National and was grand marshal of the Nascar race at Talladega Superspeedway, where his message -- ''Start your engines'' -- could not have been more succinct.
Now Jones can check the box for addressing an audience ''a lot smarter than I am,'' as he put it Thursday. Though he had committed to the University of Miami, Jones went to the minor leagues from high school without stopping to take freshman standards like Economics 101 or Introduction to Shakespeare.
Jones, 41, recalled for the graduating class how he targeted big league ballplayer as a career in his youth and maintained his focus to make it happen. The ride, he told the students, was not always smooth, although it ended with 468 home runs and a .303 career batting average.
''I came into quite a bit of fame and money at an early age,'' he said before alluding partly to a well-chronicled case of infidelity that led to a divorce. ''Quite frankly, I didn't handle it all that well.''
Jones added: ''One of the ways to make people forgive you is stand up like a man, admit your mistakes and move forward. People are going to respect you a lot more when you own up to the mistakes you made.''
He said the rock-star-like lifestyle in his first few seasons ''was awesome.'' He followed with a serious postscript: ''It came back to haunt me.''
Sounding on occasion much like a commencement speaker, he urged students to take their jobs seriously and, citing his charitable foundation, to give back to their communities.
Jones fell into a line of eclectic speakers at Emory since Class Day was established in 2003. Among the speakers have been actors (Mia Farrow, Danny Glover), a science guy (Bill Nye), a furry creature (the fellow beneath the Big Bird costume on ''Sesame Street'') and another athlete of some renown (Peyton Manning).
Bukie Adebo, chairwoman of the student committee that selected Jones, a perennial tormentor of the Mets, said there was no opposition, even though 15 percent of the Class of 2013 was from New York state.
When she dispatched an e-mail disclosing the choice of Jones to the seniors, the first response was from a New Yorker who wrote, '' 'This is awesome -- way better than anybody else being considered,' '' Adebo said.
Jones offered seven reasons -- the number of knee operations he had, along with wrist and ankle operations -- for not second-guessing his decision to retire. ''I'm a little tired of them cutting me up and fixing me,'' he said.
In an interview afterward, Jones left open the possibility of returning to baseball in administration, coaching or broadcasting, ''but that is still a ways away,'' he said.
''Quite frankly, I'm still a little tired of the lifestyle, living out of a suitcase,'' he added.
He has not cut ties altogether, having swung by the Braves' spring training camp as a hitting instructor. He recently offered pointers to his slump-ridden friend Adam LaRoche of Washington -- just before a Nationals series in Atlanta, to the consternation of some Braves fans.
And he has watched enough baseball on television to be wowed by Mets pitcher Matt Harvey, who ''reminds me of Rocket,'' Jones said, referring to Roger Clemens.
Addressing a sizable crowd was practice for a significant speech Jones may deliver in 2018. That year, he is eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

HEADLINE: House Vote on Debt Ceiling Gives Priority to Creditors

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House voted Thursday to allow the Treasury to continue to make payments to foreign and domestic federal creditors and Social Security recipients in the event of a stalemate over the government's statutory borrowing limit, digging in for another debt ceiling standoff, which is looming in the fall.
The legislation, which passed 221 to 207, would allow limited borrowing to make payments to federal bondholders, then Social Security recipients, even if the Treasury is prohibited from borrowing to finance the rest of the government. No Democrats voted for it, and eight Republicans were opposed. 
Republicans said the measure effectively took the threat of a government default off the table if the debt ceiling was breached. But opponents said the bill was unworkable and would do nothing to stave off a messy default and economic chaos once the Treasury exhausted its payment options early this fall. The bill is unlikely to get a hearing in the Senate, and President Obama has promised a veto.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, called it ''so shallow'' that it would fail an eighth-grade model government class.
House Republicans used the bill to signal that for the third time since taking control in 2011, they would try to extract major concessions on fiscal policy from the president before they were willing to raise the government's borrowing authority.
''We're not in any different position than we were two years ago,'' Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio told reporters Thursday. ''We continue to spend more money than we bring in. You can't continue to do this.''
The bill, called the ''Pay China First Act'' by Democratic opponents, signaled an end to a truce in Washington's budget wars that ensued after Republicans and Democrats agreed in January to allow taxes to rise mainly on affluent households, then let $85 billion in across-the-board spending cuts take effect in March. Amid those steps, Congress temporarily set aside the government's borrowing limit, but the statutory $16.4 trillion debt ceiling comes back into force May 19, at which time the government's debt will actually already exceed that number.
Because of higher-than-expected tax receipts and large payments from the federally controlled housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, lawmakers in both parties say that Treasury officials believe they can shuffle money within accounts to avoid any more borrowing until the fall.
That schedule sets up what lawmakers in both parties see as another conflagration approaching on Sept. 30, when the government would run out of money to operate and the Treasury would near the exhaustion of its borrowing options.
House and Senate appropriations committees have begun work on 12 annual spending bills, but House Republicans will set total spending in those bills at $967 billion, expecting the automatic spending cuts known as sequestration to continue. Senate Democrats are expected to use the spending cap of $1.058 trillion established in the first debt ceiling fight, in 2011. House Republican aides concede that a majority of House members might not be able to accept the cuts to domestic programs that would be needed to stay within the Republican limit.
The brewing standoff could be resolved with a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement, but so far House and Senate Republican leaders have refused to even convene a formal negotiating conference to resolve the vast differences between the budget blueprints passed by the Senate and the House.
''We should be talking about the budget in general and how we can get to conference and what we need to do to compromise,'' said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. ''They're over there debating how we're going to create the next crisis that this country is going to have to face down.''
With little real negotiations going on, Democrats accused House Republicans of preparing for disaster. Representative Dan Maffei, Democrat of New York, said the House ''prioritization'' bill ''maps out not if but when the United States defaults for the first time in the nation's history.''
Some Republicans were no more charitable.
Even if the Treasury could pull off the difficult task of managing incoming taxes and outgoing payments on a daily basis, about 25 percent of the government would have to shut down for lack of money. And Tony Fratto, a Treasury and White House spokesman in the Bush administration, said the task could not be done.
Daily tax receipts are ''lumpy,'' Mr. Fratto said. They do not arrive in any steady or predictable way. At the same time, government payments are ''spiky'' and fluctuate in ways that do not mesh with income tax receipts. The bill also hands Democrats a talking point that Republicans are willing to make foreign creditors like China a priority over veterans and the military.
Mr. Fratto called the bill ''technically impossible and politically disastrous.''
But Republicans said they were merely being prudent and signaling to world financial markets that they would not let the United States government miss debt payments.
''This legislation credibly and permanently removes the threat of default on a U.S. debt payment and ensures that Social Security benefit payments are paid in full and on time,'' said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.

HEADLINE: Delta Sees New Terminal as Symbol of an Air Travel Makeover

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As Delta Air Lines executives tell it, the carrier's bright and spacious new terminal at Kennedy Airport in New York reflects the industry's new priorities.
Rather than compete on the lowest fares -- a race to the bottom over the last decade that just weakened them -- the airlines are now seeking to lure passengers with better amenities and service. That new strategy points to the improving financial health of the industry, a turnaround that can be traced to both the string of megamergers among the big carriers and the industry's single-minded emphasis on cutting excess capacity since the depths of the recession.
Delta, the first of the major carriers to go into a merger -- with Northwest in 2008 -- is also in the strongest position to reshape its goals. And the $1.2 billion investment in a new terminal in New York, which will replace two grim 50-year-old and woefully inadequate terminals at the end of the month, is the latest and most visible sign of its new approach. 
The airline has already been flexing its muscles. In the last two years, it has focused on improving its balance sheet as well as its operations, expanded its global partnerships, invested in airlines like Virgin Atlantic and even bought an oil refinery. On Wednesday, it said it would reward shareholders with $1 billion in quarterly dividends and share repurchases over the next three years.
''The airline industry has been broken for decades,'' Edward H. Bastian, Delta's president, said in a recent interview. ''It was fragmented. People worried if the airlines were going to make it or if they were going to be bankrupt. Today, everybody has scale, customers have choices and people have seen that service matters.''
In this new world of fewer airlines and less capacity, airline executives hope to achieve a level of stability that has eluded them since the federal government deregulated air travel in 1978. While Delta's merger is complete, more work remains on United Airlines' merger with Continental Airlines and Southwest Airlines' tie-up with AirTran. American Airlines and US Airways, which announced in February that they would merge, are just starting the process. But most have begun putting Wi-Fi and individual televisions aboard their planes, installing more comfortable seats for business passengers and investing in mobile technology that gives passengers more control over their travel plans.
Not all the changes have been welcomed by travelers. Airlines charge more fees than ever, requiring passengers to pay for services that were once free, including checking bags or booking seats with more legroom. These fees are also rising and account for a bigger share of the airlines' revenues. In the latest of these, United increased its ticket-change fee to $200 from $150, a move that was matched by most airlines this month.
Airline executives argue that the industry needs to be profitable for service to improve. Fares have risen in recent years, but they remain lower than they were in the 1990s when adjusted for inflation.
Delta, which left its 19-month bankruptcy in 2007, has also been financially conservative, reducing capital expenses and using cash to cut debt. The carrier posted a net profit of $1.6 billion last year, up 30 percent from the previous year, giving it four years of rising profits despite high fuel costs.
The company said on Wednesday that it would start to pay a quarterly dividend of 6 cents a share and buy back $500 million of its shares in the next three years.
The airline also said it would continue to reduce its debt in the next three years, to $7 billion from $17 billion in 2009. In the next five years, it also plans to spend $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year on its fleet, airports and technology.
Paying a dividend is rare in an industry with losses of $60 billion in the last decade, although there have been exceptions. Southwest Airlines now pays a quarterly dividend of one penny a share, while Alaska Airlines and Allegiant Air buy back their own shares.
Delta's shares have gained more than 60 percent in the last 12 months, outpacing United but trailing Southwest. On Thursday, they closed at $17.70.
Hunter Keay, an airline analyst with Wolfe Trahan, said investors were looking at the airline industry with more interest since airlines merged and cut their combined capacity substantially.
''Delta is clearly establishing itself in a leadership role in terms of cash generation, returning cash to shareholders and profit margins,'' Mr. Keay said.
At Kennedy, Delta will move most of its flights to Terminal 4, where it is completing an extension. There will be more gates and security lanes, a large lounge for frequent fliers and an outdoor observation deck. The doughnut-shaped Terminal 3, which has a leaky roof and plastic buckets that collect rainwater, will be torn down.
The Kennedy expansion came after a complex deal that Delta engineered in 2011 to expand capacity at La Guardia Airport in New York by swapping takeoff and landing rights there with US Airways for some of its own slots at Washington's Reagan National Airport. Delta now has nearly half of all departures at La Guardia, where daily capacity is capped.
Delta is also taking the offensive at London's Heathrow Airport, another congested airport with limited capacity. In December, Delta spent $360 million to buy a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. The partnership with Virgin will expand Delta's daily flights to Heathrow to 23 from nine and increase its market share between New York and London -- the world's top business route -- to 37 percent from 10 percent.
Delta surprised analysts last year, though, when it acquired the Trainer oil refinery in Pennsylvania to provide more steady prices for its jet fuel supplies.
Operating a refinery has proved tricky. Hurricane Sandy disrupted supplies and its gasoline production unit, forcing a temporary shutdown. Delta took a $22 million loss on the plant in the first quarter. Still, executives remain optimistic about the refinery, on which Delta has so far spent $250 million. By contrast, the company's fuel bill averages about $12 billion a year.
The investment, however, is based on the notion that oil prices are unlikely to fall much in the future. If that happened, Delta could pay more for its jet fuel than its competitors, analysts said.
The company has also remodeled its fleet substantially in recent years, shedding a large number of its 474 smaller, 50-seat airplanes, which have become expensive to fly because of high fuel prices.
Delta, replicating a strategy used at Northwest, has bought a large number of secondhand planes at a substantial discount. Delta thinks it can save money in the long run because the planes cost far less than new ones. Passengers are not likely to see a difference: the planes will get a thorough mechanical check while the cabins are entirely refurbished.
Delta also spent $140 million over two years to develop a new Web site, which it unveiled last year. The site allows the airline to sell more services to passengers, including upgrades to premium seats, or booking hotel rooms or cars. At a conference last year, one executive compared the company's aims to something Amazon has on its Web site -- the ability to bundle offers or suggest products based on a passenger's history and preferences.
''We had to go through this dark period of elimination of the weaker carriers that was perhaps necessary,'' said Glen W. Hauenstein, Delta's head of network planning and revenue management. ''And you'll find in the next few years an industry that is healthier and that is going through a bit of a renaissance.''

HEADLINE: Stop the Plunder of Africa

BYLINE: By KOFI ANNAN

 BODY:
With Africa's economies riding the crest of the global commodities wave, there is an unprecedented opportunity to convert the region's vast resource wealth into investments that could lift millions out of poverty, create jobs, and bring hope to future generations.
Seizing that opportunity will require strengthened governance backed by international cooperation to stem the hemorrhage of revenues associated with tax evasion, secret deals and illicit financial transfers. 
Natural resource exports have propelled Africa into the world's high-growth league. Around one-third of the region's economies grew by more than 6 percent in 2012. Strong demand in emerging markets is set to drive another decade of high prices for Africa's natural resources, and foreign investment is on the rise. Mozambique and Tanzania are poised to emerge as major exporters of natural gas. Guinea and Sierra Leone stand to reap windfall gains from iron ore exports. Demand for Zambia's copper and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's cobalt is booming.
Unfortunately, the rising tide of wealth is not lifting all boats. Poverty has been falling far too slowly, and in some countries -- including Zambia and Nigeria -- it has increased. Few governments have used the increased revenues generated by resource exports to counteract rising inequality, build better health care and education systems or strengthen smallholder agriculture. Moreover, corruption remains endemic.
African governments themselves must step up to the plate and address these issues. They need to recognize the urgency of converting their country's resource wealth into the human capital and investments in infrastructure on which sustained and inclusive growth depend. And they should follow the example of countries like Liberia and Guinea that are combating corruption by posting all mining contracts online for public scrutiny.
In other areas, action by African governments alone will not succeed. As we highlight in this year's Africa Progress Report, no region has suffered more from tax evasion, aggressive tax planning and plunder of national wealth through offshore-registered companies. These are global problems that demand multilateral solutions.
The scale of the losses sustained by Africa is not widely recognized. Transfer pricing -- the practice of shifting profits to lower tax jurisdictions -- costs the continent $34 billion annually -- more than the region receives in bilateral aid. Put differently, you could double aid by cutting this version of tax evasion. The extensive use made by foreign investors of offshore-registered companies operating from jurisdictions with minimal reporting requirements actively facilitates tax evasion. It is all but impossible for Africa's understaffed and poorly resourced revenue authorities to track real profits through the maze of shell companies, holding companies and offshore entities used by investors.
There have been some encouraging recent developments in the multilateral response to these challenges. Under the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and comparable measures in Europe, extractive companies are now required to meet higher standards of disclosure. (In what is surely an act of strategic folly, many of these companies are swimming against the tide of reform by mounting a legal challenge to the Dodd-Frank Act.) Meanwhile, the British government has taken the lead in putting international cooperation on taxation at the center of the agenda for next month's Group of 8 summit.
This is an area in which the G-8 can make a real difference. The summit should serve as a launch-pad for the development of a rules-based global system on transparency and taxation.
It is time to draw back the veil of secrecy behind which too many companies operate. Every tax jurisdiction should be required to publicly disclose the full beneficial ownership structure of registered companies. Switzerland, Britain and the United States -- all major conduits for offshore finance -- should signal intent to clamp down on illicit financial flows. And the G-8 and the G-20 should work together to expand the scope and reach of the Dodd-Frank legislation.
It is also critical that the G-8 helps to empower African governments. The region's revenue authorities are hopelessly ill-equipped to tackle problems such as transfer pricing or to counter illicit transfers. That is why the Africa Progress Panel has called on the G-8 to provide the technical, financial and administrative support to build capacity.
More than 50 years ago, as African states emerged into independence, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president, commented: ''Never before have a people had within their grasp so great an opportunity for developing a continent endowed with so much wealth.''
With political leadership at home and strengthened international cooperation we can seize the opportunity that Kwame Nkrumah identified.
Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, is chairman of the Africa Progress Panel.

HEADLINE: Bank of England Maintains Key Rate at a Record 0.5%

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- With the British economy showing feeble signs of resilience and a new central bank governor waiting in the wings, the Bank of England decided on Thursday to keep its benchmark interest rate and its economic stimulus program unchanged.
The central bank left its interest rate at 0.5 percent, a record low, and held its program of bond-buying at £375 billion, or about $581 billion. The stimulus program, also known as quantitative easing, frees more money for lending to businesses and individuals. 
Some economists expect the Bank of England to expand its stimulus program this year to help the recovery, while others said recent economic data were encouraging and that further stimulus might not be necessary.
Where they agree is that any action would probably wait until the next central bank governor, Mark Carney, takes over in July from Mervyn A. King, who has held the position since 2003.
''There are broad improvements in business sentiment, and with equity markets heading to new highs, we are not expecting anything'' until Mr. Carney arrives, said James Knightley, an economist in London with ING Bank.
The British economy narrowly avoided falling back into a recession for a third time in five years at the beginning of this year. The 0.3 percent growth it recorded in the first three months of this year was hardly a sign of a robust recovery, but it allowed George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, to dispel critics of his austerity measures, who had argued that spending cuts and tax increases would pull Britain back into a recession.
While still in decline, the manufacturing and construction industries shrank less than some economists had expected in April and the services sector also strengthened last month. Economic confidence is improving and house prices increased to the highest level in almost three years in April, according to Halifax, a mortgage lender.
Under pressure to show his austerity program was indeed repairing the British economy by reducing the budget deficit without choking off growth, Mr. Osborne in March gave the Bank of England more flexibility in supporting the economy without the need to lower inflation in the short term.
Consumer price inflation is at 2.8 percent, above the Bank of England's 2 percent target. Prices have been climbing faster in Britain than in the euro zone or the United States, squeezing households as salaries remain broadly unchanged.
The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent from 0.75 percent last week. The move was widely expected and was seen as mostly symbolic, to show that the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi, was willing to act to bolster the euro zone as recession threatened to engulf countries that were previously spared, like Germany.
The troubles in the euro zone have been weighing on Britain, which is a member of the European Union but not part of the euro zone. The region is Britain's largest single export market. Mr. Osborne repeatedly pointed to weak demand for goods and services from the euro zone as a reason for the slow recovery of the British economy.
Mr. Knightley is among those economists who expect the arrival of Mr. Carney at the helm of the Bank of England, in two months, to bring some change there.
Mr. Carney, now the governor of the Bank of Canada, might be more specific about what to expect from interest rates in the future, Mr. Knightley said. Few economists expect interest rates to increase before the end of next year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Senate Bipartisanship on Display, Briefly, as Committee Focuses on Border Security

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Senate Judiciary Committee began plowing through more than 300 amendments intended to reshape -- and, in some cases, derail -- legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, signs of bipartisanship emerged Thursday, with the committee accepting at least eight Republican proposals to strengthen border security.
Four of the bill's authors -- Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, along with Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans -- sit on the committee and had previously indicated that they would band together to vote against any amendments they saw as undermining the core of the bill. The legislation offers a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country, and implements stricter border security measures. 
At the same time, members of the bipartisan group -- as well as Democrats on the committee -- were eager to demonstrate that they were operating with an open mind and a willingness to accept Republican suggestions to improve security at the border. By Thursday afternoon, they were pointing to the eight approved Republican measures as a sign they had done just that, hoping to increase Republican backing for the bill.
One amendment by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the committee, was approved with a voice vote and would require continuous surveillance of 100 percent of the United States border and 90 percent effectiveness of enforcement of the entire border. In the original bill, the 90 percent effectiveness rate applies only to high-risk sectors of the border.
If border officials have not reached the surveillance and enforcement goals after five years, the bill creates a border commission to advise the Department of Homeland Security on how to reach its goals. Mr. Grassley's amendment makes it more likely that the commission would need to be established.
''We are going to make sure that we have border security first,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''The legislation doesn't do it.''
But the bipartisan coalition also held firm and defeated an amendment by Mr. Grassley that would have required the Homeland Security secretary to certify that the southern border was secure for six months before any undocumented immigrants could receive legal status.
Democrats on the committee felt that Mr. Grassley's measure had the potential to endlessly delay citizenship to the undocumented immigrants already in the country, and Mr. Flake and Mr. Graham -- the Republican members of the bipartisan group who also sit on the committee -- joined with the Democrats in voting it down, 12 to 6.
''This is our chance, in this hearing room, to write an immigration bill for the 21st century, for America and its future,'' Mr. Durbin said.
Despite the generally congenial tone and the roughly two-dozen amendments, from both Democrats and Republicans, that ultimately passed, tempers were running high by the end of the day. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, argued that, ''The committee has voted down every serious border security amendment that has been presented here today.''
When Mr. Schumer said that Mr. Cruz simply did not want to accept any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the country -- something Mr. Cruz has said, and has even filed an amendment to that end -- Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, accused Mr. Schumer of ''impugning people's motives.''
''There's big holes in the underlying bill and we're trying to plug them,'' Mr. Cornyn said. ''We're actually trying to be helpful.''
Thursday's sessions came as the American Conservative Union released a letter signed by more than two-dozen prominent conservatives throwing their support behind an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.
''Conservatives are ready to support immigration reform, so long as it is pro-economic growth, strengthens families, fosters assimilation and prevents another wave of illegal immigration from happening again,'' the letter read.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the committee, has made plans for a marathon markup, as the process of considering amendments to legislation is known, that he said would likely last all month. In a move intended to head off criticism from opponents that the process is too rushed and not fully transparent, Mr. Leahy decided to make all the amendments available to the public by posting them on the committee's Web site on Tuesday night.
Politically delicate amendments remain on both the Democratic and Republican sides, including two by Mr. Leahy that would allow United States citizens to seek a permanent resident visa, known as a green card, for a same-sex foreign partner -- something they cannot do now.
Asked about Mr. Leahy's amendments, which Republicans in the bipartisan group have said would doom the legislation, Mr. Schumer said he was nervous.
''This one is something, you know, I worry about all the time, even -- I'm a good sleeper, but I wake up in the morning thinking of these things, sometimes early in the morning,'' he said. ''And so how we resolve this remains to be seen.''

HEADLINE: Bills Would Prevent Rise in Student Loan Rates

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Congress now has an array of legislative options to prevent the interest rate on student loans from doubling to 6.8 percent on July 1, as scheduled.
With student loans topping $1.1 trillion -- and held by one in five American households -- many families are questioning why students should pay so much when market interest rates are so low. 
On Thursday, Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced legislation that would provide a long-term solution, tying interest rates to the government's cost of borrowing, as the Obama administration proposed in its budget.
''I think a lot of people are going to go for it,'' Mr. Kline said. ''I talked to Secretary Duncan yesterday,'' he added, referring to Education Secretary Arne Duncan, ''and told him that our numbers were a little different, but the approach is the same.''
There are other proposals out there, too. In her first stand-alone legislation, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, introduced a bill on Wednesday to cut the student loan rate for one year to 0.75 percent, the rate that big banks get.
Two other Democratic senators and two Democratic representatives this week proposed rates based on the 91-day Treasury bill, and three Republican senators have offered legislation that would set the interest rate at three percentage points above the 10-year Treasury rate.
There is now widespread acceptance of the idea of moving to market-based rates. Under Mr. Kline's proposal, students would pay the 10-year Treasury rate, plus 2.5 percent, for all Stafford loans, with a cap of 8.5 percent. For Parent Plus and Grad Plus loans, the rate would be the Treasury rate plus 4.5 percent, with a 10.5 percent cap.
Real divisions remain, though. The administration proposed no cap on interest, leaving students vulnerable to high rates in years to come. But while the White House wants rates fixed for the life of the loan, the Kline bill would reset rates each year -- and that, too, would leave students vulnerable to high costs if interest rates rise.
In a statement Thursday afternoon, the president again called for Congress to act to prevent the rate from doubling, but did not endorse Mr. Kline's plan.
''While we welcome action by the House on student loans, we have concerns about an approach that both fails to guarantee low rates for students on July 1 and asks too many of them to bear the burden of deficit reduction through unaffordable rates,'' said the statement, from a spokesman, Matt Lehrich.

HEADLINE: After 5 Days of Gains, Momentum Dwindles

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market retreated from its nominal highs on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipping after five days of gains.
Despite the pullback, the Dow Jones industrial average remained above the 15,000 mark, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was still well above 1,600. 
The length of the recent market rally has surprised some investors. Analysts said it was difficult for stocks to continue their upward momentum without further catalysts, such as first-quarter earnings reports, which are nearing an end.
''This market is so stretched to the upside that if we get some little wiggle somewhere, I can easily see us getting back down to 1,580'' on the S.& P. 500, said Stephen J. Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management.
The Dow industrials fell 22.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 15,082.62. The S.& P. 500 declined 6.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,626.67. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 4.10 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,409.17.
The day's main economic data was basically positive, but failed to give much of a boost to stocks. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in more than five years.
New jobless claims fell by 4,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 323,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less-volatile figure, dropped 6,250, to 336,750.
Apple helped lead the declines of both the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq, falling $4.02, or 0.9 percent, to $456.77. I.B.M. was the biggest drag on the Dow, dropping $1.58, or 0.8 percent, to $203.24.
Despite the day's declines, the Dow is up 15.1 percent so far this year, while the S.& P. 500 is up 14.1 percent.
Trading was fairly volatile. The market, which had been down slightly from the opening bell through midday, reversed course and began to edge higher in early afternoon. Stocks lost steam later in the session.
Limiting the losses in the S.& P. 500, News Corporation shares rose $1.46, or 4.6 percent to $33.44 after it reported earnings late Wednesday that beat expectations.
Among the stocks making big gains, Tesla Motors surged $13.61, or 24.4 percent, to $69.40 a day after posting earnings that were three times what analysts had expected, as the company sold more cars than initially forecast.
Barnes & Noble shot up $4.31, or 24.3 percent, to $22.08, after TechCrunch, an influential technology Web site, published an unconfirmed report that Microsoft was considering an offer to acquire all of the company's Nook Media's digital assets for $1 billion. Microsoft fell 33 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.66.
In the bond market, interest rates moved up. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 21/32, to 99 14/32, while its yield rose to 1.81 percent, from 1.77 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Challenge To Dogma On Owning A Home

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Homeownership is a good thing, for the individual and for society. Or so American governments, whether Republican or Democrat, have long believed. The benefits have been cited repeatedly in justifying the existence and expansion of the tax breaks given to home buyers.
But maybe it isn't nearly as good as had been thought.
A new study by two economists concludes that rising levels of homeownership in a state ''are a precursor to eventual sharp rises in unemployment in that state.'' As more homes are owned, in other words, fewer people have jobs.
The study, by David G. Blanchflower of Dartmouth and Andrew J. Oswald of the University of Warwick in England, does not argue that homeowners are more likely to lose jobs than are renters. But it does argue that areas with high and rising levels of homeownership are more likely to be inhospitable to innovation and job creation and to have less labor mobility and longer commutes to work. 
''We find that a high rate of homeownership slowly decimates the labor market,'' Professor Oswald said.
At the simplest level, the authors of the study, released by the Peterson Institute of International Economics, point to the fact that the five states with the largest increase in homeownership from 1950 to 2010 -- Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia -- had a 2010 unemployment rate that was 6.3 percentage points higher than in 1950. The unemployment rates in the five states where homeownership went up the least -- California, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin -- rose 3.5 percentage points during the period.
Such statistics are not persuasive by themselves, and the professors know it. Many factors obviously influence unemployment rates in any given state. North Dakota's current boom stems from energy deposits, which would have been there no matter who owned the land.
But they say that the statistics show those patterns no matter how much they control for other variables and that the same picture emerges if they look at employment growth rather than unemployment rates. They say that the pattern existed before the crash of the housing market that began in 2007 and that the statistics are not dependent on including the more recent period.
If that is true, why have few noticed it before? ''The time lags are long,'' they write, up to five years before a rise in homeownership hurts an area's unemployment rate. ''That gradualness may explain why these important patterns are so little known.''
Nonetheless, the idea is not new. Professor Oswald pointed to some of the data as far back as 1996, saying that in Europe as well as the United States a higher proportion of homeownership seemed to be associated with a higher level of unemployment. But other researchers soon concluded that the evidence did not support the thesis that homeowners were more likely to be unemployed than renters, and the correlation was largely ignored.
If the correlation is real, what could be the cause? The professors say they believe that high homeownership in an area leads to people staying put and commuting farther and farther to jobs, creating cost and congestion for companies and other workers. They speculate that the role of zoning may be important, as communities dominated by homeowners resort to ''not in my backyard'' efforts that block new businesses that could create jobs. Perhaps the energy sector would be less freewheeling in North Dakota if there were more homeowners.
Homeownership, in economists' jargon, creates ''negative externalities'' for the labor market.
In Finland, there was something of a test of the thesis, the professors say. Finland changed its housing laws in the 1990s in ways that discouraged homeownership, putting the changes into effect at different times in different regions. ''While homeowners are less likely to experience unemployment,'' concluded Jani-Petri Laamanen, an economist at the University of Tampere who analyzed the Finnish housing market, ''an increase in the rate of homeownership causes regional unemployment to rise.''
Until the credit crisis, homeownership was generally viewed in the United States as an unquestionably good thing. President George W. Bush, like his predecessors, boasted of a rising homeownership rate in his administration. He summarized the consensus in 2005 when he proclaimed June to be ''National Homeownership Month.''
''The spread of ownership and opportunity helps give our citizens a vital stake in the future of America and the chance to realize the great promise of our country,'' he wrote. ''A home provides children with a safe environment in which to grow and learn. A home is also a tangible asset that provides owners with borrowing power and allows our citizens to build wealth that they can pass on to their children and grandchildren.''
Homeownership, the president concluded, is ''a bedrock of the American economy, helping to increase jobs, boost demand for goods and services, and build prosperity.''
The benefits of homeownership were said to go far beyond the obvious ones. A document distributed by the National Association of Realtors pointed to positive externalities. Homeowners' children were more likely to do well in school and less likely to drop out. They were more likely to be well behaved. Teenage pregnancy rates were lower, and the children of lower-income homeowners were less likely to wind up on welfare as adults than were children of similar renters.
The credit crisis damaged that consensus as millions of homeowners lost their homes. Rather than creating wealth, homes had enabled people to gain cash by refinancing mortgages and live beyond their means until the crisis sent them into bankruptcy. The percentage of Americans owning their own homes is now the lowest since 1995.
But the good reputation of homeownership largely survived. Lawrence Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, complained in a Washington Post article earlier this year that not enough mortgage loans were being made. ''The clearest evidence is the growing number of lower- and middle-income families paying rents to the private equity firms that own their homes at rates far above what a mortgage would cost,'' he said, taking it for granted that owning a home was a good idea.
The professors' paper could turn out to have appeared at a particularly inappropriate time for the interests that have long promoted homeownership and reaped bountiful subsidies for it. With the federal budget under pressure, reducing the tax benefits for homeownership might be easier if the halo around homeownership were to sag.
There have been proposals thrown around to limit those tax advantages by limiting or even eliminating the deductibility of mortgage interest. Renters, after all, receive no such deduction.
''The mortgage interest deduction is one of the largest tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code,'' Eric J. Toder, the co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted in Congressional testimony last month. ''Achieving a revenue-neutral tax reform that reduces marginal tax rates significantly would be difficult or impossible to achieve without cutting back the mortgage interest deduction or some other equally popular and widely used provisions.''
There is no political argument that is more potent now than one that says jobs will be created by whatever is proposed. That claim was used last year to pass a bill making it far easier to raise capital from investors despite warnings that it also made investment fraud more likely. Imagine what might happen if politicians came to believe that encouraging homeownership was reducing employment.

HEADLINE: In Texas Visit, Obama Points Spotlight on Manufacturing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- President Obama arrived here Thursday hoping to put a spotlight on this city's embrace of advanced manufacturing and on Republican efforts in Congress to block his economic agenda.
In a series of events to kick off the latest version of his ''Middle-Class Jobs and Opportunity Tour,'' Mr. Obama drew attention to educational and economic successes that have fueled this city's growth and accused his adversaries of putting politics ahead of policies that could help speed up the nation's economic recovery.
''I've sent Congress proposals on a wide range of ideas,'' Mr. Obama told a group of students at Manor New Technology High School near Austin. ''But, some of them have been blocked in Congress for, frankly, political reasons. I'm going to keep on trying.'' 
After touring the school and viewing student projects on robotics, earthworms, bungee jumping and solar cars, Mr. Obama hailed the facility, where students are focused on science, technology, engineering and math, as the kind of educational opportunity that too many American students do not have.
''We can do better than that,'' he said, calling on Congress to approve funds for his program to expand preschool.
Ahead of the president's visit on Thursday, White House officials argued that federal investment of $1 billion in ''manufacturing institutes'' would help set off an industrial revival and create new jobs. Mr. Obama's budget included the request, but Republicans have been cool to the idea.
As a result, Mr. Obama announced Thursday an executive order creating three such manufacturing hubs using $200 million from the budgets of five agencies: the Departments of Defense, Energy and Commerce, and the National Science Foundation and NASA. White House officials said the president would continue to push for Congress to finance the remaining hubs.
The president also announced an executive order requiring that government data be made available to the public -- and to entrepreneurs -- in manageable formats that could be more easily used by researchers and businesses to jump-start new products and services.
''These steps are not a substitute for the bold Congressional action we need to create jobs and grow the economy, but they'll make a difference,'' a White House official said, speaking on background ahead of the president's official announcement.
Republican officials quickly mocked Mr. Obama's trip to Austin, describing it as a campaign-style stunt that would not substantially help the economy or put people back to work. ''Obama's Jobs Strategy: Pivot Back to the Economy Every So Often,'' said a news release from the Republican National Committee.
In his State of the Union address this year, Mr. Obama laid out an economic agenda that included the call for a new emphasis on manufacturing along with more money for early childhood education, an increase in the minimum wage and greater investment in infrastructure.
Though some Republicans have expressed support for pieces of that agenda, there is little indication that the bulk of it is headed toward passage anytime soon in a Congress that is increasingly frozen when it comes to fiscal issues.
But aides to the president believe that events like the ones in Austin, though likely in service to a lost cause, are necessary to keep pressure on Republicans and to show Americans that Mr. Obama is still pushing for his agenda.
The risk for Mr. Obama is that the events can come across as little more than costly excursions that do little to actually improve the economy. But aides are quick to point out that the president would most likely be criticized if he announced an agenda in the State of the Union address and did not push for it.
And the president's political advisers remember what happened during his first two years in office, when he rarely traveled around the country, staying in Washington to shepherd his health care legislation through Congress. His approval ratings and his mood sank, leading aides to believe that it is important that he travel the country frequently.
In Austin, Mr. Obama was scheduled to meet with some local residents and technology entrepreneurs, officials said. And then he was to tour a facility of Applied Materials, a company based in Silicon Valley that manufactures the complex equipment needed to make silicon chips for computers, phones and other high-tech machines.
The manufacturing hubs Mr. Obama announced on Thursday will focus on three areas, officials said: ''digital manufacturing and design innovation,'' ''lightweight and modern metals manufacturing,'' and the ''next-generation power electronics manufacturing.''
In a political twist, while in Austin, Mr. Obama will highlight the accomplishments of Rick Perry, the Texas governor, who lost a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
In an opinion article in The Austin American-Statesman, Mr. Perry took credit for the very achievements that the Democratic president was advancing.
''In fact, the very school he will visit today, Manor New Technology High School, was created as a result of a collaborative effort with Manor ISD, Samsung and my office, as part of a multibillion-dollar capital investment project by Samsung for a semiconductor facility,'' Mr. Perry wrote in the article. ''I was proud to cut the ribbon on opening day.''
Even so, Mr. Perry greeted Mr. Obama warmly as the president descended from Air Force One upon his arrival in Austin. The president clapped Mr. Perry on the shoulder and they spoke briefly before jointly shaking hands on a rope line.
Later, at the high school, Mr. Obama opened his remarks with a hearty ''Howdy.'' No word on whether he received any pointers on the greeting from Mr. Perry.

HEADLINE: The Next Contagion: Closer Than You Think

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. OSTERHOLM. 
Michael T. Osterholm, an epidemiologist, is a professor of environmental health sciences in the School of Public Health, and the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the University of Minnesota. .

 BODY:
MINNEAPOLIS
THERE has been a flurry of recent attention over two novel infectious agents: the first, a strain of avian influenza virus (H7N9) in China that is causing severe respiratory disease and other serious health complications in people; the second, a coronavirus, first reported last year in the Middle East, that has brought a crop of new infections. While the number of human cases from these two pathogens has so far been limited, the death rates for each are notably high.
Alarmingly, we face a third, and far more widespread, ailment that has gotten little attention: call it ''contagion exhaustion.'' News reports on a seemingly unending string of frightening microbes -- bird flu, flesh-eating strep, SARS, AIDS, Ebola, drug-resistant bugs in hospitals, the list goes on -- have led some people to ho-hum the latest reports.
Some seem to think that public health officials pull a microbe ''crisis du jour'' out of their proverbial test tube when financing for infectious disease research and control programs appears to be drying up. They dismiss warnings about the latest bugs as ''crying wolf.'' This misimpression could be deadly. 
It's important to understand our relationship with the microbial world. Most microscopic organisms benefit humans, other organisms or the environment in some way -- for example, they help us digest our food and keep bad bugs in check.
At the same time, we are never far away from one of the 1,400 kinds of disease-causing microbes that are capable of infecting people; many infect animals, too. Of these microbes, known as pathogens, about 500 can be transmitted from humans to other humans. And around 150 of them can cause epidemics -- rapidly spreading outbreaks of serious, sometimes life-threatening, disease.
Each pathogen has its own ''footprint'' (or potential footprint) on our human health and social, political and economic landscapes. Far too often the public -- and policy makers and journalists -- confuse those infectious diseases that can be life-threatening for a limited number of individuals with those that can cause widespread damage to society as a whole.
A disease in the former category is ''flesh-eating strep'' (invasive group A streptococcal disease). Approximately 9,000 to 11,500 cases are recognized each year in the United States, and about 1,000 to 1,800 of these patients die. When outbreaks of this type occur in this country, particularly if they affect schools or day-care centers, they generate front-page news and widespread concern.
Conversely, last year worldwide 1.7 million of the 34 million people infected with H.I.V. died from AIDS. There was little front-page news coverage about these cases. Nor was there much coverage last year of the estimated 1.5 million tuberculosis-related deaths, of the 1.1 million young children who died of infectious diarrheal illness, or of the 825,000 deaths from malaria. Infectious diseases like these plague the world but, because they don't occur in our backyard, they remain relatively invisible to Americans.
In the case of the two latest threats -- the H7N9 influenza virus and the new coronavirus -- the number of infected people is small, and the infections are occurring thousands of miles away from the United States. Yet we should be seriously concerned about both.
Diseases like H7N9 influenza and the new coronavirus are different from noninfectious causes of serious illness and death -- and even most microbial causes of disease. They can kill large numbers of people quickly and simultaneously around the world. The 1918 flu pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide in less than 18 months. The 2003 SARS pandemic, while more limited, resulted in more than 8,275 cases and 775 deaths.
Why does this suddenly happen? Both animal influenza and coronaviruses normally infect animals, not humans. But when these viruses undergo very specific genetic changes that occur as a result of everyday microbial evolution, we have a whole new ballgame; one that is largely played by their rules and on their schedule. Now a virus that once could infect only animals and maybe very rarely infect humans is readily transmitted by people to other people. You could get infected just by breathing shared air with the airplane passenger next to you, or by standing next to the wrong person in an elevator or even by lying next to your sleeping mate. We call this respiratory transmission.
Consider how quickly the H1N1 influenza virus spread in 2009: within the first month of that pandemic, the virus had infected people in at least 42 countries. The only thing keeping these viruses from becoming pandemic killers is their genetics. With few exceptions, all the current human H7N9 and coronavirus cases represent sporadic animal-to-human transmission. But if these viruses continue to spread in their respective animal reservoirs, repeated transmissions of the viruses to humans may lead to the genetic changes that will make either virus readily transmitted by humans to humans. Add in the fact that humans have little to no natural immunity to these viruses, and we could have the next pandemic.
Our public health tools to fight these viruses are limited. We have no vaccines or effective drugs readily available to stop or treat the new coronavirus in the Middle East. And while we have influenza vaccines, my colleagues and I have detailed in an article this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association why we most likely will have limited global impact on an H7N9 pandemic with our current outdated influenza vaccine technology.
In short, we won't be saved by vaccines if a pandemic emerges from these two new threats. At best, in the case of H7N9, we can only hope that vaccines can help somewhat.
The toll is economic, not just human. Studies have shown that a severe global pandemic, caused by viruses like influenza or coronavirus, could bring the global economy, which is ever reliant on global communications and transportation networks, to its knees. When people are too sick or too afraid to work, borders are closed and global supply chains break, and trade falls. Over months, the economic costs could send the world into recession.
Are either H7N9 or coronavirus pandemics inevitable? We don't know. But each time one of these viruses infects a human or even another mammal, it's one more throw at the genetic roulette table.
To reduce the odds of a pandemic, China and the Middle Eastern countries where these viruses are now circulating in animals must do everything they can to identify the animal sources and use every tool they have to eliminate the spreading of the disease. To cull millions of apparently healthy chickens or other domestic animals is not easy, but it is essential.
The world as whole must invest in a new generation of effective influenza and coronavirus vaccines. They are the ultimate insurance policy against similar future emerging viruses. These viruses may seem far away, but tomorrow they could be at America's doorstep.

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes Sanctions On Those Aiding Iran

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States on Thursday expanded its roster of those violating Iran sanctions, blacklisting four Iranian companies and one individual suspected of helping the country enrich nuclear fuel. It also singled out two other companies, including a Venezuelan-Iranian bank, accused of helping Iran evade other Western-imposed prohibitions on oil sales and financial dealings.
The penalties announced by the Treasury and State Departments came a day after the Senate introduced legislation that could effectively deny the Iran government access to an estimated $100 billion worth of its own money parked in overseas banks, a step that proponents said could significantly damage Iran's financial stability. 
That legislation, known as the Iran Sanctions Loophole Elimination Act, is expected to be integrated into a broader House measure introduced in February.
The actions on Thursday appeared to signal an accelerated American effort to squeeze Iran economically over the lack of progress in negotiations on the disputed Iranian nuclear program, which Iran says is peaceful but the West has called a guise to achieve the ability to make atomic bombs.
The latest round of negotiations last month ended inconclusively, and Western critics of Iran have accused it of stalling for time while it continues to enrich uranium.
''With Iran's nuclear program marching steadily forward, we need to work as quickly as possible to eliminate any sources of funding for the regime,'' the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican, said in a statement issued jointly with the ranking Democrat, Representative Eliot Engel of New York.
They said the committee would hold a hearing Wednesday on Iran's nuclear activities.
Any assets that blacklisted companies or individuals may have under American jurisdiction can be frozen, and they are prohibited from doing business with American citizens or businesses. Other individuals or business that engage with those under sanctions are themselves subject to penalties.
Iran has characterized the sanctions as illegal bullying by the United States and its allies. Some critics of the sanctions have said they are more likely to harden Iran's resistance.
A State Department announcement said four Tehran-based businesses, identified as Aluminat, Pars Amayesh Sanaat Kish, Pishro Systems Research Company and Taghtiran Kashan Company, and an Iranian citizen from Tehran identified as Parviz Khaki, were all blacklisted for providing goods, technology and services for activities that violated United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran's nuclear activities.
''This action was taken in light of the ongoing concerns that the international community has with respect to Iran's nuclear program, which Iran continues to refuse to address,'' the State Department announcement said.
In what appeared to be a coordinated announcement, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which helps administer sanctions, announced that it was punishing Sambouk Shipping FZC, based in the United Arab Emirates, for cloaking the origin of Iranian oil and selling it on the international market. The Treasury said that the company was owned by a Greek business executive, Dmitris Cambis, who was blacklisted earlier this year for ties to sanctioned Iranian companies.
In addition, the Treasury penalized the Iranian Venezuelan Bi-National Bank, based in Tehran, for engaging in financial transactions for the Export Development Bank of Iran, which has already been blacklisted.
''As Iran becomes increasingly isolated from the international financial system and energy markets, it is turning increasingly to convoluted schemes and shady actors to maintain its access to the global financial system,'' David S. Cohen, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in the Treasury announcement. ''As long as Iran tries to evade our sanctions, we will continue to expose their deceptive maneuvers.''

HEADLINE: After Plant Explosion, Texas Remains Wary of Regulation

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA, MANNY FERNANDEZ and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Kitty Bennett contributed research from St. Petersburg, Fla., and Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WEST, Tex. -- Five days after an explosion at a fertilizer plant leveled a wide swath of this town, Gov. Rick Perry tried to woo Illinois business officials by trumpeting his state's low taxes and limited regulations. Asked about the disaster, Mr. Perry responded that more government intervention and increased spending on safety inspections would not have prevented what has become one of the nation's worst industrial accidents in decades.
''Through their elected officials,'' he said, Texans ''clearly send the message of their comfort with the amount of oversight.''
This antipathy toward regulations is shared by many residents here. Politicians and economists credit the stance with helping attract jobs and investment to Texas, which has one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, and with winning the state a year-after-year ranking as the nation's most business friendly. 
Even in West, last month's devastating blast did little to shake local skepticism of government regulations. Tommy Muska, the mayor, echoed Governor Perry in the view that tougher zoning or fire safety rules would not have saved his town. ''Monday morning quarterbacking,'' he said.
Raymond J. Snokhous, a retired lawyer in West who lost two cousins -- brothers who were volunteer firefighters -- in the explosion, said, ''There has been nobody saying anything about more regulations.''
Texas has always prided itself on its free-market posture. It is the only state that does not require companies to contribute to workers' compensation coverage. It boasts the largest city in the country, Houston, with no zoning laws. It does not have a state fire code, and it prohibits smaller counties from having such codes. Some Texas counties even cite the lack of local fire codes as a reason for companies to move there.
But Texas has also had the nation's highest number of workplace fatalities -- more than 400 annually -- for much of the past decade. Fires and explosions at Texas' more than 1,300 chemical and industrial plants have cost as much in property damage as those in all the other states combined for the five years ending in May 2012. Compared with Illinois, which has the nation's second-largest number of high-risk sites, more than 950, but tighter fire and safety rules, Texas had more than three times the number of accidents, four times the number of injuries and deaths, and 300 times the property damage costs.
As federal investigators sift through the rubble at the West Fertilizer Company plant seeking clues about the April 17 blast that killed at least 14 people and injured roughly 200 others, some here argue that Texas' culture itself contributed to the calamity.
''The Wild West approach to protecting public health and safety is what you get when you give companies too much economic freedom and not enough responsibility and accountability,'' said Thomas O. McGarity, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on regulation.
Since the accident, some state lawmakers began calling for increased workplace safety inspections to be paid for by businesses. Fire officials are pressing for stricter zoning rules to keep residences farther away from dangerous industrial sites. But those efforts face strong resistance.
Chuck DeVore, the vice president of policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative study group, said that the wrong response to the explosion would be for the state to hire more ''battalions of government regulators who are deployed into industry and presume to know more about running the factory than the people who own the factory and work there every day.''
This antiregulatory zeal is an outgrowth of a broader Texas ideology: that government should get out of people's lives, a deeply held belief throughout the state that touches many aspects of life here, including its gun culture, its Republican-dominated Legislature and its cowboy past and present.
Texas is one of only four states with legislatures that meet as infrequently as possible, once every two years, as required by the state's 137-year-old Constitution. From the freewheeling days of independent oilmen known as wildcatters to the 2012 presidential race, in which President Obama lost Texas by nearly 1.3 million votes, the state's pro-business, limited-government mantra has been a vital part of its identity.
That is particularly true in the countryside. ''In rural Texas,'' said Stephen T. Hendrick, the engineer for McLennan County, where the explosion occurred, ''no one votes for regulations.''
Debating a Fire Code
Texas is dotted by more than 700 fertilizer depots like the one near West. Many store ammonium nitrate, the fertilizer that exploded near West, which is spread on the soil to supply the nitrogen that crops need. Consisting of white pebbles that resemble coarse table salt, the chemical can explode when heated. In the wrong hands, it can be deadly. About two tons was used in the bomb that destroyed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995.
Fertilizer accidents are rare across the nation. Texas was, however, the site of the deadliest industrial accident in United States history in April 1947, when nearly 600 people were killed in Texas City in an explosion on a ship carrying ammonium nitrate.
It is impossible to know whether tougher regulations would have prevented the disaster near West, especially since investigators remain unsure what sparked the fire that caused the fertilizer to explode. McLennan is among the counties without a fire code.
But federal officials and fire safety experts contend that fire codes and other requirements would probably have made a difference. A fire code would have required frequent inspections by fire marshals who might have prohibited the plant's owner from storing the fertilizer just hundreds of feet from a school, a hospital, a railroad and other public buildings, they say. A fire code also would probably have mandated sprinklers and forbidden the storage of ammonium nitrate near combustible materials. (Investigators say the fertilizer was stored in a largely wooden building near piles of seed, one possible factor in the fire.)
''It's tough to overstate the importance fire codes would have made,'' said Scott Harris, a former emergency management coordinator in Texas for the Environmental Protection Agency, who is now with UL Workplace Health and Safety, a safety science company. ''Texas just hasn't wrapped its brain around this fact yet.''
In chemical fires, firefighters often bear a heavy toll. Ten of the at least 14 people who died in West were firefighters, and two more were residents helping fight the flames. This week, officials from the state firefighters' association said the 50-foot-tall memorial to volunteers killed in the line of duty, on the Capitol grounds in Austin, had no room left for new names, not even those from West.
State Senator Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, said enough was enough. ''We can dance around it all we want to,'' said Mr. Ellis, who has called for more frequent inspections of plants like the one near West. ''But the laissez-faire attitude about government oversight and government regulation has to have some impact on safety measures.''
Gaps in Oversight
The night of the accident, Mr. Muska, 55, was not just serving as West's mayor; he was also among the firefighters on the scene. And he became one of his town's victims: the home where he lived with his wife and 14-year-old daughter was ruined. Five of his friends, fellow members of the West Volunteer Fire Department, were killed.
The blast, 20 minutes after a fire broke out at the fertilizer depot, was so powerful that it registered as a 2.1-magnitude earthquake, decimating the 11-building, 10-acre plant on the edge of town. It left a crater 93 feet wide and sent a gray mushroom cloud into the sky that reminded many residents of the images they had seen of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Many families in West -- population 2,800 -- share the bonds of Czech heritage, including Mr. Muska. The Best Western is known as the Czech Inn. Regular travelers on the interstate make a habit of stopping in West for gas and a box of kolaches at a bakery, the Czech Stop.
Like other communities in central Texas, West is home to cattle ranchers and farmers, welders and deer hunters. Its hills and wide open spaces are so green it is easy to forget that other parts of the state remain in a drought, and the roads on the outskirts of town are so tranquil it is hard to remember that Dallas is just an hour north.
The fertilizer warehouse opened in 1962 to supply local corn and cotton farmers, changing ownership and names several times over the decades. It was built far from West's downtown, but the town expanded in recent years toward the fertilizer depot. Before long, a middle school, a nursing home and an apartment complex were just blocks away.
Residents, including Mr. Muska, never viewed the plant as a potential tinderbox capable of obliterating half their town. To many, it was a respected employer and, as some local and state leaders put it, a ''good corporate citizen.'' With fewer than 10 employees, the depot was owned by Donald R. Adair, 83, a lifelong resident and active member of the West Church of Christ.
''It was a friendly convenience,'' said Ronnie Gerik, a farmer who bought fertilizer, fuel and tools once a week from the depot. ''It meant you didn't have to drive 20 minutes to Hillsboro or Waco to get what you needed.''
West Fertilizer fell under the purview of at least seven state or federal regulatory agencies, each with its own objectives. None had primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of the hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored there or that of the workers or residents nearby.
Zak Covar, the executive director of the state environmental regulatory agency, has said his office is not responsible for tracking ammonium nitrate. He pointed to the Office of the Texas State Chemist. Tim Herrman, the state chemist, said his agency monitors whether fertilizers are labeled correctly and not their safety. ''It's fair to say we are not fire-safety experts,'' he said.
In Austin, two hours south of West, a handful of lawmakers say the time may be right to push, incrementally, for change.
Walter T. Price IV, a Republican state representative from Amarillo, sponsored a bill to give smaller rural counties the option to impose fire codes. Though it is a straightforward bill, Mr. Price said, he has already heard complaints from business owners that such requirements could be financially burdensome.
State Senator Brian Birdwell, a Republican whose district includes West, declined to say whether he would back the bill.
Mr. Perry, who toured the blast site and met with town leaders and emergency responders, is similarly noncommittal. Asked whether the governor would support Mr. Price's proposal, a spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, said that the governor would review any bill that made it to his desk, but that the investigation into the blast was continuing.
This week, Mr. Perry's press office announced that Texas had been ranked for the ninth year in a row as the country's most pro-business state, according to a survey by the magazine Chief Executive. Texas accounted for nearly a third of all private sector jobs created over the last decade, according to federal labor data. And under Mr. Perry, it has given businesses more tax breaks and incentives than any other state, roughly $19 billion a year.

Phillips, senior economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, agreed that Texas' formula helps generate jobs and draw businesses, though factors like the state's oil economy and its low cost of living play a role, too. ''Growth is going to occur where businesses can maximize profits and where workers and retirees want to live,'' he said.
Paul Burka, senior executive editor at Texas Monthly, said he did not imagine that the West disaster would lead to much in the way of change. Tragedies rarely do, he said. ''We're not going to spend our money telling businesses what we should do with their premises,'' said Mr. Burka, who grew up near Texas City, the site of the 1947 explosion.
Indeed, days after the accident near West, state lawmakers killed a proposal to provide $60 million in training and resources for volunteer firefighters. And a lobbyist for state firefighters, who backed Mr. Price's effort, said the bill had little chance of passing because of resistance from the real estate industry.
''Businesses can come down here and do pretty much what they want to,'' Mr. Burka said. ''That is the Texas way.''

HEADLINE: Pro-Inflation Policies Show Signs of Helping the Japanese Economy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and GRAHAM BOWLEY; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Tokyo and Graham Bowley from New York.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- For almost two decades Japan's economic fortunes have deteriorated, and little seemed to be done about it.
But in the last few months, the nation's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pushed policy makers and other officials to take bold steps to revive one of the world's largest economies. Their handiwork was evident on Thursday when the Japanese yen hit 100 to the dollar for the first time in four years.
Normally a weakening exchange rate might be taken as a sign of decline. The yen has fallen nearly 14 percent against the dollar this year, and no currency has fallen more except the Venezuelan bolívar. But in Japan's case, it is a sign that the policies put in place by Mr. Abe and Haruhiko Kuroda, chairman of the Bank of Japan, are starting to work. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive around the world. 
The most immediate impact of the weaker yen has been the boost in profits of the major exporters. This week, the Toyota Motor Corporation reported net income in the last 12 months jumped threefold, and Sony produced an annual profit for the first time in five years. Both companies forecast further profit increases largely because of the weaker yen.
Perhaps more important, particularly for the citizens of Japan who have suffered from a long period of falling wages and prices, the yen's move is expected to kindle inflation in the once moribund economy.
Bank of Japan has moved aggressively to reinvigorate the economy and fight deflation. Last month, the central bank announced a decisive break with its earlier policies. Instead of focusing on keeping overnight interest rates close to zero -- which seemed to be having little effect in reviving growth -- the central bank aimed to double the amount of money in circulation, seeking to produce annual inflation of about 2 percent.
''This is new territory for the Bank of Japan, and the market is responding to that,'' said Aroop Chatterjee, foreign exchange strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''The Bank of Japan announced very strong monetary policy easing at the start of April.''
However, he said the more immediate trigger for the rate to cross Thursday's threshold was signs of strength in the United States economy.
Amari Akira, Japan's economic revitalization minister, quickly focused attention away from Japan's role in weakening its own currency, in a bid to stave off accusations that Japan was manipulating the yen to bolster its exports. Rather, he said the dollar's strength reflected investors' hopes for an economic comeback in the United States.
''It's the dollar that's in demand because economic recovery in America is gathering steam,'' Mr. Amari said at a morning news conference.
The efforts by the Bank of Japan to continue to flood the economy with liquidity is likely to keep downward pressure on the yen in the coming months. The central bank is following an asset purchase program to inflate the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years.
By mid-morning in Tokyo on Friday, the dollar was trading at 101.09 yen.
Japanese officials say the policy does not overtly pursue a lower yen rate, which could raise tensions with other exporting nations like the United States. But a weaker yen is a welcome development in some ways.
The depreciation of the yen may be a step in the right direction as the authorities try to stimulate some growth. However, Japan still faces many stiff challenges until it breaks out of its period of deflation. It has an aging and shrinking population and cumbersome regulations that make the economy inefficient.
As Mr. Abe has tried to put a new focus on reviving the economy, he has also fought with the central bank's former leaders over setting the 2 percent inflation goal. Mr. Abe's pressure in the end led to the resignation of the bank's previous governor, the moderate Masaaki Shirakawa. His departure led to the appointment of Mr. Kuroda, who shares Mr. Abe's economic philosophy.
Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said some in the market were speculating that the yen had been driven lower by non-Japanese investors. Those investors were anticipating that cash-rich Japanese investors were finally going to start selling their yen holdings to buy American and other foreign bonds in a hunt for higher yields outside Japan.
While the weaker yen is good for Japanese exporters, it makes imported products more expensive. That in turn can make selling foreign goods there harder.
In a statement, the American Automotive Policy Council reacted strongly to Thursday's milestone. ''The depth of Japanese currency manipulation has reached a new low,'' said Matt Blunt, the council's president. He said the yen's weakening will cost American exports and jobs.
Still, there are concerns that too weak a currency could bring pain to a country dependent on imports for its energy and food. The Fukushima nuclear crisis, which has all but shut down Japan's nuclear power program, has already led to surging oil and gas imports and rising energy prices.
News shows have breathlessly covered recent price increases in items like tissue paper and canned tuna, perhaps a sign of the shock that prices should rise at all after more than a decade of deflation, rather than any immediate risk to household finances.
The key, economists say, is how much exporters and other corporations buoyed by the weaker yen will pass on their windfall to consumers, by hiring more workers and raising wages. Mr. Abe himself has been publicly pressuring corporate executives to raise pay, declaring on television last month that companies needed to ''return favorable corporate earnings to their workers,'' prompting a string of companies to declare wage increases or extra bonuses in recent months.
''If wages can rise, then the return to inflation is good news,'' Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said in a recent research note. ''If wages are going to be flat or down, all we are going to see is stagflation.''

HEADLINE: The Health Law and Its Incentives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''What Health Insurance Doesn't Do,'' by Ross Douthat (column, May 5), reflects a common, serious misconception, stating that ''health insurance is useful mostly because it averts financial catastrophe.'' From this, Mr. Douthat concludes that health insurance should be treated like ''normal insurance.''
Health insurance's benefit is not ''mostly or exclusively financial.'' Nor, for most people, is the first purpose of insurance economic protection. 
Rather, health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid's primary benefit is to spread the cost and therefore share the benefits of health care for people who either cannot afford it or will not buy it until it is too late. It helps keep our social network functional.
Health insurance enables us to obtain, without any economic disincentives, basic health care, including vaccinations, childbirth, children's checkups and other routine health care. With insurance, we can all afford and therefore benefit from basic health benefits.
Medicaid is not ''deeply dysfunctional.'' It, like Medicare, actually provides less expensive health care and to a less healthy part of our population than private health insurance.

To the Editor:
Ross Douthat presents an intriguing idea to replace Obamacare's guarantee of full coverage with a plan limited to catastrophic expenses. But he has his politics reversed.
Liberals have offered numerous proposals for similar coverage flexibility, only to be met with cries of ''death panels'' and ''rationing.'' When Mr. Douthat assumes that conservatives are natural allies for his idea, he is looking for support in the wrong place.
ROBERT I. FIELD Philadelphia, May 5, 2013
The writer, a professor of law and of health management and policy at Drexel University, is the author of The Field Clinic, a health policy blog on Philly.com.
To the Editor:
Ross Douthat's statement that liberals ''remain wedded to the dream of a health care bureaucracy that pays'' is disingenuous. Obamacare will provide greater access to health care but will neither diminish health care costs nor provide universal care. Progressive physicians favor a single-payer health plan serving as an insurance fund, leaving physicians free to organize their own practices and patients free to choose their physicians.
''Lump'' payments for a given condition (angina, asthma) rather than individual payments for each test ordered would push physicians to minimize testing rather than maximize it, and thus limit cost. A powerful single provider could negotiate reasonable drug prices, thus decreasing the exorbitant cost of prescription drugs.
Countries with a single-payer system show major reductions in their administrative costs. Pharmaceutical industry and medical insurance company profits are unconscionable. It is possible to improve health care while limiting both bureaucracy and cost.
MARC H. LAVIETES Bradley Beach, N.J., May 6, 2013
The writer, a clinical associate professor of medicine at U.M.D.N.J., is secretary of Physicians for a National Health Program, New York City chapter.
To the Editor:
I am quizzed daily by my patients regarding health care reform. I point out that the problem is not Obamacare in particular, but rather the entire concept of using insurance to cover small financial transactions, thus warping normal market pressures and driving medical costs through the roof. I say, ''Imagine what a gallon of milk would cost if we insured groceries.''
Rather than a quick financial transaction at the front desk to cover my service and office overhead, I have armies of people processing my claims, and the insurance companies have theirs.
The answer to much of our health care woes? Marry the Democrats' insurance mandate to the Republicans' health savings accounts. Our culture will not refuse care, so everyone needs to participate; thus the mandate. The health savings account provides the structure for people to spend their own money on everyday medical expenses, returning market forces to rising costs.
DOUGLAS HAMMERSTROM Colorado Springs, May 5, 2013
The writer practices family medicine.
To the Editor:
The RAND study comparing groups each receiving a different amount of health insurance coverage and finding ''the level of insurance had no significant effect on the participants' actual wellness'' led Ross Douthat to propose a variety of remedies for the seeming overexpenditure. Each related to today's common fee-for-service mode of paying for health care.
Fee-for-service is inflationary and has resisted efforts at cost control for decades. Only through risk-adjusted capitation and accountability through primary care physicians will this country get to cost control, and where quality of care and patient satisfaction are also achieved.
MITCHELL T. RABKIN Milton, Mass., May 6, 2013
The writer, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, is president emeritus of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston.
To the Editor:
Ross Douthat describes the central dilemma of the health care system: expanded insurance doesn't improve health outcomes. Unfortunately, Obamacare just doubles down on the dysfunctional system.
The underlying flaw is that the incentives are perverse on all three sides of the health care triangle. Patients, often divorced from costs, overuse. Health care professionals overcharge, and insurance companies try to deny claims.
Mr. Douthat's solution -- that health insurance policies operate like normal insurance to protect people from financial catastrophe -- makes a lot of sense.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-73), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Fine Lines: American Drawings From the Brooklyn Museum' (through May 26) Although marred by the tone-deaf exhibition design usual to this museum, the first large display of American drawings from its collection spans over 150 years with more than 100 sheets and six sketchbooks. Well-known artists like Winslow Homer, Ralph Blakelock and Louise Nevelson are well represented, but less familiar figures like Joseph Frank Currier, Louis Bouché and Chaim Gross contribute equally to its excellence. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (through May 19) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to trinkets; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (through May 22) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS, is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, from Myanmar, both born in 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (through June 9) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity' (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivotal point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular work, flowed toward it and from it.

Mary Grigoriadis: 'Strokescapes: 1970s-1980s' (through May 18) This splendid little exhibition showcases early warning signs of the Pattern and Decoration movement of the early 1970s, which signaled that American painting could be other than abstract and minimal. Their bright symmetrical designs draw on a host of multicultural sources while exploring still-current concerns with the materials and methods of paintings. They are seen here with later, more free-form and spatially active paintings from the 1980s, forming a group that packs a visual punch.

Peter Piller: 'Umschläge' (through May 18) This metaphorically charged installation of photographic works could be titled ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' Colored diptychs copied from an East German military magazine picture an attractive woman on one side and some kind of impressive military weaponry like tanks, cannons and rockets on the other. Grainy black-and-white photographs of ocean waves and devastated World War I battlefields expand the mythic implications. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Johnson)
Kathy Ruttenberg: 'Nature of the Beast' (through May 18) Combining human figures with the flora and fauna of the natural world, this artist's ambitious ceramic sculptures make her a force to contend with as a narrator and symbolist, a form maker and colorist. In her pieces woodland scenes unfold across skirts; flowers or trees sprout from heads; and sexual tensions are coated with a storybook innocence. Human companionship may be hard to sustain, but, like it or not, we are one with nature. Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, stuxgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Richard Serra: 'Early Work' (through June 15) This terrific exhibition looks back on five formative years in the career of the world's most admired sculptor. One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic procedures like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up four-by-four-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, eight feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability.

Giosetta Fioroni: 'L'Argento' (through June 2) This first American survey of Giosetta Fioroni reveals that we still have much to learn about postwar Italian art, despite recent gallery exhibitions of Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Giorgio Griffa, Gianni Colombo and Luigi Ghirri and museum shows of Michelangelo Pistoletto and Alighiero Boetti. In the silvery, evanescent paintings, drawings and films of Ms. Fioroni, who was born in Rome in 1932, we see how American Pop's celebrities and commodities took on new meanings in a post-fascist society.

Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (through June 16) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (through June 16) One hundred years ago the Armory Show opened in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of home-grown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (through June 9) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (through May 19) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichéd style that demeaned women. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply.

&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

Last Chance
Sadie Benning: 'War Credits' (closes on Sunday) Two abstract paintings, two videos and a gouache on newsprint explore and weave together different formal and social realities, always in distinctive, medium-conscious ways. The serene, subtly handmade paintings use the palette of the American flag; seem formed from solid pieces of color and draw on '60s abstraction without looking derivative. The videos confront American life more directly and bleakly while still attending to abstraction and process. The gouache holds the key.

Morgan Library & Museum: 'Degas, Miss La La and the Cirque Fernando' (closes on Sunday) Viewers catching their first glimpse of ''Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando'' will tend to agree with an early Degas biographer who called the painting ''one of his most surprising canvases.'' But after a close look at this curious 1879 picture of an aerialist hanging from a rope by her teeth (on loan from the National Gallery in London, and displayed with related studies, sketchbooks, circus programs and other ephemera), they will recognize Degas's skeptical eye and classical perspective on modern entertainment. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Kay WalkingStick (closes on Tuesday) This show of New Mexican landscapes is one of the most beautiful ever by this artist. Mesas and arroyos, looking as soft as flowing water, change color from gold to shades of brown in pictures done at different times of the day. There are no figures, but bands of patterning lifted from Navajo rugs and Northern Cheyenne beadwork float like spirits or materialized music across desert vistas in which Cezanne comes to the Rio Grande.

HEADLINE: Three Sisters

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
Not for the faint of heart or weak of bladder, Wang Bing's two-and-a-half-hour ''Three Sisters'' documents extreme poverty in rural China with the compassionate eye and inexhaustible patience of a director whose curiosity about his country's unfortunates never seems to wane. 
Filming for six months in a remote hillside village in 2010, Mr. Wang follows the spirit-crushing lives of a short-tempered peasant and his three little daughters. Their mother ran off long ago, and now Yingying, 10; 6-year-old Zhenzhen; and Fenfen, 4 -- all so malnourished that they look years younger -- spend their days doing chores and herding sheep. But when their father leaves for a job in the city, taking the two youngest girls with him, Yingying is left alone. A grandfather and an aunt live close by, but the girl's isolation and sadness suggest a poignant hopelessness, as though she has reached the age at which she has begun to notice a future. And it's not pretty.
Though less overtly political than Mr. Wang's nine-hour masterpiece from 2003, ''Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks'' (which chronicled China's painful transition from a state-run economy to a free market), ''Three Sisters'' makes its point in lice-infested hovels and with the bleeding feet of endlessly coughing children. A communal meal at a great-uncle's house reveals village elders sniffing at the government's proposed ''rural revival,'' knowing that it really means extra land fees for already strapped peasants. Clearly, the country's economic boom is not trickling down, leaving them frozen in a way of life as ancient as the ground beneath their feet.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Wang Bing In Mandarin, with English subtitles 2 hours 33 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Electronic Music in Chelsea

BYLINE: By A. C. LEE

 BODY:
The Miser can't leave home these days without encountering the AutoTuned pipes of one pop star or another. But while AutoTune's vocal effect may seem like just the latest pop music craze, historians of electronic music point out its distinguished antecedents, in, say, Elvis Presley's slapback echo, Peter Frampton's talk box, or the vocoder used by Laurie Anderson in her unlikely 1981 pop hit, ''O Superman.'' 
Ms. Anderson has only deepened her explorations of electronic sound in the years since, and this weekend is the curator of the third installment of Synth Nights, an ''intergenerational electronic music series'' at the Kitchen in Chelsea.
Friday night's bill features Ebe Oke, an American-born, London-based multimedia artist; Fig, a duo consisting of Yuka C. Honda of the late, great group Cibo Matto on sampler and keyboards, and the Wilco guitarist Nels Cline on guitar and flute; and the composer and improviser Brian Marsella, whose work bridges jazz, classical, world and pop music. Tickets are $15.
Also at the Kitchen, and closing on Saturday, is ''Maniac Shadows,'' a video installation by the Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman investigating the nature of cinematic time, domestic space and feminine consciousness, territory Ms. Akerman has been mapping since ''Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' her 1975 classic of avant-garde cinema. Admission is free.
(Synth Nights, Friday at 8; ''Maniac Shadows,'' Friday from noon to 6 p.m., and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; 212-255-5793; thekitchen.org.)

A Francophone sensibility invades the Lower East Side this weekend in the form of the Cutlog Art Fair. After four seasons in Paris, the New York version will set up shop at the Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, where dozens of galleries and curators, representing cities from Oakland to Antwerp to Tel Aviv, will present art, installations, performances and talks.
Thursday through Sunday nights, from 8 to midnight, a projected-image series called Free Parking will run in a parking lot next to the center, featuring film, video and slide shows on large outdoor screens.
Admission for each day is $15; $12 for students and adults 65 and over; a pass for multiple days is available for an economical $25. Admission to the outdoor image series is free.
(Cutlog Art Fair, Friday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Monday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side; 646-770-1669, cutlogny.org/en.)

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
'Ain't in It for My Health: A Film About Levon Helm' (No rating, 1:23) This documentary about Levon Helm, drummer for the Band and all-around musical powerhouse (who died in 2012), is less a standard talking-head life-and-times than an extended hangout session, mostly filmed at Helm's home in Woodstock, N.Y. He emerges as a wise and wizened raconteur, with a wild streak barely tamed by age and illness. (A. O. Scott)
&#x2605; 'At Any Price' (R, 1:45) If Ramin Bahrani's allegory of American hubris set in the heartland overstates its points, they are still worth making. And the hot-wired performances by Dennis Quaid and Zac Efron as an agribusiness honcho and his volatile son drive them home in a movie that sticks to your ribs and stays in your head. (Stephen Holden) 
'Big Wedding' (R, 1:30) To say that Justin Zackham's farce ''The Big Wedding'' takes the low road doesn't begin to do justice to the sheer awfulness of this star-stuffed, potty-mouthed fiasco directed by the screenwriter of ''The Bucket List.'' (Holden)
'The Company You Keep' (R, 2:05) This earnest, well-intentioned movie with a blue-ribbon cast, directed by Robert Redford, has its moments. But it also elicits frustration that the story had to be packaged as a conventional, not very suspenseful fugitive thriller with a bogus Hollywood ending. (Holden)
'The Croods' (PG, 1:36) This animated film about a prehistoric family has a wearyingly familiar core dynamic -- restless teenager, overprotective father -- but a lavish look and an appealing female lead (thanks to the voice-over work of Emma Stone). It is at its most amusing when riffing on how cave dwellers might have reacted to new phenomena, like fire and shoes. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Dead Man's Burden' (No rating, 1:33) Set in New Mexico immediately after the Civil War, Jared Moshé's morally complex, stylistically minimalist western brings together a struggling young couple (Clare Bowen and David Call), the fate of their parched homestead, and a long-lost brother (Barlow Jacobs) trailing twisted loyalties and inconvenient principles. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Evil Dead' (R, 1:31) Directed with competency though not nearly enough humor by Fede Alvarez, this remake of Sam Raimi's 1981 horror film about a cabin of cult curiosities, doesn't have the original's wooden performances, puffy clothes and hairdos or its amusingly crude special effects, but it sure does share its blood lust. Let it bleed, indeed. (Manohla Dargis)
'42' (PG-13, 2:08) The inspiring story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), recruited by Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) to integrate professional baseball, is told simply and effectively by Brian Helgeland, who wrote and directed. The movie is earnest and a little stiff, but it paints an emotionally accessible picture of the pervasive racism that Robinson faced, and the loneliness of his struggle with it. (Scott)
'From Up on Poppy Hill' (PG, 1:31) This charming animated feature from Ghibli Studios takes a nostalgic look back at Yokohama in 1963, when two teenagers meet, fall in love, and discover that they share family secrets dating back to the war. (Scott)
'G.I. Joe: Retaliation' (PG-13, 1:50) With a sequel to a movie about a Hasbro toy, you can kind of guess what you're getting: a lot of noise with occasional plot mixed in. Only a few G.I. Joes survive after a devastating attack ordered against them by the president, who is behaving as if his body has been taken over by a malevolent impostor, which it has. Dwayne Johnson plays Roadblock, who leads the surviving Joes on a mission to set things right. Fans of the G.I. Joe mythology will enjoy seeing how some new additions, like Firefly and Lady Jaye, are brought to life. (Genzlinger)
'Greetings From Tim Buckley' (No rating, 1:39) This fiction from Daniel Algrant looks at two musicians who died young and were largely strangers, Tim Buckley (Ben Rosenfield) and his son Jeff Buckley (Penn Badgley), and goes right for worship: it's sweet, sentimental, almost inevitably touching if not persuasive. It brushes against the thorns in each man's life without drawing blood. (Dargis)
'The Host' (PG-13, 2:05) The director Andrew Niccol (''Gattaca'') can't do much to enliven this dull, derivative story, which he adapted from a Stephenie Meyer best seller. A combination of unoriginal science-fiction themes, young-adult pandering and bottom-line calculation, the movie has one virtue, a fine Saoirse Ronan, who plays a rebel fighting an alien invasion. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Iceman' (R, 1:45) Michael Shannon's mesmerizing portrayal of Richard Kuklinski, a notorious contract killer, has the paradoxical quality, peculiar to many great screen performances, of being unreadable and transparent. If the narrow biographical focus of this movie keeps it from being a masterpiece of the crime genre, it is still an indelible portrait that clinches Mr. Shannon's status as a major film actor. (Holden)
'In the House' (R, 1:45) The latest from François Ozon (''Swimming Pool,'' ''Under the Sand'') is a teasing, semi-surreal comedy about the tricky line between fantasy and reality. Fabrice Luchini, France's master of middle-aged neurosis, plays a literature teacher who falls under the spell of a student's tales of mischief and obsession. The film itself has a beguiling magic that builds steadily for about an hour before dissipating in a flurry of willful narrative perversity. (Scott)
'Iron Man 3' (PG-13, 2:09) Big, noisy and empty, this third franchise installment plays out much like the first two movies -- stuff blows up, and then more stuff blows up -- though this one exploits a great deal of iconography from Sept. 11 and its aftershocks. Robert Downey Jr. serves as the delivery system for the usual Tony Stark poses and quips; Shane Black directed. (Dargis)
'Love Is All You Need' (R, 1:50, in Danish, English and Italian) For the Danish filmmaker Susanne Bier (''Brothers,'' ''Things We Lost in the Fire,'' ''In a Better World''), ''Love Is All You Need'' is a conspicuously strained detour from serious drama into romantic comedy. A Scandinavian heaviness hangs over the film whose lighter side feels like whitewash applied to disguise an underlying dourness. (Holden)
'Midnight's Children' (No rating, 2:20, in English and Hindi) To do cinematic justice to Salman Rushdie's novel ''Midnight's Children,'' it would take a entertainer with Bollywood flair and a literary bent; that is, a directorial equivalent of Mr. Rushdie would need to be conjured. Deepa Mehta, who does the honors here, seems a mismatch for the gleeful too-muchness of the material. Mr. Rushdie wrote the script himself, wrestling his epic to movie-acceptable size. The result is a modest, modestly engaging movie that feels drained of the mythic juice that powers the novel. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Mud' (PG-13, 2:10) In Jeff Nichols's third feature, two Arkansas boys (Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland) meet a mysterious drifter named Mud (Matthew McConaughey) and are drawn into an improbable web of romance and intrigue. Despite an overcrowded story, the movie is full of sly backwoods humor and fine performances, including Reese Witherspoon as the love of Mud's misbegotten life. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'No' (R, 1:58, in Spanish) In Pablo Larraín's sly, smart, fictionalized tale about the art of the sell during a fraught period in Chilean history, advertising isn't only an art; it's also a way of life. That's certainly true for the young adman, René (Gael García Bernal), who signs on to a campaign to oust Gen. Augusto Pinochet. René may be vaguely interested in selling the country on life without Pinochet, but what reels him in is the challenge of pitching a superior product. (Dargis)
'Oblivion' (PG-13, 2:04) Tom Cruise stars in this lackluster science-fiction adventure, which takes place long after a cataclysmic war between earthlings and extraterrestrials. Directed by Joseph Kosinski (''Tron: Legacy'') and stitched together from bits and pieces that evoke numerous other, far better far-out tales and ideas, conceits and characters from the likes of Philip K. Dick and Duncan Jones (''Moon''), the movie never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy. (Dargis)
'Olympus Has Fallen' (R, 1:58) The White House has been taken over by terrorists! Who will save us? Gerard Butler! Sorry. (Scott)
'One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das' (No rating, 1:12) The native Long Islander at the heart of this documentary is charismatic in his Everyman ease, and concert scenes of him singing kirtan -- a sort of call-and-response chant, normally of Sanskrit names for God -- are attractive even if you aren't drawn to the music. It's a shame his life, with its despair but mostly devotion, is recounted here by telling more than showing. But it's still quite a life, what with his finding a guru and losing him before discovering a world-renowned calling. (David DeWitt)
'An Oversimplification of Her Beauty' (No rating, 1:24) This lovely and dazzling feature-length debut by the Brooklyn filmmaker Terence Nance traces his failure to get together with a friend. The tragicomic result is a mixtape that memorializes, and not so sneakily celebrates, the sweet angst of a certain kind of romantic limbo. The film is a rich, organic and funny piece of urban poetry, making use of candid video, subtly colored animation and stop-motion, playful direct address and suavely chosen music and sonic bridges. (Nicolas Rapold)
'Oz the Great and Powerful' (PG, 2:10) Save your money, spare yourself the headache and watch ''The Wizard of Oz'' again instead. One day, when you will catch a few minutes of this ''Oz'' on cable, you will shudder at its horror and you will thank me. (Dargis)
'Pain & Gain' (R, 2:09) Michael Bay's latest is a scuzzy, funny slice of South Florida true crime in which Mark Wahlberg leads a gang of idiots in pursuit of the American dream. Mr. Bay, a muscular cinematic populist, refuses the easy route of satire, and the result is both repellent and impressive in its celebration of greed, hedonism and physical fitness. (Scott)
'The Place Beyond the Pines' (R, 2:20) Derek Cianfrance's film is a sprawling, heartfelt melodrama about two men (Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper) whose fates become entangled, along with those of their sons. The film does not quite fulfill its epic ambitions, but its novelistic sense of detail and strong performances (from Eva Mendes as well as the two male leads) are impressive. (Scott)
'The Reluctant Fundamentalist' (No rating, 2:08) Mira Nair's thuddingly crude take on ''The Reluctant Fundamentalist,'' a 2007 novel by the Pakistan-born writer Mohsin Hamid, is blunt where the book is subtle. It stars a fine Riz Ahmed as a young Pakistani lecturer grievously, possibly violently disenchanted with the United States who narrates his tale to a mysterious stranger (Liev Schreiber). (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Renoir' (R, 1:51, in French) Set in the wild paradise of the Cote d'Azur, Gilles Bourdos's compassionate late-life portrait of the French Impressionist painter and his relationships with a voluptuous 15-year-old model and with his son Jean, injured in World War I, is a gorgeous cinematic extension of his canvasses. (Holden)
'Room 237' (No rating, 1:42) An ode to movie love at its most delirious, Rodney Ascher's enjoyable nonfiction movie looks at some serious film fans who take ''The Shining,'' Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece, very, very seriously. Convinced that Kubrick wove secrets and signs into his film, these true believers find clues about the Holocaust in elevators and messages about the Apollo 11 Moon landing in a sweater. It will make a great double bill with ''The Shining.'' (Dargis)
'The Sapphires' (PG-13, 1:39) This sloppy, rollicking, music-filled movie, directed by Wayne Blair and inspired by a true story, takes a look at some familiar '60s drama -- Vietnam, the struggle against racism -- from a fresh angle, focusing on the travails of an all-girl, indigenous Australian singing group. (Scott)
'Scary Movie V' (PG-13, 1:35) The ''Scary Movie'' screenwriters Pat Proft and David Zucker (who doesn't direct this time) return, taking hit-or-miss pot shots at the ''Paranormal Activity'' series, ''Mama,'' ''Black Swan'' and ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes,'' with nods to others of their ilk. A capable Ashley Tisdale (inheriting Anna Faris's scream-queen mantle), rare flashes of wit and stunt cameos keep the proceedings only intermittently entertaining. (Andy Webster)
'Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's' (PG-13, 1:33) While this documentary by Matthew Miele imparts some insight into noteworthy employees of the high-end Manhattan department store, it essentially amounts to a numbing litany of endorsements from the likes of Giorgio Armani, Marc Jacobs and the Olsen twins. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Side Effects' (R, 1:55) This chilly, twisty thriller -- which Steven Soderbergh has said will be his last feature, at least for a while -- changes direction several times. A young woman suffering from depression (the spooky Rooney Mara) does something terrible, apparently under the influence of a new antidepressant. Her sympathetic psychiatrist (Jude Law) tries to figure out what happened, and by the time he does the context of the crime has passed from corporate conspiracy to everyday lust and greed. Mr. Soderbergh is a skillful orchestrator of moods and effects, with a sharp eye for the telling details and uncomfortable contradictions of modern life. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Something in the Air' (No rating, 2:02, in French) With characteristic grace and insight, Olivier Assayas follows a group of French adolescents caught up in the militancy and frustration of the early 1970s, after the bloom of May 1968 had faded. Without romanticizing or condescending to the characters, and drawing to some extent on his own experiences, Mr. Assayas captures the contradictions of the period, as well as the fleeting intensity and passionate seriousness of youth. (Scott)
'The Source Family' (No rating, 1:38) Documenting the hippy-dippy lifestyle and hedonistic principles of Hollywood's favorite 1970s cult -- led by the self-professed guru and suspected bank robber Jim Baker, a k a Father Yod -- Maria Demopoulos and Jodi Wille's disturbing film is an object lesson in psychological manipulation. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'Spring Breakers' (R, 1:34) In his latest, the pasticheur and cultural vulgarian Harmony Korine, takes four beauties, including the former Disney teen queens Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens, to Florida on spring break. There, they meet James Franco in a film that, from one angle, comes across as a savage social commentary that skitters from one idea to another, including white faces, black masks, celebrity, the American dream, the limits of self-interest and the search for an authentic self. From another, it comes off as the apotheosis of the excesses it so spectacularly displays. (Dargis)
'Trance' (R, 1:41) This speed-freaky neo-noir from the British director Danny Boyle hinges on an art heist that -- with a lot of literal smoke and metaphoric mirrors -- leads to twists, turns and an old-fashioned story that he has retrofitted with his turbocharged style. The super-fine cast includes James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson. (Dargis)
'Tyler Perry's Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor' (PG-13, 1:51) Mr. Perry has long embraced religion in his films, but perhaps never more so than in this heavy-handed sermon against deviation from the church, monogamy and the righteous path of cooking meals for a husband. The actors (with the exception of Kim Kardashian) are appealing, but the pace is slack and the preachiness stifling. (Webster)
'Upstream Color' (No rating, 1:36) A man, a woman, some worms, a lot of pigs and the great big beyond all come into complicated play in the second feature from the writer and director Shane Carruth (''Primer''). Despite the cosmic reaching and jigsaw montage, the movie isn't the head-scratcher it seems so just ignore the story and go with the trippy flow. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Voyage to Italy' (No rating, 1:37) Roberto Rossellini's film -- which follows a British couple (Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders) as they travel to Naples to sell a piece of property -- was so maligned in 1955, the year of its American release, that it did not receive a review in The New York Times. Film Forum is now screening a restored digital version of the film, which, for all its charming glimpses of a bygone era, feels unnervingly contemporary. Rossellini's way of dissolving narrative into atmosphere, of locating drama in the unspoken inner lives of his characters, anticipates some of what Michelangelo Antonioni would do a few years later in ''L'Avventura.'' (Scott)
&#x2605; 'What Maisie Knew' (R, 1:38) Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan play a divorced couple competing for Worst Parent of the Year honors in this smart, delicate updating of Henry James's 1897 novel. The directors, David Siegel and Scott McGehee (''Suture,'' ''The Deep End''), follow James in limiting themselves to the point of view of Maisie (Onata Aprile), the couple's young daughter. She sees a great deal, but how much she understands remains a tantalizing and heartbreaking mystery. With Alexander Skarsgard and Joanna Vanderham as Maisie's young stepparents. (Scott)
Film Series
'Booed at Cannes' (Friday through Thursday) It may be the world's most prestigious film festival, but Cannes, which begins its 66th edition on Wednesday, is famous for its easily outraged audiences. BAMcinématek's slyly conceived retrospective, which runs through May 23, features films that were widely hooted at their premiere screenings, several of them quite justifiably (like Tony Richardson's ludicrous ''Mademoiselle'' on May 21), but many others received that treatment just because they didn't conform to expectations. A prime example is Michelangelo Antonioni's ''Eclisse,'' which screens four times on Friday; its hauntingly beautiful final sequence, in which Antonioni abandons the narrative for a sequence of eerie urban landscape shots, reportedly brought down the house with howls of derision. Also this week: David Lynch's ''Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me'' (Saturday), which does seem pretty silly next to Jean Eustache's masterpiece ''The Mother and the Whore'' (Sunday). BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
Chinese Realities/Documentary Visions (Friday through Thursday) China's economic transformation during the last two decades has yielded some powerful and strikingly original documentaries and fiction films grounded in documentary observation, made both with and without government sanction. This monthlong series features a generous sampling of the available styles, beginning with a personal appearance by the fiercely independent Wu Wenguang, whose 1990 ''Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers'' placed emerging digital cinema technology in the service of sustained, objective observation. Mr. Wu will screen ''Bumming in Beijing,'' about an artists' colony trying to absorb the shock of Tiananmen Square, at 7 p.m. on Friday, and participate in a discussion with the critic Kevin B. Lee, a co-curator of this film series. Other highlights from the first week: Zhang Yuan's 1990 ''Mama'' (Saturday at 1 p.m. and Wednesday at 7 p.m.), widely considered to be China's first independent dramatic film; Zhang Yimou's 1992 ''The Story of Qiu Ju'' (Saturday at 4 p.m. and next Friday at 8 p.m.) in which the expressionistic director of ''Red Sorghum'' shifts into hyper-realism for the dramatized story of a village woman (Gong Li) and her stubborn campaign against bureaucratic indifference; and the government-sponsored ''No. 16 Barkhor South Street,'' a 1996 examination of a Chinese social services agency in Lhasa, Tibet (Sunday at 2 p.m.). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $8 to $12. (Kehr)

Previews and Openings 'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' (in previews
opens on May 30) Once you've turned Wedekind into an alt-pop juggernaut, Brecht should be a snap, right? Duncan Sheik, whose ''Spring Awakening'' score earned him a Tony Award, has contributed a new score to this 1940s parable about goodness in a diabolical world. Christopher Lloyd heads a cast that includes the dependable supporting performers Mary Testa, Tom Riis Farrell and Elizabeth A. Davis. The director, Brian Kulick, did right by Brecht's play ''Galileo'' last year. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Eric Grode) 'A Family for All Occasions' (in previews
opens on Sunday) The Labyrinth Theater looks to two of its leading lights, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the playwright Bob Glaudini, for this latest look into familial dysfunction. Mr. Hoffman starred in Mr. Glaudini's ''Jack Goes Boating'' in 2007, and now he's directing a group of other Labyrinth stalwarts (including Deirdre O'Connell and Jeffrey DeMunn) in this look at the upheavals that happen when a recent retiree's daughter brings her new boyfriend home. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Grode) 'Far From Heaven' (in previews
opens on June 2) It's been a busy spring for Richard Greenberg, who has opened two new Broadway plays, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' which has already closed, and ''The Assembled Parties.'' Here he has joined the ''Grey Gardens'' creative team for the musicalization of a movie -- the lush 2002 homage to Douglas Sirk's febrile melodramas, in which racial and sexual taboos topple in a seemingly idyllic Connecticut town in 1957. Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale lead the whopping cast of 18 -- the largest Playwrights Horizons has ever fielded. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode) 'The Golden Dragon' (in previews
opens on Wednesday) For those trying to keep abreast of the more exciting playwriting voices beyond the United States and Britain, the Play Company has become an invaluable resource. The acclaimed German playwright Roland Schimmelpfennig, little seen on these shores, presents a dark comedy about all hell breaking loose in a pan-Asian restaurant. With the rising director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar (''These Seven Sicknesses'') at the helm, the production shouldn't be hurting for ambition. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, playco.org. (Grode) 'The Master Builder' (previews start on Sunday
opens on May 21) Grandiosity seems to come easy to John Turturro, who has played the Brechtian dictator Arturo Ui, Howard Cosell and ''the Jesus.'' (That's Jesus Quintana, in ''The Big Lebowski.'') He and the director Andrei Belgrader scored a hit at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2008 with a starry production of Beckett's ''Endgame''
the two men have returned to take on Ibsen's 1892 classic tale of obsession and ambition. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode) 'Murder Ballad' (in previews
reopens on May 22) A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who is taking over for Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley) 'Queerspawn' (previews start on Friday
opens on Tuesday) You know you've arrived when you inspire both a play and a musical. Such is the state of the sex columnist and ''It Gets Better'' creator Dan Savage, whose parenting chronicle ''The Kid'' yielded a New Group musical a few years ago. Now it's time for the group known as A Collection of Shiny Objects to address Mr. Savage's freshman year of high school, which clearly had plenty of room for improvement: small town, two mommies and plenty of bullies. Starring the inestimable David Greenspan. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Grode) 'Reasons to Be Happy' (previews start on Thursday
opens on June 11) For anyone going through ''The Office'' withdrawal, the headline here will be Jenna Fischer (a k a Pam) in her Off Broadway debut. For everyone else, the news is that Neil LaBute has created a sequel -- the MCC Theater is calling it a companion piece -- to his understated (by LaButian standards) 2008 gem ''Reasons to Be Pretty.'' All four of its characters are back for more high-octane couplings and uncouplings, with Ms. Fischer joined by Josh Hamilton, Leslie Bibb and the LaBute regular Fred Weller. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode) 'Somewhere Fun' (previews start on Wednesday
opens on June 4) Jenny Schwartz made plenty of friends in high theatrical places -- including Edward Albee -- with her linguistically and emotionally ambitious ''God's Ear'' in 2007. In her first play since then, Ms. Schwartz and her ''God's Ear'' director, Anne Kauffman, explore an impromptu reunion between two women who met 35 years ago. Ms. Schwartz's ear for the quirks and clichés of the English language remains intact, though her cast is a bit starrier this time around: Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew are the two women. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Grode) 'Three Kinds of Exile' (previews start on Wednesday
opens on June 11) John Guare's new play has a dependably meaty subject -- the lives of three noted émigrés from Poland and Czechoslovakia, among them the writer Witold Gombrowicz -- and one unexpected co-star: Mr. Guare himself, who is making his Off Broadway acting debut 45 years after winning his first Obie Award for playwriting. Among his co-stars are the actors-turned-authors David Pittu and Martin Moran, so they'll have plenty to talk about. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode) 'The Weir' (previews start on Wednesday
opens on May 23) Irish Repertory Theater's offerings tend toward the comforting, which makes this revival of Conor McPherson's 1997 bone-chiller of a play all the more intriguing. The presence of a young woman in a remote Irish pub one windy night shifts the usual whiskey-warmed blarney into something altogether more eerie and astonishing. Irish Rep's producing director, Ciaran O'Reilly, directs a group of company regulars. 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode) Broadway 'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood) 'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow, and starting on Thursday, Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley) &#x2605
'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynn Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'The Big Knife' Bobby Cannavale stars in the first (and last?) Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's 1949 drama about a movie star in a moral bind: to knuckle under to studio blackmail and sign his life and artistic aspirations away, or leave behind the corrupt system and risk reprisals. Doug Hughes's sluggish production doesn't make a case for the play's enduring merits
Odets handled similar themes with more urgency and cogency in ''Golden Boy,'' seen earlier this season in a superior revival (2:20). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood) &#x2605
'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) &#x2605
'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) &#x2605
'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood) 'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Orphans' In Lyle Kessler's 1983 play about motherless thugs, knives, guns, rope and fists are deployed to violent ends. Yet Daniel Sullivan's limp revival somehow plays like a sentimental sitcom, perhaps a low-rent ''Modern Family.'' Alec Baldwin, in slippery mode, plays the avuncular gangster, held hostage by two brothers: Ben Foster and the remarkably hyperkinetic Tom Sturridge (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'Bull' Mike Bartlett's efficient three-character, 55-minute exercise in human brutality, in which the workplace is transformed into a boxing ring, isn't as rich or complex as his ''Cockfight Play.'' But as directed by Clare Lizzimore, it may provide catharsis for theatergoers seeking to purge tensions by watching a metaphoric version of what happens during their regular office hours (:55). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley) &#x2605
'The Call' Tanya Barfield's thoughtful, absorbing drama explores the tensions that arise when a white couple (the terrific Kerry Butler and Kelly AuCoin) decide to adopt an African baby. Their African-American friends, a lesbian couple well played by Eisa Davis and Crystal A. Dickinson, have different perspectives on their choice. Leigh Silverman directs (1:50). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood) 'Collapse' This manic comedy follows four characters, each dealing with anxiety (1:30). New York City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Ken Jaworowski) 'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates) &#x2605
'The Drawer Boy' The Oberon Theater Ensemble does a fine job with this lovely play by Michael Healey about two farmers, one with a brain injury, and the writer who comes to observe them for the purposes of writing a play about farming. The humor is left wry and dry, and when it comes time to reveal the story of how the two men arrived at their present state, heartstrings are tugged expertly (2:00). Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Neil Genzlinger) &#x2605
'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster) &#x2605
'_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell) &#x2605
'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley) 'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' The cabaret singer Mark Nadler does an effective job of transforming what last year was a cabaret show into a theatrical production, annotating a journey through music that was created during the Weimar Republic or by composers like Kurt Weill after they escaped Naziism. The show starts out feeling like a pleasant history lesson but ends as a profoundly personal journey (1:45). Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Genzlinger) 'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood) 'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco) 'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz) &#x2605
'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' When Dave Malloy's improbably wonderful electro-pop opera based on ''War & Peace'' opened in the fall, audience members were crowded together with Tolstoy's characters in an intimate setting: Ars Nova's theater, which had been transformed into a kind of basement nightclub, chockablock with tables and complete with vodka and pierogis. Singing about their loves and woes, the introspective, emotional, impetuous characters somehow felt like old friends -- and drinking buddies. Can that spirit be retained when the show moves to a new home in the meatpacking district, a Russian supper club built specifically for the production? Rachel Chavkin, who made marvelous use of her space and cast in the original staging, directs again (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Saltz) 'Nikolai and the Others' An estimable cast of 18, directed by the ensemble master David Cromer, works in harmonious disharmony in Richard Nelson's sprawling, occasionally soporific portrait of transplanted eminent Russians in leafy Connecticut in the late 1940s. The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman) &#x2605
'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood) &#x2605
'Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance)' The great avant-garde auteur Richard Foreman returns to the stage with a gleeful brain-bender in which a man (Rocco Sisto) recalls his wilting salad days. Memory lane, for Mr. Foreman, turns out to be near Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, and his nostalgic frame of mind melts and warps like a Salvador Dalí clock. Great fun for organic head trippers (1:05). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley) 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley) 'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30). Gym at Judson, Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, judson.org/The-Gym. (Brantley) Off Off Broadway &#x2605
'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (David Rooney) &#x2605
'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley) 'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell) Long-Running Shows 'Avenue Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:15). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. 'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' This adaptation of three of Stan and Jan Berenstain's children's books is pleasant enough, but the cubs are showing their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. 'Black Angels Over Tuskegee' The tear-jerker story of these trailblazing African-American pilots (2:30).

'Buyer & Cellar' (closes on Sunday) Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Rooney) &#x2605
'Cirque du Soleil: Totem' (closes on Sunday) This offering from Cirque du Soleil is far more exciting than some of its past shows, and more geared toward adults than children (2:30). Lot C, Citi Field, 126th Street and Roosevelt Avenue, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, cirquedusoleil.com/totem. (Jaworowski) 'Jekyll & Hyde' (closes on Sunday) Frank Wildhorn musicals are the crab grass of Broadway, and this gothic musical from 1997, with a cliché-riddled book and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, started the scourge. Constantine Maroulis (''Rock of Ages''), as the titular duo, and the disco diva Deborah Cox, as the hooker with lungs of steel to match a heart of gold, sing the throat-thrashing score with impressive ease (2:20). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood) 'Mama, I Want to Sing' (closes on Saturday) A largely new cast gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Grode) 'The Megile of Itzak Manger' (closes on Sunday) In this Yiddish-language production inspired by the old scenery-chewing Purim spiels of Eastern Europe, a Polish circus troupe retells the story of the Book of Esther. Klezmer-style musical numbers are supplemented by some novice-level juggling, aerial silks and cartwheels, as well as craft-project-like puppets. The show does not really invest enough resources in any of these circus acts to deliver much that is striking or memorable, though, and the result looks a lot like a community theater production designed for children (1:30). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (646) 312-5073, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Rampell) &#x2605
'La Ruta' (closes on Sunday) The theater is a tractor-trailer, and inside are cardboard boxes for playgoers to sit on while making the journey with immigrants being smuggled into Texas. This site-specific Working Theater production of Ed Cardona Jr.'s drama cannot fail to humanize the individuals trying to come to America, and the menace they face in doing so (1:10). Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (212) 244-3300, theworkingtheater.org. (Daniel M. Gold) 'Scrambled Eggs: It's Not Always Over Easy' (closes on Saturday) This warm but unchallenging play follows a woman who looks back on her uneventful life (1:20). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, scrambledeggstheplay.com. (Jaworowski) &#x2605
 'Talley's Folly' (closes on Sunday) Danny Burstein and Sarah Paulson give performances of translucent feeling in this loving Roundabout Theater Company revival of Lanford Wilson's 1979 romantic pas de deux about two misfits in 1944 Missouri trying to find a mutual rhythm. Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood) 'Wanda's Monster' (closes on Sunday) Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming hourlong production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00). Theater 3, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (646) 250-1178, makingbookssing.org. (Laurel Graeber) PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY SARA KRULWICH/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Previews and Openings
'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' (in previews; opens on May 30) Once you've turned Wedekind into an alt-pop juggernaut, Brecht should be a snap, right? Duncan Sheik, whose ''Spring Awakening'' score earned him a Tony Award, has contributed a new score to this 1940s parable about goodness in a diabolical world. Christopher Lloyd heads a cast that includes the dependable supporting performers Mary Testa, Tom Riis Farrell and Elizabeth A. Davis. The director, Brian Kulick, did right by Brecht's play ''Galileo'' last year. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Eric Grode) 
'A Family for All Occasions' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The Labyrinth Theater looks to two of its leading lights, Philip Seymour Hoffman and the playwright Bob Glaudini, for this latest look into familial dysfunction. Mr. Hoffman starred in Mr. Glaudini's ''Jack Goes Boating'' in 2007, and now he's directing a group of other Labyrinth stalwarts (including Deirdre O'Connell and Jeffrey DeMunn) in this look at the upheavals that happen when a recent retiree's daughter brings her new boyfriend home. Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Grode)
'Far From Heaven' (in previews; opens on June 2) It's been a busy spring for Richard Greenberg, who has opened two new Broadway plays, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' which has already closed, and ''The Assembled Parties.'' Here he has joined the ''Grey Gardens'' creative team for the musicalization of a movie -- the lush 2002 homage to Douglas Sirk's febrile melodramas, in which racial and sexual taboos topple in a seemingly idyllic Connecticut town in 1957. Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale lead the whopping cast of 18 -- the largest Playwrights Horizons has ever fielded. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Golden Dragon' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) For those trying to keep abreast of the more exciting playwriting voices beyond the United States and Britain, the Play Company has become an invaluable resource. The acclaimed German playwright Roland Schimmelpfennig, little seen on these shores, presents a dark comedy about all hell breaking loose in a pan-Asian restaurant. With the rising director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar (''These Seven Sicknesses'') at the helm, the production shouldn't be hurting for ambition. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, playco.org. (Grode)
'The Master Builder' (previews start on Sunday; opens on May 21) Grandiosity seems to come easy to John Turturro, who has played the Brechtian dictator Arturo Ui, Howard Cosell and ''the Jesus.'' (That's Jesus Quintana, in ''The Big Lebowski.'') He and the director Andrei Belgrader scored a hit at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2008 with a starry production of Beckett's ''Endgame''; the two men have returned to take on Ibsen's 1892 classic tale of obsession and ambition. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Murder Ballad' (in previews; reopens on May 22) A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who is taking over for Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Queerspawn' (previews start on Friday; opens on Tuesday) You know you've arrived when you inspire both a play and a musical. Such is the state of the sex columnist and ''It Gets Better'' creator Dan Savage, whose parenting chronicle ''The Kid'' yielded a New Group musical a few years ago. Now it's time for the group known as A Collection of Shiny Objects to address Mr. Savage's freshman year of high school, which clearly had plenty of room for improvement: small town, two mommies and plenty of bullies. Starring the inestimable David Greenspan. Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Grode)
'Reasons to Be Happy' (previews start on Thursday; opens on June 11) For anyone going through ''The Office'' withdrawal, the headline here will be Jenna Fischer (a k a Pam) in her Off Broadway debut. For everyone else, the news is that Neil LaBute has created a sequel -- the MCC Theater is calling it a companion piece -- to his understated (by LaButian standards) 2008 gem ''Reasons to Be Pretty.'' All four of its characters are back for more high-octane couplings and uncouplings, with Ms. Fischer joined by Josh Hamilton, Leslie Bibb and the LaBute regular Fred Weller. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Somewhere Fun' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 4) Jenny Schwartz made plenty of friends in high theatrical places -- including Edward Albee -- with her linguistically and emotionally ambitious ''God's Ear'' in 2007. In her first play since then, Ms. Schwartz and her ''God's Ear'' director, Anne Kauffman, explore an impromptu reunion between two women who met 35 years ago. Ms. Schwartz's ear for the quirks and clichés of the English language remains intact, though her cast is a bit starrier this time around: Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew are the two women. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Grode)
'Three Kinds of Exile' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 11) John Guare's new play has a dependably meaty subject -- the lives of three noted émigrés from Poland and Czechoslovakia, among them the writer Witold Gombrowicz -- and one unexpected co-star: Mr. Guare himself, who is making his Off Broadway acting debut 45 years after winning his first Obie Award for playwriting. Among his co-stars are the actors-turned-authors David Pittu and Martin Moran, so they'll have plenty to talk about. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Weir' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on May 23) Irish Repertory Theater's offerings tend toward the comforting, which makes this revival of Conor McPherson's 1997 bone-chiller of a play all the more intriguing. The presence of a young woman in a remote Irish pub one windy night shifts the usual whiskey-warmed blarney into something altogether more eerie and astonishing. Irish Rep's producing director, Ciaran O'Reilly, directs a group of company regulars. 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow, and starting on Thursday, Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynn Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Big Knife' Bobby Cannavale stars in the first (and last?) Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's 1949 drama about a movie star in a moral bind: to knuckle under to studio blackmail and sign his life and artistic aspirations away, or leave behind the corrupt system and risk reprisals. Doug Hughes's sluggish production doesn't make a case for the play's enduring merits; Odets handled similar themes with more urgency and cogency in ''Golden Boy,'' seen earlier this season in a superior revival (2:20). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Orphans' In Lyle Kessler's 1983 play about motherless thugs, knives, guns, rope and fists are deployed to violent ends. Yet Daniel Sullivan's limp revival somehow plays like a sentimental sitcom, perhaps a low-rent ''Modern Family.'' Alec Baldwin, in slippery mode, plays the avuncular gangster, held hostage by two brothers: Ben Foster and the remarkably hyperkinetic Tom Sturridge (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bull' Mike Bartlett's efficient three-character, 55-minute exercise in human brutality, in which the workplace is transformed into a boxing ring, isn't as rich or complex as his ''Cockfight Play.'' But as directed by Clare Lizzimore, it may provide catharsis for theatergoers seeking to purge tensions by watching a metaphoric version of what happens during their regular office hours (:55). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Call' Tanya Barfield's thoughtful, absorbing drama explores the tensions that arise when a white couple (the terrific Kerry Butler and Kelly AuCoin) decide to adopt an African baby. Their African-American friends, a lesbian couple well played by Eisa Davis and Crystal A. Dickinson, have different perspectives on their choice. Leigh Silverman directs (1:50).

'Collapse' This manic comedy follows four characters, each dealing with anxiety (1:30). New York City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'The Drawer Boy' The Oberon Theater Ensemble does a fine job with this lovely play by Michael Healey about two farmers, one with a brain injury, and the writer who comes to observe them for the purposes of writing a play about farming. The humor is left wry and dry, and when it comes time to reveal the story of how the two men arrived at their present state, heartstrings are tugged expertly (2:00). Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' The cabaret singer Mark Nadler does an effective job of transforming what last year was a cabaret show into a theatrical production, annotating a journey through music that was created during the Weimar Republic or by composers like Kurt Weill after they escaped Naziism. The show starts out feeling like a pleasant history lesson but ends as a profoundly personal journey (1:45). Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Genzlinger)
'The Last Five Years' Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' When Dave Malloy's improbably wonderful electro-pop opera based on ''War & Peace'' opened in the fall, audience members were crowded together with Tolstoy's characters in an intimate setting: Ars Nova's theater, which had been transformed into a kind of basement nightclub, chockablock with tables and complete with vodka and pierogis. Singing about their loves and woes, the introspective, emotional, impetuous characters somehow felt like old friends -- and drinking buddies. Can that spirit be retained when the show moves to a new home in the meatpacking district, a Russian supper club built specifically for the production? Rachel Chavkin, who made marvelous use of her space and cast in the original staging, directs again (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Saltz)
'Nikolai and the Others' An estimable cast of 18, directed by the ensemble master David Cromer, works in harmonious disharmony in Richard Nelson's sprawling, occasionally soporific portrait of transplanted eminent Russians in leafy Connecticut in the late 1940s. The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance)' The great avant-garde auteur Richard Foreman returns to the stage with a gleeful brain-bender in which a man (Rocco Sisto) recalls his wilting salad days. Memory lane, for Mr. Foreman, turns out to be near Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, and his nostalgic frame of mind melts and warps like a Salvador Dalí clock. Great fun for organic head trippers (1:05). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30).

&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00).

'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' (closes on Sunday) Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30).

'Jekyll & Hyde' (closes on Sunday) Frank Wildhorn musicals are the crab grass of Broadway, and this gothic musical from 1997, with a cliché-riddled book and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, started the scourge. Constantine Maroulis (''Rock of Ages''), as the titular duo, and the disco diva Deborah Cox, as the hooker with lungs of steel to match a heart of gold, sing the throat-thrashing score with impressive ease (2:20). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway at 45th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Mama, I Want to Sing' (closes on Saturday) A largely new cast gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them (2:00).

'The Megile of Itzak Manger' (closes on Sunday) In this Yiddish-language production inspired by the old scenery-chewing Purim spiels of Eastern Europe, a Polish circus troupe retells the story of the Book of Esther. Klezmer-style musical numbers are supplemented by some novice-level juggling, aerial silks and cartwheels, as well as craft-project-like puppets. The show does not really invest enough resources in any of these circus acts to deliver much that is striking or memorable, though, and the result looks a lot like a community theater production designed for children (1:30).

&#x2605; 'La Ruta' (closes on Sunday) The theater is a tractor-trailer, and inside are cardboard boxes for playgoers to sit on while making the journey with immigrants being smuggled into Texas.

Directed with sympathy and insight by Michael Wilson (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Wanda's Monster' (closes on Sunday) Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming hourlong production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00).

HEADLINE: Citrus Disease With No Cure Is Ravaging Florida's Groves

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
AVON PARK, Fla. -- Florida's citrus industry is grappling with the most serious threat in its history: a bacterial disease with no cure that has infected all 32 of the state's citrus-growing counties.
Although the disease, citrus greening, was first spotted in Florida in 2005, this year's losses from it are by far the most extensive. While the bacteria, which causes fruit to turn bitter and drop from the trees when still unripe, affects all citrus fruits, it has been most devastating to oranges, the largest crop. So many have been affected that the United States Department of Agriculture has downgraded its crop estimates five months in a row, an extraordinary move, analysts said.
With the harvest not yet over, orange production has already decreased 10 percent from the initial estimate, a major swing, they said.
''The long and short of it is that the industry that made Florida, that is synonymous with Florida, that is a staple on every American breakfast table, is totally threatened,'' said Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat who helped obtain $11 million in federal money for research to fight the disease. ''If we don't find a cure, it will eliminate the citrus industry.'' 
The relentless migration of the disease from southern to northern Florida -- and beyond -- has deepened concerns this year among orange juice processors, investors, growers and lawmakers. Florida is the second-largest producer of orange juice in the world, behind Brazil, and the state's $9 billion citrus industry is a major economic force, contributing 76,000 jobs.
The industry, lashed over the years by canker disease, hard freezes and multiple hurricanes, is no stranger to hardship. But citrus greening is by far the most worrisome.
The disease, which can lie dormant for two to five years, is spread by an insect no larger than the head of a pin, the Asian citrus psyllid. It snacks on citrus trees, depositing bacteria that gradually starves trees of nutrients. Psyllids fly from tree to tree, leaving a trail of infection.
Concerted efforts by growers and millions of dollars spent on research to fight the disease have so far failed, growers and scientists said. The situation was worsened this season by an unusual weather pattern, including a dry winter, growers said.
''We have got a real big problem,'' said Vic Story, a lifelong citrus grower and the head of The Story Companies, which owns 2,000 acres of groves in Central Florida and manages an additional 3,000 acres, all of which are affected at varying levels. ''It's definitely the biggest threat in my lifetime, and I'm 68. This is a tree killer.''
Before this year, the losses and increased costs of fighting the disease had already taken a toll on Florida's citrus industry, which has been in decline for 15 years. In a 2012 report, University of Florida agricultural analysts concluded that between 2006 and 2012, citrus greening cost Florida's economy $4.5 billion and 8,000 jobs.
Some orange packers and small and midsize growers have sold their groves, razed them for development, or simply abandoned them. Others have postponed replanting lost trees, which take five years to mature, until they know whether a cure will be found. Many more, including the largest growers, are doing what they can to survive; they say they are optimistic they can hold on long enough for researchers to find a treatment.
''This year was a real kick in the gut,'' said Adam Putnam, Florida's agriculture commissioner and a former United States representative, whose family owns citrus groves. ''It is now everywhere, and it's just as bad as the doomsayers said it would be.''
But there was good news this week, too. Coca-Cola announced it would spend $2 billion to plant 25,000 acres of new orange groves. The company, which owns Minute Maid and the Simply juice brands, will buy fruit from two growers in Florida -- one local and the other a Brazilian company that has invested in the state.
''To see such a dominant player in the beverage market double down on the future of orange juice in Florida is a real morale boost to the industry and a sign they have confidence we will find a cure for greening,'' Mr. Putnam said.
Across the Wheeler Farms groves here in Avon Park and beyond, the evidence of greening is obvious on some trees. Leaves turn yellow, then fall off, leaving behind sparse foliage. That is often the beginning of the end.
The psyllids are thought to have arrived through the Port of Miami a decade ago, scientists said. And while the bacteria does not harm humans, it devastates trees, leaving behind bitter, misshapen oranges.
Greening has crippled citrus production around the world, including in Asia and Africa, researchers at the University of Florida said. A decade ago, psyllids were discovered in Brazil, which, with its abundant rural land, has tried to outrun the disease by removing countless trees and planting new acres.
Aware of the potential consequences, Florida's thousands of growers have aggressively moved to curtail its spread. They have spent $60 million over six years, money raised mostly from a self-imposed tax, to create a research foundation seeking to eradicate greening. The federal Department of Agriculture also has dedicated millions of dollars to the effort.
More money is coming. The Florida Legislature this month approved $8 million toward greening research, a record sum. And Mr. Nelson is pushing a bill in Congress to set up a research trust fund using money from a tariff on imported orange juice.
Florida is no longer alone in its battle against greening. The disease has spread to Texas and California, where officials are anxiously watching developments in Florida. They are also joining the fight to speed up research.
''It's worrisome that we are still three to five years away, even if we find a silver bullet,'' said Mark Wheeler, a grower and chief financial officer of Wheeler Farms, which owns 2,500 acres. ''We are to the point now that to stay alive in this type of environment you have to be on top of it 24/7.''
As is, he said, some growers can lose 30 to 40 percent of what they pick in a given year.
Researchers are working on several tracks, among them hindering the insect's reproductive cycle or its ability to transmit the disease, and developing resistant trees. But they are also advising growers on short-term options.
''Now there is a real sense of urgency,'' said Michael W. Sparks, the chief executive officer of Florida Citrus Mutual, a trade organization for growers. ''We are not doing research to publish a paper but research we can get on the back of a tractor.''
In Florida, growers have had to transform how they raise orange and grapefruit trees, a shift that has more than doubled their costs over the past decade.
Baby citrus trees must now be raised in greenhouses before they can be transplanted. And most growers douse their groves with a more powerful cocktail of nutrients and spray insecticide more frequently, which has helped slow the disease's progress. At first, they tried removing acres of full-grown, fruit-bearing trees in the hopes of eradicating the disease. That failed because psyllids simply flew over from neighboring groves that were either abandoned or not following the same costly regimen of fertilizer and insecticide.
James Graham, a professor of soil microbiology at the University of Florida who works with the grower-funded Citrus Research and Education Center, said next year's harvest would be crucial. It will show whether this year's statewide early fruit drop was an aberration -- a bad combination of quirky weather and greening -- or proof that the disease is truly entrenched.
Mr. Story, for one, is not giving up. He is scooping up groves that are for sale and plans on planting 300 new acres.
''We think we can do it; we know we can do it,'' he said. ''We just need somebody to figure out how we can kill this bacteria in these trees.''

HEADLINE: In Its Efforts to Integrate Roma, Slovakia Recalls U.S. Struggles

BYLINE: By ANDREW HIGGINS

 BODY:
SARISSKE MICHALANY, Slovakia -- Gazing out his window during morning recess on his first day at work, the principal of an elementary school here, Jaroslav Valastiak, was caught up short: all the children playing in the asphalt-covered yard were white, a strikingly monochromatic scene at a school where a majority of pupils are dark-skinned Roma.
The Roma children, he then discovered, had all been shepherded into a separate, Roma-only playground.
Lunchtime brought another shock. The school canteen served only white children, with Roma pupils left outside with bagged rations, instead of hot food. Classes were also divided, officially on the basis of academic aptitude, but in a manner that ended up grouping students along rigid ethnic lines. 
''The segregation here was as obvious as fireworks,'' Mr. Valastiak said.
The 59-year-old principal has spent the past year trying to break down barriers, both physical and mental, in a painful struggle for integration that some here say echoes that of the United States more than a half-century ago.
''The situation in Slovakia now is exactly the same as it was in the United States,'' said Peter Pollak, a Roma member of Parliament and the government's plenipotentiary for Roma communities, who recently visited the United States to learn about its battles over segregated schooling and other entrenched barriers to equality.
In a continent faced with an economic crisis, soaring unemployment and bursts of nationalist populism, the elementary school here in eastern Slovakia is a microcosm of one of Europe's biggest challenges: how to keep old demons of ethnic scapegoating at bay and somehow bring its most disadvantaged and fastest growing minority into the mainstream.
Many Europeans associate Roma with crime, particularly well-organized gangs of young Roma pickpockets who prey on local residents and tourists alike in the Continent's wealthier cities.
Descendants of medieval migrants who arrived in Europe from India more than a millennium ago, Roma, also known as Gypsies, now account for around 10 percent of Slovakia's population and a substantial minority in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Macedonia. There are also Roma communities scattered across Western Europe.
In all these places, they outpace all other groups in unemployment, illiteracy and other indicators of deprivation and as targets for abuse and sometimes violent attack.
Only 20 percent of Roma men of working age in Slovakia have jobs -- compared with 65 percent in the general population -- and they die 15 years earlier than the national average, according to a World Bank report last year. Only 28 percent of Roma children even start the equivalent of high school, compared with the 94 percent of native Slovaks who graduate.
In terms of health, income and education, the report said, the ''dire situation'' of Slovakia's Roma ''is more comparable with that of countries in sub-Saharan Africa than the European Union.''
The struggle for desegregation in Sarisske Michalany and other towns and villages across wide stretches of Europe has galvanized a small but energetic band of civil rights activists and stirred angry opposition from defenders of the status quo.
''There is a lot of resistance to what we are trying to do,'' said Vlado Rafael, the director of EduRoma, a group that is now working with Mr. Valastiak, the school principal.
The most powerful lever working for desegregation in Slovakia has been the court system, which has been reinforced by antidiscrimination statutes adopted in the past decade to bring the code into conformity with European Union standards.
Inspired by the landmark 1954 United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregated schooling unconstitutional, Vanda Durbakova, a Slovak civil rights lawyer, filed a suit in 2010 against the Sarisske Michalany elementary school. Recently, she won a legal victory.
An appeals tribunal in the city of Presov ruled that the school had violated an antidiscrimination law by separating students. The three-judge panel rejected arguments that segregated teaching was driven by legitimate academic considerations, and ordered that classes be integrated by the start of the next school year.
Ms. Durbakova, a lawyer with the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Kosice, the main city in eastern Slovakia, said she chose the village not because it was a particularly egregious offender but for the opposite reason, because the ''school is not exceptional.''
The appeals court ruling, which came into force in February after the school decided against further appeal, ''won't solve the problem,'' she said, but does give legal force to arguments long made by Roma activists that discrimination exists, is illegal and must be combated.
Leslie Hawke, an American, has worked for more than a decade in Romania helping to get Roma children into preschools. She worries that the focus on racial discrimination distracts attention from the abject poverty of many Roma and their alienation from modern mainstream norms, which she considers a more serious brake on integration.
Many Roma activists, Ms. Hawke said, ''see everything through the prism of racism'' and play down economic and social obstacles. ''Tremendous racism'' exists, she added, but ''there are no Jim Crow laws to strike down.''
Mr. Valastiak, the principal, said he welcomed the court's ruling but cautioned that integration ultimately depends mostly on narrowing the cultural gap. When he opened the school canteen to Roma students, for example, ''we had to teach them how to use cutlery, and some had trouble digesting warm food.''
He also abolished separate playgrounds and lifted a ban on Roma parents entering the school building. But, he acknowledged, integrating classes has only just started and has already created frictions, not only because white parents object but also because Roma children often do not want to leave their friends who remain in the segregated classes.
''I need to move slowly,'' he said. ''I can't make a radical break.''
Among the faculty, wariness of Roma runs strong. ''These people are interested in only two things: money and sex,'' said Vladimir Savov, an English teacher. ''They are lazy and don't want to learn.''
Like other teachers, Mr. Savov now accepts that change is necessary, if only to satisfy the court, but he is deeply skeptical about abandoning segregated teaching. ''Mixed classes are a good idea in principle, but the question is how will they work in real life,'' he said.
On paper at least, the school has never had separate classes for Roma but only special, remedial ones for slow learners, all of whom happened to be Roma. A 2009 study by the Roma Education Fund, a Hungary-based group, found that more than 85 percent of the students enrolled in special classes in Slovakian schools are Roma.
Mr. Valastiak said that not all Roma belong in remedial classes, but that many, particularly those who travel to his school from a garbage-strewn ghetto in the adjacent village of Ostrovany, do have trouble keeping up with their white schoolmates. Most Roma children from the ghetto, he said, start their schooling with no previous exposure to books, a poor grasp of Slovak and little or no discipline.
Of his school's 435 students, 270 are Roma, with 220 of these coming from the ghetto, which has no school.
Vincent Lesso, Sarisske Michalany's mayor, said he supported integration during recess and lunch, but not in the classroom. ''Sudden integration is not an option,'' he said, and will only drive the white children to other schools. A handful of parents, angry at Mr. Valastiak's policies, have already sent their children to a school in another village that has no Roma families.
Mr. Pollak, the government's senior official for Roma affairs, agreed that the authorities needed to go slowly to curb the risk of ''white flight.'' Officials also worry about extremist groups seizing on white frustrations to promote their overtly racist views.
''To think that there will soon be only integrated schools in Slovakia is naïve,'' he said.
White parents in Sarisske Michalany denounce the pressure for integration as the work of outsiders ignorant of local realities. ''Why should my kid be forced to be part of an experiment that holds her back with Roma children?'' said Lubos Bernat, head of the village school board and of an all-white parents association.
Monika Duzdova, one of two Roma teaching assistants hired by Mr. Valastiak to help the integration program, said she understood some of the concerns of white parents and added that the better-off Roma families were also alarmed by the flood of destitute children from the nearby ghetto.
The ghetto in Ostrovany is separated from the white neighborhood by a seven-foot concrete wall, erected in 2009 in response to a rash of robberies. It has not stopped thieving, but, said Peter Kaleja, a resident of the ghetto who works as a teaching assistant at the elementary school, has left Roma children even more alienated.
His biggest headache these days, Mr. Kaleja said, is not hostility from whites to integration, but from Roma children and their parents. ''They have got used to separation,'' he said. ''There is now a wall in their minds.''

HEADLINE: Joel A. Miele Sr., 78, Giuliani Appointee

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Joel A. Miele Sr., who was the commissioner of environmental protection in New York City when it undertook major initiatives to safeguard its water supply in the 1990s, died on Monday at his home in Howard Beach, Queens. He was 78.
The cause was cancer, said his son, Joel Jr. 
Mr. Miele, a public engineer and member of the City Planning Commission, had been buildings commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani when the mayor appointed him to head the environmental agency in 1996.
At the time, the city had embarked on a five-year, $660 million pollution control project that was both ambitious and diplomatically delicate: buying land and improving environmental protection in a 2,000-square-mile region of upstate New York, where it had no jurisdiction, but beneath which lay the city's water supply, increasingly threatened by leaking septic systems and other polluting byproducts of an upstate development boom.
From 1996 until 2002, when Mr. Miele was replaced by Christopher O. Ward, the agency negotiated the purchase of thousands of acres and undertook pollution control measures under the so-called Watershed Protection Program, the terms of which had been hammered out between upstate authorities and Mr. Miele's predecessor, Marilyn G. Gelber.
Environmentalists criticized Mr. Miele's efforts as too slow and too friendly to business. While he headed the agency, upstate business leaders and government officials successfully lobbied for a major state highway project, which paved over a large swath of the watershed; builders routinely disregarded pollution control guidelines set by the city; and the agency's own employees spilled mercury-laced chemicals in a building adjoining one of the city's upstate reservoirs, for which the city was fined $50,000 after pleading guilty to two felony counts of violating the federal Clean Water Act.
Mr. Miele said he was doing his best, arguing that contending with the many stakeholders in the region -- state, federal and local governments, environmentalists and business interests -- was complicating his work.
''If I had my own way as the manager of the water supply, sure, it'd be great to put a Berlin Wall around the whole thing, get everybody out and let it all go back to nature,'' he told The New York Times in 1999.
''Then I could guarantee to the mayor and the City of New York we'll never have a problem with our water. But that's not realistic.''
In a related project, Mr. Miele oversaw the opening, in 1998, of the first segment of a new water tunnel system linking the city to its upstate water supply -- a 13.5-mile tunnel under Brooklyn and Queens.
As the commissioner of buildings from 1994 to 1996, Mr. Miele carried out Mr. Giuliani's mandate to shrink government, reducing the number of building inspectors by 20 percent and introducing a controversial ''self-certifying'' system, which allowed architects and engineers to approve their own blueprints and conduct their own inspections of completed jobs.
Mr. Miele said licensed engineers and architects were better qualified than inspectors to certify that their work met code regulations, and argued that streamlining the process would benefit the city economy.
City inspectors would follow up with spot checks, he said, but ''nobody is going to go out and look for reasons to aggravate people when there isn't a reason.''
Joel Arthur Miele was born on May 28, 1934, in Jersey City to Gennaro and Eleanor Miele. His father, a civil engineer, founded the firm Miele Associates, which he moved to Middle Village, Queens, in the 1940s while moving the family to Howard Beach.
After serving in the Navy, Mr. Miele received his engineering degree from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which is now part of New York University, and joined his father's firm in the early 1960s.
He was named to the Planning Commission in 1990 by the Queens borough president, Claire Shulman.
Besides his son, Mr. Miele is survived by his wife, Josephine; two daughters, Vita Marie Miele-Chu and Janet Miele-Powers; seven grandchildren; a brother, Jean; and two sisters, Lana Miele Simon and Eleanor A. Miele.

HEADLINE: Editor's Letter | Away We Go

BYLINE: DEBORAH NEEDLEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Travel, and travel writing, should be able to open our minds &#8212; and even to change them. 

 BODY:
Travel journalism often falls into one of two camps - the highly didactic and servicey piece, "go here, stay there, see that," or the long-winded narrative in which the writer has the experience and we are meant to be satisfied by the first-person blow-by-blow he or she has brought back for us: "the road into town was dusty and unpaved and the driver kept getting lost." The former is best served up by the Internet on demand. (You can find all of our hotel and restaurant suggestions for the stories in this issue at tmagazine.com.) And the pure version of the latter is perhaps best left to brilliant writers who promise to reward you for coming along (Edith Wharton, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Evelyn Waugh, Jan Morris). There are of course also intellectual and cultural histories of locales, in which the writer seeks to tease out the influences - historical, economic, social, stylistic, culinary and political - that make the place uniquely what it is (V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski). The type we favor at T is a hybrid of the three, in which great writing and personal narrative is done in the service of not just traipsing along with the writer who got to go on an amazing journey that we didn't, but of bringing you back a new understanding of a place that is enlightening and satisfying regardless of whether you ever plan to visit. 
And yet, if you do choose to go, we're there to guide you.
In this issue, Gideon Lewis-Kraus susses out the world of Airbnb, a travel phenomenon made possible by the Web, in which one can affordably stay in strangers' homes across the globe, bypassing the polar choices of the impersonal hotel room or the too-personal B&B. As you're dealing with real people and real abodes, not hospitality professionals and rooms spit polished by uniformed maids, there is a quirky, happenstance quality that makes for experiences that at times can be annoying and pretty weird, but also rather great, and even magical - depending on your point of view.
In his Yes, Please column, Andrew O'Hagan expounds on the profound sensory pleasures of traveling solo, without dealing with others who might whinge at your proclivity to walk everywhere or force-march you to all the sights when you really just feel like sleeping in.
To support his life's work at the Roden Crater near Flagstaff, Ariz., the artist James Turrell does a fair number of private commissions around the world, on sites as diverse as glass houses in the desert and epic estates in the English countryside. Edward Helmore takes us on a vicarious visit to several of these open-to-the-heavens installations, and uncovers a fascinating dynamic between the artist and his patrons - and a body of work as varied as the sky itself.
And finally, Adam Sachs profiles the strange and beautiful utopia that is Marin County, which happens to be populated by people defined by their liberal tolerance (so long as no one disagrees with them), their love of nature and open space (despite a serious case of nimbyism), and their defense of free speech (so long as no one is talking about where they live). Their contradictions mirror that of our writer's: "I always sort of want to hate Marin," he says. Of course, "I always fall in love and want to stay."
Travel, and travel writing, should be able to open our minds - and even to change them.

HEADLINE: A Fresh Challenge to Dell Buyout

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Carl C. Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management are preparing a rival bid for Dell. | California&#8217;s attorney general has accused JPMorgan Chase of debt collection abuses. | SAC Capital Advisors has extended a deadline for investors to decide whether to withdraw money. | The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have softened its tone in a settlement with Philip A. Falcone. 

 BODY:
ICAHN AND SOUTHEASTERN READY RIVAL BID FOR DELL | The billionaire Carl C. Icahn and Southeastern Asset Management, two of the biggest shareholders of Dell, plan to bid for the computer maker in a last-ditch effort to stop what they call "the great giveaway," the $24.4 billion management buyout led by Michael S. Dell, the company's founder, and the private equity firm Silver Lake, Andrew Ross Sorkin and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.
Unlike the bid currently on the table, which would pay shareholders $13.65 a share in cash, the bid by Mr. Icahn and Southeastern, disclosed in a letter to Dell's board Thursday night, would pay shareholders about $12 a share either in cash or in additional shares of the company, leaving a portion of Dell publicly traded. If the special committee of Dell's board refuses to budge, the two investors, which together owned more than 11 percent of Dell's shares as of late March, have threatened a legal battle. "We are often cynical about corporate boards, but this board has brought that cynicism to new heights," their letter to Dell's board said. "This company has suffered long enough from very wrongheaded decisions made by the board and its management." 
By offering to give shareholders a chance to remain investors in Dell, the shareholders argue their bid is worth more than the offer on the table. Dell's stock closed Thursday at $13.32 and rose modestly in trading after hours.
CALIFORNIA SUES JPMORGAN OVER CREDIT CARD CASES | California's attorney general accused JPMorgan Chase on Thursday of flooding the state's courts with questionable lawsuits to collect overdue credit card debt, claiming that the bank "committed debt collection abuses against tens of thousands of California consumers," Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook. From January 2008 to April 2011, JPMorgan filed thousands of lawsuits each month to collect such debt, claims the attorney general, Kamala D. Harris. The bank took shortcuts like relying on court documents that were not reviewed for accuracy, Ms. Harris says. "To maintain this breakneck pace," according to the lawsuit, JPMorgan relied on "unlawful practices."
Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes: "The accusations outlined in the lawsuit echo problems - from questionable documents used in lawsuits to incomplete records - that plagued the foreclosure process and prompted a multibillion-dollar settlement with big banks. One hallmark of the foreclosure crisis, robosigning, in which banks worked through mountains of legal documents without reviewing them for accuracy, is at the center of Ms. Harris's lawsuit against JPMorgan."
SAC'S FIGHT TO KEEP CLIENTS | The giant hedge fund run by Steven A. Cohen has extended a deadline for investors to decide whether to withdraw money, pushing the date to June 3 from May 16, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports, citing a person briefed on the matter. "While only a couple of weeks, the extension hints at the tense behind-the-scenes discussions between SAC and its investors over the firm's central role in the government's broad crackdown on insider trading," Mr. Lattman writes. "One possible reason for granting the additional time is that SAC investors are awaiting the resolution of a civil action brought against SAC by the Securities and Exchange Commission."
ON THE AGENDA | Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gives the keynote address at a conference of the Chicago Fed. Jacob Lew, the secretary of the Treasury, is on CNBC at 5:30 a.m. The banking analyst Michael Mayo is on Bloomberg TV at 7:45 a.m. 
FALCONE AND S.E.C. REACH DEAL | The Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have softened its tone nearly a year after suing Philip A. Falcone. The high-flying hedge fund manager, who was accused last summer of manipulating the market, using hedge fund assets to pay his own taxes and "secretly" favoring select customers at the expense of others, disclosed in a filing on Thursday that he had "reached an agreement in principle" to settle the two cases with the S.E.C. DealBook's Ben Protess writes: "The settlement, which came after a federal judge in New York questioned aspects of the cases, would be a moral victory of sorts for Mr. Falcone, who has stubbornly resisted a deal for more than a year. It might also reignite concerns that the S.E.C.'s results sometimes fall short of its ambitions."

HEADLINE: Europe's Careless Dithering

BYLINE: STEVEN RATTNER


HIGHLIGHT: European countries need to make bold moves toward full integration of their economic policies. 

 BODY:
EUROPE'S economic problems are growing steadily worse, with unemployment in parts of the Continent now above the level reached in the United States during the Great Depression.
Meanwhile, policy makers dither over solutions. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates by a meager quarter of a percentage point, akin to giving two aspirin to a patient with pneumonia. Meanwhile, pressure is growing to ease the emphasis on austerity and to allow larger budget deficits.
If it were only that simple. 
Properly coupled with other new policies, fiscal stimulus can help, but on its own it is just an inadequate palliative.
The problems of the euro zone are not some routine cyclical downturn that can be rectified by traditional macroeconomic policy; they are deep structural flaws in both the design of the common currency and the economic policies of many of its members.
Most fundamentally, the design of the euro was ill conceived. A disparate group of 17 countries, ranging from the German powerhouse to weaklings like Greece, should never have been joined in a single currency without integrating their other economic policies.
As a consequence, while Germany grew ever more efficient, many other members allowed the cheap borrowing rates that accompanied the euro to lull them into complacency. Budget deficits expanded, wages rose rapidly and speculation in real estate ran rampant. Meanwhile, excessive regulation of business and labor made needed restructuring nearly impossible.
Take autos. The European automobiles industry resembles that of the United States, circa 2009: too many factories employing too many workers, able to make more cars than the market can absorb. And, doing it too inefficiently. A Fiat autoworker in Poland produces three times as many cars as a Fiat employee in Italy and is paid one-third as much. And yet, achieving an American-style restructuring in Europe is impossible. Closing a single plant, even in Germany, is an expensive and often unsuccessful effort.
When Peugeot ran into liquidity problems last fall, the French government provided up to seven billion euros in loan guarantees, but only if Peugeot spared some of the 8,000 jobs on its cutting board. Saving unproductive jobs is not a recipe for economic prosperity.
In contrast, there's Spain, where a more flexible labor market has led to higher productivity and competitiveness and in turn, to expanded production by a raft of automakers, including Nissan, Ford, Renault and Volkswagen.
Spain remains plagued by high unemployment and recession. But better competitiveness has led to rising exports and a workable base for future expansion.
Ireland has done even better in improving its competitiveness, and as a result its exports have boomed, growth has resumed and its double-digit unemployment rate has begun to tick down.
But two of the largest euro zone economies - Italy and France - seem paralyzed. For example, Italy, under the previous prime minister, Mario Monti, made modest reforms like higher retirement ages and more freedom for employers to shed workers. While the reforms did not go far enough, even Mr. Monti's small steps were soon watered down. He lost the most recent election, and his successor has been conspicuously silent about the needed structural changes.
Competitiveness is not the only problem. Banks, because of their own weak balance sheets and a fear of more losses, have been wary of lending to small and medium-size businesses, and when they do it's at a high interest rate. In Italy, where 80 percent of workers are employed by small or medium-size firms, borrowing costs are around 6 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in Germany. Nothing significant has been done to address this problem.
To be fair, the euro zone has been taking small steps toward the greater integration that is required. A banking union and single regulatory framework are under development. And discussions are under way over a deal in which the austerity regime would be relaxed for certain countries, including France, in return for structural reforms.
But incrementalism is an insufficient response. Europe should pursue full economic integration, much like the United States did in 1789, after the failed Articles of Confederation experiment. That would involve harmonized regulatory policies and a shared central government budget that would provide extra funds to troubled countries, just as America does for weaker states.

HEADLINE: American Health Care as a Source of Humor

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: How American hospitals reach their pricing policies could make you laugh, if you&#8217;re not a patient, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
From time to time I stand accused of injecting humor into my public presentations on health policy in the United States. As a German-born economist, I find it hurtful.
Germans pride themselves on their lack of humor. Economists, for their part, pride themselves on being practitioners of the dismal science. We are the professional buzzkills who put caveats on any good news.
Now imagine both traits packaged into one human being: you have yours truly. It is not that I inject humor into our otherwise august debate on health policy. Rather, the health system in the United States is in many ways so risible that it comes across as droll even when a dour German-born economist describes it. 
One of those risible moments occurred this week when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of the Department of Health and Human Services delivered a giant spreadsheet on hospital charges and payments.

The spreadsheet has data in 163,072 rows and 12 columns. It covers, for each of more than 3,000 hospitals, charges and payments for the 100 most frequently billed inpatient cases, along with the average covered charges hypothetically billed by those hospitals for those cases.
The distribution of this giant spreadsheet instantly brought headlines in major daily publications, telling the world that billing charges for a given case vary widely among hospitals even within one city.
Really?
Why was this news? That charges vary enormously among hospitals surely must have been known for many years. As early as 2004, for example, Lucette Lagnado of The Wall Street Journal reported that on the paper's front page.
I recall producing from her data, for a 2006 paper, "The Pricing of U.S. Hospital Services: Chaos Behind a Veil of Secrecy," the following slide. More such wondrous charges can be found in Ms. Lagnado's article.
Readers of this blog may recall several posts on the pricing of hospital services, commenting on such variations.
Perhaps the news in this case was that at long last the government had bestirred itself to publish data on which it had been sitting for decades. Indeed, why it had not done so eons ago is an intriguing question.
Part of the data in the government's daunting spreadsheet could potentially be useful to prospective paying patients. The other part is useful mainly as a source of humor.
 What Medicare Actually Pays: For each hospital listed in the spreadsheet, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show in Column K the average case payments that Medicare actually made to that hospital in 2011 for the 100 most frequently billed cases in the government's "medical severity-adjusted diagnosis-related grouping," known as MS-DRG, a classification of inpatient cases. These actual payments are the total payments the hospital received for the case not only from Medicare itself but from patients in the form of co-payments, or from third parties, such as Medigap insurers that cover co-payments otherwise due from patients.
I described an excellent synopsis of Medicare's MS-DRG classification system and how it sets the payment rate per MS-DRG case in an earlier post.
In principle, patients paying out of pocket could use the actual Medicare payment for an MS-DRG rate as benchmarks by which to gauge the reasonableness of whatever a hospital may charge them for that type of case.
For example, in Column K of Row 28,067 of the spreadsheet, readers learn that for MS-DRG 249 "Perc Cardiovasc Proc W Non-Drug-Eluting Stent w/o MCC" Medicare paid North Shore Medical Center in Miami an average case payment of $13,301 in 2011.
If a paying patient treated or to be treated at North Shore Medical Center can understand the sometimes arcane case descriptions listed in Column A of the spreadsheet, this information might be helpful in haggling with the hospital over its detailed bill before or even after the procedure.
From Column J, Row 28,067 of the spreadsheet, the patient also learns that North Shore Medical Center's average covered charges for MS-DRG 249 came to $99,275, or 7.5 times what Medicare pays.
So what have we here? What are these charges?
In a handsome graphic comparing Medicare reimbursement (the actual Medicare payment) with average covered charges, a Washington Post blog post described the latter as "average cost." But costs is exactly not what these "average charges" reflect.
"Average charges" in the United States hospital business are pure fiction - and a funny fiction, at that. They are simply list prices few patients ever pay. Indeed, if any hospital in the United States ever were paid its charges for every patient, its profits would be truly embarrassing.
To appreciate why, it may be helpful to say a word about the so-called chargemasters of hospitals.
 Average Covered Charges: Under the tab "Documentation" in the Excel workbook, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services define "average covered charges" as "the provider's average charge for services covered by Medicare for all discharges in the DRG. These will vary from hospital to hospital because of differences in hospital charge structures."
In composing a bill for an inpatient case, a hospital's computers find the charge for a particular service, procedure or manufactured good in the hospital's huge chargemaster. The latter is a detailed listing of the hospital's list prices for myriad procedures and products.
Under the mantra that rules American health care, that "one size does not fit all" - this, in a country that invented one-size-fits-all franchising like McDonald's and Holiday Inn - the structure and detail of chargemasters are hospital-specific and vary considerably among hospitals. In a detailed study in 2005, the consulting firm Lewin Group noted that hospital chargemasters may contain anywhere from 12,000 to 45,000 distinct items, depending on the hospital.
To see a live example of such a chargemaster and to appreciate how useless its contents would be to a lay person, readers may wish to consult the 2012 chargemaster of Dameron Hospital in Stockton, Calif. I chose it because it happened to pop up in a Google search.
Hospitals update their chargemasters continuously, under the overall supervision of the hospital's chief financial officer and often with the help of outside consultants.
Here is how, in 2004, the chief financial officer of California's UC Davis Health System, a 30-year veteran of hospital financing, described this process of updating to The Wall Street Journal:
There is no method to this madness. As we went through the years, we had these cockamamie formulas. We multiplied our costs to set our charges.
Even a German-born economist cannot suppress a smirk at this amazing feature of American health care, a feature whose production engages so many deadly serious adults, including an armada of deadly serious outside consultants.
Even funnier are the protestations by hospital executives that hardly anyone ever pays these fictional prices, which prompted me to offer the following technical definition: " 'Charges' are the prices that a totally inebriated foreign billionaire would pay a U.S. hospital if his wife were not around to control the bloke."
While it may be true that hardly anyone ever pays these hospital charges, Steven Brill reported not long ago that some and perhaps many hospitals actually bill uninsured American patients with some means and then hound them for payment. That, of course, is not funny.
In the end, though, it is not at all clear to me why anyone should care about the fictitious "average covered charge" figures reported by the Medicare agency. What exactly is a prospective patient to do with this metric?
Nor is it clear to me what all the excitement in the news media was about.
It just made this dour German-born economist laugh out loud once again.
An earlier version of this post misstated the number of rows in a spreadsheet from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on hospital charges and payments. It has 163,066 rows, not 65,536.

HEADLINE: Q. and A. on the 'Shell Game' of College Aid

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: In a question-and-answer exchange, the author of a new report on financial aid describes problems in making college affordable for low-income students, and potential solutions. 

 BODY:
"With their relentless pursuit of prestige and revenue, the nation's public and private four-year colleges and universities are in danger of shutting down what has long been a pathway to the middle class for low-income and working-class students," writes Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation, in a new report that's gettingconsiderableattention.
Mr. Burd uses data from the Education Department to argue that many colleges "are engaged in an elaborate shell game." With Congress having recently increased the size of Pell Grants, a large federal aid program for lower-income families, colleges are redirecting their own aid money toward higher-income students. The goal of the colleges, he says, is to attract the high-scoring students who lift a college's ranking and prestige.
Yet with list-price tuition growing rapidly, lower-income students, Mr. Burd writes, are left to pay more. He adds: "This is one reason why even after historic increases in Pell Grant funding, the college-going gap between low- income students and their wealthier counterparts remains as wide as ever." 
He uses the federal data to name colleges that are charging high net prices - that is, even after taking into account financial aid - for low-income students. The average net price for first-year, full-time students with family incomes of $30,000 or less at New York University, for instance, is a whopping $25,462. In effect, N.Y.U. is asking such a family to devote all of its income to college. 
The comparable average at the University of Miami is $21,415. At Southern Methodist University, in Dallas, it is $14,040. At Penn State, a public university, it is $16,839. On the other end of the spectrum are, among others, Georgia Tech ($0), Caltech ($310) and Amherst College ($448).
Mr. Burd and I recently conducted a conversation by e-mail, and a lightly edited transcript follows.
 Q. 
 Many people - myself among them - have long seen some advantages in the so-called high-tuition, high-aid model, in which a college charges a substantial list price but also awards large amount of aid. Such a system ensures that high-income families, who can afford college, pay for it at a time when college budgets are stretched and income inequality is high. It is an akin to a progressive system of taxation. You are skeptical of that model, though. Why? 
 A. 
 I completely understand the appeal of the high-tuition, high-aid model in a theoretical sense. However, the net price data that I examine show that in states that are following this model, such as Pennsylvania and South Carolina, the neediest students are facing net prices that are more than double what they are being in low-tuition states such as North Carolina.
I think what happens sometimes is that states go to the high-tuition model but don't follow through on the high-aid side of the equation. It also appears to be the case that the high aid is not necessarily going to low-income students - but is instead being redirected toward wealthier students.
 Q. 
 Do you see any exceptions - state universities that charge a high list-price tuition but provide large amounts of aid to low-income students and enroll substantial numbers of them? There seem to be at least a few private colleges following that model, including Amherst, Haverford and Pomona. 
 A. 
 I didn't dig as deep on the public college side to parse that out. There still are a significant number of state universities that enroll a substantial share of low-income students and charge them a manageable net price. Having said that, the public institutions that I found are cheapest for low-income students are in low-tuition states, such as California, Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The schools that were most expensive for low-income students are in high-tuition, high-aid states such as New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.
There are definitely some schools in high-tuition, high-aid states that provide generous amounts of need-based aid - such as the University of Virginia and the University of Michigan. But these schools don't tend to enroll a substantial share of low income students.
 Q. 
 Yes, that seems to be one of the big mysteries from your report. You have two tables listing excellent colleges that are affordable for low-income students yet enroll very few of them, including Virginia, Michigan, the University of Delaware, Caltech and Washington University in St. Louis. Studies have made clear that large numbers of high-performing, low-income students exist. Why don't they make it to these colleges? Do you think the colleges want to attract them? 
 A. 
 I think that there are some schools that genuinely want to attract these students - and some like Amherst, Vassar, M.I.T., etc., that do a very good job of it. There are others that appear to be much more interested in attracting the "best and the brightest" and wealthiest students to improve their rankings and increase their revenues.
I do think that schools like Harvard and Virginia are genuinely interested in attracting more low-income students but have had trouble finding them. The excellent report you've written about by Christopher Avery and Caroline Hoxby shows that colleges don't always look in the right places to find these students. And many of these students - even those with the most impressive academic records - don't even think about applying to these schools because they don't think they can afford them, among other reasons.
 Q. 
 Imagine the president or a governor called you into his or her office and said, "O.K., how do we change policy to improve matters." What would you say? 
 A. 
 I can't believe that hasn't already happened!
Because of my background covering federal student aid, I've mostly thought of this from the perspective of the federal Pell Grant program, which provides nearly $35 billion a year to help low-income students pay for college. Right now this money goes to colleges without any strings attached. I think that's got to change to ensure that colleges are doing their part to remove the financial barriers that prevent low-income students from enrolling in and completing college.
At the New America Foundation, we have recommended that the government take a carrot-and-stick approach. The carrot is to help schools that don't have the resources to keep down the net prices of the low-income students they serve. The plan would offer Pell bonuses to financially strapped public and private four-year colleges that serve a substantial share of Pell Grant recipients and graduate at least half of their students school-wide. The goal would be to help these schools boost their institutional aid budgets and bring down the net prices they charge the neediest students.
The stick is for wealthier colleges that have chosen to divert their aid to try to buy the best and/or wealthiest students. These schools would be required to provide additional need-based aid, to help the lowest-income students, in exchange for the Pell dollars they receive.

HEADLINE: India Ranks Number One in Cervical Cancer Deaths

BYLINE: PAMPOSH RAINA


HIGHLIGHT: Of the 50 countries surveyed, maximum deaths from cervical cancer occurred in India, a new report says. 

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -More women die from cervical cancer every year in India than anywhere else in the world, according to the Cervical Cancer-Free Coalition, an American research and advocacy group that released a "cervical cancer global crisis card" Friday. 
The index, which ranked 50 countries, shows India in the top spot in terms of overall deaths, with nearly 73,000 a year. China came a close second, followed by Brazil.
Using the most recent data published by multilateral agencies including the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the World Bank, the crisis card has also ranked countries by mortality rate in cases of cervical cancer. African countries have the highest mortality rates, with women in Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania being most likely to die if affected by the disease.
The rankings were compiled using information from a 2010 report available on the World Health Organization Web site, which says an estimated 72,825 women die of cervical cancer every year in India. About 134,420 women are diagnosed annually with this disease, the most common form of cancer that is detected in women between the ages of 15 and 44.
"Despite the great burden of this disease there are encouraging opportunities for prevention with breakthroughs in cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings," Usha Rani Poli of the MNJ Institute of Oncology Regional Cancer Center in Hyderabad, said in a press release issued by the Cervical Cancer-Free Coalition.
"Community mobilization is critical to educate the public on the importance of screening and to break down cultural barriers about discussing sexual issues," Dr. Poli said.
India, China, Brazil, Bangladesh and Nigeria represent more than half of the "global burden of cervical cancer deaths," according to the release on global rankings.
An estimated 275,000 women die of cervical cancer every year and 500,000 new cases are reported annually worldwide, the release said.
Two companies that make vaccines against cervical cancer said Thursday that they would reduce prices to less than $5 per dose for the world's poorest countries, The New York Times reported. The vaccines that protect against the strains of the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus, or HPV, that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers, cost almost $130 in the United States.
Experts believe that prices could further come down if millions of more doses were ordered and rival vaccine makers from India and China entered the field, The Times said. Merck's Gardasil and GlaxoSmithKline's Cervarix are currently the only two vaccines in the world approved by the World Health Organization, but companies such as Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker, are also developing papillomavirus vaccines.
The "crisis card" release was timed ahead of Mother's Day, to draw attention to the disease, which authors say could cause half a million female deaths annually by 2030.

HIGHLIGHT: A field guide to obstruction. 

 BODY:
In a recent Pew Poll, 80 percent of respondents said the president and Republican leaders were not working together to address important issues - and, by a two-to-one margin, said the G.O.P. was more to blame for gridlock.
Despite their minority status in the Senate, the people on the right side of the aisle have managed to muck up the works. Their obstructionist repertoire is so extensive that you almost need a field guide to their delaying techniques. 
Here's a start on that guide.
Filibuster Abuse: The practice of halting Senate deliberation is an old one, practiced by both parties, but the current Republican caucus has taken it to new heights. They have filibustered an unprecedented number of President Obama's nominees. The District Court for Washington, D.C., perhaps the most important appeals court in the land, has four of its 11 seats vacant. The last time the Senate confirmed a judge was in 2006. The Republicans have filibustered all of Mr. Obama's nominees because Republicans simply don't want him to appoint any judges to a currently conservative court, which rules on appeals involving federal regulatory agencies, and which has exclusive jurisdiction over national security matters.

Boycotting: Also known as taking your marbles and going home, the most recent example came on Thursday, when Republicans refused to attend a meeting of the Environment and Public Works Committee, thereby blocking the nomination of Gina McCarthy as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. They claimed they were not completely satisfied with her answers to the more than 1,000 questions they dumped on her in the confirmation process. In addition to stymying Mr. Obama, holding up her nomination has the great virtue of hamstringing the E.P.A., which the right thinks shouldn't exist in the first place. And that leads us to the next G.O.P. tactic:
Denial of services: Some government agencies require a certain number of members, or a permanent chief, to operate. If the Republicans don't like those agencies, they simply make sure those positions never get filled. For instance, the National Labor Relations Board, which Republicans loathe because it protects workers, requires a quorum to take action. So the Republicans refused to confirm Mr. Obama's nominees. Then they held fake pro-forma sessions during their vacations to try to prevent him from making recess appointments. He did that anyway and the Republican-packed D.C. appeals court (see above) ruled that the appointments were illegitimate - which could invalidate scores of decisions. The Republicans are playing this same trick with the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created in response to the wildly reckless actions that led to the financial collapse of 2008.
Investigate again and again and again: When Darrell Issa, took over the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform after the G.O.P. won the House majority in 2010, he said he wanted to hold "seven hearings a week times 40 weeks." His supposed reason was that Mr. Obama is "corrupt." That's a frequent Republican talking point, but it's so obviously ridiculous that I wonder if they actually believe it. In any case, the real reason is that endless "investigative" hearings cause trouble and distract administration officials from their actual jobs. The hearings on Benghazi, for example, have revealed none of the impeachable offenses that Republicans claimed would come to light. They have kept Congress and the administration focused on what happened in Libya eight months ago, which was awful, rather than on what is happening there today, which is awful.
Refuse to negotiate: Republicans in Congress used to complain that the Senate Democrats hadn't produced a budget in the last four years. But recently the Democrats did just that. So the Republicans abandoned their old talking point and are now refusing to form a conference committee to reconcile the Senate budget with the House budget.

HEADLINE: In the Servants' Quarters

BYLINE: JULIANA BARBASSA


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s time for Brazil to concern itself with the comfort of the poor. 

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO - "Downton Abbey" has nothing on contemporary Brazil: With more household servants than any other country - 6.5 million, according to the International Labor Organization - discussing upstairs-downstairs drama is a national pastime.
Brazil's long-standing income disparities have provided the upper and middle classes with a steady supply of cooks, nannies, maids and caretakers; they can be seen in Rio and São Paulo loading bags of groceries, pushing strollers, walking dogs or their elderly charges. The certainty that there is always someone else to make breakfast and tidy up after dinner is so entrenched that even one-bedroom apartments have separate postage-stamp-size rooms for the help. 
Domestic workers in Brazil (60 percent black, 90 percent female) not only use separate bathrooms; they eat in the kitchen and ride separate elevators in the back of buildings. They get very few benefits, work unlimited hours and can be fired on a whim.
Which is why a law implemented in April that is designed to modestly improve the lot of domestic workers is causing a fury. It caps their workload at 44 hours a week, and it grants them one-and-a-half-pay for overtime and a month of vacation per year. Yet it is being described as the end of civilization - an economic revolution on a par with the abolition of slavery.
In a post last month, one blogger described a hypothetical evening in which a maid insists that her eight-hour day is over, leaving a hungry toddler wailing for food and her hapless father wringing his hands. An op-ed in O Globo, Rio's leading newspaper, warned readers who have grown tired of their maids' cooking to consult a lawyer before firing them because "socialism has now reached the kitchen."
An April cover of Veja, a conservative newsmagazine, shows a morose businessman in shirt and tie washing dishes under the headline, "You tomorrow."
The discomfort is about more than money. Having someone else to do your dirty work raises your own status, according to studies of domestic workers in Arab states edited by Simel Esim and Monica Smith, of the I.L.O. Maids have taken up the bottom rung in Brazil's social, economic, racial and gender hierarchy, giving everyone else a boost up.
Without them there, the others take a step down. In a series of articles published in April in O Globo, Brazilians abroad share their tips for living without help. One couple in France divvies up household chores with their teenage children.
Another in the United States describes their "domestic revolution": They learned to cook, clean, iron and even wash toilets. "It was a shock - a lifestyle I'd only seen in movies," the wife confided to the reporter.
Some change was inevitable. Brazil has grown both wealthier and more equitable over the last 15 or so years. Although incomes have risen across the board, the poorest 10 percent of Brazilians arguably have benefited the most: Their earnings have nearly doubled over the last decade, and 25 million of them have been hoisted out of extreme poverty over the last two years.
Thanks to an unemployment rate at a near-record low - between 5 and 6 percent for much of the previous year - and transfer-of-wealth programs that alleviate extreme poverty with cash infusions, the number of maids shrunk from 7.2 million in 2009 to 6.7 million in 2011. It continued to drop last year, even while their average salary increased twice as fast as inflation. Maids tend to be older now: the proportion of domestic staff over 30 went from 57 percent to 73 percent over the last decade. Much as in Britain at the turn of the last century, the balance of economic and social power is shifting in Brazil today.
The country has a history of passing progressive laws but failing to enforce them. It would be a pity if that happened again regarding the rights of domestic workers, because the recent law has the potential, in time, to bring broader reforms, like full-time schooling and more subsidized nurseries (a pledge of President Dilma Rousseff).
Voltaire once wrote, "The comfort of the rich depends upon an abundant supply of the poor." It's time for Brazil to concern itself with the comfort of the poor.

HIGHLIGHT: Syria&#8217;s young bearing brunt of war; an effort to bring the Roma into Slovakian mainstream; a lawsuit against the Bank of Spain; and a duel between new major museums in China. 

 BODY:
 NEWS As the Syrian civil war rages into its third year, it is taking a wide and disastrous toll on the country's young people. Nearly one-third of the population of 22 million inside Syria needs humanitarian help, and 1.4 million have fled their homeland altogether. Of about 500,000 seeking shelter in Jordan, about 55 percent are under 18. Jodi Rudoren reports from Sabha, Jordan. 
Investigators in three countries continued unraveling the plot behind a brazen $50 million diamond robbery in Belgium, focusing Thursday on a Swiss lawyer, a real estate businessman and a French luxury car exporter with a prison record for fraud. Doreen Carvajal reports from Paris.
An elementary school in eastern Slovakia is a microcosm of one of Europe's biggest challenges: how to bring its most disadvantaged minority, the Roma, into the mainstream. Andrew Higgins reports from Sarisske Michalany, Slovakia.
The two companies that make vaccines against cervical cancer announced Thursday that they would cut their prices to the world's poorest countries below $5 per dose, eventually making it possible for millions of girls to be protected against a major deadly cancer. Donald G. McNeil Jr. reports.
Memorials to victims of drug violence are ubiquitous in Culiacán, Mexico, but officials are slowly asking families' permission to replace them with discreet marble plaques. Karla Zabludovsky reports from Culiácan, Mexico.
Just in time for Richard Wagner's bicentennial this month, a controversy has erupted over a new production of the opera "Tannhäuser" in Düsseldorf because of violent depictions of a Nazi concentration camp in its staging. Nicholas Kulish reports from Berlin.
A group of investors plans to file an unusual lawsuit against the Bank of Spain, accusing the central bank of failing to warn investors of the problems at Bankia, a giant mortgage lender whose downfall helped set off a banking crisis that obliged Spain to seek a bailout from Europe. Raphael Minder reports from Madrid.
 ARTS With the National Art Museum of China, also known as Namoc, planning to open in a new building in Beijing in 2017, and Hong Kong projected to open its M+ museum in a new cultural district about the same time, the cities could emerge as twin titans of contemporary Chinese culture. Kevin Holden Platt reports from Beijing.
Frieze New York, which opens its second edition Friday in Randall's Island Park in Manhattan, remains a daring move and a gamble for the London art show and its organizers. Roslyn Sulcas reports from London.
 SPORTS The man chosen to follow Alex Ferguson as Manchester United manager is described as loyal, dependable, full of integrity. The fact that United, probably the biggest brand in global soccer, handed David Moyes a six-year contract makes its own statement. Rob Hughes writes from London.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | $16.295 Million for Wraparound Views

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A 6,637-square-foot residence with six bedrooms and a private 1,814-square-foot terrace was the most expensive residential sale of the week. 

 BODY:
A pristine 12-room sponsor unit at 535 West End Avenue, a 1920 brick building reinvented, expanded and marketed as a luxury destination by the Extell Development Company, sold for $16.295 million and was the most expensive residential sale of the week, according to city records. The 6,637-square-foot residence, No. 16, had an original listing price of $16.9 million. 
Besides being one of the largest of the 22 condominiums in the building, No. 16 is the only unit graced with a private 1,814-square-foot wraparound terrace, with views to the north and east. Monthly carrying costs of the six-bedroom, six-and-one-half-bath unit are $8,148. Building amenities include an indoor pool, a gym and a billiards room.

The living room, which has a fireplace, and the master bedroom suite, which offers his and hers bathrooms of Calacatta and Thassos marble, both have access to the terrace. There is a Smallbone kitchen with La Cornue, Miele and Sub-Zero appliances; a staff suite has river views.
The listing brokers were Lisa Lippman and Scott Moore of Brown Harris Stevens. Epo In-Manning of Sotheby's International Realty represented the buyer. Extell used a limited-liability company, Imico West End, on the city paperwork; the buyer also used a limited-liability company, Toutou Ouest. But according to signatures on the deed, the new owner is David Sekiguchi, a founder of QFR Capital and a former managing director of Deutsche Bank, where he was the global head of emerging markets.
Another high-priced sale this week involved a brick town house at 54 East 64th Street. Marketed as a residence by Dolly Lenz of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, it is best known as the former headquarters of The Observer and is categorized in city records as an office building. It sold for $18 million, which was $10 million below the asking price. The buyer used a limited-liability company, 54 East 64th Street Townhouse, as did the foreign seller, SM 64th Street Holdings, which had paid $20 million for the property in 2011.
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's decision in 2011 to close an investigation of the older of two brothers accused of carrying out the Boston bombings has cast an unflattering shadow over the legacy of Robert S. Mueller III at the agency as he prepares to step down as director. Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Michael S. Schmidt write that "instead of coasting into retirement, Mr. Mueller will spend the final months answering tough questions about how the bombing suspects slipped away." 
Testifying Thursday at a Congressional hearing on the bombings, the Boston police commissioner said the F.B.I. did not tell him about its investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, although the agency said Boston police officers were involved in the inquiry, Scott Shane and Mr. Schmidt report.
House Republicans are focused on one word in their call for the White House to release an e-mail that raised the possibility that Islamic extremists might have been involved in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi. Mark Landler writes that the move signals that "Republican leaders intend to continue portraying the attack as a major failure of the administration as well as a potentially effective issue against former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton if she runs for president in 2016."
In preparation for a likely standoff over the debt ceiling in the fall, House Republicans have approved a bill that would allow the Treasury Department to prioritize payments to its creditors in the event that its borrowing limit is reached, Jonathan Weisman writes.
As senators began plowing through more than 300 amendments offered Thursday for immigration overhaul legislation, lawmakers hoped that approving some measures offered by Republicans - but rejecting proposals that would undermine the legislation - would encourage more G.O.P. members to support the bill, Ashley Parker writes.
A day after delaying a panel vote on President Obama's nominee to lead the Department of Labor, Republicans on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee blocked a committee vote on the nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, infuriating Democrats who accused their G.O.P. colleagues of engaging in a pattern of obstructionism, John M. Broder writes. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed that the Senate would vote on the nominations, although it was unclear whether Democrats had enough votes to confirm the nominees.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports expected Friday include the federal budget for April from the Treasury Department at 2 p.m.
President Obama will "deliver a statement on the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health, lives and pocketbooks of women and their families" at 2:40 p.m. in the East Room, according to the White House.
During a meeting on Friday, the board of governors of the Postal Service will hold an open session at 8:30 a.m.
At 9 a.m., the United States Chamber of Commerce and its foundation will hold a quarterly economic briefing.
At 1:30 p.m., Secretary of State John Kerry will participate in an online video discussion titled "The U.S. in the World: What's in It for Us?" The conversation, to be held through a Google+ Hangout, will be moderated by Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.

HEADLINE: Obama to Bookend Group of Eight Summit With Belfast and Berlin Visits

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, will make a three-day trip to the United Kingdom and Germany around the G-8 summit in June. 

 BODY:
President Obama and his wife, Michelle, will make a three-day trip to the United Kingdom and Germany around the Group of Eight summit in June, the White House said Friday. 
Mr. Obama will look to ease tensions with Russia during the annual meeting of world leaders, scheduled for June 17 and 18 in Lough Erne, a resort in Northern Ireland, by meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. Relations have soured amid American efforts to punish Russian citizens accused of human rights abuses, but new recognition of shared security concerns after the Boston Marathon bombings has prompted something of a thaw. Mr. Putin skipped last year's summit when Mr. Obama held it at Camp David.
Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain will host the meeting this year, just a month after his planned visit to the White House on Monday.
Before the conference, Mr. Obama is scheduled to start his trip in Belfast, where he will "engage with the people of Northern Ireland and highlight the hard work, dialogue and institutional development they have undertaken together," the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, said in a statement.
Mr. Obama will end his June trip in Berlin, where he will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck of Germany.

HEADLINE: Author of Study on Immigrants' I.Q. Leaves Heritage Foundation

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Jason Richwine, whose critique of an immigration bill in the Senate was undercut by his graduate dissertation on Hispanic immigrants&#8217; intelligence, has parted ways with the conservative research group. 

 BODY:
Jason Richwine, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who argued in a graduate school dissertation that Hispanic immigrants were less intelligent than white Americans, resigned from his post with the foundation on Friday. 
"Jason Richwine let us know he's decided to resign from his position," the Heritage Foundation said in a terse e-mail statement. "He's no longer employed by Heritage."
The foundation declined to comment further, saying, "It is our longstanding policy not to discuss internal personnel matters."
Mr. Richwine was also the co-author of a Heritage Foundation study that criticized legislation in the Senate to overhaul the nation's immigration laws, citing high economic costs. The analysis found that the legislation would cost taxpayers roughly $6.3 trillion over the next 50 years.
But reports this week about the content of Mr. Richwine's 2009 doctorate dissertation, in which he said the lower I.Q.'s of immigrants should be considered when crafting public policy, set off a furor, with some immigration advocates decrying his writing as racist.
The Heritage Foundation had already come under criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for the study on the costs of the immigration proposal, and news of Mr. Richwine's outside writings further undercut the organization's attempt to help shape the immigration debate from the outside.

HEADLINE: Alan Abelson, 87, of Barron's, A Thorn in Wall Street's Side

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Alan Abelson, a former top editor of Barron's magazine who made waves -- sometimes tsunamis -- by writing a pugnacious, sagacious stock market column that denounced Wall Street hucksterism and routinely rocked share prices, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 87.
The cause was a heart attack, his daughter, Reed Abelson, a business reporter for The New York Times, said. 
No subject was sacred to Mr. Abelson, including the celebrated investor Warren Buffett, whom he chided in his column, ''Up & Down Wall Street,'' for being overly optimistic in the 1996 annual report of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Abelson suggested that Mr. Buffett should have added the words ''just kidding.''
In the 1990s, he was consistently scathing in his criticism of the run-up in technology stocks, a stance that was proved right when the tech bubble burst. In December 1992, he pointed out that the $28 billion I.B.M. investors had lost that year exceeded the $16 billion estimated cost of cleaning up after Hurricane Andrew. ''The case for an official designation of I.B.M. as a disaster area seems unanswerably compelling,'' he wrote.
His sarcasm about government economic promises was biting. ''We'll get a second-half recovery,'' he once wrote, ''it just won't be the second half of this year.''
Mr. Abelson was one of those rare journalists who come to personify their publications. Barron's, a weekly tabloid that is more technical than most popular financial magazines, comes out on Saturdays. In the days before global markets, readers of Mr. Abelson's tips and analyses on Barron's front page could ponder their moves on Sunday, a day before the markets opened. Barron's, which has a circulation of about 300,000, has been published by Dow Jones & Company since 1921. Dow Jones has been owned by the News Corporation since 2007.
Mr. Abelson's power prompted executives worried about negative articles to threaten to punch him in the nose early in his career and to sue him in later, gentler times. ''Go right ahead'' was his brisk rejoinder to those threatening to sue. Many did, but none won.
The losers included Business Week magazine, which in 1975 reported that some investors sometimes found out the contents of Mr. Abelson's column in advance. He responded with a libel suit demanding that McGraw-Hill, Business Week's owner, admit that it had no reason to believe he had leaked information on purpose or acted unethically. McGraw-Hill made the admission, and Mr. Abelson dropped his suit.
Alan Howard Abelson was born in New York City on Oct. 12, 1925, grew up in Queens and attended Townsend Harris High School. He entered the City College of New York at 15, studied chemistry and English, and graduated in 1946. The next year, he earned a master's degree in creative writing from the University of Iowa, and went to work as a freelance journalist.
He became a copy boy at The New York Journal-American in 1950 and was promoted to reporter and then, with a $5-a-week raise, to stock market columnist.
Mr. Abelson joined Barron's as a reporter in 1956 and was named managing editor in 1965. He started his column in January 1966 as a piecing together of odds and ends about the stock market. His last column, three months ago, sardonically defined a Wall Street expert as anyone who can spell Mr. Buffett's name.
In 1981, Mr. Abelson was appointed Barron's top editor. Dow Jones asked him to resign in 1992 after circulation fell, but allowed him to continue writing his column. ''I'm a terrible manager,'' he told Manhattan Inc.
Mr. Abelson's wife, the former Virginia Eloise Peterson, who owned a bookstore in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., died in 1999. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his son, Justin, editorial page editor of The Recorder of Greenfield, Mass., and five grandchildren.
In 1998, the G. & R. Loeb Foundation gave Mr. Abelson its lifetime achievement award. ''Few journalists have been as influential as Alan Abelson,'' the foundation said. ''For 41 years he has given us his insights, wisdom and a moral view of a world in which ethics and straight dealings are often rare commodities.''
What many readers and investors most valued in him was his insistent contrarianism in the face of boosters proclaiming the wonders of a particular stock. ''He never promises false hope,'' The Street.com said in 2001. ''Rather no hope. For that, his readers love him.''

HEADLINE: Recovery in Germany Is Faster Than Elsewhere

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE recovery from the Great Recession has been slow, or even nonexistent, in most of the developed world.
But not in Germany.
In Germany, alone among the 27 members of the European Union, unemployment rates for both older and younger workers are now lower than they were when the United States slipped into a recession at the end of 2007.
In the rest of the euro zone, the unemployment rate for workers ages 25 to 74 has more than doubled over that period, to 12.8 percent. The rate for younger workers is more than 30 percent, on average -- and above 50 percent in Spain and Greece. In Germany, it is less than 8 percent. 
The accompanying charts show how unemployment rates for both groups of workers have changed in each of the 17 countries in the euro zone, as well as for Britain and the United States.
In terms of adult unemployment rates, the most recent figures for the United States (6.1 percent) and Britain (5.7 percent) are not that far from Germany's figure of 5.1 percent. The major difference is in youth unemployment, which is above 16 percent in the United States and above 20 percent in Britain.
What accounts for that difference? Some of the credit goes to Germany's education and employment system for young workers, and to German policies that encourage employers facing downturns to reduce working hours rather than fire workers. In Germany, students are separated into different career tracks, with many put into a system that leads to apprenticeships rather than to college degrees.
But that is not the entire story. The euro zone's troubles have helped Germany's export-oriented economy. The weak euro has made Germany's exports more competitive against those of countries with which it competes, most notably the United States and Japan. Since the end of 2007, the euro is down about 10 percent against the dollar and about 20 percent against the yen.
Were the euro zone to break up, there is little question that the value of a new German mark would rise sharply, while the currencies of many other members of the zone would fall relative both to the mark and other international currencies. That would depress German exports.
The charts reflecting Germany's unemployment rates, if they were the only evidence available on world economic trends, would seem to indicate there was a mild downturn in 2009 that soon ended, with the economy recovering the next year. The United States charts would indicate a more severe downturn, followed by a recovery that began in 2010 and may now be gathering strength. In Britain, there has been much less progress since unemployment peaked in 2011.
In the 16 other euro zone countries as a group, the chart indicates a deep recession that leveled off in 2010 and 2011 but has since gotten much worse -- particularly for young workers. ''We will have to speed up in fighting youth unemployment,'' the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, said at a conference this week, ''because otherwise we will lose the support, in a democratic way, in some populations of the European Union.''
If that is to happen, it may require a change of course for Europe, where it appears the rich will continue to get richer. The European Commission's latest economic forecast, released last week, predicted declining unemployment in Germany this year and next, but said joblessness was likely to continue to climb in France, Italy and Spain.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Germany Stands Alone: Unemployment in Germany is now lower than it was before the financial crisis began -- something that is not true of the United States or any other country in the European Union. Germany's unemployment rate for adults is not far below the similar rates in the United States and Britain, but youth unemployment rates are far higher in those countries. The charts show how unemployment rates have changed from December 2007, when the United States recession began, through the most recent data available.

HEADLINE: Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS

 BODY:
The level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared milestone, scientists reported Friday, reaching a concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.
Scientific instruments showed that the gas had reached an average daily level above 400 parts per million -- just an odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions under control are faltering.
The best available evidence suggests the amount of the gas in the air has not been this high for at least three million years, before humans evolved, and scientists believe the rise portends large changes in the climate and the level of the sea.
''It symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in tackling this problem,'' said Pieter P. Tans, who runs the monitoring program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that reported the new reading. 
Ralph Keeling, who runs another monitoring program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, said a continuing rise could be catastrophic. ''It means we are quickly losing the possibility of keeping the climate below what people thought were possibly tolerable thresholds,'' he said.
Virtually every automobile ride, every plane trip and, in most places, every flip of a light switch adds carbon dioxide to the air, and relatively little money is being spent to find and deploy alternative technologies.
China is now the largest emitter, but Americans have been consuming fossil fuels extensively for far longer, and experts say the United States is more responsible than any other nation for the high level.
The new measurement came from analyzers atop Mauna Loa, the volcano on the big island of Hawaii that has long been ground zero for monitoring the worldwide trend on carbon dioxide, or CO2. Devices there sample clean, crisp air that has blown thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean, producing a record of rising carbon dioxide levels that has been closely tracked for half a century.
Carbon dioxide above 400 parts per million was first seen in the Arctic last year, and had also spiked above that level in hourly readings at Mauna Loa.
But the average reading for an entire day surpassed that level at Mauna Loa for the first time in the 24 hours that ended at 8 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday. The two monitoring programs use slightly different protocols; NOAA reported an average for the period of 400.03 parts per million, while Scripps reported 400.08.
Carbon dioxide rises and falls on a seasonal cycle, and the level will dip below 400 this summer as leaf growth in the Northern Hemisphere pulls about 10 billion tons of carbon out of the air. But experts say that will be a brief reprieve -- the moment is approaching when no measurement of the ambient air anywhere on earth, in any season, will produce a reading below 400.
''It feels like the inevitable march toward disaster,'' said Maureen E. Raymo, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a unit of Columbia University.
From studying air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice, scientists know that going back 800,000 years, the carbon dioxide level oscillated in a tight band, from about 180 parts per million in the depths of ice ages to about 280 during the warm periods between. The evidence shows that global temperatures and CO2 levels are tightly linked.
For the entire period of human civilization, roughly 8,000 years, the carbon dioxide level was relatively stable near that upper bound. But the burning of fossil fuels has caused a 41 percent increase in the heat-trapping gas since the Industrial Revolution, a mere geological instant, and scientists say the climate is beginning to react, though they expect far larger changes in the future.
Indirect measurements suggest that the last time the carbon dioxide level was this high was at least three million years ago, during an epoch called the Pliocene. Geological research shows that the climate then was far warmer than today, the world's ice caps were smaller, and the sea level might have been as much as 60 or 80 feet higher.
Experts fear that humanity may be precipitating a return to such conditions -- except this time, billions of people are in harm's way.
''It takes a long time to melt ice, but we're doing it,'' Dr. Keeling said. ''It's scary.''
Dr. Keeling's father, Charles David Keeling, began carbon dioxide measurements on Mauna Loa and at other locations in the late 1950s. The elder Dr. Keeling found a level in the air then of about 315 parts per million -- meaning that if a person had filled a million quart jars with air, about 315 quart jars of carbon dioxide would have been mixed in.
His analysis revealed a relentless, long-term increase superimposed on the seasonal cycle, a trend that was dubbed the Keeling Curve.
Countries have adopted an official target to limit the damage from global warming, with 450 parts per million seen as the maximum level compatible with that goal. ''Unless things slow down, we'll probably get there in well under 25 years,'' Ralph Keeling said.
Yet many countries, including China and the United States, have refused to adopt binding national targets. Scientists say that unless far greater efforts are made soon, the goal of limiting the warming will become impossible without severe economic disruption.
''If you start turning the Titanic long before you hit the iceberg, you can go clear without even spilling a drink of a passenger on deck,'' said Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. ''If you wait until you're really close, spilling a lot of drinks is the best you can hope for.''
Climate-change contrarians, who have little scientific credibility but are politically influential in Washington, point out that carbon dioxide represents only a tiny fraction of the air -- as of Thursday's reading, exactly 0.04 percent. ''The CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rather undramatic,'' a Republican congressman from California, Dana Rohrabacher, said in a Congressional hearing several years ago.
But climate scientists reject that argument, saying it is like claiming that a tiny bit of arsenic or cobra venom cannot have much effect. Research shows that even at such low levels, carbon dioxide is potent at trapping heat near the surface of the earth.
''If you're looking to stave off climate perturbations that I don't believe our culture is ready to adapt to, then significant reductions in CO2 emissions have to occur right away,'' said Mark Pagani, a Yale geochemist who studies climates of the past. ''I feel like the time to do something was yesterday.''

Crossing a Line: Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was measured at just above 400 p.p.m. on Thursday, the highest daily average ever recorded at the flagship Mauna Loa station.
Preindustrial levels of carbon dioxide, as measured in ice bubbles, tended to oscillate between 180 and 280 p.p.m.

HEADLINE: Pay People to Cook at Home

BYLINE: By KRISTIN WARTMAN. 
Kristin Wartman is a journalist who writes about food, health, politics and culture.

 BODY:
THE home-cooked family meal is often lauded as the solution for problems ranging from obesity to deteriorating health to a decline in civility and morals. Using whole foods to prepare meals without additives and chemicals is the holy grail for today's advocates of better eating.
But how do we get there? For many of us, whether we are full-time workers or full-time parents, this home-cooked meal is a fantasy removed from the reality of everyday life. And so Americans continue to rely on highly processed and refined foods that are harmful to their health. 
Those who argue that our salvation lies in meals cooked at home seem unable to answer two key questions: where can people find the money to buy fresh foods, and how can they find the time to cook them? The failure to answer these questions plays into the hands of the food industry, which exploits the healthy-food movement's lack of connection to average Americans. It makes it easier for the industry to sell its products as real American food, with real American sensibilities -- namely, affordability and convenience.
I believe the solution to getting people into the kitchen exists in a long-forgotten proposal. In the 1960s and '70s, when American feminists were fighting to get women out of the house and into the workplace, there was another feminist arguing for something else. Selma James, a labor organizer from Brooklyn, pushed the idea of wages for housework. Ms. James, who worked in a factory as a young woman and later became a housewife and a mother, argued that household work was essential to the American economy and wondered why women weren't being paid for it. As Ms. James and a colleague wrote in 1972, ''Where women are concerned their labor appears to be a personal service outside of capital.''
She argued that it was a mistake to define feminism simply as equal pay in the work force. Instead, she wanted to formally acknowledge the work women were already doing. She knew that women wouldn't stop doing housework once they joined the work force -- rather they would return home each evening for the notorious ''second shift.''
Many feminists at the time ignored the Wages for Housework campaign, while some were blatantly antagonistic toward it. Even today, with all the talk of the importance of home cooking -- a huge part of housework -- no one ever seems to mention Ms. James or Wages for Housework.
But ignoring this idea once again devalues housework and places a premium on working outside of the home. Since women first began to enter the work force, families have increasingly relied on processed foods and inexpensive restaurant meals. Those foods tend to have more calories and less nutritional value than fresh vegetables, fruits and meats, so it's easy to see how the change in meal patterns led to a surge in obesity.
In 1970, Americans spent 26 percent of their food budget on eating out; by 2010, that number had risen to 41 percent. Over that period, rates of obesity in the United States more than doubled. Diabetes diagnoses have also soared, to 25.8 million in 2011 from roughly three million in 1968.
It's nearly impossible for a single parent or even two parents working full time to cook every meal from scratch, planning it beforehand and cleaning it up afterward. This is why many working parents of means employ housekeepers. But if we put this work on women of lower socioeconomic status (as is almost always the case), what about their children? Who cooks and cleans up for them?
In the Wages for Housework campaign, Ms. James argued for a shorter workweek for all, in part so men could help raise the children. This is not a pipe dream. Several Northern European nations have instituted social programs that reflect the importance of this work. The Netherlands promotes a ''1.5 jobs model,'' which allows men and women to work 75 percent of their regular hours when they have young children. In Sweden, parents can choose to work three-quarters of their normal hours until children turn 8.
To get Americans cooking, we need to make it possible. Stay-at-home parents should qualify for a new government program while they are raising young children -- one that provides money for good food, as well as education on cooking, meal planning and shopping -- so that one parent in a two-parent household, or a single parent, can afford to be home with the children and provide wholesome, healthy meals. These payments could be financed by taxing harmful foods, like sugary beverages, highly caloric, processed snack foods and nutritionally poor options at fast food and other restaurants. Directly linking a tax on harmful food products to a program that benefits health would provide a clear rebuttal to critics of these taxes. Business owners who argue that such taxes will hurt their bottom lines would, in fact, benefit from new demand for healthy food options and from customers with money to spend on such foods.
If we truly value domestic work, we should also enact workplace policies that incentivize health, like ''health days'' that employees could use for health-promoting activities: shopping for food, cooking, or tending a community garden.
We can't democratize good food without placing tangible value on the work done in the home. So while proponents of healthier eating are right to emphasize the importance of home-cooking and communal meals, we will never create an actual movement without placing a cultural and monetary premium on the hard work of cooking and the time and skills needed to do it.

HEADLINE: A French Jet Maker Is Approaching a Crossroad

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
SAINT-CLOUD, FRANCE -- As Jérôme Camps, an engineer at Dassault Aviation's main design center, showed off a ghostlike 3-D model of one of the company's small jets here recently, his hand passed through the plane's skin to reveal an intricate web of support structures as well as a jumble of multicolored cables and pneumatic tubes, rendered in vivid detail.
''This is a living tool,'' Mr. Camps said, as an assistant rotated the projected image with a few keystrokes. ''This is it. There are no blueprints.''
Dassault Aviation, the French maker of the Falcon series of business jets as well as the Rafale military fighter, first started to dispense with traditional paper drawings and physical scale mock-ups a decade ago, migrating to an all-digital design system that has since been adopted globally by the aerospace industry, as well as by automakers and other manufacturers. It is an innovation that the company -- still controlled by the heirs of Marcel Dassault, a pioneer of France's modern aerospace industry -- is fiercely proud. 
Despite its broader influence, Dassault, while respectably profitable, is fighting to maintain its footing after the financial crisis eroded demand for flashy business jets, coupled with deep, austerity-driven cuts in European defense budgets. In this environment, some industry analysts wonder how much longer the company can continue to go it alone in an increasingly competitive global market.
''France, and especially Dassault, are unique in the world of aerospace,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''They don't outsource much outside of France.''
Dassault is dealing with a confluence of issues.
Of Dassault's 11,600 employees worldwide, more than two-thirds are based in France, where hourly manufacturing pay is 20 percent higher than in the United States in dollar terms and labor laws are notoriously inflexible.
High-tech manufacturers face added political pressure to resist moving coveted skilled jobs to less costly markets. While the company's roots are in military aircraft, private jets have been its mainstay for decades, generating 70 percent of its 3.9 billion euros, or $5.1 billion, in revenue last year. Demand plunged with the global financial crisis that hit in late 2008, diminishing the global jet set as bank credit tightened and private planes became a symbol of excess.
Dassault says new orders have begun to recover, but Éric Trappier, Dassault's chief executive, still describes the market as ''convalescent.'' The company wants to deliver 70 Falcon jets this year, up from 66 in 2012.
Dassault's Rafale order book has been almost entirely dependent on the French government, which has so far ordered about 200 fighters -- of which a little more than half have been delivered, at a rate of around 10 a year. Last month, however, the government of François Hollande slashed its commitment to the Rafale, capping France's total projected fleet at 225, down from 286. The cuts are part of an austerity budget that aims to limit overall French military spending.
As such, Dassault faces intense pressure to find export customers for the Rafale. It won a critical victory in early 2012 after India selected it as the preferred bidder for a $10 billion order of 126 planes, beating out Eurofighter as well as its American rivals Boeing and Lockheed Martin. But talks to complete the deal drag on. Analysts say Dassault's prospects in other international fighter contests -- in Brazil, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere -- look grim.
''I don't have too many doubts that Dassault can continue to flourish in business jets,'' said Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at Echelon Research and Advisory in London. ''But I don't think it has got the ability to maintain its combat jet capability without French government commitment and French government funding.''
This raises the question, analysts said, of whether Dassault can -- or should -- remain an independent player in European military projects over the longer term. France's Rafale orders should keep factories humming through about 2022, while a contract from India might further extend production. But even then, an independent Dassault risks becoming a niche player in an era where shrinking budgets are raising pressure on military companies -- and governments -- to consider pooling their resources for future programs.
''There will not be another manned fighter development by a single nation-state,'' Howard Wheeldon, an independent strategist and fellow of the British Royal Aeronautical Society, predicted. ''Those days are gone, even for the French.''
Another company in a situation similar to Dassault's might seek to spin off its military business and sell it to a larger European player, analysts said. But in addition to a fierce sense of identity, the ownership structure at Dassault significantly complicates matters. A family holding -- Groupe Industriel Marcel Dassault -- owns a little more than 50 percent of the company, while European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent company of Airbus, holds a weighty 46 percent minority stake.
''If the freely floated part of Dassault was in the driver's seat, a sale or merger of the defense business would be the economically rational outcome,'' said Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group. ''If you need capital to grow and achieve critical mass, that is the sensible strategy.''
But it is a strategy that, for now, remains anathema to the Dassault family and to management. ''Merging for merging's sake has no interest for us,'' Mr. Trappier said. ''That's not our philosophy. It's not our concept.''
Dassault's innovations have served the company well in recent years. Its all-digital design system has enabled the company to compress the development times for new jets by allowing its more than 1,500 engineers and contractors at a half-dozen locations to collaborate in real time. ''These tools are a big help in terms of developing high-quality new products,'' Mr. Trappier said.
''But they are also critical for us to be competitive'' against Dassault's main competitors, Gulfstream of the United States and Bombardier of Canada. And Dassault recognizes that its future lies, if not in consolidation, then in deeper cooperation with its European peers, Mr. Trappier said. In that respect, Dassault feels its digital design and collaborative development methods will guarantee the company a seat at the European defense table.
Last December, a consortium led by Dassault celebrated the first flight of the nEUROn, an armed drone demonstrator that was conceived, designed and built by a half-dozen European companies using the same 3-D platform used to develop the Falcon 7X and the Rafale. The total price tag for the six-year project came to 400 million euros.
''It is the French who were in charge'' of the nEUROn, Mr. Trappier said. While no European government has so far committed to an unmanned fighter program, he says he believes the project ''paves the way for the future'' of combat jet development.
''I am convinced that the next fighters will be developed in cooperation,'' Mr. Trappier said. ''We will find the partners we need,'' he added. ''We don't need to merge to cooperate.''

HEADLINE: 'Great Gatsby' Is Poised for a Strong Opening, No Thanks to Critics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- As very early box-office numbers for ''The Great Gatsby'' rolled in -- a strong $3.25 million from the Thursday late-night shows, Warner Brothers said on Friday morning -- it was already becoming clear that the audience has a mind of its own. 
More than a few critics were rough on the film. (''There may be worse movies this summer than 'The Great Gatsby,' but there won't be a more crushing disappointment,'' wrote Peter Travers, who reviewed it for Rolling Stone.) But Friday morning found Hollywood's box office watchers privately predicting opening weekend numbers even higher than the $40 million or so being publicly bandied about in various reports.
A $40 million opening would make it the best, by far, for Baz Luhrmann, who directed the film. According to boxofficemojo.com, his previous record was the $14.8 million in opening weekend ticket sales for ''Australia,'' which was released by 20th Century Fox in 2008. That film went on to take in about $50 million at the domestic box office, short of the ultimate receipts for ''Moulin Rouge!,'' which was directed by Mr. Luhrmann, and had $57.4 million in domestic ticket sales after its release in 2001.
Whatever the critics may think, it appears that ''The Great Gatsby,'' with a big boost from premium-prices 3-D ticket sales, is well on its way to becoming Mr. Luhrmann's highest grossing film, even adjusting for inflation. According to Box Office Mojo, ''Romeo + Juliet,'' released in 1996, currently holds that honor. Adjusted to current prices, that film, which took in about $46 million at the time, would have had about $83 million in domestic sales.
But there are bigger things at stake here than Mr. Luhrmann's career. Based on early ticket sales, the audience appears to be sending a message: It is hungry for spectacle, but it also wants something to talk about. ''Iron Man 3'' did great for Disney when it opened last weekend. But it isn't the kind of movie that starts water-cooler arguments, expanding Hollywood's usual audience with viewers who want to see something challenging, or just new. ''Life of Pi'' appears to have done that last year. To some extent, ''Hugo'' did it the year before.
Films of that sort don't easily spawn sequels. Even Baz Luhrmann would be hard-pressed to design a ''Gatsby 2.'' But they do stir things up.

HEADLINE: Pro-Inflation Policies Show Signs of Helping Japanese Economy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
TOKYO -- For almost two decades, Japan's economic fortunes have deteriorated, and little seemed to be done about it.
But in the last few months, the nation's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has pushed policy makers and other officials to take bold steps to revive Japan, one of the world's largest economies. Their handiwork was evident Friday when the yen hit 100 to the dollar for the first time in four years.
Normally a weakening exchange rate might be taken as a sign of decline. The yen has fallen nearly 14 percent against the dollar this year, and no currency has fallen more except the Venezuelan bolívar.
In Japan's case, it is a sign that the policies put in place by Mr. Abe and Haruhiko Kuroda, chairman of the Bank of Japan, are starting to work. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive around the world. 
''Abenomics is about coming out on top in global competition,'' Mr. Abe said during a live interview on the Fuji Television Network. ''We're finally seeing a correction of the excessively strong yen.''
The most immediate effect of the weaker yen has been the increase in profits of major exporters. This past week, Toyota Motor reported that net income in the last 12 months had jumped threefold, and Sony produced an annual profit for the first time in five years. Both forecast further profit increases largely because of the weaker yen.
Perhaps more important, particularly for the citizens of Japan, who have suffered from a long period of falling wages and prices, the yen's move is expected to kindle inflation in the once moribund economy.
The Bank of Japan, the central bank, has moved aggressively to reinvigorate the economy and fight deflation. Last month, it announced a decisive break with its earlier policies. Instead of focusing on keeping overnight interest rates close to zero -- which seemed to be having little effect in reviving growth -- the central bank aimed to double the amount of money in circulation, seeking to produce annual inflation of about 2 percent.
''This is new territory for the Bank of Japan, and the market is responding to that,'' said Aroop Chatterjee, foreign exchange strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''The Bank of Japan announced very strong monetary policy easing at the start of April.''
However, he said the more immediate catalyst for the rate's crossing of the threshold was signs of strength in the U.S. economy.
Akira Amari, the Japanese economic revitalization minister, quickly drew attention away from Japan's role in weakening its own currency, in a bid to stave off accusations that Japan was manipulating the yen to bolster its exports. Rather, he said, the strength of the dollar reflected investors' hopes for an economic comeback in the United States.
''It's the dollar that's in demand because economic recovery in America is gathering steam,'' Mr. Amari said at a morning news conference.
The efforts by the Bank of Japan to continue to flood the economy with liquidity are likely to keep downward pressure on the yen in the coming months. The central bank is following an asset purchase program to inflate the economy by aggressively buying longer-term bonds and doubling its government bond holdings in two years.
By Friday night in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at ¥101.42.
Galvanized by the yen's renewed weakness, the Nikkei 225-stock index jumped more than 400 points, or 2.9 percent, to close in Tokyo at 14,607.54, led by exporters' stocks.
Japanese officials say the policy does not overtly pursue a lower yen rate, which could raise tensions with other exporting nations, like the United States. But a weaker yen is a welcome development in some ways.
The depreciation of the yen may be a step in the right direction as the authorities try to stimulate some growth. However, Japan still faces many stiff challenges until it breaks out of its period of deflation. It has an aging and shrinking population and cumbersome regulations that make the economy inefficient.
As Mr. Abe has tried to put a new focus on reviving the economy, he has also fought with the central bank's former leaders over setting the 2 percent inflation goal. Mr. Abe's pressure led to the resignation of the bank's previous governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, a moderate, two weeks before his term was up, making way for Mr. Kuroda, who shares Mr. Abe's economic philosophy.
Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, said some in the market were speculating that the yen had been driven lower by non-Japanese investors. Those investors were anticipating that cash-rich Japanese investors were finally going to start selling their yen holdings to buy bonds from the United States and other foreign countries in a hunt for higher yields outside Japan.
While the weaker yen is good for Japanese exporters, it makes imported products more expensive. That in turn can make selling foreign goods there harder. In a statement, the American Automotive Policy Council reacted strongly to the currency milestone. ''The depth of Japanese currency manipulation has reached a new low,'' said Matt Blunt, the council's president. He said the yen's weakening would cost the United States exports and jobs.
For Japan, what exporters do with their extra profits will be crucial in determining whether the wider economy gets a similar lift. Recent data suggest that Japanese exporters are keeping the prices of their goods unchanged, preferring simply to expand profits instead of slashing prices to increase export volumes. Even if they do nothing, exporters' overseas earnings are worth more as the yen weakens.
And for now, it remains unlikely that exporters will race to bring investment, production and jobs back to an aging and shrinking Japanese population, despite the lower local costs associated with a weakening yen. If ''companies are unwilling to spend or invest in the domestic economy, then there is likely to be no positive contribution to'' gross domestic product, Paul Donovan, global economist at UBS, warned in a report early Friday.
Meanwhile, there are already concerns that too weak a currency could bring pain to a nation dependent on imports for energy and food. The Fukushima nuclear crisis, which has all but shut down Japan's nuclear power program, has already led to surging oil and natural gas imports and rising energy prices.
News shows have breathlessly covered recent price increases in items like tissue paper and canned tuna, perhaps a sign of the shock that prices should rise at all after more than a decade of deflation, rather than any immediate risk to household finances.
The key, economists say, lies in how much exporters will pass on their bigger profits to consumers, by raising wages or hiring new workers. Higher incomes would drive a much-needed recovery in consumption, bringing about a virtuous cycle of rising prices, profits, investment and even higher incomes.
Mr. Abe himself has been publicly pressuring corporate executives to increase pay, declaring on television last month that companies needed to ''return favorable corporate earnings to their workers,'' prompting a string of companies to declare wage increases or extra bonuses in recent months.
''If wages can rise, then the return to inflation is good news,'' Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a recent research note. ''If wages are going to be flat or down, all we are going to see is stagflation.''
But Mr. Abe reassured the public Friday, telling Fuji Television that the trickle-down to consumers from the weaker yen was already starting. Tourism from overseas was already picking up, for example, as foreign visitors took advantage of the weaker yen, he said. ''It might take a year or two for everyone's incomes to grow, but we've already seen things start to improve this year,'' he said.
Graham Bowley reported from New York.

HEADLINE: In Immigration Bill Talks, House Group Raises Voice

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group in the House of Representatives has been meeting on and off for four years behind closed doors, working on its own version of legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration laws. But with a comprehensive bill already making its way through the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House group is fast losing its chance to shape the debate percolating on Capitol Hill, let alone put forth a proposal of its own.
''I think a lot of us believed in this bipartisan group that we would have finished quite some time ago,'' said Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California and a member of the group. ''I think you really make it tough for yourself, and I hope House Republicans would agree with me on that, that you make it difficult to believe that you're for fixing the broken immigration system and getting our economy on track unless you really seriously try to start in May.'' 
Already, the House Judiciary Committee has begun introducing a series of bills pegged to certain parts of an immigration overhaul, in a move designed, in part, to press the bipartisan group to action.
One major block, aides say, is reluctance on the part of Republicans in the group to accept a deal between the nation's leading business and labor organizations, which would establish a guest worker program, known as a W-Visa program, for low-skilled, year-round temporary workers, those who perform seasonal work but are allowed to stay in the country throughout the year.
Though the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. reached an agreement in late March on a guest worker program, which was incorporated into legislation drafted by a similar bipartisan group in the Senate, House Republicans believe the deal is too favorable to labor and are trying to rework it. The current agreement starts the number of available W-Visas at 20,000, capping it at 200,000 visas annually, and limits the number of visas available to construction occupations at 15,000 annually.
Democrats in the House group say there was an implicit agreement to accept whatever deal the business and labor groups agreed upon. But Republicans want to raise the overall cap, particularly on construction visas.
''From a 30,000-foot level, the concern is that construction is being treated differently than any other industry in the Senate bill,'' said Geoff Burr, the vice president for federal affairs at the Associated Builders & Contractors. ''The 15,000 cap in the Senate bill is preposterous.''
Republicans and outside groups are pushing several options to increase the number of construction visas available: making those visas a percentage of the overall W-Visas, rather than imposing a hard cap; making it easier for employers who still face labor shortages after the quota is met to use a ''safety valve'' exemption to bring in more foreign workers; and creating a returning worker exemption, in which those workers are not counted under the cap.
But Democrats in the group think that trying to modify the already delicate business-labor agreement could harm the overall bill.
''The moment you pull the thread from one side on this fabric, this compromise, the moment it gets undone on the other side,'' Mr. Becerra said.
Labor organizations have publicly and privately indicated that they will not support any changes to the existing W-Visa program. ''We can't accept any changes in the W-Visa program,'' said Tom Snyder, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s immigration campaign manager. ''We spent many months working and reworking and carefully crafting this agreement with the Chamber of Commerce, and succeeded in getting it into the Senate bill, and we just won't accept changes.''
Whatever legislation does emerge from the Republican-controlled House, however, is expected to be more conservative than the Senate's approach. The House bill would offer a 15-year path to citizenship, rather than the 13-year path in the Senate plan, aides say. Both bills, however, would allow people in the country illegally to earn a green card in 10 years.
Under the House plan, people would also be required, as part of their application progress for legal status, to sign an admission stating they had violated American immigration laws, aides said. That admission would lead to a probationary status, and if an immigrant was then found to violate the terms of probation, he or she would be subject to deportation.
Conservative groups have been critical of the Senate bill's estimated costs. The Heritage Foundation issued a study estimating that the legislation would cost taxpayers roughly $6.3 trillion over the next 50 years, but members of both parties objected to it. The report also became a target when it was disclosed that the co-author, Jason Richwine, had written a doctoral dissertation in which he said immigrants' I.Q.'s should be considered when shaping policy. On Friday, Mr. Richwine, a senior policy analyst at the foundation, resigned.
The Senate bipartisan group is eager for the House to produce legislation of its own -- especially if it reflects principles in line with those already in the Senate plan.
''If the House eight of them came in with a bill very similar to ours, that would be helpful, and I would hope they could,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate group.

HEADLINE: Week Finishes on High Note for Dow and S.&P. 500, With an Assist From the Tech Sector

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended at milestone highs on Friday, as shares posted a third consecutive week of gains when a rise in Google and other technology shares offset a slide in energy stocks. 
Nasdaq led gains, bolstered by a 1 percent rise in Google's stock.
Indexes were flat for much of the session, but managed a late-day surge. On Thursday, the S.& P. 500 broke a five-day streak of new closing highs.
Stocks have risen on the Federal Reserve's bond buying and some encouraging corporate earnings, but analysts said the momentum could wane without further positive signs.
''I think it's going to be hard to maintain these levels in the short term,'' said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Maryland, which has about $13 billion in assets.
''There are not a lot of positive catalysts to keep it going,'' she said, noting that spending cuts by the federal government could pressure the economy in the near term.
Oil prices tumbled as the dollar hit a four-and-a-half-year high against the yen, and the dollar index was on track for its strongest week in 10 months against other major currencies. A strong dollar makes commodities priced in dollars, like gold and oil, more expensive for foreign investors, pressuring shares of energy and basic materials companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 35.87 points, or 0.24 percent, at 15,118.49. The S.& P. 500 was up 7.03 points, or 0.43 percent, at 1,633.70. The Nasdaq composite index was up 27.41 points, or 0.80 percent, at 3,436.58.
The S.& P. 500 is up 14.6 percent for the year. For the week, the Dow rose 1 percent, the S.& P. 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq 1.7 percent.
Among energy stocks, Exxon Mobil lost 1 percent to $90.14.
Shares of Hess slid 2.3 percent to $69.30. John B. Hess, its chief executive and son of the company's founder, is being stripped of his duties as chairman as the oil and gas company scrambles to keep an activist investor at bay.
The S.& P. energy index dropped 0.5 percent as Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices fell.
Shares of Priceline jumped 3.8 percent to $765.41, a day after the online travel company reported a first-quarter profit that topped estimates.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 25/32 to 98 21/32. Its yield rose to 1.90 percent, from 1.81 percent.

HEADLINE: Heavy Load of Student Loan Debt Is Weighing on the Economy, Too

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
The anemic economy has left millions of younger working Americans struggling to get ahead. The added millstone of student loan debt, which recently exceeded $1 trillion in total, is making it even harder for many of them, delaying purchases of things like homes, cars and other big-ticket items and acting as a drag on growth, economists said.
Consider Shane Gill, a 33-year-old high-school teacher in New York City. He does not have a car. He does not own a home. He is not married. And he is no anomaly: like hundreds of thousands of others in his generation, he has put off such major purchases or decisions in part because of his debts. 
Mr. Gill owes about $45,000 in federal student loans, plus another $40,000 to his parents. That investment in his future has led to a secure job with decent pay and good benefits. But it has left him with tremendous financial constraints, as he faces chipping away at the debt for years on end.
''There's this anxiety: what if I decided I wanted to get married or have children?'' Mr. Gill said. ''I don't know how I would. And that adds to the sense of precariousness. There's a persistent, buzzing kind of toothache around it.''
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a new study, found that 30-year-olds with student loans were now less likely to have debts like home mortgages than 30-year-olds without student loans -- even though most of those with student loans are better educated and can expect to earn more money over their lifetimes. The same pattern holds true for 25-year-olds and car loans.
''It is a new thing, a big social experiment that we've accidentally decided to engage in,'' said Kevin Carey, the director of the Education Policy Program at the New America Foundation, a research group based in Washington. ''Let's send a whole class of people out into their professional lives with a negative net worth. Not starting at zero, but starting at a minus that is often measured in the tens of thousands of dollars. Those minus signs have psychological impact, I suspect. They might have a dollars-and-cents impact in what you can afford, too.''
The weak economy and tight credit standards remain the main culprits preventing young people just establishing themselves from making major purchases. But millions now face putting a substantial share of their take-home pay toward past debts rather than present needs. Student loan debt leaves them with less money for things like clothes and restaurant meals. And it is even more likely to suppress purchases of more expensive items that need to be bought with credit. A poor job market is compounding the problem: the educational debt burden of many so-called millennials has sharply increased even as they are being forced to get by on significantly less income than the previous generation -- a decline of about 15 percent in real terms since 2000, with much of that drop coming from the recession.
According to calculations by the Pew Research Center, the measure of debt to income for households under the age of 35 has ballooned to about 1.5-to-1 in 2010 from about 1-to-1 in 2001. The composition of that debt has shifted, too: more is tied to student debts, and less to homes. ''Having a lot of student loan debt makes it harder to qualify for a mortgage and harder to save for a down payment,'' said Jed Kolko, the chief economist at Trulia.
With the interest rate on some federal student loans set to double on July 1, House Republicans and Senate Democrats have both put forward proposals to try to hold them down. Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota, has proposed tying the rate on several federal student loans to the government's borrowing costs. Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin of Illinois, have made a similar proposal. Some have suggested going further: Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has proposed letting students borrow at the same ''discount rate'' that the Federal Reserve charges to banks, currently 0.75 percent.
Student loan debt is not only constraining young adults, but also, at least in the near term, holding back the recovery itself, some economists say. The shadows might remain even as the economy picks up, by making young workers more cautious when it comes to decisions about their careers and their finances. Millennials might end up buying less expensive homes or more often choosing to rent than previous generations.
''The debt is shifting how much young people can spend, and it can also be a powerful psychological thing as well,'' said Selma Hepp, an economist at the California Association of Realtors.
On the other side of the equation, many college graduates now in their 20s and early 30s should eventually be able to make up for lost ground. Students who take on debt to pay for higher education commit themselves to paying off huge sums, but they usually lift their lifetime earnings by substantial amounts. And they are in a better position to insulate themselves against economic bad times, given the profound rewards the job market provides to the college-educated.
Indeed, the economy is far more punishing to workers without a college degree. The college-educated earn, on average, 80 percent more than those who only completed high school, a premium that has widened over the last 30 years. Unemployment rates for the less educated are higher, too.
For most young workers, gaining a college degree remains well worth it in the long run, even if it delays some purchases in the near term. ''For an individual going to college and ending up with a lot of debt -- you're still better off,'' said Chris G. Christopher of the forecasting firm IHS Global Insight. There might, however, be a slice of young workers who paid huge sums for degrees that prove less valuable on the job market, saddled by a debt burden that could end up holding them back for decades.
Mr. Gill said his education remained a vital investment, even if the debt overhang has for now put white picket fences or a condo with a gleaming view out of reach. ''Sometimes I think: 'What if I were to buy an apartment?' '' he said. ''It is like asking: 'What am I going to do when I first land on the moon? What's the first thought that I will have when I see Earth from outer space?' ''

HEADLINE: U.S. Posts $113 Billion Surplus in April

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The United States government reported a rare surplus of $113 billion for April, the largest in five years and a sign of the nation's improving finances. Steady economic growth and higher tax rates have increased tax revenue in recent months, keeping this year's annual budget deficit on pace to be the smallest since 2008. Through the first seven months of the budget year, the deficit was $488 billion, according to the Treasury, less than last year's deficit of $720 billion over the same period. Even with the improvement, the deficit for the full year will still be quite large: the Congressional Budget Office expects it will reach $845 billion when the budget year ends on Sept. 30. While that would be the first annual deficit below $1 trillion since 2008, it would still be the fifth-largest deficit in United States history. 
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Umpire Suspended for Allowing a Pitching Change in Violation of the Rules

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
In a week in which umpires twice became the story of games because of high-profile mistakes, Major League Baseball took action on Friday, handing a two-game suspension to Fieldin Culbreth, the umpire who on Thursday incorrectly allowed an illegal pitching change in a game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels.
The Culbreth controversy erupted when Houston's rookie manager, Bo Porter, tried to remove a pitcher, Wesley Wright, who had yet to pitch to a batter. Porter, reacting to a pinch-hitter announcement, wanted to bring in Hector Ambriz instead. 
The switch was questioned by Angels Manager Mike Scioscia, who cited Official Baseball Rule 3.05(b), which states a pitcher who has yet to face a batter can only be removed because of illness or injury. But Culbreth ruled against Scioscia, and the Angels said they would play the remainder of the game under protest. They went on to win, 6-5.
On Friday, M.L.B. ruled that Culbreth's decision was a clear violation of 3.05(b) and that Wright should have been forced to pitch to a batter. The suspension will start at a date determined by the commissioner's office, and fines were issued to the other umpires of his crew: Brian O'Nora, Bill Welke and Adrian Johnson.
An umpire being suspended is rare but not unprecedented. Last season, Bob Davidson was suspended one game for repeated violations and in 2007 Mike Winters was suspended for three games for poor conduct on the field in an incident with Milton Bradley. In that instance, Bradley reacted so violently to the exchange with Winters that he tore a ligament in his knee while entangled with coaches trying to restrain him.
The Culbreth ruling came two days after Angel Hernandez, the second base umpire and crew chief in a game between the Cleveland Indians and Oakland Athletics, incorrectly said a game-tying home run by Adam Rosales of the Athletics had not cleared the wall, instead ruling it a double. Asked to review the play, in which the ball appeared to ricochet off a railing high above the outfield wall, Hernandez and his crew chose to uphold the call. The Athletics, like the Angels, protested, and went on to lose the game by one run.
On Thursday, M.L.B. confirmed the ruling was made in error, but said no action would be taken.
''By rule, the decision to reverse a call by use of instant replay is at the sole discretion of the crew chief,'' Joe Torre, who oversees umpiring, said in a statement released Thursday. ''In the opinion of Angel Hernandez, who was last night's crew chief, there was not clear and convincing evidence to overturn the decision on the field. It was a judgment call, and as such, it stands as final.''
Neither protest rose to the high standards necessary under baseball's rules.
In the case of the Athletics, the call made on the field was not eligible for a protest. Official Rule 4.19 states, in part, ''No protest shall ever be permitted on judgment decisions by the umpire.'' As a home run call, even in replay, is a judgment decision, Hernandez's call could not be protested. For the Angels, the lack of formal protest was simply because the team went on to win the game.
Even in the rare instance that a team files a legitimate formal protest, the chances of any action are slim. Since 2004, 11 protests have been filed with the commissioner's office, and each has been denied. The most recent protest, filed by Scioscia last season, involved a baserunner impeding a fielder by running out of the basepath.
The Web site Retrosheet.org has tried to put together a list of all games in which a protest was upheld, with play resuming at the point of the protest, and has identified 14. The last, a 1986 game between the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates, in which the Pirates claimed a rain delay was not handled properly, resulted in the game being restarted two days later. Despite the restart, the Pirates still lost.
The most famous protest is the one filed by the Kansas City Royals in support of George Brett, who had been denied a go-ahead home run in the ninth inning against the Yankees in July 1983 over the amount of pine tar on his bat. In that case, the umpiring crew made the decision correctly based on the letter of the law, but they were overruled by Lee MacPhail, the president of the American League, who said the pine tar rule was based on economics, and not strategic advantage.
Should the Athletics find themselves one game out of the playoffs come October, they regret not having had a similar ruling made in their favor.

HEADLINE: Seamless Regulation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''A Disappointing Debut'' (editorial, May 6), about the regulation of derivatives: 
Seen from Europe, you are less than fair to Mary Jo White, the new chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial crisis taught us the hard way that regulatory shortcomings have global consequences. Just as the crisis is international in origin and scope, so must the regulatory response eschew protectionism and insularity.
The Group of 20 finance ministers and bank governors developed international standards on derivatives now being enacted in domestic law, both in the United States and across the European Union.
Lest we create friction and opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, it is essential that international companies and transactions operating across the Atlantic be covered by seamless regulation.
For this purpose, United States agencies have developed the concept of ''substituted compliance'' and we have ''equivalence.'' Put simply, we check that the other side's rules generate the same outcome as our own, and if so, we allow each other's rules to cover companies and transactions with which they are most closely connected.
The European Union counts on the American authorities to provide effective supervision and cooperation and of course offers the same treatment in return.

HEADLINE: How Errors In Investing Cost a College Its Legacy

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Since Peter Cooper's heirs gave the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art the land under the Chrysler Building in 1902, the school's endowment has enabled it to offer students a high-quality, tuition-free education through two world wars, the Great Depression and multiple stock market crashes and financial crises.
So why does Cooper Union now find itself forced to charge tuition of an estimated $20,000 a year, abandoning what many consider its most important legacy?
This week, angry students were occupying the president's office in protest. They might be even angrier to learn that some of their future tuition dollars could be going to support wealthy hedge fund managers who oversee some of the school's $666.7 million endowment. 
Cooper Union may be an extreme example, but it's hardly the only college suffering from a combination of decades of bad decisions and recent treacherous markets. Its endowment was typical of the many endowments and pension funds that took the plunge into so-called alternative investments like hedge funds, which have lured investors with the promise of generous and steady returns in both good times and bad. And compared with many universities, Cooper Union did a good job managing its endowment through the recent financial crisis. As recently as 2009, the school maintains, it ranked first among all American universities for endowment performance.
Even so, hedge funds couldn't solve the college's dire financial problems, and many hedge funds have been far more successful at lining the pockets of their managers than beating market averages. (The typical hedge fund manager charges a fee of 2 percent of assets plus 20 percent of any gains.) In fiscal year 2009, which ended June 30, 2009, Cooper Union's hedge funds and other managed assets lost 14 percent, and the returns since then have lagged the stock market's recovery. Today, Cooper Union's endowment is lower than it was at the end of fiscal year 2008, even as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has hit new highs. From 2009 to 2012, a simple, low-fee mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds far outperformed hedge fund indexes.
Weak hedge fund performance is hardly Cooper Union's only financial problem. Today's crisis has been brewing for decades if not longer, and comes after years of what looks like bad management decisions with little accountability or supervision by New York's attorney general, who oversees nonprofit institutions. Over the decades, Cooper Union has sold off assets piecemeal, failed to diversify its endowment, taken on debt and built a lavish new building. After the 2000-1 stock market plunge, the managed endowment, excluding the Chrysler Building, lost half its value. The school never cultivated its potential donor base, leaving most graduates with the impression that it was wealthy and didn't need alumni contributions.
In some ways, it's surprising that the school's trustees managed to stave off charging tuition as long as they did. ''We've only been one step ahead of the bailiff for decades,'' said John C. Michaelson, a trustee who runs an investment firm and has been chairman of the investment committee since 2012, as well as from 2005 to 2008. ''We were pulling rabbits out of hats.''
The simplest rule of asset management, one familiar to even novice investors, is diversification. Yet Cooper Union's endowment is highly unusual in that it's concentrated in a single asset -- the land under the Chrysler Building -- which accounts for nearly 84 percent of its assets, according to its most recent financial statement.
By contrast, Emory University in Atlanta, which as recently as 2001 had 60 percent of its main endowment in Coca-Cola stock, has since sold all of it and diversified into other assets.
Having so much of the endowment in a single asset ''is against everything I stand for,'' Mr. Michaelson said. He and other trustees said they considered selling it in 2006, when the college was facing mounting financial deficits, but concluded that would be impractical. Cooper Union receives annual lease payments of $9 million from the owner of the Chrysler Building, Tishman Speyer Properties, and $18.2 million in so-called tax equivalency payments that would otherwise go to New York City. The right to the tax revenue couldn't be transferred to a buyer.
But assuming a 5 percent return, a $27.2 million annual revenue stream would be generated by selling the Chrysler Building land for $544 million, which doesn't seem so far-fetched a price. Tishman Speyer sold 666 Fifth Avenue, which hardly compares to the landmark Chrysler Building, for $1.8 billion in 2006, and bought the MetLife building in 2005 for $1.72 billion. And the Chrysler site might have been highly appealing to a sovereign wealth fund or other major real estate investor looking for a trophy asset. (A Cooper Union spokesman said the trustees needed to generate annual revenue of $55 million, which the lease is expected to produce beginning in 2018. The amount necessary to generate that revenue at a 5 percent return would be $1.1 billion.)
Still, it doesn't seem the trustees made any serious attempt to even determine its market price, and the college seems to have had a nostalgic attachment to it as a part of its heritage. In 2006, Cooper Union defended the decision not to sell the land by describing it as ''a gift from the children of Peter Cooper,'' that is ''the heart of the Cooper Union.''
Instead, Cooper Union renegotiated the lease with Tishman Speyer, which was not due to expire until 2047. The college negotiated an increase to $32.5 million in 2018, which rises every 10 years thereafter. But it still had to make it to 2018, five years into the future.
At the same time that Cooper Union decided not to try to sell the site, it borrowed $175 million, using the Chrysler site as collateral, to build a new engineering and art building and ''to meet future operating deficits,'' as the school acknowledged in court papers seeking permission for the loan. The term of the loan was 30 years, at an interest rate of 5.875 percent, which amounts to more than $10 million in interest payments a year. By today's standards, 5.875 percent is exorbitant, but the college said it couldn't refinance the loan at a lower rate.
Hardly anyone disputes Cooper Union's need for new engineering facilities. Whether it needed that particular building, at such high cost -- about $166 million -- remains a matter of dispute. Trustees told me that the college's development consultants told them that a signature building with a marquee architect -- in this case, Thom Mayne of Morphosis Architects -- would attract a large donor eager to have his or her name on a trophy building.
But no such donor materialized, and experts I consulted said Cooper Union had it backward -- the first step is to attract the donor, who then is involved in choosing the architect and designing the building. ''I've never heard of a case where you build the building first and hope a donor comes along,'' said Kenneth E. Redd, director of research and policy analysis for the National Association of College and University Business Officers. Trustees I spoke to agreed that the assurances they got that donors would materialize proved to be wrong. ''We were supposed to raise another $125 million,'' a trustee told me. ''We didn't. Maybe we were over-optimistic, but we had these professional development people who told us someone would want to put their name on the building.''
Of the loan proceeds, $34 million was turned over to the school's endowment. According to Mr. Michaelson, all of that was held in cash and used over the next few years to cover the school's mounting operating deficits. ''I never would have borrowed money to invest in the market,'' Mr. Michaelson said. ''It's against everything I believe in; I don't believe in leverage. Leverage is great on the upside. It destroys you on the downside. We couldn't afford to lose money.''
But the endowment aside, the large loan did have the effect of adding a large amount of leverage to Cooper Union's balance sheet at what turned out to be an especially bad moment. And the cash freed up other money for alternative assets at what turned out to be the top of the market. In 2006, the school had $19.4 million in hedge funds. In 2007, that had ballooned to $75.6 million, which amounted to more than 60 percent of the managed portfolio, excluding the Chrysler site and cash. By 2008, the hedge fund investments amounted to almost $103 million. That's a very high concentration of the non-real estate assets in a single asset class.
Cooper Union's heavy reliance on hedge funds ''strikes me as irresponsible,'' said Simon Lack, an investment adviser and author of ''The Hedge Fund Mirage,'' which questions many of the premises of hedge funds. ''Of course, it was forced upon them by a long series of what look like bad decisions. But there's no way that hedge funds could deliver the returns they wanted after their high fee structure.''
Mr. Michaelson said he anticipated there might be a market downturn, and that the hedge funds included so-called long-short funds and absolute return strategies intended to protect against declining markets. But by the end of fiscal year 2009, Cooper Union's hedge funds amounted to just $18.8 million, in part because of market declines and in part through liquidation.
Mr. Michaelson said he was aiming for a 10 percent annual return, which may have been attainable in the early days of hedge funds, when they had much less capital to invest. Today, ''such returns are simply unrealistic,'' Mr. Lack said.
Hedge funds did help cushion the market decline in fiscal year 2009, when the S.& P. 500 dropped about 26 percent. But they have hurt the endowment's performance since then. Mr. Michaelson said Cooper Union's returns for the managed endowment, excluding the Chrysler asset and cash, were negative 14 percent in fiscal year 2009, 10 percent in 2010 and 17 percent in 2011. Cooper Union's portfolio lost 5 percent in fiscal year 2012. That portion of the endowment fell to about $85.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2012, from about $169 million in 2008, and the total endowment dropped to $666.7 million from $710 million in 2008.
By comparison, a simple mix of 60 percent stocks, as measured by the S.& P. 500, and 40 percent bonds, using the Dow Jones corporate bond index, performed far better: down 11.7 percent in 2009, and up 14.5 percent in 2010, 20.8 percent in 2011 and 7.9 percent in 2012. Yet investors keep pouring money into hedge funds -- a record $15.2 billion in this year's first quarter. Hedge funds now have $2.375 trillion under management, according to Hedgeweek, a trade publication; the value of the assets increased by $122 billion in the first quarter.
Cooper Union's costs, especially health care costs, kept mounting inexorably. In 2008, the college was $4.6 million short in cash. Last fiscal year, the cash-flow deficit was $13.2 million.
Aside from endowment income, universities have only limited options for increasing revenue: donations, tuition and, for research universities, government grants. Alumni contributions have long been a weak spot at Cooper Union. Thomas R. Driscoll, a trustee and member of the alumni council, said: ''There was never any sense of giving back. Cooper never asked. We always thought Cooper didn't need the money because it had the Chrysler Building. Forty years ago, I would have stressed to students that someone had to make it possible for you to come here for free.''
With few donations, that left Cooper Union only one option: charging tuition. On April 23, the college announced that it would cut the full-tuition scholarship in half beginning with the entering class in 2014, and would continue to offer full-tuition scholarships to students with demonstrated need. ''Our priorities have been and will continue to be quality and access, so that we will remain a true meritocracy of outstanding students from all socio-economic backgrounds,'' the college's trustees said in a statement.
Mr. Michaelson conceded that the school could have continued to use the endowment to cover deficits and would have survived until 2018, when the higher payments from the Chrysler lease start. ''But what kind of school would you have had by then?''

HEADLINE: Europe's Careless Dithering

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner on economic policy, finance and business.

 BODY:
On its face, Friday's announcement that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter was good news, following as it did an only marginally positive result for the previous three-month period.
But, alas, that rosy headline figure masked disturbing signs: an economy whose recovery has failed to match the pace of past expansions may now be facing a deceleration in its own modest growth rate.Start with the G.D.P. figures, which can be misleading because of temporary fluctuations in the inventories maintained by businesses. Adjusted for those changes, the economy's annualized growth rate shows a steady deceleration over the past three quarters, from 2.4 percent to 1.9 percent to 1.5 percent. 
That's on top of a highly disappointing employment report for March, when only 88,000 new jobs were created, compared with an average of 197,000 for the previous six months.
And other economic measures -- ranging from retail sales to the index of leading economic indicators -- have begun to display softness and even declines. All told, at a minimum, we have entered yet another spring slowdown.
Perhaps it will prove transitory, as the pauses of the past three years have been. But worrisome signs suggest that this time may, indeed, be different.
For one thing, hourly wages, after adjustment for inflation, haven't budged in more than three years. That's unusual during an ostensible period of recovery, particularly from such a vicious recession.
Without higher incomes, consumers can't expand their purchases (at least not without dipping into their savings).
Meanwhile, Washington's budget wars have thus far produced a fistful of undesirable policy changes. Instead of thoughtful reforms -- particularly to programs like Medicare and Social Security -- to begin to bring the nation's long-term debt under control, Congress has adopted a series of meat-ax measures.
While that has shrunk the federal deficit significantly -- this year, the deficit is likely to come in at around $775 billion, compared with $1.1 trillion in the previous year -- the sudden contraction is likely to slow the economy further, cutting the growth in America's economic output this year by about 1.5 percentage points. Using basic yardsticks, that measures out to 1.5 million fewer jobs.
Finally, the weak world economy has knocked one American strategy for ratcheting up growth -- faster increases in exports -- badly off the rails. Just three years ago, United States exports were expanding at a 27 percent annual rate; today they are barely growing, and sales to Europe's hard-hit economies are declining.
To be sure, unlike Europe, where countries have faced double-dip recessions (and, in some cases, the prospect of a triple-dip), the United States is highly unlikely to experience a similar fate.
Our economy still exhibits some signs of strength, like the gathering recovery in housing construction and home prices. That has been aided by a strong stock market, which has rebuilt the value of retirement accounts and other investments.
But without rising incomes (and with mortgage financing still constrained), Americans' ability to buy new homes will remain limited.
Meanwhile, the stock market recovery has been built on the shaky pilings of higher corporate profitability that has resulted far more from cutting costs than from growing revenues. That's not sustainable.
The challenges listed above, of course, would be substantial by themselves.
But the most worrisome aspect of our current economic doldrums is that we can't expect any of the factors weighing on it to be self-correcting. For example, the lack of wage growth owes much to the continuing effects of globalization, a trend that has benefited the United States as a whole while hurting many workers.
Nor are the prospects bright for renewed expansion in Europe, or for a resumption of the meteoric growth rates we once saw in emerging market nations, particularly in China.
Were Washington functional, policy makers could significantly ameliorate these effects. First and foremost, Congress could adopt budget policies that would accomplish more thoughtful, more gradual -- and yet, ultimately, more substantial -- deficit reduction.
Instead of deep, across-the-board cuts in many important investment programs, ranging from infrastructure to research and development, we need to protect those initiatives while adjusting our social welfare programs to live within our means and protect the truly needy.
To address the effects of globalization, so much more can be done in education and training to prepare workers for the skilled jobs that play better to America's strengths.
Congress would be doing the American people a service if it came together to tackle these more consequential questions, and not just the problem of air-traffic delays.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europe's Careless Dithering

BYLINE: By STEVEN RATTNER. 
Steven Rattner is a Wall Street executive and contributing opinion writer.

 BODY:
EUROPE'S economic problems are growing steadily worse, with unemployment in parts of the Continent now above the level reached in the United States during the Great Depression.
Meanwhile, policy makers dither over solutions. Last week, the European Central Bank cut interest rates by a meager quarter of a percentage point, akin to giving two aspirin to a patient with pneumonia. Meanwhile, pressure is growing to ease the emphasis on austerity and to allow larger budget deficits.
If it were only that simple. 
Properly coupled with other new policies, fiscal stimulus can help, but on its own it is just an inadequate palliative.
The problems of the euro zone are not some routine cyclical downturn that can be rectified by traditional macroeconomic policy; they are deep structural flaws in both the design of the common currency and the economic policies of many of its members.
Most fundamentally, the design of the euro was ill conceived. A disparate group of 17 countries, ranging from the German powerhouse to weaklings like Greece, should never have been joined in a single currency without integrating their other economic policies.
As a consequence, while Germany grew ever more efficient, many other members allowed the cheap borrowing rates that accompanied the euro to lull them into complacency. Budget deficits expanded, wages rose rapidly and speculation in real estate ran rampant. Meanwhile, excessive regulation of business and labor made needed restructuring nearly impossible.
Take autos. The European automobiles industry resembles that of the United States, circa 2009: too many factories employing too many workers, able to make more cars than the market can absorb. And, doing it too inefficiently. A Fiat autoworker in Poland produces three times as many cars as a Fiat employee in Italy and is paid one-third as much. And yet, achieving an American-style restructuring in Europe is impossible. Closing a single plant, even in Germany, is an expensive and often unsuccessful effort.
When Peugeot ran into liquidity problems last fall, the French government provided up to seven billion euros in loan guarantees, but only if Peugeot spared some of the 8,000 jobs on its cutting board. Saving unproductive jobs is not a recipe for economic prosperity.
In contrast, there's Spain, where a more flexible labor market has led to higher productivity and competitiveness and in turn, to expanded production by a raft of automakers, including Nissan, Ford, Renault and Volkswagen.
Spain remains plagued by high unemployment and recession. But better competitiveness has led to rising exports and a workable base for future expansion.
Ireland has done even better in improving its competitiveness, and as a result its exports have boomed, growth has resumed and its double-digit unemployment rate has begun to tick down.
But two of the largest euro zone economies -- Italy and France -- seem paralyzed. For example, Italy, under the previous prime minister, Mario Monti, made modest reforms like higher retirement ages and more freedom for employers to shed workers. While the reforms did not go far enough, even Mr. Monti's small steps were soon watered down. He lost the most recent election, and his successor has been conspicuously silent about the needed structural changes.
Competitiveness is not the only problem. Banks, because of their own weak balance sheets and a fear of more losses, have been wary of lending to small and medium-size businesses, and when they do it's at a high interest rate. In Italy, where 80 percent of workers are employed by small or medium-size firms, borrowing costs are around 6 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in Germany. Nothing significant has been done to address this problem.
To be fair, the euro zone has been taking small steps toward the greater integration that is required. A banking union and single regulatory framework are under development. And discussions are under way over a deal in which the austerity regime would be relaxed for certain countries, including France, in return for structural reforms.
But incrementalism is an insufficient response. Europe should pursue full economic integration, much like the United States did in 1789, after the failed Articles of Confederation experiment. That would involve harmonized regulatory policies and a shared central government budget that would provide extra funds to troubled countries, just as America does for weaker states.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HIGHLIGHT: Survivor pulled from factory collapse; desegregating the Roma; Athens museum confronts crisis; and sailing death clouds America&#8217;s Cup. 

 BODY:
 NEWS Day after day, the grim drudgery of digging for bodies had progressed at Rana Plaza. Talk of rescuing survivors had faded. This was the recovery phase, and what was being recovered were corpses, the numbers spinning remorselessly forward: 700 dead became 800, then 900, with no end in sight. By Friday morning, the number had pushed above 1,000. And then, late in the afternoon, a soldier from the Bangladeshi Army, standing atop the rubble of the wrecked building, noticed an iron rod that seemed to be moving. There was a noise, a voice. Rescuers hurriedly carved a hole through a concrete pillar. Television stations in Bangladesh cut to the scene: a woman, gasping, was alive in the wreckage, nearly 17 full days after Rana Plaza had collapsed. A new number was announced: One. A female garment worker named Reshma. A survivor. A miracle. "Save me!" rescuers heard her shout, before they pulled her into the afternoon light, her face powdered in dust as she was placed on a stretcher. Julfikar Ali Manik reports from Dhaka, Bangladesh and Jim Yardley reports from New Delhi. 
In a continent faced with an economic crisis, soaring unemployment and bursts of nationalist populism, an elementary school in eastern Slovakia is a microcosm of one of Europe's biggest challenges: how to keep old demons of ethnic scapegoating at bay and somehow bring the Roma people into the mainstream. Many Europeans associate Roma with crime, particularly well-organized gangs of young Roma pickpockets who prey on local residents and tourists alike in the Continent's wealthier cities. Now, an energetic band of civil rights activists is spearheading a desegregation drive in towns and villages across wide stretches of Europe that has stirred angry opposition from defenders of the status quo. Andrew Higgins reports from Sarisske Michalany, Slovakia.
Angelos Delivorrias has led the Benaki Museum in Athens for almost 40 years. Now, in the face of steep budget cuts, he is fighting to protect what he helped build. In the fat years, the museum, which is run by a board of directors that includes three descendants of the Benaki family, could rely on the Greek government to pay for most of its operating costs. But with the crisis, it has faced abrupt and steep cutbacks. Suzanne Daley reports from Athens.
ArcelorMittal on Friday reported a net loss of $345 million for the first three months of 2013, as the world's largest steel company continues to struggle while demand for steel remains at depressed levels. The loss contrasts with a $92 million profit in the similar period of 2012. Sales for the first quarter of 2013 were down 13 percent year on year, to $19.8 billion. There were some signs that the company, which relies on demand from heavy industries like automobile manufacturing and construction, may be reaching the bottom of a several-year slide. Stanley Reed reports from London.
 ARTS The auction sales this week of Impressionist and Modern art forcefully brought out the dangers that arise in the market when the sense of aesthetic hierarchy vanishes because relevant points of comparison become too scarce. In seeming paradox, Sotheby's sales on Tuesday and Wednesday - which represented a time capsule and briefly created the illusion that abundance was back - illustrated the erratic price patterns that develop when buyers lack perspective. Souren Melikian reports.
 SPORTS The death of a leading British sailor, the Olympic champion Andrew Simpson, shows how technology and modern danger have found their way into the America's Cup. Sailors, even weathered veterans, have been genuinely on edge even as they embrace the new thrill of the new-age boats for the Cup. On Thursday Artemis's AC72 capsized in San Francisco Bay while bearing away, or turning from the wind, during a training exercise. Christopher Clarey reports.

HEADLINE: Why Putin Can't Solve Syria

BYLINE: DAVID ROHDE


HIGHLIGHT: Russian analysts say Washington is kidding itself if it believes Mr. Putin can orchestrate a quick and easy Assad exit. But the crisis has increased Vladimir Putin&#8217;s standing at home and Russia&#8217;s abroad. 

 BODY:
MOSCOW - After marathon meetings with Secretary of State John Kerry here this week, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, hinted that Moscow might finally pressure President Bashir al-Assad of Syria to leave office.
"We are not interested in the fate of certain individuals," Mr. Lavrov said at a late night news conference on Tuesday. "We are interested in the fate of the Syrian people."
Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Kerry announced that they would host an international conference where Syrian government officials and rebels will be given a chance to name an interim government. The odds of the two sides agreeing are low but Mr. Kerry deserves credit for securing a small diplomatic step forward here.
The problem is that Mr. Lavrov and his boss, President Vladimir Putin, may be unable to deliver on Mr. Assad. 
For nearly two years, Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Putin have served as the Syrian leaders' chief diplomatic allies but Iran has provided far more military support. Russian analysts say Washington is kidding itself if it believes Mr. Putin can orchestrate a quick and easy Assad exit.
"All of this is wishful thinking," said Sergei Strokan, a columnist for the liberal Moscow daily Kommersant. "Moscow has quite limited influence on the Syrian regime."
Decades from now, President Barack Obama's decision to not arm Syria's rebels may be condemned or praised. But a visit to Moscow this week showed that it has come at an immediate price. Washington's failure to act created a vacuum that Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov used to boost Russia's global standing.
"For the last two years, Lavrov has dramatically elevated his profile on the world stage," Susan Glasser recently wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. "He has done so by almost single-handedly defying Western attempts to force some united action to stop Syria's deadly civil war."
Mr. Lavrov and Mr. Putin have also used Syria to bolster their standing at home. Mr. Kerry's widely publicized visit coincided with the one-year anniversary of disputed elections in Russia that led to Mr. Putin's third term in office. Before meeting with Mr. Kerry, Mr. Putin fired a key lieutenant who was the architect of the system that has allowed the Russian leader to control major industries, seize most media outlets and intimidate or co-opt rivals.
With the price of oil low, Putin's oil-dependent economy is flagging. Barring a surge in prices, massive social welfare payments are unsustainable. Corruption is endemic, consuming an estimated $300 billion a year, 16 percent of Russia's gross domestic product. Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, named Russia the worst nation on earth in its most recent Bribe Payer's index, which ranks firms on their likelihood to bribe.
A spate of recent laws on libel, protests, blasphemy and treason has made it more difficult to exercise basic rights, the Washington Post reported last month. Mr. Putin also recently ordered prosecutors nationwide to search for non-governmental organizations that have failed to abide by a new law requiring them to register as "foreign agents" if they receive foreign funding.
Mr. Putin is probably secure until the end of his term in 2016. But a slowing economy and public fatigue with Mr. Putin are taking a toll. In the end, the key factor may be the price of oil, the pillar of Putin's one-dimensional economy.
"If the price of oil drops below $50 [a barrel], it is a death sentence," said a Russian analyst who asked not to be named.
On the international stage, meanwhile, Russia is ascendant. For Mr. Putin, Mr. Kerry's request for help marked the achievement of a decade-old goal. From the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 1999 bombing of Kosovo, to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, to the 2011 U.N.-backed toppling of Muammar Gaddafi, Moscow has been largely irrelevant. Mr. Putin saw each post-Cold War American intervention as an attempt to remove opponents, not defend human rights.
"In Putin's view, they were all victims of a cynical U.S. plot for global domination," journalist Lucian Kim wrote last year, "where any weapon is fair game, be it smart bomb, a pro-democracy grant or Twitter."
Instead of being the West's potential victim, Mr. Putin is now its vital interlocutor. Maria Lipman, a scholar-in-residence at the Carnegie Moscow Center and a leading political analyst, said Mr. Putin's logic is simple: "You may denounce us," she explained, "but when it comes to the most important international issue today, you come to Moscow."
So, why is the Obama administration turning to Mr. Putin for help? The answer is simple: the White House's deep desire to not get entangled in Syria. To American officials, a deal with Russia is a cost-free solution. The geopolitical equivalent, if you will, of a drone strike. No Americans lives will be lost. There will be little domestic political risk.
In truth, though, there is no easy way to stem the conflict in Syria, which increasingly threatens to destabilize the region. Blame is widespread. Mr. Assad, of course, is the worst culprit. His refusal to relinquish power in the face of an initially peaceful protest movement has led to the killing of an estimated 70,000 people. In Washington, Mr. Obama allowed exaggerated fears of another Iraq to paralyze his administration.
 Mr. Putin, though, has arguably been the most cynical. He exaggerated his control of Mr. Assad and may also be double-dealing.
Twenty-four hours after Mr. Kerry left Moscow, the press reported that Russia was planning to sell surface-to-air missiles to Syria that would make any American intervention in the conflict vastly more difficult. The Wall Street Journal reported that Israeli officials had warned the Obama administration of Russia's imminent sale to Syria of sophisticated S-300 missiles with a range of 125 miles.
Asked about the sale at a press conference in Rome on Thursday, Mr. Kerry said Washington would prefer that Russia not provide arms to Syria and called the missiles "potentially destabilizing" to Israel. If true, the missile sale would be a personal affront to Mr. Kerry, who lauded Mr. Putin and Mr. Lavrov in Moscow.
Sale or no sale, the proposed conference should be carried out. Both sides may miraculously agree on an interim government.
But it is more likely that the United States has lost control of the rebels, particularly the jihadists. And Russia has lost control of Mr. Assad, who retains Tehran's backing and has killed so many people that he cannot compromise.
Syria's downward spiral will continue.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, a look at the weekly party addresses and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
The dispute over the White House's account of the September assault on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, flared upon Friday, with a disclosure of e-mails showing the White House was more deeply involved in revising talking points about the attack than officials previously acknowledged, Mark Landler reports. Disclosure of the e-mails had the White House scrambling to provide an explanation and insisting that the talking points were not modified for political reasons.

        
President Obama came out swinging in defense of his health care plan on Friday, saying he was committed to delivering its benefits on schedule, Robert Pear and Peter Baker report. The president made a moral case for universal health insurance coverage. "The United States of America does not sentence its people to suffering just because they don't make enough to buy insurance on the private market, just because their work doesn't provide health insurance, just because they fall sick or suffer an accident," he said.
 

        
A federal judge gave an unusually harsh critique of the Obama administration this week, saying that its efforts to block easier distribution of the morning-after emergency contraceptive pill was driven by raw politics - not scientific evidence, Michael D. Shear reports.

        
The Internal Revenue Service apologized to Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations on Friday for overzealous audits of their applications for tax-exempt status, Jonathan Weisman reports. The agency admitted to singling out nonprofit applicants with the terms "Tea Party" or "patriots" in their titles.

        
A bipartisan group in the House of Representatives has been meeting on and off for four years to create an immigration bill, but with comprehensive legislation already being debated by the Senate, the House group is quickly losing its chance to shape the outcome, Ashley Parker writes.
 Weekly Addresses 

        
President Obama called homeownership a cornerstone of the American Dream in this week's address, promoting his housing plan that "has already helped more than two million people refinance their mortgages." He also reflected on last week's nomination of Mel Watt to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, saying that Mr. Watt's experience in protecting consumers from dishonest mortgage lenders should make Congress confirm him right away. "And they shouldn't stop there," he said. "Our economy and our housing market are poised for progress - but we could do so much more if we worked together."

        
Representative Martha Roby of Alabama delivered this week's Republican address after her Working Families Flexibility Act passed in the House. The bill, she said, "will remove an outdated and unnecessary restriction on private sector employees accruing comp time, or paid time off, in exchange for overtime." It is aimed at providing working parents with more "options" to take care of family responsibilities without changing the 40-hour workweek or how overtime pay is calculated. Ms. Roby said that "the fact that we can't solve the big, overarching problems overnight shouldn't stop us from doing what we can right now to help make life a little easier for working moms and dads."

HEADLINE: Declining Sales Bring Loss Of $345 Million at Steel Giant

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- ArcelorMittal may close steel plants in Eastern Europe if the European economy continues to slump, the company's chairman and chief executive suggested Friday as the company posted a net loss of $345 million for the first three months of 2013.
The chairman, Lakshmi N. Mittal, said during an interview that he expected world demand for steel to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent for the next two to three years. But he added that he was ''still worried about the global economy, especially the European economy.'' 
Demand for steel in the United States is close to returning to levels before the financial crisis, while in Europe it remains down about 30 percent, he said.
The company is ''watching the economic environment and market conditions'' in Eastern Europe, Mr. Mittal said. If demand remains ''muted,'' he said, ''we will look at resetting that footprint.''
ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel company, has drawn fire for closing plants in France and Belgium. Four of the company's blast furnaces in Poland and Romania are temporarily idled, Mr. Mittal said.
The first-quarter loss contrasts with a $92 million profit in the similar period of 2012. Sales for the first quarter of 2013 were down 13 percent year to year, to $19.8 billion.
There were some signs that the company, which relies on demand from heavy industries like automobile manufacturing and construction, may be reaching the bottom of a several-year slide. While steel shipments in the first quarter were down about 6 percent year to year at 20.9 million metric tons, they rose almost 5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2012.
Similarly, while sales were down year to year in the first quarter, they were up a modest 2 percent from the last quarter of 2012.
Mr. Mittal said Friday that while the results were ''still not satisfactory, at least I am starting to see the benefits of the actions we have taken'' to reduce capacity.
Given the slump in demand in Europe, ''we felt that this is not a cyclical but a structural change,'' he said. ''We needed to take action.''
The closing of operations in Europe, especially at Liège, Belgium, and Florange, France, has led to tension with governments and unions.
The French government last year threatened to nationalize the Florange site, but Mr. Mittal largely held firm on his plans to permanently close blast furnaces there. The company did say Friday that it had begun a new production line at Florange for modern, lightweight automotive steel with the trademark Usibor.
ArcelorMittal executives say the operating environment in the Americas is much healthier than in Europe. Louis Schorsch, who heads a large part of the American business, said that steel consumption in the United States was approaching levels last seen before the financial crisis. Demand from the auto industry, probably the company's most important customer in the United States, is ''a good story'' and housing is ''a little better,'' he said, while demand for drill pipe and other energy-related products is ''a little bit off.''
Thomas O'Hara, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a research note that the company's reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $1.6 billion was ''a clear beat'' of analysts' expectations by about $200 million. Ebitda is the standard earnings measure in the steel industry.
ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, still looks as if it has a long way to go before it returns to the high profitability it enjoyed before the onset of the global financial crisis. The company reported net income of $10.4 billion in 2007.
''There is a glut of steel supply globally,'' said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie in London. ''That is going to prevent a company like ArcelorMittal from making the type of profits it did in its heyday.''
In Europe, where ArcelorMittal employs more than 90,000 people, the company still lost money in the crucial unit that produces flat steel for automakers and other customers. The unit posted a $59 million operating loss in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $283 million a year earlier and of $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, when the company wrote down the value of some of its European businesses. A $210 million gain from selling carbon emissions credits helped limit the bleeding.
Steel production at the unit was up slightly from the previous year, but the average price per ton fell by 3 percent to $831. ArcelorMittal said it had lost $9 per ton on average on the European flat steel unit.
Even in mining, where Mr. Mittal is focusing most of his investment these days, the results were not stellar. Operating income of $286 million was down 19 percent compared with the previous year, although it was up 54 percent compared with the last quarter of 2012.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Directors Disappoint By What They Don't Do

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
DIRECTORS of some high-profile public companies are coming under scrutiny this proxy season. Shareholder advocates say it's about time.
The coming meeting of JPMorgan Chase shareholders, to be held in Tampa, Fla., on May 21, is a case in point. Directors on that board are under fire for not monitoring the bank's risk management, a failure highlighted by last year's $6 billion trading loss in the company's chief investment office. Shareholder advisory firms have recommended voting against some of the directors on the risk policy committee and audit committee, so it will be interesting to see what kind of support those board members receive at the election.
The risk-management fiasco at JPMorgan was an obvious failing, but directors of public companies often let down their outside shareholders in ways that are more subtle, but equally important, say some experts on public company board practices. Directors commonly neglect chief executive succession planning and inadequately analyze company performance as it relates to managers' pay. 
Paul Hodgson, principal at BHJ Partners, a corporate governance consulting firm, said he believed chief executive succession planning was one of the signal tasks of a director and one at which most of them continued to fall short.
''J. C. Penney is the most recent example, but there are countless others,'' said Mr. Hodgson, referring to the recent ouster of Ron Johnson, who came to Penney with great fanfare from Apple.
''Hiring an outside C.E.O. costs between three and five times the amount it does to promote an existing manager, so boards are failing in their fiduciary duty and wasting shareholders' money by not having a properly functioning succession plan in place,'' Mr. Hodgson said.
Another board duty that is basic but often badly executed involves how a company's performance is measured for pay purposes. Mark Van Clieaf, managing director at MVC Associates International, an organization consulting firm, said he believed boards were stuck in a groove that was dangerous for shareholders. The measures most directors use to assess corporate performance, he contends, are too focused on earnings growth and often do not weigh a company's return on assets, equity or invested capital.
Return on invested capital is a preferred method to measure the creation or destruction of shareholder value, Mr. Van Clieaf said, because it reveals how effective a company is using its money to generate returns. If boards ignore this measure when setting pay, executives could be rewarded even when their companies' financing costs exceed the returns on their investments. No company can survive in that circumstance for long.
Equally troubling is the board practice of rewarding executives for short-term performance when the risks in their businesses take much longer to play out. The rewards handed over to senior bank executives in the years leading up to the financial crisis, for example, show how unbalanced many companies' incentive plans are.
Consider the mortgage business. It typically takes as long as five years for problems, like payment defaults, to show up in home loans. Yet most financial companies paid those top executives for performance periods significantly shorter than that.
Back in 2009, responding to the credit debacle, the Financial Stability Board, a group of international regulators and standard setters, published a policy paper recommending principles for sound compensation practices among financial companies. The board said a ''substantial portion of variable compensation, such as 40 to 60 percent,'' should be deferred over a period of no less than three years. And in 2008, the Institute of International Finance, a global financial industry group, suggested that a sizable portion of executives' bonuses be deferred over five years.
Both were good ideas, Mr. Van Clieaf said, that have gone largely unheeded. In 2010 he looked at compensation packages at the 18 largest United States banks. ''For the 90 named officers of those banks,'' he said, ''the average performance period was 2.2 years.''
Mr. Van Clieaf has not analyzed these institutions since 2010, but said that other analyses indicated performance periods at most big banks might have stretched to three years, on average. Even that needs to be lengthened, he said.
This short-term orientation on executive pay extends well beyond the financial industry. Last year, Mr. Van Clieaf examined performance periods and metrics among roughly 250 large corporations. He found that less than 4 percent of these companies had both a balance-sheet oriented metric, like return on capital, equity or assets, and a performance period longer than four years.
Another analysis he did, of the 1,500 largest United States companies in 2012, showed that only 18 percent used a balance sheet metric and even fewer -- 8 percent -- employed performance periods of more than four years.
I ASKED which companies appeared to be taking the right approach. Mr. Van Clieaf pointed to the Eaton Corporation, a maker of engineered products, which bases its incentive pay in part on the cash flow return the company generates on its capital.
Eaton also uses a four-year performance period when setting pay for executives.
Abbott Laboratories, a provider of health care products and services, is another good example, Mr. Van Clieaf said. It uses five-year performance benchmarks and includes return on equity and return on net assets in those calculations.
These companies are in the minority, however. Mr. Van Clieaf blames not only corporate directors but also their advisers and the shareholders who rubber-stamp the misaligned pay practices.
Directors make good money. According to the most recent figures compiled by Equilar, an executive compensation data firm, median pay for outside directors at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was almost $239,000 in 2012. That's up 11 percent from the median pay awarded in 2010. But that pay comes with a duty: ensuring shareholder interests come first.
''This is a failure to create metrics, performance periods and incentives that are truly strategic for long-term shareholders,'' Mr. Van Clieaf said.
''Boards, pay advisers and investors,'' he said, ''all need a whack on the side of the head.''

HEADLINE: A Director Who Doesn't Fake It

BYLINE: By JOHN ANDERSON

 BODY:
The Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur made his international reputation with such offbeat films as ''101 Rekjavik,'' a comedy about a sexually confused slacker, and ''The Sea,'' about dark family secrets in a remote fishing village. Yet he is making an impressive transition to American filmmaking with action fare like ''Contraband,'' a hit last year, and the comic-book-based ''2 Guns,''coming this summer.
That doesn't mean he's gotten with the whole Hollywood program. ''For two weeks he didn't know he had a trailer'' on the set, said Mark Wahlberg, who stars with Denzel Washington in ''2 Guns,'' in which crooked cops take on the Mob. ''He was just on the set, getting things done.''
The director, chagrined, admitted that it was true about the trailer. ''I used it twice,'' he said recently by phone from Budapest. 
He was there to shoot an HBO pilot, but he was also planning a remake of ''Jar City,'' his 2006 hit, which helped whet the American appetite for Scandinavian noir.
''Humbly,'' he said during an earlier interview in New York, ''that was the beginning of the 'crime wave,' the first Scandinavian crime movie that came out in America.''
''It didn't crack through in the way Stieg Larsson's stuff did,'' he said, citing the author of ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo'' and its sequels. ''But it started that wave.''
What followed the wave, of course, was Iceland's crash, which set back all aspects of the Icelandic economy, including a tight-knit film industry in which only a handful of films are made each year. But it has hardly slowed Mr. Kormakur, who resists the concept -- one as old as studio movies -- that a foreign director has to surrender to achieve success in Hollywood. Especially if, at the same time, he's building an empire back home.
''You don't have to necessarily start doing cocaine and sitting around a pool waiting for someone to call you,'' Mr. Kormakur said. ''If I never make another movie after '2 Guns' in America, I wouldn't see it as a failure. I would see it as an adventure I went for, and I'd keep doing what I do.''
What Mr. Kormakur does at home will hit American screens this week: ''The Deep,'' shortlisted for the foreign-language Oscar this year, tells the real-life tale of the fishing trawler Breki, which in 1984 went down with all hands save one: a sailor (played by Olafur Darri Olafsson, a regular in Kormakur films) who survived six hours in 40-degree water before reaching the volcanic shores of the Westman Islands, off the southern coast of Iceland. Baffled researchers concluded that the man's unusually thick body fat made him, in effect, part seal.
It was an important moment in recent Icelandic history, one Mr. Kormakur said he had to get right, because of the national trauma and the sea's importance to the economic and spiritual life of Iceland.
''It's an almost mythical story,'' he said. ''Everyone in Iceland knows it. But what I didn't want to do is create emotional porno. It's so easy to fall into that. What I'm trying to say in the film is, this is inevitable. This is the country we choose to live in. It's not even so much about the real guys in the accident; it's about all the sailors in Iceland. It took a long time because I wanted to get it right.''
Getting it right meant getting in the water. For ''The Deep's'' shipwreck scene, ''two of the actors opted out when we were turning the boat over,'' he said. ''I wasn't going to push them. I just said, 'O.K., I'll do it myself, give me a costume.' ''
David Linde, a veteran of the American independent scene, met Mr. Kormakur during a salmon-fishing trip to Iceland and became a producer of ''The Deep.'' He said the director's intent, as with all of his work, was to make a movie that was commercially viable worldwide.
''It's a very, very important story in Iceland,'' Mr. Linde said, ''and a lot of people think it's confined by that. But Balt never saw it that way.''
At the same time, the director was well aware of how attuned his home audience was to nuance. ''People in Iceland would know if you were faking it,'' Mr. Kormakur said. ''I wouldn't get away with 'The Perfect Storm,' and that was done with the best technique available at the time.''
No, he said, they had to shoot in the real Atlantic, with real bodies in the water. Mr. Olafsson recalled that, it was difficult for him to stay within the camera's frame while he was swimming in the constantly moving ocean. A brake was needed. ''We quickly realized there was no way around it,'' the actor said from Los Angeles.
Re-enter Mr. Kormakur. ''I asked for a rope,'' he said, ''and tied it around myself and jumped in and tied myself to Darri. I kept the rope under the water, kept myself out of the frame, and started backstroking. So while he's swimming forward, he's still stationary, because I'm swimming in the other direction. It was like a perpetual pool.''
Reflecting a widely held sentiment, Mr. Olafsson said Mr. Kormakur was ''a very sweet guy to work with, but he doesn't meddle'' though ''he's still a perfectionist.''
''He'll hire you,'' he went on, ''and immediately you know what is expected of you, and what to expect. He doesn't say much but when he does, I think 'O.K.' because he's always right.''
While most Americans will see only Mr. Kormakur's directing work, his entertainment empire seems as vast as a lava field. There's a TV production company, RVK; Blueeyes, a film-production company founded by Mr. Kormakur, 47, and his wife, Lilja Palmadottir; and TrueNorth, which has provided services and manpower for foreign projects shooting in Iceland, including ''Oblivion'' and ''Thor 2.'' He's also producing his countryman Dagur Kari's film ''The Rocketman.''
''It's tricky,'' he said about the earning power of Icelandic films. ''When they break through, they're really strong, and then there are some that make nothing. But if you touch people's hearts, they really come out.
''With 'Jar City,' it was incredible. Dozens of old people came out; they'd be on an escalator in a mall, lost, because they'd never been in a mall before, and they're just trying to find the cinema. All these old people wandering around. It was great.''

HEADLINE: Reasons for Crossing Delancey

BYLINE: By JOHN FREEMAN GILL

 BODY:
The Lower East Side, whose tenements teemed with immigrants for generations beginning in the 19th century, has in recent years become known north of Delancey Street for crowds of a different sort: the whooping revelers who stream down its streets and cascade from its scores of bars, restaurants and falafel shops on weekends. Indeed, the density of raucous nightspots has earned the nickname Hell Square for the area between East Houston and Delancey from Allen Street east to the Delancey, a club near Clinton Street.
Below Delancey, however, a quieter, more residential atmosphere prevails.
''When you cross south over Delancey you feel your blood pressure go down,'' said Para Rajparia, a psychologist, who moved into a three-bedroom Grand Street co-op in 2010 with her young family, joining the many other young professionals who have recently put down roots in the area. ''I have a sense of safety and comfort.'' 
Although new night-life attractions have begun pushing south down Ludlow Street from Delancey, they do not for the most part extend below Grand, leaving intact, at least for now, a certain low-key authenticity that many residents say they prize.
''The old world is still there,'' said Glenn E. Schiller, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, even as art galleries and artisanal food shops pop up among old-school Jewish fabric and menswear stores.
On Broome Street, sharing the block with a Chinese laundry, is a strip of specialty newcomers: the Ten Bells, an organic wine bar; Babycakes NYC, a vegan bakery; Tache, an artisanal chocolate shop; and the Earnest Sewn, a bespoke jeans store. Around the corner on Orchard, across from the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, is Top Hops, a ''tasting bar and culture center for craft and import beers.''
The combination of old and new was one of the main draws for Julie Peacock, a yoga instructor, who since 2006 has lived in the Seward Park Cooperative, one of four Grand Street co-ops built with labor backing from the 1930s to 1960. Although uncharmed by the boxy modern architecture of Seward Park's four brick high-rises, Ms. Peacock found its multigenerational mix appealing on her very first visit.
''There were young moms walking with babies, and young families,'' she said, ''but older people walking on the street, too, so it felt like a real neighborhood. And I was amazed at how quiet it was after living in the East Village.''
The deal was clinched when she found the old and new bakeries on Grand Street: Kossar's Bialys, which has had a following for over 65 years, and Doughnut Plant, a 2000 transplant from a Lower East Side tenement. So in 2006 Ms. Peacock, seven months pregnant, moved into a $2,650-a-month two-bedroom with her husband, Rusty, an emergency room physician.
Three years later, expecting their third child, they were struck by how much more space their money could buy in Seward Park than in brownstone Brooklyn. In 2009 they paid $810,000 for a 20th-story three-bedroom co-op with views of both New Jersey and Brooklyn. For another $85,000, they knocked out walls to open up the unit.
''The cool thing about these buildings,'' Ms. Peacock said, ''is that on the inside they're really these blank white boxes with great light and good bones.''
What You'll Find
The neighborhood possesses an ethnic and socioeconomic mix that many residents say feels increasingly rare in Manhattan. A 2007-2011 census survey found some 60,332 people living in the 350-acre area bounded roughly by Delancey Street, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, the Bowery and Catherine Street. Fifty-three percent were Asian, the vast majority Chinese; 22 percent were white; 19 percent Hispanic, mostly Puerto Rican; and 4 percent were African-American. The median annual income was $30,550.
''It's ideal right now because you have the perfect balance,'' said Philippe Avila, a Paris-born art conservator who has lived since 2000 in a rent-stabilized studio in a Henry Street tenement, for which he pays $1,039 a month. ''You still have a certain flavor coming from each community and enriching each other.''
Whether that balance will survive is unclear. Earlier this year the Economic Development Corporation issued a request for proposals to develop the largest parcel of underdeveloped city-owned land south of 96th Street: more than six acres near the intersection of Delancey and Essex, most of it on parking lots between Grand and Delancey. The project calls for 1,000 units, half ''affordable'' and set aside for a range of income levels. Up to 40 percent of the 1.65 million square feet will be commercial space.
Proposals are due from developers this month. ''If they could preserve that little pushcart feeling of the neighborhood that we all like and moved here for, that would be amazing,'' said Catherine McCarthy, a Stribling & Associates agent who lives in a co-op near the East River. ''But we're fearful of big-box stores and increased traffic.''
Change is also afoot in the Two Bridges section, near the river. In March an entity created by Extell Development bought a lot on South Street previously occupied by a Pathmark, city records show. The site, along the water in an area packed with subsidized and public housing, is zoned to permit one or two towers with over 1.1 million square feet. There is no height limit. An Extell spokesman declined to provide details.
As Extell is behind luxury towers like One57 on West 57th Street, its arrival is jarring to many.
''People are really worried about it,'' said Victor J. Papa, the president of the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, a nonprofit group that has sponsored subsidized housing in the area. ''What happens when a building like that comes into a low-income neighborhood like ours is that it works against the low-income tenants in the community because it attracts businesses that will appeal to the new luxury tenants.''
The Two Bridges council owns a lot adjacent to the Pathmark site, where Mr. Papa said he would like to build 75 more units of subsidized housing. But he was deeply skeptical that the traditional character of the Lower East Side, which he called ''a national treasure,'' could survive for long.
What You'll Pay
More than 8 in 10 residents rent, some in condos but far more in tenements. Streeteasy.com listed eight two-bedroom rentals, ranging from $1,850 to $4,500 a month, and six units for sale.
Two-bedrooms in the four Grand Street co-ops typically sell for $475,000 to $750,000, said Jacob Goldman, the broker-owner of LoHo Realty. The area has a few condos, notably the Forward Building, a conversion of the former home of the Jewish newspaper. Condos range from $1,000 to $1,200 a square foot, said Mr. Schiller of Corcoran; rare co-op loft conversions like 118 Forsyth Street command similar prices.
What to Do
Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. through Oct. 26, vendors at the Hester Street Fair hawk food, vintage clothing and jewelry, in a hip homage to the pushcart market that once thrived there.
Under the rumbling Manhattan Bridge, skateboarders grind from dawn to dusk in the Coleman Oval skate park, opened last year.
An ''eco-park'' is to open next spring north of the Manhattan Bridge, as part of the development corporation's $165 million East River Waterfront Esplanade.
The Schools
Hester Street is home to Public School 42 and Middle School 131. Both earned A's on their most recent city progress reports. The High School for Dual Language and Asian Studies, on Grand Street, had SAT averages last year of 412 in reading, 581 in math and 431 in writing, versus 434, 461 and 430 citywide.
The Commute
The F train stops on East Broadway and on Delancey, reaching Midtown in 20 minutes. The J, M and Z also stop on Delancey. The B and D stop at Grand and Chrystie.
The History
In 1903 the square block on Orchard Street that would become the site of the Tenement Museum had more than 2,000 residents, making it the most crowded block in one of the world's most crowded neighborhoods.

HEADLINE: Some Countries Lobby for More in Race for Visas

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government of South Korea hired a former C.I.A. analyst, two White House veterans and a team of ex-Congressional staff members to help secure a few paragraphs in the giant immigration bill.
The government of Ireland, during St. Patrick's Day festivities, appealed directly to President Obama and Congressional leaders for special treatment. And the government of Poland squeezed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill for its own favor, a pitch repeated at an embassy party last week featuring pirogi and three types of Polish ham.
Those countries, and others, succeeded in winning provisions in the fine print of the 867-page immigration bill now before Congress that give their citizens benefits not extended to most other foreigners.
Ireland and South Korea extracted measures that set aside for their citizens a fixed number of the highly sought special visas for guest workers seeking to come to the United States. Poland got language that would allow it to join the list of nations whose citizens can travel to the United States as tourists without visas. And Canadians successfully pushed for a change that would permit its citizens who are 55 and older and not working to stay in the United States without visas for as much as 240 days each year, up from the current 182. 
South Korea alone has four lobbying firms in the campaign, paying them collectively at a rate that would total $1.7 million this year, according to required disclosure reports. Other nations generally relied on their own ambassadors and embassy staff to make the push, meaning there is no way to track how much has been spent on the effort.
The deals are already drawing some criticism, particularly from those who worry that some of the provisions -- in addition to already increased annual visa allotments available generally -- could create an influx of foreigners large enough to undermine American workers.
''This could turn into a stealth immigration policy,'' said Ronil Hira, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology who studies the immigration system. ''Every country is going to try to negotiate its own carve-out.''
Indeed, lawmakers are already pushing to grant special benefits to other places, including Tibet, Hong Kong and parts of Africa.
Advocates of the measures say they serve American interests. Loosening the tourist visa requirements, for example, would result in hundreds of thousands of additional visitors spending billions of dollars each year, supporters say.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was responsible in part for inserting the measures affecting Poland, Canada and Ireland into the legislation, defends them. ''Each of these provisions makes individual sense on the merits,'' a spokesman for the senator said. ''They each solve inequities in the existing immigration law.''
The proposed foreign deals have drawn little scrutiny, but Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and his staff are starting to raise questions about some of them, saying Americans deserve to fully understand what is in the huge immigration package. ''I plan to ask many questions throughout this process,'' Mr. Grassley warned during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting on Thursday.
Some diplomats who worked for the carefully devised benefits had hoped to avoid such attention. ''If we could stay below the radar, we would much prefer it,'' one senior official at an embassy in Washington said on the condition of anonymity.
Most of the language in the immigration package, created by a bipartisan group of eight senators, applies equally to citizens of any foreign nation. It calls for tougher border security and a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. It also increases the number of visas for high-skilled workers to at least 110,000 annually from the current 65,000 and eases the way for those already here to seek a permanent resident visa, known as green card. With uncertain support in the Senate and tough opposition in the House, the fate of the bill is far from clear.
But with access to the United States a prize coveted across much of the world, the push for special favors has been intense, according to Congressional and Justice Department records.
An Irish-American group, working with the Irish Embassy, hired former Representative Bruce Morrison, Democrat of Connecticut, to help push its cause, arguing that changes in immigration law decades ago created an unfair barrier to citizens of Ireland in gaining access to the United States.
In 1990, he inserted a provision, since named the Morrison Visa, into immigration legislation that temporarily gave special preference to citizens of Ireland and a small number of other nations. The current proposal would allow work visas for 10,500 Irish citizens annually who are high school graduates, an unusual opportunity, since such visas are generally reserved for foreigners considered ''high skilled.''
Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland joined the effort, making the case with President Obama at St. Patrick's Day events in Washington.
Lobbyists working for South Korea -- including Brian D. Smith, a White House aide during the Clinton administration; Scott D. Parven, a former Senate aide; Kirsten A. Chadwick, a Bush White House aide; and Jonathan R. Wakely, a former C.I.A. political analyst -- made dozens of calls and visits to Capitol Hill in recent months to push for a special ''professional visa'' for its citizens, focusing on central players on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the Justice Department records show.
The lobbyists or the political action committees run by their firms have also made campaign donations to lawmakers who support their cause, in some cases just weeks before the helpful language was introduced, campaign finance records show. Foreign officials are prohibited by law from contributing to American political campaigns.
President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, on her first official visit to Washington last week, pressed Mr. Obama and lawmakers to preserve the language in the immigration legislation that would designate at least 5,000 special work visas for South Koreans, or pass an even more generous stand-alone bill introduced last month, which would create 15,000 such visas annually.
The South Korean government has said the provision is a necessary companion to the free trade agreement both nations ratified in 2011, so that highly skilled workers can move back and forth between the two countries freely. Australia received a similar deal in 2005 after it negotiated its own free trade pact.
''If the bill on visa quotas for Korean professionals is passed in this Congress, both our economies will benefit, for it would help create many more jobs,'' Ms. Park said in an address to Congress on Wednesday. She followed up by soliciting help from American corporations at a luncheon hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has been the leading proponent of South Korea's request on the Senate side, while Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, is leading the effort in the House. ''It allows the free trade agreement to flourish and meet its potential,'' said Mr. Roskam, who sat next to Ms. Park at a dinner hosted by the South Korean embassy last week.
The Poles made their pitch at Ambassador Ryszard Schnepf's residence on Tuesday, where hundreds of Polish diplomats, military personnel and prominent Polish-Americans joined at least half a dozen members of Congress and the guest of honor, Mr. Biden. (He joked that some in his home state, Delaware, called him ''Joe Bidenski.'')
Poland wants the United States to revamp the rules that allow foreign nations to become eligible for the so-called visa waiver program, letting tourists visit the United States without having a formal interview at embassies overseas.
Poland has been unable to qualify because too many of its citizens are rejected when they apply for visas -- an indicator that they might try to fraudulently use a tourist visa to immigrate to the United States.
The effort to revise the rules has support from the White House and groups that promote tourism in the United States. The provision could also benefit 10 or so other countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Israel.
But Jess T. Ford, who examined border security issues for the Government Accountability Office until 2011, said the change could create a loophole leaving the United States vulnerable to increased illegal immigration, at least until the United States sets up a long-delayed system to monitor visitors when they exit, not just when they arrive.
''Once somebody comes in here as a tourist, you can't keep track of them,'' Mr. Ford said in an interview.
So far, Obama administration officials and backers of the measure in Congress say they are confident that simplifying the tourist entry process will not create such a problem, as an exit-tracking system is promised as part of the package. It is a position that the lobbying team pushing for the change considers good news.
''I am confident, Mr. Vice President, that with your help, we will get this issue across the finish line,'' Ambassador Schnepf told Mr. Biden last week, drawing applause and cheers.

HEADLINE: Global Financial Leaders Avoid Public Rift With Japan

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
Finance ministers from leading global economies on Saturday avoided a public rift with Japan over policies driving down the value of its currency, while keeping up pressure on Germany to help lift growth in Europe. 
At the end of two days of talks among the Group of 7 finance ministers outside London, other nations appeared to accept -- at least for now -- Japan's explanation that its new monetary efforts were meant to stimulate its domestic economy, rather than to drive down the yen on international currency markets.
The chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, George Osborne, said on Saturday that ministers from the G-7, made up of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, Italy, France and Canada, had reaffirmed earlier commitments on exchange rates and agreed to make sure policies are ''oriented towards achieving domestic objectives.'' Other officials described the talks as in-depth and positive. Last week, the dollar breached the 100-yen mark for the first time in over four years.
The two-day meeting, in Buckinghamshire, also focused on efforts to stem tax avoidance and on banking reform, and Mr. Osborne said it was ''important to complete swiftly our work to ensure that no banks are too big to fail.'' The officials discussed efforts to create a European banking union, which have slowed in recent months.
''We agreed on the importance of ensuring banks' balance sheets are adequately capitalized to enable them to play their role in supporting the economy,'' Mr. Osborne said.
The talks took place against a background of growing austerity fatigue in Europe, and concern that the region's focus on reducing deficits and debt risked driving some economies into a downward spiral.
One United States Treasury official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there was a recognition that, because of the economic weakness in southern European nations like Greece, Portugal and Spain, it was ''more important than ever'' to have higher private demand in the euro zone countries that are performing better. Germany has the most room to lift demand, although the Treasury official did not identify it or other countries by name.
The official added that recent, positive suggestions that France and Spain should have more time to reduce their budget deficits would be helped by ''a greater contribution of private demand'' from better-performing European countries.
But a German official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, disputed any consensus on that point, noting that there was no official statement on the matter after the meeting. As planned, no communiqué was issued after the event. The idea of stimulating domestic demand is contentious in Germany, in part because of the risk of stoking inflation.
Nevertheless, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, seen as one of the main architects of the euro zone's austerity policies, has shown some signs of greater flexibility and said, before the meeting, that he supported the European Union's move to give France and Spain more time for deficit reduction.
Slow growth in much of the developed world, and particularly in Europe, provided an uncertain backdrop to the meeting, despite efforts by several central banks to stimulate economic activity.

HEADLINE: The Mellowing of Maxine Waters

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
OVER her 22 years in Congress, Maxine Waters has likened bank executives to ''gangsters,'' snarkily addressed them as ''captains of the universe'' and threatened to tax their companies ''out of business.''
The Democrat from Los Angeles, in other words, is not known for showing love to the financial industry.
So in March, when she visited a group of community bankers in a conservative corner of her district, she seemed ready for a chilly reception. ''Let's see what these guys have to say for themselves,'' Ms. Waters said with a smirk as she emerged from her S.U.V.
Escorted to a private conference room at Malaga Bank, Ms. Waters grabbed a seat at the head of the table. A dozen or so bankers shuffled in, each armed with a tale of woe about the Dodd-Frank banking overhaul passed by Congress in the aftermath of the financial crisis. 
The law is too tough, they groaned. Its capital requirements are too steep. One banker's voice quivered as she described a regulatory examination of her bank. Another griped about regulators overstepping their bounds: ''They can tell you how many pens and pencils we have in our drawers!''
In the past, such grumbling might have set off Ms. Waters's famous hair-trigger temper. But with each complaint, she leaned in for more, nodding appreciatively. ''We've heard they chase down silly stuff,'' Ms. Waters said, referring to regulators and shaking her head in disapproval. ''I'm willing to take a hit'' to help lower the capital requirements, she said. She even suggested the bankers hire new lobbyists to better represent them. ''Influence us,'' Ms. Waters said softly, reminding them of her new role as the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee. ''Help us understand the intricacies of your business.''
This was not ''kerosene Maxine,'' the nickname Ms. Waters has earned for her tendency to hurl flammable remarks. (Exhibit A: She once screamed onstage in Los Angeles that ''The Tea Party can go straight to hell, and I intend to help them get there.'') Rather, she was all empathy, vowing to use her new sway in Washington to protect the bankers' interests. ''You have a lot of good will right now,'' she said. As for Dodd-Frank, Ms. Waters said she stood ready to defend the law, but also instructed the bankers to compile a ''laundry list'' of their concerns. ''I don't want you to look at this as being impossible to tweak,'' she said.
After an hour of swiveling nervously in their chairs, the bankers broke into grins. One executive slapped Ms. Waters a high-five. Another embraced her.
''You've softened,'' Paul C. Hudson, the chairman of Broadway Federal Bank, teased Ms. Waters. ''I love the new Maxine.''
The New Maxine was born in part from Ms. Waters's ascension, in January, on the House Financial Services Committee. Exonerated in September at the end of a three-year ethics investigation, she replaced Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, for whom the banking overhaul bill was named.
The influential Financial Services Committee oversees community banks and Wall Street alike. And Ms. Waters has softened somewhat, not just toward local bankers in her district who might expect her ear, but also toward the Wall Street C.E.O.'s she formerly reviled.
In recent months, she dined with John Stumpf, the C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and met Wall Street chief executives like Michael L. Corbat of Citigroup and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. It's what she called ''an open-door policy.'' Most notably, given her penchant for railing against Wall Street abuses, she recently pushed regulators to delay certain rule changes on high-stakes derivatives trading. The regulators ultimately agreed.
The move may seem at odds with her track record as a rabble-rouser and consumer activist. In her long committee tenure, Ms. Waters positioned herself to the left of fellow Democrats, making her name on issues like affordable housing and foreclosure prevention. Ms. Waters acknowledged that ''some of my friends will not agree'' with all of her recent decisions. But after two decades in Congress, she says she has learned to pick her battles.
One battle emerged in recent days. In the face of intense lobbying pressure, Ms. Waters voted on Tuesday to oppose several House bills that would water down Dodd-Frank, a move that one consumer advocate called ''gutsy.''
''Sometimes the advocates won't like what I'm doing, and sometimes the industry won't,'' Ms. Waters said during the tour of her district in March. Then, raising her voice and striking a feistier tone, she added: ''I'm not owned by anyone.''
A softer touch with the nation's biggest banks could allow her to score points -- and campaign donations -- from an industry unhappy with her previous approach. And being more willing to compromise could also afford her new credibility on Capitol Hill to press her central focus -- the cause of consumers. But at a time when bank lobbyists are stepping up their attack on regulators, her soothing words to bankers raise a question: just how committed is the New Maxine to the banking changes she helped pass just three years ago?
IN the back seat of the Infiniti S.U.V. driving down Interstate 110, Ms. Waters glanced at her cellphone, anxious that she was running late for a tour of nearby homes that recently emerged from foreclosure. She barked directions at her driver, pointing to a detour that might shave five minutes off the trip.
Ms. Waters, who flies from Washington to her Los Angeles district almost every weekend, knows the territory well. She moved here from St. Louis a decade after high school, where the senior yearbook predicted she would become speaker of the House.
Arriving with her children, she enrolled in college at what is now California State University, Los Angeles. After a stint at Head Start, Ms. Waters joined the board of Essence magazine as she raised her profile in local politics. As a state lawmaker, she cemented her activist credentials during a bitter campaign to prevent California pension funds from investing in companies doing business with South Africa during apartheid.
Ms. Waters was elected to Congress in 1990, and has easily held her seat ever since, even as the district stretched farther away from inner-city south Los Angeles to the conservative community of Torrance. At 74, she shows few signs of the wear and tear of Washington. Ms. Waters swims 10 to 15 laps every weekend and adheres to a diet known as the 16-hour fast, routinely depriving herself of food until after sundown.
She has become famous -- or infamous -- for her public remarks as well, from her defense of the violence in the 1992 Los Angeles riots as ''somewhat understandable'' to a kindergarten-style verbal tussle with Peter King, a New York Republican, on the House floor that escalated to the moment when she told him to ''shut up.'' She also stubbornly supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that backstop the mortgage market, before their federal takeover.
Yet Democrats say the public perception of Ms. Waters as a firebrand is often out of context.
''That caricature is totally incomplete,'' said Dwight Fettig, a former top official on the Senate Banking Committee who is now a Democratic lobbyist at Porterfield, Lowenthal & Fettig. ''People underestimate her at their own peril.''
Her reputation does not seem to trouble her constituents, either; she is politically invincible in her district, in part because of her advocacy on behalf of ordinary homeowners. She memorably let ''Nightline'' tape her as she spent two frustrating hours on the phone being switched from one unhelpful bank employee to the next, trying in vain to secure loan modifications for her constituents. And one of her major efforts was writing legislation that created the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to revamp foreclosed homes.
During her trip to her district in March, she toured a once-blighted Los Angeles neighborhood that had received stabilization funds. In high heels and a hard hat, the congresswoman moved from house to house, greeted like a celebrity. Construction workers threw their arms around her. A police officer chased Ms. Waters down the street, trying to snap her picture.
Ms. Waters, already behind schedule, obliged the added distraction. ''My wife would kill me if I didn't do this,'' the officer declared.
MS. WATERS'S safe seat and her longevity on the Financial Services Committee meant that when Mr. Frank retired, she was in line to succeed him.
But until a few months earlier, the promotion had been in doubt, as Ms. Waters awaited the results of a long-running House ethics investigation.
In the fall of 2008, as Washington scrambled to rescue Wall Street banks at the height of the financial crisis, Ms. Waters contacted Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, to arrange a meeting on behalf of a trade group representing beleaguered minority-owned banks -- including a firm in which her husband owned stock. Ms. Waters's husband, Sidney Williams -- the former N.F.L. linebacker and ambassador to the Bahamas -- stood to lose about $350,000 if the bank, OneUnited, failed.
When the meeting was held, Treasury officials were surprised to see that OneUnited was the only minority-owned bank represented. In response to a question, OneUnited's executives made an appeal for a $50 million bailout. The suggestion that a congresswoman intervened to serve the financial interest of her husband kicked off a long, convoluted investigation that involved the establishment of a special ethics committee.
Last fall the committee exonerated Ms. Waters, after an independent investigator ruled that she intended to act on behalf of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. According to the independent investigator, Ms. Waters learned about OneUnited's appeal only after the meeting in 2008.
The ethics committee, however, admonished Ms. Waters's chief of staff, who is also her grandson, for twice trying to assist OneUnited. And the events prompted the committee to amend some of its ethics rules.
The exoneration paved the way for Ms. Waters to take over Mr. Frank's post. That news troubled Wall Street. Ms. Waters, lobbyists noted, was long hostile to their interests. She was, for example, a rare voice in opposition to a 1999 law that struck down Depression-era banking laws. That law, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, has since been implicated as one cause of the 2008 financial crisis. ''I voted no,'' she later boasted. ''I was right.''
Ms. Waters also played a crucial role in passing Mr. Frank's financial overhaul, pushing a provision that would make it easier for shareholders to oust a company's board members. And at Mr. Frank's urging, Ms. Waters helped sell the bill to the Congressional Black Caucus, delivering critical votes. ''She was one of the closest relationships I've had,'' Mr. Frank said recently.
With that track record in mind, some on Wall Street assumed that Ms. Waters would make Mr. Frank, one of the more liberal members of Congress, look like a free-market conservative.
But as Ms. Waters settled into her new role, she sent different signals. Just months after condemning Mr. Dimon for his opposition to some measures on derivatives, Ms. Waters urged regulators to delay the very same rules.
According to officials briefed on the matter, lobbyists for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs requested meetings with Ms. Waters's aides to raise concerns about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's plans to impose new derivatives rules on banks operating overseas. The lobbyists argued that American authorities should stand down until foreign regulators acted. Those concerns were echoed in December when a liberal member of the trading commission, Bart Chilton, came out in favor of a slight delay to the rules. Days later, Ms. Waters sent a letter to Gary Gensler, the chairman of the commission, asking for a six-month delay.
''I am writing to you to relay some of the concerns I have heard from various stakeholders,'' she wrote to Mr. Gensler. (Ms. Waters's aides say that she did not send the letter until Mr. Chilton ''tipped the scales.'' )
Still, the move elicited concern among critics of Wall Street who feared banks were winning over Ms. Waters.
''She should be shoring up regulators' spines, not clipping their wings,'' said Jeff Connaughton, a former lobbyist and Congressional staff member who recently wrote a book entitled ''The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins.'' Bartlett Naylor, a policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer rights group, called the derivatives letter ''troubling,'' adding that Ms. Waters ''needn't add her voice to the cacophony from antireform Wall Street apologists.''
Ms. Waters, however, noted that she voted against recent House bills that could curb the trading commission's overseas authority. And unless she is ''diametrically opposed,'' Ms. Waters said, she is willing ''to take a chance'' on some pro-industry efforts.
The letter to Mr. Gensler was unlikely to upset broad swaths of her base, which is generally more interested in housing issues than derivatives. In fact, Mr. Naylor said that Ms. Waters continued to be ''a stalwart defender of the American consumer.'' He noted that the new role has not stopped Ms. Waters from meeting with consumer advocates, faulting banks for their foreclosure abuses and opposing legislative efforts to weaken the Dodd-Frank law. ''When Wall Street interacts with me,'' Ms. Waters said, ''they will see I understand how things work.''
MS. WATERS'S shift in tone is not without precedent. The influential place she now holds has been known to nudge the staunchest liberals to the center, including her predecessor, Mr. Frank. ''You make a trade-off when you're at the top of the committee,'' he said. ''You gain a lot more influence but you give up some freedom to speak out.''
The ranking member on the Financial Services Committee typically takes in millions in donations from the financial services industry. As of now, Ms. Waters has received few dollars from the banking industry. Other than a recent $2,500 donation from Goldman Sachs's political action committee, her coffers are largely stocked with money from unions and other liberal causes.
For Wall Street, Ms. Waters's more open approach to the industry was a welcome change. ''The outreach has been very sincere,'' said James C. Ballentine, a lobbyist for the American Bankers Association.
Still, just how far that outreach goes -- and whether her softening tone becomes a willingness to weaken Dodd-Frank -- is a question that concerns consumer advocates. Bank lobbyists continue to argue for watering down the law's provisions, and Ms. Waters's public statements suggest she is trying to please both sides.
During a speech last month at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Ms. Waters opened the door to ''revisit, modify and clarify'' some of Dodd-Frank, while also stating her continued opposition ''to wholesale revisions.'' And at a committee hearing on Tuesday, Ms. Waters led a fight against a set of House bills that could unwind Dodd-Frank's derivatives provisions, saying she was ''exceedingly nervous about reopening the bill.'' She did so over the objections of Wall Street lobbyists and even several Democrats.
Still, of the five derivatives bills under consideration, she voted in favor of two.
''She clearly understands that her role has changed,'' said Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., a former Democratic congressman who served on the House committee with Ms. Waters and is now the acting president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group.
''But Maxine Waters is no shrinking violet,'' he said, ''and I don't think any of that's going to change.''
In the room with the California bankers, Ms. Waters suggested that at least when it comes to regulating community banks, things were going to be different.
''I think that you have made this effort of outreach is just extremely encouraging to us in the room,'' said Randy C. Bowers, the head of Malaga Bank.
Ms. Waters welcomed the praise. ''I do make myself available,'' she said. ''And now I have an opportunity as a ranking member,'' she said, where ''I can help you.''

HEADLINE: Lost and Found

BYLINE: By LESLEY DOWNER. 
Lesley Downer is a British journalist who writes about Asia. Her latest book is a novel, ''Across a Bridge of Dreams.''

 BODY:
A TALE FOR THE TIME BEINGBy Ruth Ozeki
422 pp. Viking. $28.95.
Nao, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, is in a cafe in Tokyo, writing in her diary. She is, she declares, a ''time being,'' with all the ambiguity that phrase implies. Many months later, after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami, a Japanese-American novelist named Ruth, living on an island off the coast of British Columbia, finds a barnacle-encrusted freezer bag washed up on the beach. It contains, it appears, a copy of Proust's ''In Search of Lost Time'' and a broken watch, along with some letters. But Proust's book is no more than a cover. Inside is Nao's diary, written in purple ink. 
Whenever the word ''time'' comes up -- ''wasting time,'' ''about time,'' ''in time'' -- the reader must stop and think about the many angles of approach to that subject in Ruth Ozeki's delightful yet sometimes harrowing new novel, ''A Tale for the Time Being.'' Ozeki's quirky and passionate first novel, ''My Year of Meats,'' introduced a Japanese-American television producer to a Japanese housewife; her second, ''All Over Creation,'' was set in rural Idaho. Now she sets out again to link two people on opposite sides of the Pacific.
Nao has spent most of her life in Sunnyvale, Calif., where her father was a Silicon Valley highflier. When the dot-com bubble burst, he lost his job and his money, forcing his family to return to Tokyo and a cramped two-room apartment at the wrong end of town, a situation that, as Nao puts it in her irreverent style, ''totally sucked.'' An unhappy schoolgirl who questions everything, Nao writes down whatever enters her head, making her diary read like an extended series of e-mails. When her great-grandmother and a fellow nun come on a visit from their Zen temple, she records her response: ''Yo, Dad! There's two bald midgets in pajamas here to see you.''
In her new Japanese school, Nao is an outsider, violently bullied by her classmates until she's covered in cuts and bruises. Her father's wounds are more deeply hidden: he lies to the family, saying he's found a new job, then sits in a park all day. Finally, he jumps in front of a train, but even his suicide attempt is unsuccessful. Nao also wants to die, but first she intends to write the biography of the Buddhist great-grandmother, who claims to be 104 years old. Yet there's another reason to relish her visit to the old woman's temple near Sendai, on the coast north of Tokyo: learning a way to overcome obstacles and enemies by developing ''supapawa'' (superpowers) through Zen meditation.
Nao's future reader, Ruth, has left Manhattan to live with her husband on the aptly named Desolation Sound in a community of refugees from the modern world. There she reads the diary slowly, at the same speed she imagines Nao wrote it, and gradually the teenager's world impinges more and more on Ruth's. The watch turns out to be not broken but merely in need of winding, and when Ruth translates the characters engraved on the back -- ''sky'' and ''soldier'' -- it's clear that it must have belonged to a kamikaze pilot. At the mountain temple, Nao meets the ghost of that pilot, her great-uncle, and is given letters he sent from a training camp to her great-grandmother. ''My being is attuned only to one thing,'' he informed his mother, ''the relentless rhythm of time, marching toward my death.''
Many of the elements of Nao's story -- schoolgirl bullying, unemployed suicidal ''salarymen,'' kamikaze pilots -- are among a Western reader's most familiar images of Japan, but in Nao's telling, refracted through Ruth's musings, they become fresh and immediate, occasionally searingly painful. Ozeki takes on big themes in ''A Tale for the Time Being'' -- not just the death of individuals but also the death of the planet. In doing so, she ranges widely, drawing in everything from quantum mechanics and the theory of infinite possibilities in an infinite number of universes to the teachings of the 13th-century Zen master Dogen Zenji. There's even a crow with possibly magical powers. All are drawn into the stories of two ''time beings,'' Ruth and Nao, whose own fates are inextricably bound.

HEADLINE: 'Chicago Manuals'

 BODY:
Rachel Shteir's review of ''The Third Coast,'' ''Golden'' and ''You Were Never in Chicago'' (April 21) elicited the ire of many in the Windy City, including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The Book Review received more than 100 letters about Shteir's essay. A selection of them follows:
To the Editor:
As someone who has chosen Chicago as an adopted city, I read Rachel Shteir's review of a number of books about Chicago with great interest. I strongly disagree with the negative portrayal of a city I have come to love. As a European, I can confirm the deep respect that Chicago has throughout Europe as one of the great symbols of the United States. 
Chicago is a beautiful city with many resources, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the best orchestras anywhere in the world.
Chicago's greatest resource is its wonderful people, who do not see music merely as an entertainment but also as cultural enrichment. This is a city rich in neighborhoods with great diversity that have been nothing but incredibly responsive to our attempts to bring music to those who may not or cannot come to us in the concert hall, whether because of cost or other barriers.
In each case, these efforts to share our music widely have been received with tremendous openness and affection, an outpouring of feelings from the heart that is as profound as any I have experienced conducting the great orchestras of the world across many cities and countries. Chicagoans are proud of their city, as we all should be.

To the Editor:
In her review of several books concerning Chicago, Rachel Shteir perpetuates a simplistic distinction: the obeisance to the hardscrabble city of Algren, Royko and Terkel confronted by the boosterism of elected officials and Chamber of Commerce spokesmen.
Chicago will always be the ''second city'' to New York. It will remain a national rather than an international metropolis, trapped and blessed by its location -- the most American of American cities. But sometimes smaller is better, or at least different. Absent from Shteir's negative and polarized description are a less commercialized theater scene than New York's, a first-class symphony, a smaller but superb opera company, a more limited but excellent fine-arts presence, diversified higher education and a distinctive financial district, as well as a sophisticated and self-critical population to enjoy them.
It is true that the city will not become the model it aspires to be until it improves dramatically its public school system, reduces racial segregation and consequent violence, and controls its political corruption. But what major city has found the solution to these and other urban crises? Chicago, like America itself, is more complicated than this review suggests -- and far more promising.
TED GROSSEvanston, Ill. The writer is the former president of Roosevelt University.
To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir is right about Chicago's parking meters and wrong about nearly everything else. I am sorry that she is so unhappy here, complaining that she has been ''bugged'' by the contentment of the natives ever since she moved from New York. One is tempted to make a nasty rejoinder, but being a Midwesterner, I will simply wish her well.
STEVEN LUBETChicagoThe writer is the Williams Memorial professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law.
To the Editor:
''Where are the women writers?'' Rachel Shteir's question is preposterous. Chicago's literary scene is alive with prominent -- Rebecca Skloot, Rosellen Brown, Sara Paretsky, Audrey Niffenegger, Christine Sneed, Carol Anshaw -- and less well-known novelists, journalists, story writers, poets and playwrights. How is it possible that she has missed this? A blunter sort of person might invite Shteir to take a long walk off a short pier -- our city has many lovely piers -- but a Chicagoan never would. We would only lament that Shteir has missed an opportunity to know and sing the praises of the women writers in her backyard.
KELLY O'CONNOR MCNEESChicagoThe writer is the author of three novels.
To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir's jaundiced view of Chicago suggests that she would be happier back in New York, poor thing. To point out Chicago's amenities would lead only to charges of ''boosterism.'' But allow me to note just a couple of Shteir's misleading judgments. Saul Bellow's remark about taverns being less hospitable for writers than cafes, which she reports as an example of how Chicago writers suffer, would be lost in his larger fondness for the not-papered-over realities of the city and how he liked to work here because he could do so in relative anonymity.
Shteir's reference to Lake Shore Drive as a ''highway that circumvents the poor neighborhoods'' between the University of Chicago and downtown ignores the fact that the road was there long before the poor neighborhoods, and that it doesn't circumvent anything -- it simply runs along the lake.
In the publishing house I used to run here, we had a button we wore to meetings of historians, booksellers and related types. It said, ''We don't care how they do it in New York.'' Shteir's review, and the Book Review's decision to print it, help explain why.
IVAN R. DEEChicagoThe writer was the publisher of Ivan R. Dee, now part of Rowman & Littlefield.
To the Editor:
Come on, Rachel Shteir, baby don't you wanna go?
BEN KESSLERChicago
To the Editor:
Whoa, Rachel! If you hate Chicago so much, maybe you should move. You could try some of the other American cities where I've lived. Like Houston with its oppressive heat and humidity, pollution and flying three-inch cockroaches kept at bay by regular dousings of insecticide. Or your beloved New York, where political corruption is alive and well and a postage-stamp fifth floor walk-up on the Upper East Side goes for $2,800 a month with free bedbugs. Or Boston, the arrogant self-proclaimed Hub of the Universe -- O.K., I'll give Boston a break. All of these cities have big problems, so don't try to convince me that Chicago's are completely self-inflicted. And by the way, send me your address. I'll help you load the truck.
KARL MATLINChicago
To the Editor:
I write this from the beach. No, I'm not on vacation; I'm a block off of Michigan Avenue, watching the sunrise over the lake. Remind me again where the Fifth Avenue beach is.
Like Rachel Shteir, I'm a New Yorker living in Chicago.
We both know that crime, corruption, expensive parking, a history of racial division and hyper-inflated egos are a problem here. But you're not much of a New Yorker if you think these ills are specific to Chicago. Fine, their pizzas are just calzones without tops, and putting a whole pickle on a hot dog is nothing short of sacrilege, but these are sins I can forgive.
So, from one New Yorker to another, if you truly can't stand Chicago: ''Get outta here!''
NICHOLAS B. ADELLChicago
To the Editor:
Regarding Rachel Shteir's essay, wherein she mentioned some stuff about the three books she was supposed to be reviewing: What great news! In order to review books about Chicago for The New York Times, the only qualification you need is to live here. YES! I live here! Next time, send those books to me. Furthermore, I am oblivious to my city's history, literary traditions and media environment. That should also help.
JEANNE FOLLMANChicago
To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir's reviews of the three books were, to put it simply, just silly. Chicago-bashing aside, if Shteir were familiar with urban issues, she would know that some of the most innovative neighborhood revitalization work these days is occurring in Detroit. But that would require questioning the obvious.
DIANE C. WILLIAMSEvanston, Ill.
To the Editor:
Thank you for the latest installment in the time-honored tradition of Chicago-bashing -- - a tradition that dates back 120 years to the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. In this day and age it's comforting to know that there are still just as many people willing to bash Chicago as to be boosters for it!
DANIEL MORGANChicago
To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir's commentary on Chicago is not only bitter but skewed. She begins her review quoting a friend, who said, ''Poor Chicago.'' All I can say in response is, ''Poor Rachel.'' To have spent 13 years in Chicago, a city she doesn't seem to particularly like or understand, is quite sad. She really should go back to New York and stop by Detroit on the way. It's obvious she's never been there.
MARY SHAUGHNESSYChicago
To the Editor:
From the first sentence of her essay, Rachel Shteir makes clear her dislike of Chicago. I expect a book review to be about the books and their authors, and whether or not they are worth reading. Shteir's snarky remarks detract from anything she might have said that would help me make a choice about reading these books. A point of view is one thing, but admitting right from the beginning that you intensely dislike the subject can lead nowhere productive.
JANET S. REEDChicago
To the Editor:
Rachel Shteir hasn't lived here long enough and misses the reality of being in Chicago. She ain't dumb -- just a New Yorker.
JAMES BLUMEChicago
To the Editor:
On behalf of myself and my fellow Chicagoans, I want to thank Rachel Shteir for so graciously explaining to us how foolish we are for thinking our city might have an interesting character or a rich history when we deal with such unique problems as crime, poverty and a lackluster baseball team. Now we can finally drop our tone of ''weary resignation'' and begin aping the habits of ''those on the coasts.'' But perhaps Shteir hasn't had the chance to really explore ''the coasts,'' given that cities like Philadelphia, Baltimore and Oakland, among others, seem to suffer from even worse problems than our benighted town. Presumably by ''the coasts,'' Shteir really means New York (and perhaps San Francisco), places too inundated with wealth to have to face the realities that economic diversity brings. In any event, I am glad for Shteir that she has found such a rich vein of journalistic insight to explore in the future. I look forward to reading her lectures to the people of Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi, Lagos, etc., on why they should stop pretending their cities have anything worth writing or talking about, and just focus on extolling the virtues of that provincial little island called Manhattan Shteir was once fortunate enough to call home.

THE BUSINESS OF BABYWhat Doctors Don't Tell You, What Corporations Try to Sell You and How to Put Your Pregnancy, Childbirth and Baby Before Their Bottom Line
By Jennifer Margulis344 pp. Scribner. $27.
Americans, you may have noticed, live in a capitalist society. In practical terms, this means someone is often trying to sell us something. John Updike saw a kind of glory in this: ''America is a vast conspiracy to make you happy,'' he wrote. Jennifer Margulis sees a vast conspiracy too, only its purpose is to make you miserable, sick and quite possibly dead, especially if you are a pregnant woman or a new mother. 
In ''The Business of Baby,'' Margulis, a journalist and a senior fellow at the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, recounts a range of horror stories, from expectant mothers ''told to drink an unnaturally sweet and horrible-tasting syrupy beverage'' as part of a test for gestational diabetes to women who die after a botched Caesarean section or from an embolism after doctor-ordered bed rest. From start to finish, in ways small and large, the process of having a baby is portrayed as one of humiliation, helplessness and fear on the part of women, and mendacity, greed and contempt on the part of doctors, nurses and anyone employed by companies that make diapers, formula or vaccines.
There are, of course, serious questions to be raised about women's health care in this country: Why are maternal mortality rates higher in America than in so many other industrialized countries? Why is the rate of C-sections, which are associated with a higher risk of complications than vaginal births, increasing (in 2011 it hit 33 percent)? A reader looking for a nuanced examination of the many factors behind these complex phenomena will not find it in this tendentious, one-sided book. Margulis sniffs the same motivation behind prenatal care, ultrasounds, neonatal intensive care units, well-baby visits, even circumcisions: profit. Hospitals have a lucrative sideline in selling foreskins to the biotechnical industry, Margulis reports, which uses them to make artificial skin, wound dressings and ''high-end beauty products.'' She quotes Tora Spigner, a doula and registered nurse, on the real reason doctors circumcise: ''All you have to do is follow the money trail.''
Margulis's travels on the money trail lead her to many sources like Spigner -- health care professionals who often seem to have an ax to grind or a perspective to promote. The author acts as their uncritical and frequently credulous scribe. Margulis interviews Larry Palevsky, a pediatrician from Long Island, who tells her that he was taught in medical school that the hepatitis B vaccine is given to infants to protect them against the disease in case any of them grow up to be prostitutes or IV drug users. ''If I'm a rational person and I listen to what you've said, the recommendation that we vaccinate a newborn against hepatitis B sounds absolutely insane,'' Margulis says. ''Asinine,'' Palevsky agrees.
Inaccurate or inflammatory statements are repeatedly reproduced without adequate substantiation or comment from the other side. ''Formula is killing babies in the United States,'' a Norwegian obstetrician claims. The behavior of American OBs ''is often arrogant, disrespectful, and sometimes even abusive,'' charges a retired physician from Washington State. Margulis's treatment of scientific evidence is similarly unbalanced. She chides doctors for ignoring ''the existing scientific literature'' on bed rest or toilet training, but resorts to anecdote to support her own positions: midwives in Iceland are ''having a lot of success'' with a rebozo, a ''Mexican cloth'' they wrap around the hips and buttocks of a woman in labor; ultrasound exams of pregnant women may be responsible for rising rates of autism among their children, according to ''a commentator in an online article.'' This anonymous individual has ''used ultrasonic cleaners to clean surgical instruments (and jewelry),'' which apparently qualifies him or her to offer an opinion on how the vibration of ultrasound waves may be causing the developmental disorder: ''Perhaps this vibration could knock little weak spots in myelin sheeting of nerves or such, I don't know.''
Margulis employs a simple heuristic in evaluating the practices and products associated with childbearing: anything used by mainstream doctors and hospitals = bad; anything used by midwives or alternative healers = good. (She also approves of anything used by Scandinavians; she spends many pages praising the health outcomes of women in Norway and Iceland, without delving deeply into the demographic and economic differences between America and such countries.) Her conviction that what is natural must be good leads her to romanticize not only other countries but also other eras: ''In colonial times and during most of the 19th century, the majority of births in America took place at home,'' she writes approvingly. ''Birthing women were usually attended by informally trained midwives who passed on their skills from generation to generation'' -- while a birth taking place in a hospital today involves ''at least half a dozen medical professionals.''
What's the reason for this? Margulis allows a doula named MaryBeth to make the by now predictable point: ''Are all those people needed at a normal birth? Absolutely not. All it does is drive up the cost of everything -- after all, all these people need to have salaries. If we make it normal to have your baby at a birth center, too many people will be out of a job.'' While there are no stories of women or babies saved by medical advances made since ''colonial times,'' Margulis's book includes many wrenching accounts of mothers and infants dying from the indifference or incompetence of doctors, and many bitter complaints about ''sterile'' and ''hygienic'' hospitals.
''The Business of Baby'' is dominated by an emotional dynamic that feels oddly dated: in Margulis's telling, doctors are supercilious, dismissive or hostile, and their female patients are naïve, cowed and submissive. She doesn't seem to be describing 21st-century America when she writes that ''it's almost unthinkable in the United States to go against what is considered routine when it comes to pregnancy, childbirth and raising an infant. We defer to the person we believe is the expert, wearing a white coat with a stethoscope around her neck. We are conditioned to trust doctors, to accept that what they tell us is true and to believe that they only have our best interests in mind.'' Has she not heard of Dr. Google? Today it's easier than ever to educate ourselves about health and disease and to find communities of like-minded people online (many of whom are proudly going ''against what is considered routine'').
With her focus on a largely bygone 1950s dynamic between women and doctors, in fact, Margulis has missed the real problem for today's patients: too much information and too few reliable intermediaries who can sort fact from rumor. Margulis herself proves unfit for this role in a shockingly irresponsible chapter on vaccines. All of her favorite conceits are here: the money-hungry pharmaceutical companies; the pediatricians who schedule routine immunizations simply to collect insurance reimbursements; the health care workers who patronize and bully women who refuse vaccinations for their children; and the brave parents who ''decide that they do not want to intramuscularly inject their child with something that is not part of the natural course of life.''
Just because something is for sale doesn't necessarily mean it's suspect. Caveat emptor has been good advice for a very long time; I advise you to apply it when considering whether to buy ''The Business of Baby.''

Unsafe factory conditions overseas: who is culpable?
To the Editor:
The building collapse in Bangladesh last month was the latest in a long series of preventable tragedies in the garment industry. Blame quickly extended from the owners of the building and the factories it contained, to the government of Bangladesh, to the retailers who sold the clothing. But the culpability extends all the way down the supply chain -- to us.
Our willingness to buy garments sewn under dangerous conditions, chocolate made from cocoa picked by captive children, or cellphones and laptops containing ''conflict minerals'' from Congo create the demand that underwrites these tragedies.
After a generation of outsourcing and globalization, corporations in many industries are often merely the last step in a long chain of suppliers and assemblers. As a result, the companies whose brands are on the product often have little idea of what might have occurred two steps back. 
Even the biggest electronics companies have had to mobilize substantial effort to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act's requirement to report their use of conflict minerals. The tech giant Hewlett-Packard is four steps upstream from the smelters that buy and refine the minerals that ultimately end up in its products. By locating and publicizing the identity of these smelters, H.P. intends to enable its suppliers to verify that their parts are conflict-free.
Shareholder pressures are unlikely to reduce unsafe practices in the supply chain. In the seven months after The Times published an exposé about safety problems in the iPad's supply chain, Apple's stock market value increased by over $200 billion, making it the most valuable corporation in history. Investors apparently had little reason to question Apple's supplier practices.
If we want to see fewer tragedies like the one in Bangladesh, we as consumers need to reward the companies that make the effort to verify their supply chains and shun those that do not. Make it unprofitable to be unsafe.

Readers React
I appreciate Mr. Davis's putting pressure on consumers to put pressure on corporations that turn a blind eye toward abuse of people and the planet in the interest of profit-making. Yes, in our quest for cheap disposable items from clothing to cellphones, we care not how these items were made -- although we shriek (momentarily) when the next factory collapses.
However, the problem is bigger than this. For one thing, consumers face limitations in their ability to respond. It's hard to gain information about the conditions in a factory where one's product is made, and even if we had this info, where can most consumers purchase fairly made items?
The larger system -- with its pressure to reward shareholders and failure to penalize companies that exploit others or the environment -- has few incentives to reward good corporate behavior.
For myself, I have divested from the stock market; reduced purchases to the minimum while seeking out previously owned and/or fairly made items whenever possible; spread the word in schools and other settings about these abuses; and taken groups abroad to visit our struggling neighbors and ecosystems and to consider the connections between our lives and theirs. The nonprofit organization that I head supports the empowerment of girls and women in other countries to be successful within their own economies, as the global system always tends toward exploitation.
DAVID RADCLIFF Director, New Community Project Peoria, Ariz., May 8, 2013
No, Mr. Davis, the culprit in the Bangladesh collapse is not ''us.'' And it certainly is not me, in particular.
Thirty years ago, I spent several years working in consumer products marketing and realized even back then -- before ''free trade,'' before ''offshoring,'' before ''globalization'' -- that profits come through exploiting whatever assets, human or otherwise, can be exploited; slapping disclaimers on any contract, products or actions that can result in liabilities; shifting responsibility when things go wrong; and simultaneously pumping out marketing and press materials that gloss over these cynical practices.
So, no, Mr. Davis, speaking for ''us,'' I resent being held responsible for Bangladesh. The fault lies squarely with executives much higher up the chain, the honchos in government, the regulatory agencies, industry, and the financial and legal sectors. They knew what they were doing, or at the very least, they have no excuse for not knowing.
BARBARA E. GOODMAN Ottawa Hills, Ohio, May 8, 2013
Professor Davis is right to say that consumers need to reward companies that take responsibility for conditions in factories producing their products. But he sets the bar too low. He proposes that consumers should reward companies merely because they ''make the effort to verify their supply chains.'' This is not enough, and simply monitoring individual factory conditions is only a first step.
Instead, consumers should reward those global companies that make a long-term commitment to stay in poor countries like Bangladesh, to work with their competitors to develop and implement practical industry standards on worker safety and other human rights, and then to make a collective commitment to press but also assist local governments as they struggle to uphold these minimum standards.
MICHAEL POSNER New York, May 8, 2013
The writer is a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.
Mr. Davis suggests that we use our power as consumers to change labor practices. But in a world of Walmart wages, Walmart prices are actually all most people can afford. Those in low-wage jobs themselves don't have the luxury of paying more for clothing made under decent working conditions. It's a race to the bottom, here and there.
If the blatant repression of labor organizing in Bangladesh were to stop, workers would have the power to represent their own interests. And similarly, in this country, if employers like Walmart were to be penalized for their anti-union repression, American workers could afford to make purchasing decisions based on human rights.
ELIZABETH ORAM New York, May 8, 2013
I remember not eating grapes for many months during the farm workers' boycott led by Cesar Chavez in the late 1960s. After five years the national boycott worked to improve the conditions and hourly wages of those who toiled in the fields.
Consumers need to reduce demand by only 10 to 15 percent to ultimately effect meaningful change. Just as consumers need to ''make it unprofitable to be unsafe,'' we must demand that multinationals do the same by rewarding suppliers that abide by prescribed guidelines and shunning those that do not.
BARBARA ALLEN KENNEY Santa Fe, N.M., May 8, 2013
Studies show that American consumers will pay more for clothing and toys if they can be assured they are made under decent conditions. Today, however, over 95 percent of the clothing and most toys sold in the United States are made overseas, primarily in Asian sweatshops. Companies like Walmart, Disney and The Gap demand that their overseas subcontractors produce goods at minimal cost, guaranteeing dangerous working conditions and below-poverty wages.
If these hugely profitable global companies required suppliers to double wages and provide safe factories, and passed on these costs to consumers, price increases would be negligible. For example, the Worker Rights Consortium estimates a total cost of $3 billion to improve Bangladesh's 5,000 factories to Western safety standards, adding less than 10 cents to the factory price of the garments made for global brands.
The Obama administration should call a summit meeting of American apparel companies, unions, and consumer and human rights group to demand that the companies raise pay and workplace standards, allow employees to unionize, and submit to regular monitoring by a neutral nonprofit organization that would issue a ''report card'' on each company's behavior for consumers to use in deciding what to purchase.
PETER DREIER Los Angeles, May 9, 2013
The writer is chairman of the urban and environmental policy department at Occidental College.
The public discourse relating to the recent building collapse in Bangladesh killing hundreds of factory workers has been devoid of one essential component: the state. Instead, nearly all that has been discussed involves either the extent to which a parent corporation should be responsible for the acts and omissions of subsidiary corporations, or the responsibilities of Western consumers.
Under international human rights law, each state has the responsibility not to commit human rights violations itself, but it also has the responsibility -- a legal responsibility -- to ensure that private entities, including corporations, do not violate human rights standards. What is evident from the tragedy in Bangladesh and many of the other workplace violations such as those involving Apple is that the state has utterly failed to meet these international obligations.
But the most vexing question is which states bear responsibility for this protection. Under the traditional approach, such responsibility would lie exclusively with the territorial state -- in this case Bangladesh. However, there has been a growing recognition that in the absence of human rights protection by the ''host'' state, a multinational corporation's ''home'' state must act to ensure that one of its entities does not violate human rights standards in other lands. Thus, not only has Bangladesh failed to meet its human rights obligations, but so too have a number of ''home'' countries, including the United States.
MARK GIBNEY Asheville, N.C., May 8, 2013
The writer is a professor at the University of North Carolina-Asheville and a founding member of the Extraterritorial Obligations Human Rights Consortium.
I confess -- I own Apple products. Through innovative design and marketing, Apple has convinced me that I need its products, and thus the controversies over its overseas manufacturers, like Foxconn, weigh less heavily in mind. Also, as a prudent consumer, I buy regular apples from a chain grocery store instead of fair-trade, organic apples from a local food cooperative.
As consumers, we do what psychologists call ''moral disengagement.'' We continue to buy things we like because we convince ourselves that it is not our responsibility to deal with supply chain problems or that the consequences of such problems are not severe. Recent research found that if consumers desire a product, they are motivated to justify sweatshop labor as less immoral. Because I love Apple products and regular apples, I morally disengage from supply chain ethics.
While consumers certainly have a role in forcing companies' accountability, it is unwise to place the entire burden on us.
MADELINE ONG Ann Arbor, Mich., May 8, 2013
Having invested a 40-year career in the retail and wholesale industry, I support Mr. Davis's comments. The retail competition in the United States has fostered an environment of constant pressure on suppliers to reduce wholesale pricing. If a wholesaler refuses, his future is sealed. The pressure moves up the supply chain, and the result, as we have witnessed in India and Bangladesh, can be tragic.
Retailers' vows to take the steps needed to ensure worker safety take money. Wholesalers cannot enforce safety practices unless their customers (the retailers) are willing to pay for more for the product. Ultimately, this translates to higher retail prices.
The responsibility for worker safety worldwide rests with the consumer worldwide. If we think it does not, we are electing to ignore our own complicity in these tragedies.
DARYL DAVIS Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., May 8, 2013
Even if workable, Mr. Davis's proposal would have limited impact. It does nothing to address the millions of workers in the developing world who toil in factories that produce goods for local markets or agricultural laborers who handle pesticide-infused products.
The root cause of the tragedy in Bangladesh is poverty and corruption. Petty corruption allows building inspectors to look the other way and labor officials to let preteens work in unsafe conditions. Poverty forces laborers to work in appalling conditions.
Alas, addressing the multiple causes of poverty is a long-term project, but one that must be pursued nonetheless.
MICHAEL A. RUGH Lake in the Hills, Ill., May 8, 2013
In 1911, after the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, the New York State Legislature appointed a Factory Investigating Commission, whose chairman was State Senator Robert F. Wagner. He saw firsthand the results of a one-sided industrial relations regime that uniformly favored factory owners at the expense of workers' rights, workers' safety -- and, in too many cases, their very lives.
Twenty-four years later, as a United States senator, Mr. Wagner successfully sponsored the National Labor Relations Act, which codifies the right of workers to organize unions of their own choosing.
Mr. Wagner's central insight is as true now as it was then: You can never hire enough inspectors to inspect every workplace at every time something might go wrong. But workers are already there and know quite well where the hazards are and how to prevent them.
Whether in Bangladesh or the boroughs of New York, self-government in the workplace remains the surest way to balance the awesome power of employers -- and the best safety program ever invented.

The Writer Responds
Should consumers feel any responsibility for how the goods they buy are produced? Ms. Goodman says no -- that executives and officials higher up the chain are responsible, not us. But why should the buck stop with a retailer that buys from a wholesaler that buys from a brand licensee that sources from Bangladesh? The retailer is three steps removed from factory conditions; we are four.
We can choose to ignore distant tragedies, but our purchases keep the machinery in motion. In a Web-enabled world, ignorance is a feeble excuse: if you can use a search engine, you can quickly research which brands oversee safe practices and make the long-term commitment that Professor Posner describes, and which do not.
Can consumers do anything to promote changed business practices? Ms. Kenney mentions the grape boycott that ultimately changed the working conditions of farm laborers in California. Consumers today have the capacity to change the landscape for nearly every product they buy -- particularly the affluent demographic that reads The Times. There are free apps on the Web that allow us to identify responsible products (such as GoodGuide), and some grocers post the provenance of their fresh foods.
If enough of us commit to following such ratings, it will shape business behavior -- particularly among the branded products that depend on their reputation.
Is this enough to change the dynamics of the global economy and alleviate poverty around the world? Not without vast structural changes. Scrupulous governments and empowered labor have always been essential for ensuring worker rights and safety. But consumer choices are the motive force, and we control what we buy. Some brands and retailers are already taking the lead here. Organics moved from high-end niche product to Walmart staple; why not products made under just conditions?

HEADLINE: The Truck Stops Here

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Stefan Nafziger seemed oddly downbeat for a guy watching a dozen or so hungry people line up to buy his falafels. Three years ago, when it seemed as if food trucks might take over Manhattan, he planned to have a fleet of his Taim trucks dispensing Middle Eastern fare throughout the city. He even got a Wall Street investor. Now, he says, his one truck barely justifies the cost.
I was originally hoping that Nafziger would help me figure out a decidedly New York puzzle. As I was walking through Prospect Park recently, I wanted to find a healthful snack for my son and something for me. The only options, though, were the same sort of carts that my dad took me to in the '70s: Good Humor ice cream, overpriced cans of soda and overboiled hot dogs sitting in cloudy water. This seemed ridiculous. In the past few decades, food in New York City has gone through a complete transformation, but the street-vendor market, which should be more nimble, barely budges. Shouldn't there be four Wafels & Dinges trucks for every hot-dog cart? 
David Weber, president of the New York City Food Truck Association, explained that the ratio is more like 25 to 1 the other way. That's because despite the inherent attractiveness of cute trucks and clever food options, the business stinks. There are numerous (and sometimes conflicting) regulations required by the departments of Health, Sanitation, Transportation and Consumer Affairs. These rules are enforced, with varying consistency, by the New York Police Department. As a result, according to City Councilman Dan Garodnick, it's nearly impossible (even if you fill out the right paperwork) to operate a truck without breaking some law. Trucks can't sell food if they're parked in a metered space . . . or if they're within 200 feet of a school . . . or within 500 feet of a public market . . . and so on.
Enforcement is erratic. Trucks in Chelsea are rarely bothered, Nafziger said. In Midtown South, where I work and can attest to the desperate need for more lunch options, the N.Y.P.D. has a dedicated team of vendor-busting cops. ''One month, we get no tickets,'' Thomas DeGeest, the founder of Wafels & Dinges, a popular mobile-food businesses that sells waffles and things, told me. ''The next month, we get tickets every day.'' DeGeest had two trucks and five carts when he decided he couldn't keep investing in a business that was so vulnerable to overzealous cops or city bureaucracy. Instead, DeGeest reluctantly decided to open a regular old stationary restaurant.
Nafziger also knows well the regulatory hassles of the business. After one of his employees spent eight hours in jail for selling falafel without a license, he strictly follows the rule insisting that every mobile-food employee has Health Department certification. The trouble is that he needs to employ four people, each with his own license; if one quits, it can take two months for a new worker to get the proper paperwork. Nafziger said he holds on to his truck only because it's basically a moving billboard for his two, more successful brick-and-mortar restaurants, in Greenwich Village and NoLIta. And stationary restaurants, by the way, require that only a single employee on duty have a Health Department certification.
Nafziger and DeGeest may have become experts in the rules and regulations, but many of the city's vendors are constantly flummoxed. I spent one recent morning in the offices of the Street Vendor Project, a worker-advocacy group. As I sat with Sean Basinski, the group's founder, a stream of vendors came in with pink tickets in their hands. One woman, an Ecuadorean immigrant who sells kebabs in Bushwick, Brooklyn, handed Basinski the six tickets that she and her husband received on a single afternoon. The total came to $2,850, which, she said, was much more than what she makes in a good week. She had a street-vendor's license, she said, but didn't understand that she also needed a separate permit for her cart.
The food-truck business, I realized, is a classic case of bureaucratic inertia. The city has a right to weigh the interests of food-market owners (who don't want food trucks blocking their windows) and diners (who deserve to know that their street meat is edible, and harmless). But many of the rules governing location were written decades ago. In the '80s, the city capped the number of carts and trucks at 3,000 (plus 1,000 more from April to October). Technically, a permit for a food cart or truck is not transferable, but Andrew Rigie, executive director of the N.Y.C. Hospitality Alliance, said that vendors regularly pay permit holders something like $15,000 to $20,000 to lease their certificates for two years. Legally, the permit holder becomes a junior partner in the new business.
As Rigie spoke, I was reminded of corrupt countries that I've visited, like Iraq and Haiti, where illogical and arbitrarily enforced rules create the wrong set of incentives. Perhaps the biggest winner in our current system is an obscure type of business known as an authorized commissary. By city law, every food cart and truck must visit a licensed commissary each day, where a set of mandated cleaning services can be performed. These commissaries also sell and rent carts and sell vendors food, soda, ice cream and propane. Rigie told me that many commissary owners make a bit extra by acting as informal brokers, facilitating the not-quite-legal trade of permits, which, by some estimates, is a $15 million-a-year business. Given their city-mandated stream of business, these commissaries have essentially formed an oligopoly. As a result, they have little incentive to compete aggressively by offering different kinds of food. No wonder we have an oversupply of hot dogs and knishes and nowhere near enough waffles and falafels.
Economically speaking, the problem is a standard one, known as the J-curve, which represents a downslope on a graph followed by a steep rise. Some sensible changes to the current food-vendor system may have long-term benefits for everyone, but the immediate impact could spell short-term losses for those who now profit from the system. A small group of New Yorkers -- particularly owners of commissaries and physical restaurants -- are highly motivated to lobby politicians not to change things. And most of the potential beneficiaries don't realize they're missing out. Many of the rest of us would love to have more varied food trucks, but we don't care enough to pressure the City Council.
The one group that clearly suffers from the current system -- the ticketed vendors -- are often poorly paid immigrants without legal status and virtually no power. This sort of dynamic more or less sums up the economies of the third world. Economists generally agree that one of the distinguishing factors between rich countries and poor ones is that it is much easier to start businesses in rich countries. In Ecuador, for example, it takes about 56 days and 13 separate procedures to get all the legal paperwork done to start a new business. In the United States, it's an average of six days and six procedures. But if you want to open a mobile-food business in New York, it's essentially like starting a business in Ecuador -- and that's if you can somehow arrange a permit.
After I left Prospect Park, I went home and began to read about Portland, Ore. The city embraced food-truck and cart culture and has made the procedure for starting a business remarkably easy. I found a Web site listing the carts and trucks operating there: Caribbean, Cajun, Central American, creperie, Cambodian, Cuban, Czech. And that's just the C's.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. The food-truck business stinks.
2. The dirty-dog business is an oligopoly.
3. Street food is where New York City enters the third world.

HEADLINE: The Demented Imagineer

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
''Now, I see this as pantsless,'' the artist Paul McCarthy announced one winter morning to a group of male actors standing at the edge of a massive soundstage in a warehouse east of downtown Los Angeles, flanked by a plumbing supply and an auto impound yard. Normally, McCarthy looks like a hipster carpenter, broad and bandylegged, with gnarled fingers and wiry white hair poking out around his baseball cap. But this morning he was nearly unrecognizable in a tuxedo and gray toupee, a regal prosthetic nose glued over a neatly trimmed mustache.
The transformation was startling not only because McCarthy, 67, had succeeded in making himself look quite a bit like Walt Disney, but also because his version of Walt smacked -- obviously but also hilariously -- of Hitler. He shook my hand, and I asked how he was.
''Pretty exhausted,'' he said. ''I picked a fight with Grumpy yesterday, and it got a little out of hand.'' He sank back into a chair, nursing a badly bruised elbow. 
Today's filming would be much less crazy, he announced. ''It's just going to be a light day, a music day.'' But before long, McCarthy as Disney -- or Walt Paul, as he called his amalgamated character -- was rampaging alongside an actress dressed as Snow White and the male actors done up like scrofulous-looking dwarves, to the din of a kitchen pot that Dopey pummeled into a metallic lump. The cacophony built toward pantslessness, and within minutes McCarthy and the dwarves were dancing a conga line, tights and trousers around their ankles, penises flapping in the air like pompoms. McCarthy's son, Damon, holding a high-end video camera, brought the scene to a close and seemed satisfied. He walked past me, grinning: ''Just another day at the office.'' And everyone took five.
The Snow White project, which will make its debut at the Park Avenue Armory in New York on June 19, is -- even for an artist whose subject is outsize spectacle -- a monster. It necessitated the creation of an 8,800-square-foot artificial forest, filled with glowering brown plastic-foam trees whose branches undulate more than 20 feet into the air, concealing in their midst what enchanted forests often do: a cottage. This one, however, owed nothing to the Brothers Grimm or Gustave Doré or Disney. It was a faithful replica of the canary yellow ranch house in Salt Lake City where McCarthy himself was raised, the son of a liberal Mormon homemaker and a grocery-store butcher. In its evocation of childhood set amid a kind of pop catastrophe, the project is quintessential McCarthy. For four decades, his version of American Gothic has been so perverse and outrageous, bloody and scatological, that it remains disturbing for even art-world initiates.
When I first visited the set in its early stages last November, McCarthy had placed a conference table at the forest's edge, so that he could convene meetings while looking at the work, the way a painter spends time with a canvas, except on an environmental scale. (The space is so large that whenever a landline call comes in for McCarthy, a loudspeaker rings out: ''Call for Paul! Call for Paul!'') At that moment, he was struggling with how to complicate the set. ''It needs abstracting. . . . I need a lot more time to screw it up,'' he said, using a much more descriptive verb.
This entire colossus, forest and house sets -- which McCarthy calls ''WS,'' for ''White Snow'' -- would soon be packed into dozens of tractor-trailers headed for New York, where the Park Avenue Armory has prepared the ground for anyone expecting a bedtime story. ''This exhibition contains content that visitors may find challenging and unsuitable for children,'' its Web site warns. The forest, paired with projections of the kind of footage I'd watched him shooting, will be the largest single work McCarthy has ever presented in America, and certainly the most important show he has ever had in New York, where he was long regarded as a West Coast cult phenomenon. (McCarthy didn't sell his first substantial piece until he was 45.) To coincide with the Armory exhibition, his gallery, Hauser & Wirth, will host four separate Manhattan exhibitions.
McCarthy views ''WS'' very much as a work in progress. Once the New York show is over, he intends to repatriate it to Los Angeles, where it can grow and mutate, possibly for years. And yet the forest is not even the most complex work he has planned. He recently bought a thousand acres of rolling scrubland north of Los Angeles to construct an Old West town for a series of demented westerns he envisions filming, another milepost on what amounts to the creation of his own B-movie studio.
As he hurtles ahead with these multimillion-dollar projects, many of them so unwieldy that their prospects of making it into collections or institutions are uncertain at best, McCarthy has set out on a path more ambitious than almost any American artist now working, one not even he is sure he can follow. ''It's necessary to do what I have to do, and I see the art world the same way,'' he told me, sitting at the big conference table with the artificial trees looming over us. ''I could retreat. I could do it another way, maybe. But obviously I'm not going to turn it around at this point. I'm only digging myself deeper.''
Paul Schimmel, the former chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and a longtime McCarthy supporter, told me: ''The thing about Paul -- and it comes partly from so many years of lack of success -- is that he is willing to bet absolutely everything, put the entire pot on the table and double down and say, 'I'm going to push this to the brink.' The potential for massive failure -- financially, intellectually -- is always there, and now it's as big as it's ever been. I think that kind of risk is what keeps him pure.''
For an artist whose work is still underrepresented in public collections because it makes many museum officials squirm, McCarthy lives a life of remarkable domesticity. He and his wife, Karen, an ebullient fellow Utahan, have been married for 46 years and are rarely apart. In the 1980s, when McCarthy had no money and worked in construction, they built the modest wood-frame house where they still live; he designed it so that none of the roof beams weighed too much for him and Karen to hoist alone.
The house, near Pasadena, at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, is cluttered and usually full of art people, grandchildren and dogs. When I visited, there was a pet turtle in the back and a treadmill in the living room. It could have been home to a couple of English professors, except that just off the living room, in a small studio, there hangs a prominent picture of a bare-bottomed mannequin excreting a sausage into a bowl, a still from a 1992 film reimagining the Swiss classic ''Heidi'' that McCarthy made with his fellow Los Angeles artist Mike Kelley.
The McCarthys run the studio as a family business, mulling over personnel issues in the mornings on their back deck (the studio sometimes employs more than 40 people full and part time). Damon, 39, who is his father's chief collaborator, lives nearby, as does the McCarthys' daughter, Mara, 34, who runs a highly regarded downtown gallery, the Box, where she often shows the work of underrated artists from her parents' generation. ''I basically knew my dad as a guy who worked in construction, and the art part was just something that was around,'' Mara said of a fairly normal middle-class Los Angeles childhood that included high-school baseball for Damon and gymnastics for her.
The McCarthys fly in a better class than they used to, but otherwise their life shows few traces of the financial success that, in recent years, has put McCarthy in the same rarefied realm as artists like Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince. His sculptures -- cartoon figures, uncanny McCarthy avatars, supersize inflatable feces -- can sell for more than a million dollars apiece. In 2011, one -- a toylike character topped with a huge tomato head with holes for inserting eyes, ears and genitalia -- went for $4.5 million at Christie's, setting an auction record for his work. ''I never really think about the money,'' McCarthy told me over sandwiches one afternoon at the house. ''I just think about the next piece and about how we'll do it and how much it will be. And sometimes I think, Wow, that's a lot. And sometimes we have it, and sometimes we don't.''
In addition to the large studio east of downtown, there is a 20,000-square-foot space, in the Baldwin Park neighborhood, dedicated to sculptural casting and to eerie animatronic pieces that have been a staple of McCarthy's work, made by some of the most-sought-after special-effects artists and sculptors in Hollywood. (One sculptor left Disney last year and then went to work for McCarthy.) Over the last several months, negotiations were completed for yet another warehouse, a 150,000-square-foot behemoth near downtown that will allow him to consolidate storage and give him an even larger soundstage environment.
McCarthy presides over this mushrooming enterprise as a generally benevolent but tireless sort of director-producer, constantly in motion, addressing everyone, man and woman alike, as ''dude.'' Much of his time is spent shuttling between his various locations in a white Subaru hatchback, which meant that many of our deepest conversations took place along the 210 Freeway or else at a sausage-and-beer joint near his daughter's gallery, where he and Karen like to go. Sitting there, listening to him describe becoming what amounts to the George Lucas of his own maniacal Industrial Light and Magic, I constantly found myself looking at the happy-seeming people around us and thinking: If you only knew what comes out of this man's mind.
McCarthy came of age as minimalism was blurring into the performance-heavy world of conceptual art. But even under conceptualism's cool spell, his early pieces were hard-core. ''When I first came to Los Angeles, I had this idea where I drew a line straight across a big map of the city and then tried to walk it,'' he recalls. ''But it meant you had to go through people's backyards and over roofs and walk long diagonals across busy freeways. There was no way to do it without getting killed.'' While still an art student at the University of Utah, he executed a homage to Yves Klein's famous 1960 ''Leap Into the Void,'' a doctored photograph showing Klein doing a swan dive to the pavement from a roof ledge in a Paris suburb. But McCarthy had only read about the photograph and had no idea it was faked. He threw himself feet first out of a second-floor window and somehow avoided breaking his ankles.
His Salt Lake City childhood was a fettered, anxious 1950s-suburban one. He was dyslexic, which made school traumatic: ''I just remember being afraid all the time.'' But the condition revealed to him early on that he experienced words and images differently from everyone else. ''For me, each part of a conversation,'' he says, ''always had a position in space.''
In the late 1960s, he settled in San Francisco, but Los Angeles always seemed the inevitable destination. ''It was like L.A. chose me,'' he says. First, he and Karen lived in Echo Park, and McCarthy worked in derelict downtown spaces. Then they moved to Pasadena, whose empty storefronts became an unlikely hotbed of art in the early 1970s, home to Bruce Nauman and Allan Kaprow, whose participatory, evanescent ''happenings'' (he once built a wall near the Berlin Wall with bread and jelly as mortar) were deeply influential for McCarthy.
Over the last half-century, some of the most acidic and genuinely terrifying American artwork has emerged from the sun-splashed studios of Los Angeles -- Ed Kienholz's ''Five Car Stud,'' a sculptural tableau of six white men castrating a black man; Chris Burden's performances in which he wriggled across a parking lot spread with broken glass and had himself shot in the arm with a .22-caliber rifle; Nauman's videos of clowns being ''tortured.'' (''Like getting hit in the face with a baseball bat,'' Nauman said of the intended effect. ''Or better, like getting hit in the back of the neck. You never see it coming.'')
McCarthy's early work was primarily performance and about as close as an American came to the extremes of the Viennese Actionists, artists whose notorious works in the 1960s sometimes involved real blood and real criminality -- enough to land them in jail. In 1976, before a classroom of students at the University of California, San Diego, McCarthy performed ''Class Fool,'' a shamanistic, quasi-sexual ritual with plastic dolls, in which he crawled around naked and smeared with ketchup, retching at the conclusion. ''Early on,'' he says, ''it was about understanding something about the absurdity of normality in the face of everyday existence. It was about trying to make work that grinds into something.''
As the performances developed, they became more overtly comical, though rarely any easier to watch. ''It's a little bit like eating meat,'' Burden, a longtime friend of McCarthy's, told me about his work. ''I mean, I love meat. But I'm not sure that I want to go to the slaughter yard. And that's where Paul takes you.'' (The analogy is apt in more ways than one. In McCarthy's world, consumer foodstuffs, sometimes rotted -- hot dogs, ketchup, mayonnaise, hamburger meat, chocolate -- are like paint and plaster.)
In what he calls not films but ''performance videos,'' he began to wear masks and take on personas -- cartoon characters like Olive Oyl and Pinocchio. Increasingly, the personas became those of patriarchal types -- a ship's captain, Santa Claus, Willem de Kooning. McCarthy says that he doesn't have any inherent interest in fairy tales or childhood stories but that, like westerns, they provide him with simple, archetypal, often moralizing stories -- of family, society, good and evil. In some ways, Walt Disney seems to be the figure he has been practicing to eviscerate his whole life.
To anyone who thinks of contemporary art as a confrontational, profane, puerile, nihilistic, body-obsessed in-joke, McCarthy provides a near-perfect example of all that has gone wrong since the '60s. His work can -- and does -- provoke physical revulsion. But it is not mere provocation; it's intended as an all-out assault, a ''program of resistance,'' as he calls it. And the older he gets, the more explicit he has become that his target is the American entertainment-consumer economy. ''I can see much more clearly now that we are living in the middle of this kind of insanity,'' he told me, ''and it runs itself. And the really scary thing is that we're not conscious of it anymore. It's a kind of fascism. The end goal of this kind of capitalism is to erase difference, to eradicate cultures, to turn us all into a form of cyborg, people who all want the same thing.'' This may be true, but even if you agree, you still have the sneaking feeling that the perversity is so abundant simply because it lights him up; it's his métier.
His work was never meant to be easy for the commercial art world to digest, which for a long time, it didn't. ''A lot of stuff got thrown out,'' he says. ''There were times when we needed space, and we would just take a load out to the dump.'' After one long trip to Europe, during which he was living hand-to-mouth (and also was robbed), he recalled: ''I came back and I was pretty screwed up. I had to figure out what to do -- two kids and no money, you know?'' He and Karen were on the verge of moving back to Utah when Burden, then teaching at U.C.L.A., helped McCarthy get a part-time teaching job. McCarthy also found piecemeal work in Hollywood; he was on the crew of the first ''Star Trek'' movie in 1978, assisting with special-effects photography. ''It affected me,'' he says now, ''being on the Paramount lot especially.''
Like Burden, who gave up pure performance and started creating sculpture and installations, McCarthy decided that to have a lasting influence in the art world, he had to begin making objects. But he did so without losing the impact of his performances. The turning point for his career was ''The Garden,'' from 1992, a small Arcadian patch of artificial forest (some of it recycled from sets for the television series ''Bonanza'') that connects his early work with the kind of massive set-building he undertakes now. As viewers walk around it, two animatronic male mannequins become visible, both with their pants down, one standing and copulating placidly with a tree and the other lying down, doing the same to the earth.
''I was in another room, and before I ever laid eyes on it, I heard people gasping,'' says Jeffrey Deitch, who was a New York-based art adviser when he saw the piece in an influential show of Los Angeles art, ''Helter Skelter,'' curated by Paul Schimmel, at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Deitch, now the director of MOCA in Los Angeles, bought the piece and later showed it in an exhibition that toured Europe. He considered it a new kind of work, a performance sculpture. ''It's rare than an artist invents a wholly new structure for art,'' he says, ''and Paul did that.''
Yet even after so many years of being lionized by fellow artists and curators, McCarthy has remained a figure little known outside the art world. Tom Eccles, a longtime New York curator who is helping to organize the Armory exhibition, recounted a story of introducing McCarthy at a New School lecture in Manhattan. ''I showed a lot of tough images, and everyone looked a little frightened. And then when Paul finally came out to the stage, a group of older people up front got up and stomped out. They thought they were coming to see Paul McCartney.''
McCarthy's standing as an art-world secret is likely to change in the next few years. In November, he and Karen drove me to a patch of chaparral and rolling grassland that sits between the San Joaquin Valley and the Mojave Desert. On the drive there, up California State Route 14, past Edwards Air Force Base, the land becomes flatter and browner, and signs begin to pop up about God, mostly the vengeful Old Testament version, along with ominous Northrop Grumman billboards showing only an image of a dark gray military drone and the slogan ''Securing the Globe, 36 Hours at a Time.'' Just two hours north of the city, this is full-blown John Ford country -- part of ''The Grapes of Wrath'' was filmed around here, outside the town of Tehachapi. And it's also where McCarthy bought the thousand acres on which he plans to build his own Cinecittà to make anti-westerns among the California pinyon pines.
''It's really a pretty crazy idea, even for me,'' he said, looking over a sparsely wooded basin where he has tentatively platted his Old West town, composed of all the familiar structures of frontier civilization -- saloon, sheriff's office, general store, bank, hotel/brothel. In the recreation room of a plain ranch house on the land, he keeps a conference-table-size architectural layout of the town, with plastic models to represent the buildings. The windowless structures will be mostly disorienting, claustrophobic and repetitive. ''It's not going to be like going into a saloon or a jail or an outhouse,'' McCarthy said, fiddling with the models. ''It's going to be like going into someone's head, into their mind.''
This little Dodge City will be unlike any other land-based art or public art in the country, if it ever opens to the public, a subject about which McCarthy is still highly ambivalent. He originally wanted to buy land to build the town along a major highway, so that it would be visible, like a crackpot theme park, to hundreds of thousands of people passing on their way to work. He also toyed with buying Santa's Village in the San Bernardino Mountains, a family-run amusement park with gingerbread houses and live reindeer that closed in 1998 after more than four decades in business. But the isolation of Tehachapi and the cost of its real estate -- ''We bought it basically for the price of desert land,'' he says -- appealed to him. Among the hurdles to creating the town is the task of getting city construction permits for buildings that don't fit into any known category of municipal structure. ''Ninety percent of the time I don't even mention the word 'art' at all,'' says Damon McCarthy, who has been talking to Tehachapi officials about their plans. ''It just really confuses people.''
The next time I visited McCarthy's main Los Angeles studio, in late February, filming was under way in the forest, which had grown freakish over the few months since I had seen it. It was overrun with huge plastic acid-trip flowers and thickets of underbrush installed by a Hollywood set company. The towering leafless brown trees looked both funny and unmistakably fecal. In a huge adjoining room, domestic sets replicated the interior of McCarthy's childhood home down to the faux-ormolu-framed mirror in the living room and a rust stain in the bathroom sink. Actors emerged from the makeup room done up like dwarves, with scrotum-like bulbous noses and tighty-whitey underwear over leggings. Elyse Poppers, the actress who plays McCarthy's primary ''White Snow'' character (following a kind of dream logic, there are doppelgängers), walked around in a red ball gown for that day's scene, a party in which relations between the maternal-erotic White Snow and her earthy cartoonish hosts start to reel out of control.
This Snow White would not follow much of a fairy-tale narrative -- no evil queen, no magic mirror, no resurrection through a prince's love. At one point, two of the Snow Whites, most of the dwarves and McCarthy lay in a moaning, panting, undulating pile on the living-room floor that McCarthy intended as a visual echo of an image in Jack Smith's 1963 underground transvestite romp, ''Flaming Creatures.''
''It's not about sex,'' he told me of his own scene. ''It's about basic human contact. It's about hanging onto someone else for dear life.''
When they finished, McCarthy hopped up and seemed barely out of breath. He was practically glowing. ''O.K., we take five and then we'll go again,'' he announced. ''Like yesterday, we'll kind of start this as a see-where-it-goes. Then we amp it up. We take it somewhere.''

The Hawaiian monk seal has wiry whiskers and the deep, round eyes of an apologetic child. The animals will eat a variety of fish and shellfish, or turn over rocks for eel and octopus, then haul out on the beach and lie there most of the day, digesting. On the south side of Kauai one afternoon, I saw one sneeze in its sleep: its convex body shuddered, then spilled again over the sand the way a raw, boneless chicken breast will settle on a cutting board. The seals can grow to seven feet long and weigh 450 pounds. They are adorable, but also a little gross: the Zach Galifianakises of marine mammals. 
Monk seals are easy targets. After the Polynesians landed in Hawaii, about 1,500 years ago, the animals mostly vanished, slaughtered for meat or oil or scared off by the settlers' dogs. But the species quietly survived in the Leeward Islands, northwest of the main Hawaiian chain -- a remote archipelago, including Laysan Island, Midway and French Frigate Shoals, which, for the most part, only Victorian guano barons and the military have seen fit to settle. There are now about 900 monk seals in the Leewards, and the population has been shrinking for 25 years, making the seal among the world's most imperiled marine mammals. The monk seal was designated an endangered species in 1976. Around that time, however, a few monk seals began trekking back into the main Hawaiian Islands -- ''the mains'' -- and started having pups. These pioneers came on their own, oblivious to the sprawling federal project just getting under way to help them. Even now, recovering the species is projected to cost $378 million and take 54 years.
As monk seals spread through the mains and flourished there, they became tourist attractions and entourage-encircled celebrities. Now when a seal appears on a busy beach, volunteers with the federal government's ''Monk Seal Response Network'' hustle out with stakes and fluorescent tape to erect an exclusionary ''S.P.Z.'' around the snoozing animal -- a ''seal protection zone.'' Then they stand watch in the heat for hours to keep it from being disrupted while beachgoers gush and point.
But the seals' appearance has not been universally appreciated. The animals have been met by many islanders with a convoluted mix of resentment and spite. This fury has led to what the government is calling a string of ''suspicious deaths.'' But spend a little time in Hawaii, and you come to recognize these deaths for what they are -- something loaded and forbidding. A word that came to my mind was ''assassination.''
The most recent wave of Hawaiian-monk-seal murders began on the island of Molokai in November 2011. An 8-year-old male seal was found slain on a secluded beach. A month later, the body of a female, not yet 2 years old, turned up in the same area. Then, in early January, a third victim was found on Kauai. The government tries to keep the details of such killings secret, though it is known that some monk seals have been beaten to death and some have been shot. (In 2009, on Kauai, a man was charged with shooting a female seal twice with a .22; one round lodged in the fetus she was carrying.) In the incident on Kauai last January, the killer was said to have left a ''suspicious object'' lodged in the animal's head.
Killing an endangered species in Hawaii is both a state and federal offense. Quickly, the State of Hawaii and the Humane Society of the United States put up a reward for information. ''We're all in agreement that somebody knows who did this,'' one Humane Society official told me. The islands are close-knit but also loyal, particularly the native Hawaiian communities. In January, when I met with the state wildlife agency's chief law-enforcement officer for Kauai -- a man named Bully Mission -- he confessed that, after a year, Kauai's tip line hadn't received a single call. In fact, there was still a reward out from a seal killing in 2009.
A quick aside about Bully Mission: I went to Hawaii thinking I'd write a straight-up police procedural -- you know, ''CSI: Monk Seal.'' When I heard that Kauai's top wildlife cop was named Bully Mission, I figured I'd found my hard-boiled protagonist. But for one thing, Bully Mission isn't anything like the detectives on TV. He's a small, wide-smiling man, who seems to inner-tube through life on currents of joy and amusement. (His real name is Francis.) Wildlife crime-solving doesn't fit the network-drama formula, either. The wilderness is a big, unwatched place. The ocean is a violent environment. Sometimes it's tough even to determine a cause of death. (A seal with skull fractures may have been beaten, or it may have died miles out at sea of natural causes, then knocked around in the surf.) When your victim is a seal, one federal agent points out, ''you can't interview the seal; you can't interview its friends.'' Often, you can only pile up a reward and wait.
And so, as the deaths kept coming after that initial murder on Molokai, environmental groups chipped in more money, bringing the total reward to $30,000, or $10,000 per seal. Then, in April 2012, a fourth seal was killed on the east side of Kauai. This particular seal was well known in the neighborhood; it frequented an inlet under a scenic walking path. Locals nicknamed it Noho, Hawaiian for ''homebody.''
Mary Frances Miyashiro, a retired teacher and social worker who patrols that coastline as a volunteer monk-seal responder, arrived on the scene first. She sat with Noho's body for an hour, waiting for others to come and heft the seal into an insulated body bag so it could be driven into town for a necropsy, or animal autopsy. ''My heart sank,'' Miyashiro told me. ''I didn't know what to do with those feelings, so I picked up trash.'' It felt hopeless, like the killings might go on forever.
Two days later, a uniformed law-enforcement officer from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the federal agency responsible for monk seals, flew to Kauai from Honolulu to open the U.S. government's investigation. This officer's name was Paul Newman.
Newman went to the crime scene -- the beach -- and photographed whatever seemed notable. Not much, really. There was one lead -- someone had overheard a man badmouthing the monk seal -- but it went nowhere. So that night, Newman hopped a commercial flight back to Honolulu. He had a cooler with him, packed with ice, sealed with official tape. Inside was Noho's wounded head. The head was the only evidence.
The reward ticked up to $40,000.
We live in a country, and an age, with extraordinary empathy for endangered species. We also live at a time when alarming numbers of protected animals are being shot in the head, cudgeled to death or worse.
In North Carolina, for example, hundreds of brown pelicans have recently been washing ashore dead with broken wings. The birds, nearly wiped out by DDT in the 1970s, are now plentiful and often become semi-tame; they're known to land on fishing boats and swipe at the catch. One theory is that irritated fishermen are simply reaching out and cracking their wings in half with their hands. In March, in Florida, someone shoved a pelican's head through a beer can.
Around the country, at any given time, small towers of reward money sit waiting for whistle-blowers to come forward. This winter four bald eagles were gunned down and left floating in a Washington lake (reward: $20,250); three were shot in Mississippi ($7,500); and two in Arkansas ($3,500). Someone drove through a flock of dunlins -- brittle-legged little shorebirds -- on a beach in Washington, killing 93 of them ($5,500). In Arizona, a javelina, a piglike mammal, was shot and dragged down a street with an extension cord strung through its mouth ($500), and in North Carolina, 8 of only 100 red wolves left in the wild were shot within a few weeks around Christmas ($2,500). Seven dolphins died suspiciously on the Gulf Coast last year; one was found with a screwdriver in its head ($10,000). Sometimes, these incidents are just ''thrill kills'' -- fits of ugliness without logic or meaning. But often they read as retaliation, a disturbing corollary to how successful the conservation of those animals has been.
Since the passage of the Endangered Species Act 40 years ago, so much wildlife conservation has been defensive at its core, striving only to keep animals from disappearing forever. But now that we've recovered many of those species, we don't quite know how to coexist with them. We suddenly remember why many of us didn't want them around in the first place. Gray wolves, sandhill cranes, sea otters: species like these, once nearly exterminated, are now rising up to cause ranchers, farmers and fishermen some of the same frustrations all over again. These animals can feel like illegitimate parts of the landscape to people who, for generations, have lived without any of them around -- for whom their absence seems, in a word, natural. As Holly Doremus, an environmental legal scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, writes, America has saved so much without ever asking ''how much wild nature society needs, and how much society can accept.''
The monk seal is not one of these success stories. The species, as a whole, is still slipping toward extinction. But the situation in Hawaii follows the same script: there used to be zero monk seals living around the main Hawaiian islands; there are now between 150 and 200. And I heard story after story from fishermen about seals stealing fish from their nets or hooks, or lurking at favorite fishing spots and scaring away everything else. A lot of fishing in Hawaii is done for subsistence -- a way for working-class people to eat better food than they can afford to buy. The monk seals are perceived as direct competition, or at least an unnecessary inconvenience. ''They're troublemakers,'' a young spear fisherman told me one morning at Kauai's Port Allen pier.
Also, as often happens with endangered species, many of the people asked to coexist with the monk seal see the animal less as an autonomous wild creature than as an extension of the government working to save it. There has been frustration with the federal government among fishermen and other ''ocean users'' in Hawaii since at least 2006, when President George W. Bush turned the water around the Leewards into the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, barring a small number of fishermen who had permits to work there from 140,000 square miles of the Pacific, an area larger than all of America's national parks combined. Now various agencies are bandying about so many other proposals -- to protect corals, humpback whales, sea turtles -- that several people I met on Kauai seemed to be making second careers of attending the government's informational meetings to keep watch over their rights. It's unclear if these proposals might lead to new fishing regulations, but the sheer volume of environmental strategizing, and the bureaucrats' sometimes inelegant ways of communicating their plans, have led some people to presume that it's all one big, aquatic land grab. A commercial fisherman named John Hurd told me that he believed the feds wanted to make the ocean ''a fishbowl.'' ''Divers can't go in there, fishermen can't go in there,'' he said. ''It's going to be an aquarium.''
That skepticism is compounded for native Hawaiians. After all, they now walk beaches that their families have used for centuries and find tracts of sand literally roped off by NOAA monk-seal responders -- men and women who, on Kauai, are almost exclusively white, wealthy retirees from the mainland. (It's these haole, as Hawaiians call white outsiders, who have the luxury of standing watch over a sleeping monk seal all day.) Even the idea that a wild animal needs such coddling strikes some locals as absurd. ''The seal needs to rest!'' one man, Kekane Pa, told me sarcastically. ''The seal needs to rest because it's been swimming in the water.''
Pa is 49 years old and gigantic, with a voice that's somehow both hoarse and totally overpowering. He'd picked me up at my hotel, found a nice spot to park his truck at Waimea Beach and proceeded to shout his side of the story at me for nearly two hours, popping a Heineken at one point and rolling down his window whenever he fogged the windshield.
Pa works construction and is also the speaker of the house of the Reinstated Hawaiian Government, a grass-roots shadow government trying to reclaim Hawaii from the United States, which, it maintains, annexed the islands unlawfully in 1898. Like others I met, Pa saw the monk-seal controversy within this historical context. He brought documents to show me and delivered a scathing people's history of the islands, from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893 to the ''Apology Resolution'' signed by President Clinton in 1993. He felt the same imperial indifference coming from the government now: Hawaiians are second-class citizens, he said; the tourists come first. Now Hawaiians were being skipped over again -- for a seal. ''There's issues here that have never been resolved since the time they stole Hawaii,'' Pa told me.
He shouted all of this with a mix of exasperation and righteousness; his eyes never stopped saying, Can you even believe this is happening? He was asking for recognition for his people -- these living, breathing afterthoughts that so-called civilization had long ago pushed aside. It was the same cry the monk seal, or any endangered species, might make if it had a voice. And yet the seal was now getting all the help and money it needed without ever having to ask.
I asked Pa if more seals would be killed. ''I hope not,'' he said. ''But I can tell you this: it's just starting to heat up, brah.''
As monk seals became more visible in recent years, this umbrage and suspicion stacked up like kindling. Then, in September 2011, when NOAA officials toured the islands to hold a series of public meetings, it ignited.
A meeting was required by law to hear public comments about NOAA's new ''programmatic environmental-impact statement'' for Hawaiian monk seals, or PEIS. As a hundred or so locals arrived at an elementary school on Kauai one Saturday evening, they were offered USB drives loaded with the document. It was 462 pages long, not including appendices.
The PEIS outlined new ideas for helping the monk seal, which, despite how things looked around Kauai, was in a dismal tailspin as a species. Young seals in the Leewards seem to be having trouble getting enough to eat. Pups are being picked off by sharks, which have learned to slither toward them while they're nursing, in as little as six inches of water. Also, for a long time, there have been more male seals than females on some of the Leewards, and pups had been bitten or drowned by sexually frustrated males trying to get to their mothers, or crushed when those rippling bulls tried to have sex with them instead. Females have been smothered when multiple males tried to mate with them simultaneously in so-called ''mobbing'' attacks.
The scientists working in the Leewards were trying everything they could to protect the female pups especially -- the future breeders. They used wooden shields called ''crowding boards'' to break up fights, or swatted the belligerent bulls away with palm fronds, or ran down the beach screaming at them. Now the PEIS was proposing an elegant workaround to the problem: NOAA wanted to move a number of young female monk seals out of the Leewards every year and into the friendlier waters around the mains. They would mature there for a few years, then be captured and moved back once they were able to fend for themselves. NOAA called this process ''translocation.'' Ecologically speaking, the idea made sense; it bordered on ingenious, even. But sociologically -- if you focused on Hawaiian people, and not just Hawaiian monk seals -- it was hopelessly tone-deaf.
For one thing, many in Hawaii were convinced that, as one attendee put it at the elementary school, the entire ''history of the monk seal is based on a lie.'' Because the species was eradicated in the mains so long ago, people have lived on Kauai their entire lives without seeing a single monk seal until recently. Traditional Hawaiian knowledge carries great authority on the islands, and in every cranny of the culture where you'd expect to see monk seals, people saw none: no mention of the seals in traditional chants, no wood carvings. People often point out that they don't even know of a Hawaiian word for the animal. (NOAA believes the ancient word ilioholoikauaua, ''dog running in rough water,'' refers to the seal, though that has been resisted; at one public forum, a man called applying that word to monk seals a ''defamation of my language and my culture.'') The logical explanation, for many, was that the seal wasn't actually native to Hawaii, that the government had brought the animals, in secret, to create jobs for scientists and push its environmentalist agenda. (This conspiracy theory may have grown from a bit of misunderstood truth; in 1994, NOAA brought 21 monk seals to the mains from one Leeward island in an earlier attempt to even out the genders there.) It seemed arrogant for NOAA to announce that it wanted to bring more now.
Another objection was rooted in an equally uncooperative set of coincidences: namely, the situation with the birds. It was Kauai's mayor, Bernard P. Carvalho Jr., who filled me in about the birds. A towering, debonair man in an earth-toned aloha shirt, Carvalho met me in his office to talk monk seals. But it was obvious that, as far as he was concerned, I was asking about the wrong animal. He explained how seabirds called Newell's shearwaters come to Kauai to mate and nest every spring. In the fall, the fledglings leave the nest and become disoriented by bright lights. They will drop from the sky and freeze up. For as long as Carvalho can remember, he said, when you find a dazed shearwater, you simply pick it up and bring it to the firehouse, where it's tucked in a pigeon box and tended to until it recovers.
The shearwater fledgling season happens to coincide with the high-school football season. One local described how little kids have always raced around the sidelines, under the Friday-night lights, collecting the paralyzed birds. But the Newell's shearwater is a federally protected species. In 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service informed the County of Kauai that each downed shearwater would be considered a violation of federal law. Fines, the mayor was told, could reach $25,000 per bird. ''So that was kind of a big . . . what?'' he said.
Friday-night football became Friday-afternoon football. Working parents had trouble seeing their kids play, and the island lost one of its central forms of entertainment. There was anger, incredulity and T-shirts that read ''Buck the Firds.'' The mayor, a former high-school football star on Kauai, told me: ''Friday night is football night. Don't even go there!'' Now, more than two years later, the county was still working with the federal government to retrofit the lights and get in compliance. In part, the mayor explained, this involved keeping track of the relative brightness of the phases of the moon.
There were other birds too, he went on: like the Hawaiian nene goose, which was once within a few dozen birds of extinction. Now many congregate on a golf course next to the airport, where the mayor worries -- ''God forbid'' -- that one might bring down a flight. Conservation is important, he said, ''but where does it end? How far does it go?''
A version of this question was raised at the elementary-school hearing again and again. As one man put it, ''Nowadays, it seems that wildlife has more support than the people.'' The government was focused so narrowly on helping monk seals survive an immediate threat, but it wasn't communicating any cohesive vision of the future. How many monk seals in the water around Kauai would be enough? What would coexistence with that many seals look like? One speaker asked, for example, whether he'd be fined for striking a seal if the animal threatened his little cousins while they were swimming. But the NOAA officials holding the meeting couldn't answer his question -- or anybody's. There had been town-hall meetings held throughout the year, but federal law required that this hearing be a ''listening session'' only. The panelists were barred from speaking to anyone who testified. It was meant to be respectful -- we're all ears -- but it came off as insulting. (''Silence,'' one participant, a construction worker named Kimo Rosa, told me. ''Silence!'') And so, one by one, people rose to delineate their conspiracy theories or plead for respect, until a timekeeper flashed a red sign and their three minutes were up.
Near the end of the hearing, a man named Kalani Kapuniai noted that if the government were here to ask for the community's input on translocation, then ''from what I gathered over here, you guys, the answer is no. . . . So put [this] down in your notes,'' Kapuniai said. People are getting fed up with the monk seals, and '' they're going to kill them. Bottom line.''
There was applause. All the moderator could do -- all she was allowed to do -- was say, ''Thank you.'' Eight weeks later, a beachgoer found the 8-year-old seal slaughtered on the Molokai beach, the first of the four killings that winter.
Many of the monk seals slipping back into the main Hawaiian Islands in the early '70s landed first on the shores of Niihau, the island closest to the Leewards. Niihau is plainly visible from the west coast of Kauai but also, in a sense, completely invisible, since it has been privately owned since 1864, when a family named Sinclair bought the island from King Kamehameha V for $10,000 in gold.
Niihau is 72 square miles -- the size of Brooklyn, roughly, or one and a half San Franciscos. While the 20th century was happening to the other Hawaiian islands, the Robinsons (the Sinclairs' heirs) pugnaciously kept outsiders away from theirs, preserving it, like a diorama, for the family's old-fashioned ranching operation and a small community of natives who still live in a village at one end. Even after a two-way radio was installed on Niihau in 1959, information was still regularly relayed to Kauai by messenger pigeon -- when information was relayed at all. Mostly, the Robinsons and the Niihau people wanted to be left alone. An irresistible scrim of secrecy still hangs around the island. In 1957, a journalist seemingly went so far as to crash-land a small airplane on Niihau so he could look around.
Pristine and mostly empty, Niihau has been a perfect gateway for Hawaiian monk seals as they have recolonized their species' ancestral habitat. It's no secret that lately the federal government's recovery effort has been mired in a fair amount of desperation. (In March, NOAA indefinitely postponed the translocation from the Leewards, not because it lacked public support, says Jeff Walters, the agency's monk-seal-recovery coordinator, but because NOAA ''needs more time and resources to grow our capacity to better manage and protect the seals already living in the mains before bringing down any new animals, even temporarily.'') And so the scientists involved can get a little breathless when they speculate about the fantastic number of monk seals that must be living happily on Niihau. But no one knows for sure: Keith and Bruce Robinson, the aging brothers who, along with their mother, inherited control of Niihau in 1969, haven't given the government the kind of access or data it would like. Walters described the island as both one of the real ''hopes for monk seals in the main Hawaiian islands'' and as a giant ''black box'' at the center of the story.
''What a horrible-looking sow!'' Keith Robinson bellowed as a scraggly black hog materialized from the bushes and scampered alongside our truck. Robinson seemed somehow uplifted by its hideousness. It was the jolliest I'd see him all day.
I'd managed to talk Robinson into giving me a tour of his family's island. He is 71 and bracingly direct. He lives on Kauai -- neither Robinson brother has ever lived on Niihau for longer than a few months at a time -- and within seconds of our meeting there, he handed me a copy of his self-published book, ''Approach to Armageddon: One Christian's Speculation About the End of the Age.'' The cover showed a wasteland of mushroom clouds and twisting pillars of smoke. At the bottom, standing like a solitary figure in a Japanese landscape painting, was an old man in work clothes and a green hard hat, carrying a rifle. The man in the hard hat was Keith Robinson. He was wearing the same outfit, including the hat, when I met him in the doorway of his office.
The Robinson brothers have made Niihau a marginally more open place than it once was. They started allowing a small number of tourists, though they barely advertise, don't run tours on any discernible schedule and permit outsiders to visit only certain parts of the island. Keith Robinson presented himself and his brother as wretchedly cash-poor -- he spent the 20-minute helicopter flight over from Kauai badgering the pilot to fly in a straight line, so as not to waste fuel -- and the island as a cherished grandparent to whom they're devoted to keeping alive, no matter the cost or aggravation. The Robinsons have been able to afford this largely through partnerships with the U.S. Navy, which operates tracking stations on the island for aircraft and missile testing offshore. The Navy also holds exercises in the channel between Niihau and Kauai -- which, Robinson explained, can be used as a proxy for the Strait of Hormuz, the link between the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Iran. Years ago, the Navy also ran downed-pilot drills on Niihau's interior. A pilot would be tasked with finding his way off Niihau, as if after a crash, while bands of Niihau people pursued him. The Niihau are solidly built and fast; one of the few native women I was able to talk with described how they hunt hogs on the island: by running the animals down on foot and grabbing an ankle. They took to the downed-pilot drills enthusiastically -- their only extramural sport. The poor pilots never had a chance, Robinson explained.
We trundled around the northwestern portion of the island, looking for monk seals in a battered, Korean War-era weapons carrier, a kind of truck, with wooden planks for benches. Our chauffeur was a silent, barrel-chested Niihau man. He pushed the truck over the sand, or on primitive dirt trails, while Robinson issued him quick, clipped instructions in Hawaiian. (The Niihau may be the last surviving community of native Hawaiian speakers.) The scenery was spectacular, in an illicit, ''Jurassic Park'' kind of way. The beaches looked like screen-saver beaches. Every so often, we saw a monk seal and stopped, rising from our seats in the truck to observe the animal doing nothing. Robinson had not been on Niihau for many months, and was disturbed by how few seals we were spotting. ''There are no monk seals here!'' he kept saying. He blamed fishermen from Kauai who've been turning up to fish Niihau's pristine reefs. He claims these fishermen are disturbing, and even occasionally shooting, the monk seals. I sensed that these ''marauders,'' as Robinson called them, were also an affront to the isolation and privacy that his family has always cherished. Robinson described these Kauai fishermen the way the fishermen described the monk seals: as an invasive species, barging in to threaten the natives' survival.
''Darn it, this is not good,'' he huffed as we crossed another empty beach. ''This is a catastrophe. This is disastrous.'' His shock and concern were quickly phasing into sulking.
Relatively speaking, Niihau is actually packed with monk seals. At its peak, about a decade ago, the population there may have reached 200 -- about a fifth of the world's current population. Returning from their millennium-long exile in the Leeward Islands, the seals found, in Niihau, a landscape that not only looked remarkably the way it did when they left it behind but that was also governed by two eccentrics willing to make room for them.
It turns out that the Robinson brothers are devout conservationists. ''I'm a right-wing extremist,'' Keith told me, and this means feeling an obligation to use the earth wisely and replenish it, just as God instructed in the Bible. ''If they want to shoot monk seals on the other islands, that's fine,'' he said. ''But Bruce and I like having them around.''
For decades, the brothers have done their best to foster and protect the seals on Niihau, organizing the Niihau people to monitor them along the coastline. That is, they've cultivated acceptance of the seals among the Niihau people -- exactly what NOAA has failed to do elsewhere. Robinson told me that, in the early days, he heard the same grumbling about monk seals from the Niihau people that I encountered on Kauai. ''But Bruce and I just said: 'Look, let's tolerate these seals. You may have to work a little harder for your fish, but the fish will still be there, and the seals will have a chance.' '' When I asked how they managed to pull this off, Robinson noted that, for one thing, there truly are more fish to go around on Niihau. But also, he added, ''well, we're the nasty, old feudal landlords.'' The Niihau people are the Robinsons' tenants and their employees. No messy public hearings on his island.
Robinson told me that he would happily host as many more monk seals as NOAA wanted to relocate from the Leewards, as long as he could manage the animals his way. He has no stomach for the tyrannical regulations and egregious spending that he feels the government uses endangered species to justify. As we drove, he laid out his case against America's ''eco-Nazis,'' an epithet he uses tirelessly and, I would learn, without hyperbole. (Robinson later gave me writings outlining his belief that environmentalism is a deliberate conspiracy to install totalitarian government in America while distracting its citizens with cuddly, vanishing animals, just as Hitler's rise to power in Germany was cloaked by nationalism.) But look at Niihau, he said: ''We've done all this quietly, on our own, and with our own money. It didn't cost the government a cent.'' On the other Hawaiian islands, people were sticking it to the government by murdering the seals it was working to save; Robinson was sticking it to the government by actually saving them.
Robinson has always imagined his conservation work as this sort of principled, guerrilla resistance to the eco-Nazi regime. A gifted horticulturist, he started growing many imperiled, native Hawaiian plants on his family's land on Kauai in the 1980s. This included a particular subspecies of Caesalpinia kavaiensis, a Hawaiian hardwood, which was coming close to extinction in the wild; Robinson managed to produce a single tree from surviving seeds. But in the mid-'90s, he discovered a draft document from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service expressing the agency's wish to ''secure'' and ''manage'' the tree on his land. He jumped to the conclusion that this meant seizure by eminent domain. (John Fay, a former botanist for Fish and Wildlife, told me, ''Basically, it was a misunderstanding.'' Deeper in the document, the agency asserted that Robinson's work should be ''supported and assisted.'') Robinson called the agency in a rage. He recounted the phone call to me several times, always in a single, Homeric run-on: ''I also stated that if they wanted to take my reserve over, they would probably have to engage in a gun battle with me, and kill me, and I said that coming after the debacle at Ruby Ridge and the debacle at Waco, which had just happened a few months before, if the government's next heroic exploit was to attack and murder a conservation worker in his own reserve to take over work that the government was too lazy and incompetent to do itself, that might look a little strange to the public.'' Seventy-two hours after he hung up the phone, Robinson told me, his Caesalpinia kavaiensis tree was dead. The implication was, he killed it. He felt sick about it, he added, but freedom comes first.
Now, Robinson explained, he and his brother were being threatened again. With monk seals flourishing in the main Hawaiian islands, environmental groups are pressuring the federal government to designate the water around Kauai and Niihau ''critical habitat'' for monk seals under the Endangered Species Act. It's an abstruse legal move that wouldn't directly affect most fishermen, but would subject the Navy to a review process that could ultimately force it to alter or even abandon its work there. This would cut off the income that has allowed the Robinsons to protect the seals' habitat in the first place. And so recently, in an uncharacteristic move, the brothers approached NOAA about including Niihau's coastline and near-shore waters in a national marine sanctuary instead. One of the Robinsons' central conditions would be to ban the Kauai fishermen. (A NOAA spokesman confirmed that the agency is in discussions with the family but that if the waters around Niihau ''are proposed for inclusion [in the sanctuary], NOAA will then embark, with the State of Hawaii, in a public process to consider any regulatory changes or restrictions.'' In February, during a trip through the Pacific, the director of NOAA's National Marine Sanctuaries system, Daniel Basta, visited the Robinsons on Niihau.)
As Robinson explained all this to me on Niihau, his sporadic bleats of indignation and alarm began to sound more nuanced. After all, in his eyes at least, our difficulty finding monk seals was the appalling proof of the damage those Kauai fishermen were doing, of how urgent the sanctuary deal had become. His panic was genuine, but I wondered whether this was why he allowed a journalist on his family's so-called Forbidden Island in the first place: not to see monk seals, but to not see monk seals.
''This place should be crawling with monk seals!'' Robinson said as we got out to explore one bluff. ''Something's awfully wrong here. Awfully wrong.''
Dana Rosendal, the pilot for the family's helicopter company, was unfazed. We'd covered only a quarter of the island, he told Robinson, and we'd already seen 10 seals.
''Dana,'' Robinson cut in, ''we've only seen five or six, plus one lousy turtle.''
Rosendal ticked off each sighting, then counted up his fingers. Ten, exactly.
''Well, whoop dee do!'' Robinson shot back. ''Ten seals!'' Then he stepped into the shallow tide, in his work boots and hard hat, and walked down the beach by himself. Suddenly, his island must have felt too crowded.
I spent my last morning in Hawaii at a coffee shop on Molokai, waiting for an anonymous monk-seal murderer to show up, or not show up, for an interview.
Molokai is the small island just to the west of Maui. It's a poor and rural place, defiantly resistant to large-scale tourism, with a single hotel and a higher percentage of native Hawaiians than any other island except Niihau. Monk-seal politics have been particularly fierce on Molokai, where unemployment is high and the rights of subsistence fishermen feel even more sacred. A local activist, Walter Ritte, described how elders on Molokai have fostered a feeling among the island's youth that monk seals are not actually Hawaiian and should be gotten rid of.
I met Ritte the previous week in Honolulu, where he was spending the day. He is soft-spoken and slight with a knotty beard and a fearsome reputation as an agitator. (Lately, he has been battling Monsanto, which grows genetically modified crops on Molokai.) On the monk-seal issue, however, Ritte has tried to be a voice of tolerance for the seals -- a native voice that can carry that message with more credibility than the government. Everyone knows him as ''Uncle'' Walter, a Hawaiian term of respect.
In Honolulu, Ritte told me that he knew who killed the first of the four monk seals in 2011 -- the big male on Molokai's southwestern shore. When he heard the news, he said, he made a point of finding out -- Ritte commands that sort of unofficial mayoral power on Molokai -- and went to speak with the person. By the time they were done talking, he said, ''I don't think that person was really happy with what they did. The remorse was really, really deep.''
I kept after Ritte while I was on Kauai the following week. The people I was meeting there were so angry and entrenched. It was comforting to know that at least one person -- the Kid, as Ritte referred to him -- seemed to have changed his mind on the issue. Eventually, Ritte called to say that the Kid agreed to have breakfast with me the following morning on Molokai. I flew over. But minutes before our meeting, the Kid called Ritte to back out.
I told Ritte I'd be at Coffees of Hawaii, reading a book, if the Kid changed his mind. Three hours later, for reasons I couldn't have imagined, he did.
The Kid was nothing like what I expected. He's in his mid-30s but projected such bashfulness that he seemed 10 or 15 years younger. He'd asked to meet on the porch of a more private location and, with Ritte looking on for support, he explained how, one day shortly after the incident, Uncle Walter simply knocked on his door unannounced and said, ''I want to talk to you about the seal.''
The Kid had mustered an enthusiastic defense. He told Ritte that he believed what the elders said: that monk seals didn't belong here and were upsetting the natural balance Hawaiians depended on. Ritte listened, then told him about his first experience with monk seals -- back in 2006, while Ritte was campaigning to stop a developer from building luxury housing on a remote Molokai coastline called Laau Point. Laau Point is a prime fishing and hunting ground, and Ritte and his troops believed that losing access to it would degrade Hawaiians' ability to provide for themselves, driving them and their traditions even closer to extinction. Hundreds of protesters occupied the point for three months, sleeping on the beach. And there, in the quiet, monk seals began to appear on the sand -- the first that some protesters had ever seen. Ritte told me that, sleeping side by side -- Hawaiians and Hawaiian monk seals -- it was just so clear to him: ''I was there for survival, and the seals were there for the same reason. I saw myself in the seals.''
''Uncle Walt is a well-respected man,'' the Kid now said. Ritte's appearance on his doorstep that day was itself a rebuke. So the Kid kept listening as Ritte explained that monk seals had actually lived in Hawaii long before Hawaiians did, and that Hawaiians -- a people who know displacement and disregard -- should feel kinship with the animals, rather than resentment. The seal was here first, and we have no right to push it out, Ritte told him. This hit the Kid hard; he still sounded crushed under the weight of this truth: ''I actually killed another Hawaiian,'' he told me.
Outside the Kid's house that day, Ritte hadn't actually asked him for any details. He didn't need to hear: the two sides of the monk-seal debate had become so predictable that it was easy for him to fill in the rest. When we first met, Ritte told me that the Kid was presumably ''doing what the elders had said. It was like killing a mongoose that ate his mother's chickens. I mean, he thought nothing of it.'' And now, I caught myself making the same assumptions. Until I asked.
The Kid seemed relieved to walk me through the story. He and his friends had hiked out to fish but kept finding monk seals at all their favorite spots. Finally, at one location, they encountered the 8-year-old bull, a huge animal with a deformed jaw, sprawled out as though it were waiting for them. One of the Kid's friends was fuming by now -- they'd walked so far -- and he goaded the Kid to do something. ''I guess it was out of anger, frustration,'' the Kid told me, ''and kind of like peer pressure.'' In retrospect, so much about what happened next surprised him: how impulsively he reached for a rock and threw it; how, though he only intended to scare the animal off and was standing a fair distance away, the rock somehow struck the seal squarely in the head, and some force inside the monk seal instantaneously shut off.
His friends clammed up. The Kid was the smallest, gentlest guy in the group, and ''that was the first time I ever did something like that,'' he said. At first, they assumed he only knocked the animal out. But eventually it sank in, and they steeled themselves and turned to walk home. ''Already,'' the Kid told me, ''it was eating me up.''
Later, a federal investigator told me that key details of the Kid's story were consistent with the necropsy report. (''The animal was hit on the head,'' he said. ''It was a blunt trauma to the head.'') A government scientist familiar with the case was more circumspect; he explained that it would be possible to kill a resting monk seal by throwing a very heavy rock -- maybe on impact, or more likely by causing internal bleeding -- but extremely difficult. Frankly, I don't know what happened. The Kid seemed so vulnerable that I believed his story on the spot. I've had moments of skepticism since then -- moments when I've wondered if, say, the Kid hadn't actually stood over the animal and dropped a 20-pound boulder on its head, and was now trying to distance himself from that act. But either way, he acted impulsively and now regretted what he had done.
It was only a few weeks after the incident that the second murdered monk seal was found on Molokai. ''Then after the second one,'' the Kid said, ''they had the one on Kauai, and I was thinking like, Oh, no, what did I start? Even Uncle Walter told me that it might have set off some kind of chain reaction.'' The Kid had never really been a churchgoer, he said, but recently his wife decided they ought to start. And a couple of weeks ago, he prayed about the monk seal for the first time. ''I kind of just prayed and asked for forgiveness,'' he explained. He wanted to come clean but worried his family would suffer if he did. ''I know what I had done was wrong, and I just basically asked Him for guidance,'' he said -- a safe way to confess. ''And lo and behold,'' the Kid told me, ''here you are.''
It was sad -- every bit of it, and in so many freakish ways. NOAA was focused on saving an endangered species by repairing the ecology around it. But more and more, the success of conservation projects relies on a shadow ecology of human emotion and perception, variables that do not operate in any scientifically predictable way. Looking back, I was astonished by how the pieces just kept snapping together, and stubbornly locking in place, in exactly the worst way: how, at the public hearings, the government's attempts to show respect and empathy were read as just more imperiousness; how reasonable the conspiracy theory about the monk seal's origins actually seemed in context; how the one safe place the monk seals had found was under erratic Robinsonian rule. There was so much terrible serendipity. The story of monk seals was pocked with black swans.
And now, here was the Kid: not the angry, musclebound fisherman that environmentalists tended to imagine when they pictured the monk-seal killers -- not even really a fisherman, it turned out. He'd gone fishing only twice that year, and the second time, when his companion started threatening a monk seal in the vicinity, the Kid said that he de-escalated the situation by telling his friend that NOAA now implanted tiny security cameras in the animals' eyes and would be watching them. He flashed a hang-loose sign at the seal's eyes and urged his friend to do the same -- to tell the bureaucrats hi. ''You should have seen the face on that one guy,'' he told me on the porch. ''So gullible.'' Then he paused a second and said, ''I wish I could be there for everybody, and tell them the same thing.''
The Kid wasn't technically a kid at all, and yet what he'd described felt like a classic coming-of-age story -- something out of a novel you'd read in middle school about a boy who, in a moment of recklessness, shoots a robin with his BB gun to impress his friends, then weeps over the corpse. Except it wasn't a robin; it was a federally endangered Hawaiian monk seal, and so, the Kid worried, his transgression had set off a killing spree. In fact, the night before we met on Molokai, news broke that a 7-month-old female seal had been found speared on an island off Oahu. It survived, and in a photograph that NOAA released, the animal stared into the camera with narrowing eyes, one prong of the metal fishing implement still stuck through her forehead. She looked like a guileless horse that had been ridden into battle and lanced.
In Hawaii, so many circumstances had knotted together to snare this species. In a way, they snared the Kid too. But he wouldn't allow himself to see it that way. At one point, he mentioned again that he only wanted to scare the monk seal away, not kill it, and I tried to say something sympathetic, lamenting his bad luck. He was quick to correct me: ''Mostly, bad decision,'' he said. ''Stupid decision. You got to accept what you did.''

HEADLINE: Away We Go

BYLINE: By DEBORAH NEEDLEMAN

 BODY:
Travel journalism often falls into one of two camps -- the highly didactic and servicey piece, ''go here, stay there, see that,'' or the long-winded narrative in which the writer has the experience and we are meant to be satisfied by the first-person blow-by-blow he or she has brought back for us: ''the road into town was dusty and unpaved and the driver kept getting lost.'' The former is best served up by the Internet on demand. (You can find all of our hotel and restaurant suggestions for the stories in this issue at tmagazine.com.) And the pure version of the latter is perhaps best left to brilliant writers who promise to reward you for coming along (Edith Wharton, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Evelyn Waugh, Jan Morris). There are of course also intellectual and cultural histories of locales, in which the writer seeks to tease out the influences -- historical, economic, social, stylistic, culinary and political -- that make the place uniquely what it is (V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin, Ryszard Kapuscinski). The type we favor at T is a hybrid of the three, in which great writing and personal narrative is done in the service of not just traipsing along with the writer who got to go on an amazing journey that we didn't, but of bringing you back a new understanding of a place that is enlightening and satisfying regardless of whether you ever plan to visit. 
And yet, if you do choose to go, we're there to guide you.
In this issue, Gideon Lewis-Kraus susses out the world of Airbnb, a travel phenomenon made possible by the Web, in which one can affordably stay in strangers' homes across the globe, bypassing the polar choices of the impersonal hotel room or the too-personal B&B. As you're dealing with real people and real abodes, not hospitality professionals and rooms spit polished by uniformed maids, there is a quirky, happenstance quality that makes for experiences that at times can be annoying and pretty weird, but also rather great, and even magical -- depending on your point of view.
In his Yes, Please column, Andrew O'Hagan expounds on the profound sensory pleasures of traveling solo, without dealing with others who might whinge at your proclivity to walk everywhere or force-march you to all the sights when you really just feel like sleeping in.
To support his life's work at the Roden Crater near Flagstaff, Ariz., the artist James Turrell does a fair number of private commissions around the world, on sites as diverse as glass houses in the desert and epic estates in the English countryside. Edward Helmore takes us on a vicarious visit to several of these open-to-the-heavens installations, and uncovers a fascinating dynamic between the artist and his patrons -- and a body of work as varied as the sky itself.
And finally, Adam Sachs profiles the strange and beautiful utopia that is Marin County, which happens to be populated by people defined by their liberal tolerance (so long as no one disagrees with them), their love of nature and open space (despite a serious case of nimbyism), and their defense of free speech (so long as no one is talking about where they live). Their contradictions mirror that of our writer's: ''I always sort of want to hate Marin,'' he says. Of course, ''I always fall in love and want to stay.''
Travel, and travel writing, should be able to open our minds -- and even to change them.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Move in the Right Direction

BYLINE: By MARGAUX LASKEY

 BODY:
Maria Consetta Taft and Todd Quentin Swanson were married Saturday at Barndiva, a restaurant in Healdsburg, Calif. Suzanne H. Woolsey, a Universal Life minister, officiated.
The bride, 36, and groom, 38, met in 2003 at Stanford, from which they each received an M.B.A. degree.
The bride is an owner of Goodman Taft, an art advisory firm in Cambridge, Mass.; she works in San Francisco. She graduated from Brown. 
She is a daughter of William H. Taft IV of Wakefield, R.I., and the late Julia Vadala Taft. The bride's father is of counsel and a retired partner in the Washington office of the New York law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. From 2001 to 2005, he was the legal adviser to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Her mother was the assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Program in New York. The bride is a stepdaughter of Judith Harkness Taft.
She is also a great-great-granddaughter of William Howard Taft, the 27th president and a chief justice of the United States, and a great-granddaughter of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
The groom works from San Francisco as an investor in natural-resource companies, including Xinergy, a coal company in Knoxville, Tenn., of which he is the chairman. He graduated from Iowa State.
He is a son of Sherry Enoch Swanson and John L. Swanson of Plymouth, Minn. The groom's mother is a college preparatory tutor. His father, who is retired, was the director of information technology for the American division of Syngenta, a Swiss seed and pesticide company, in Golden Valley, Minn.
The couple admired each other at Stanford and Mr. Swanson even told a classmate that Ms. Taft would be a great wife someday. But dating did not interest either of them at that point. Over the next several years, they saw each other on her business trips to New York, and he visited her in Hawaii.
They dated other people, but she was always in the back of his mind.
In 2009, Mr. Swanson told a mutual friend that he would like to spend more time with her. ''I planted the seed,'' Mr. Swanson said. ''Knowing that our friend wouldn't be able to help herself, and that she'd say something to Maria.'' The friend did say something, but Ms. Taft was nonplused. Mr. Swanson lived in New York; she in San Francisco: How would that work?
In October 2010, Mr. Swanson had temporarily moved to Miami when he heard ''Starry Eyed Surprise'' by Paul Oakenfold on the radio, a song that he first heard when Ms. Taft played it for him in Hawaii in 2005. He sent her a text.
Ms. Taft did not know that he was in Miami and said she was going there for Art Basel that December. They agreed to meet there. Then he told her that he was planning to move to San Francisco in a few months.
Both said that something felt different in Miami. ''It was like: 'Hi, nice to see you. Oh, this could be the beginning of something,' '' Ms. Taft said. When Mr. Swanson moved to San Francisco on Dec. 31, she picked him up at the airport. On New Year's Day, they decided to start dating.
''It seems like so many people these days fall into a relationship instead of decide to be in a relationship,'' Ms. Taft said. ''At our age, we said, 'Let's make a statement that we're really dating each other.' '' MARGAUX LASKEY

HEADLINE: Just Before Summer Tours, a Burst of New CDs

BYLINE: By ANDY LANGER. 
Andy Langer is the music columnist for Esquire and the afternoon D.J. at KGSR in Austin.

 BODY:
As the midpoint of 2013 approaches, an impressive array of high-profile releases from Texas artists has already emerged, highlighted by an octogenarian legend (Willie Nelson), a cult favorite (Iron and Wine), an embattled Dixie Chick (Natalie Maines) and a promising country starlet (Kacey Musgraves). Who's next? A Beyoncé album, still unscheduled, is somewhere on the horizon. But more immediately there is a robust selection of Texans releasing new music -- from hip-hop to country and indie rock to Top 40 -- in advance of the summer touring season.
Pure X 
Crawling Up the Stairs (out May 14)
THE STORY The genesis of this trippy Austin trio's sophomore album was rooted in real-life drama: Nate Grace, its guitarist and singer-songwriter, spent much of last year recuperating from a serious leg injury without insurance or a guarantee he would walk again. The result is a bleak and unsettling song cycle about pain and the healing process, both physical and emotional.
START HERE The atmospheric heartbreaker ''Thousand-Year-Old Child'' finds its way from delicate acoustic guitars to loud blasts of electric feedback and back again. At its core -- and arguably the core of the album itself -- is the line ''What am I doing with my life?''
Jason Boland and the Stragglers
Dark & Dirty Mile (May 14)
THE STORY Armed with a distinctive baritone and a catalog of songs you can two-step to, the Oklahoma-bred and Austin-based Mr. Boland has been a consistent favorite on the Red Dirt touring circuit. On album No. 7, he confirms that he is one of the country scene's most multidimensional songwriters, unfurling honky-tonk rave-ups, slices of slow-burn swing and tear-in-your-beer ballads.
START HERE On ''Electric Bill,'' traditional fiddle and pedal-steel belie a very modern love song about the economy and advanced government surveillance: ''When they need to take a closer look at what it means to love, they can watch with a drone from miles above.''
Demi Lovato
Demi (May 14)
THE STORY At 20, this Dallas-raised singer and ''X Factor'' judge's roller-coaster career arc -- from Disney Channel sensation to 2010 rehab graduate -- has routinely threatened to overshadow her music. Coming off the 2012 chart-topping single ''Give Your Heart A Break,'' she returns with a fourth album that somehow feels like a comeback effort, even though she never really fell off the pop-star radar.
START HERE The first single, ''Heart Attack,'' is an anthem about resisting love that alternates between bravado and vulnerability but is resolute in its message: she is happy to be a single lady without the ring.
George Strait
Love Is Everything (May 14)
THE STORY Now on Year 2 of the Cowboy Rides Away tour, his long goodbye from the road, Mr. Strait, the self-proclaimed ''king of country,'' returns with album No. 40 and three songs written with his son, Bubba Strait.
START HERE Although ''Give It All We Got Tonight'' has yet to crack the Top 10, Mr. Strait's label and fans have teamed up for the ''60 for 60'' campaign to make this lush, summery love song his 60th chart topper before his 61st birthday (May 18).
Fat Tony
New album (June 11)
THE STORY A three-time winner of the Houston Press Music Awards' best underground hip-hop artist title, this Nigerian-American's third full-length album brims with equal parts smarts and swagger. Like ''Rabdargab'' (2010) and the ''Double Dragon'' mixtape (2012), this is a collaboration with his go-to producer, Tom Cruz.
START HERE The frenetic ''Hood Party'' is a convincing bid for dance-floor play, but it is also an evenhanded meditation on gentrification that refers to the Houston Housing Authority's Cuney Homes and the upscale River Oaks neighborhood. The former Das Racist rapper Kool A. D. scores bonus points for a guest verse that name-drops Sufjan Stevens and the CNBC ''Mad Money'' host, Jim Cramer.
Bob Schneider
Burden of Proof ( June 11)
THE STORY On his 12th solo release since 1998, this prolific Austinite -- who has freely bounced among rock, Americana and X-rated funk -- tones it down a notch or three for a largely mellow collaboration with the Tosca String Quartet, the Austin classical ensemble. There are surprising stylistic nods to Leonard Cohen and Paul Simon, but Mr. Schneider is also still balancing the odd and perverse: the record features both a gorgeously straightforward reading of ''Tomorrow,'' from the musical ''Annie,'' and a double-entendre-laden love song with a title unfit to print.
START HERE There is nothing subtle about ''Unpromised Land,'' which finds Mr. Schneider shouting come-ons over crashing drums and loud guitars. It's a jarring outlier when considered in the context of the rest of the album, but it works well as a stand-alone: Mr. Schneider sounds confident navigating the tightrope between brash and melodic.

HEADLINE: China's Evolving 'Core Interests'

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Whenever China wants to identify the issues considered important enough to go to war over, it uses the term ''core interests.'' The phrase was once restricted to Taiwan, the island nation that China has threatened to forcibly unify with the mainland. About five years ago, Chinese leaders expanded the term to include Tibet and Xinjiang, two provinces with indigenous autonomy movements that Beijing has worked feverishly to control. 
Since then, Chinese officials have spoken more broadly about economic growth, territorial integrity and preserving the Communist system. But recently they narrowed their sights again, extending the term explicitly to the East China Sea, where Beijing and Tokyo are dangerously squabbling over some uninhabited islands. Top Chinese military officials first delivered the message to Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, when he visited Beijing last month. The next day, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, told reporters that ''the Diaoyu Islands are about sovereignty and territorial integrity. Of course it's China's core interest.''
This wording, with its threatening implications, is raising new tensions in a region already on edge over North Korea and several other maritime disputes, and it will make it harder to peacefully resolve the dispute over the islands, called Diaoyu in China, and Senkaku in Japan.
While Japan has held the islands for more than a century, China also claims title and has sent armed ships and planes from civilian maritime agencies to assert a presence around them. The waters adjacent to the islands are believed to hold oil and gas deposits.
To some extent, China is simply throwing its weight around, challenging the United States and its regional allies. On Wednesday and Thursday, Chinese state-run newspapers carried commentaries questioning Japan's sovereignty over the island of Okinawa, where about 25,000 American troops are based. Japan, whose wartime aggression against China and other countries still engenders animosity, has not helped. Last September, the government of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda provocatively bought three of the islands from their private owner.
The right-wing nationalists who took power in December may be equally unwilling to put Japan's past behind it, although the government of the new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, took a positive step on Tuesday when it said it would abide by official apologies that the country made two decades ago to victims of World War II. China and Japan have strong economic ties and are critical to regional stability. Both will lose if they stumble into war or otherwise cannot resolve this escalating dispute. Though efforts are under way to find a mutually face-saving solution, using loaded phrases like ''core interests'' to describe the islands only adds to the political and emotional sensitivities and will not advance that goal.
