HEADLINE: Poland Outcapitalisms America

 BODY:
In a stroke, Poland is about to create capitalism out of the rubble of socialism -- and to an extent unmatched in the West. In a breathtaking announcement, the Polish Government has proposed making every Pole a capitalist -- by handing over to 27 million adults majority ownership of 400 state-owned factories, representing 25 percent of the country's industrial sales.
In the U.S., few own much capital: the poorest half of all families owns a mere 3 percent of the nation's assets. Under the Government plan, Poland would create more capitalists, relatively, in six months than the U.S. has created in 200 years. 
 Turning over state-owned factories is a tricky task. The Polish Government can't easily sell them because there are no markets to establish fair values. Besides, the process would take decades and virtually no Pole has enough wealth to make a bid.
Nor would widespread giveaways work. If every Pole owned a fraction of each firm, none would own enough to exercise control. Diffuse ownership means, effectively, no ownership: the managers would be free to enrich themselves.
The Government's solution is to hand over 60 percent of the equity in each of 400 companies to about 20 investment funds. Ownership of the funds, in turn, would be handed over to every Pole over 18. Initially each adult would receive vouchers worth one share of each fund. The investment funds would be run by financial experts from the West and work much like Western-style mutual funds.
One more wrinkle: 33 percent of each company, out of the 60 percent, would be concentrated in just one investment fund. That would give this lead fund a stake in the financial health of the company, compelling it to tightly supervise management.
The upshot: Ownership is diffuse, but control is concentrated. That's astonishingly clever.
The balance of the firm would be owned by the state, with 30 percent, and workers, with 10 percent. Over time, investment funds would trade shares in companies, leading to a stock market where individuals could buy and sell shares on their own.
The plan works spectacularly -- on paper. But whether it will work in practice is impossible to say; nothing close has ever been tried. And there are obvious dangers. By concentrating control in a handful of investment funds, the Poles may be inviting them to act like cartels.
Indeed, Czechoslovakia is so afraid of cartels that it has drawn up a privatization plan that would use vouchers to sell firms directly to citizens. And Hungary, which has experimented with decentralized control for decades, will avoid vouchers altogether by selling off firms to the highest bidder, foreign or domestic.
The beauty of the Polish plan is that it would make every Pole a capitalist -- an ambition unmatched in the West. And to make sure the lofty achievement survives, the plan turns over control to financial experts until ordinary Poles learn to manage finances for themselves. That way naive investors won't be prey to knaves operating in competitive markets. Karl Marx promised workers of the world their rightful share. A capitalist overthrow is on the verge of delivering that promise.

HEADLINE: More Than a Parade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
With all the hoopla about Operation Desert Storm, it is an outrage that former service members may receive a maximum of only 13 weeks of unemployment insurance, while many other unemployed people are eligible for up to 26 weeks of benefits. 
 In 1981, Congress, at President Reagan's request, eliminated unemployment compensation for former service members, then restored the program to half what it was before. Further, these recipients must wait five weeks to receive a check, while everyone else waits a week at most.
In 1990, there were 132,860 initial claims of this kind. The number is likely to increase with the downsizing of the military. Congress is considering legislation to restore compensation for former service members to a 26-week maximum. This legislation should be enacted quickly, to give returning soldiers more than just a parade.

HEADLINE: 'India Is Now in a New Ball Game'

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 7

 BODY:
The Finance Minister of India says his impoverished nation has begun a fundamental shift in priorities that looks, for the first time, to South Korea and prosperous Southeast Asian nations as guiding economic symbols. For more than four decades, India's policies have been marked by suspicion of capitalism, the United States, foreign investment and trade.
"India is now in a new ball game," said Manmohan Singh, the newly appointed Minister of Finance, a self-effacing international economist who virtually acknowledges that he is seeking to lead a revolution. "Our country is now prepared for big changes and I think we can launch a process of changing the mind-sets of our people." 
 In an interview in his office last week, Mr. Singh said India hoped to attract "multinationals to look upon India as an opportunity for investment and an opportunity for profitable business."
 
Unthinkable in the Past
 Such comments by a senior Government official, no less the Finance Minister, would probably have been unthinkable in the 1970's and 1980's, when India viewed the West, and multinational corporations, as rapacious.
Mr. Singh said, essentially, that the nation's elite must forget their "ideological hangovers," because India has no viable option except to open its doors to the West as well as Asia to deal with the worst balance-of-payments crisis in the nation's history, a huge international debt, a plunging credit rating, 14 percent inflation and dwindling foreign exchange reserves.
At the edge of an economic crisis, India has urgently requested a multibillion-dollar loan from the International Monetary Fund.
In a series of sweeping moves in recent days, Mr. Singh has pledged to open India's doors to multinational companies, overhaul the crippling bureaucracy, scale down subsidies, accelerate trade and, perhaps most fundamental, turn India away from the socialist model that has traditionally guided its economic path.
 
A Second Devaluation
 On Wednesday, India devalued the rupee for the second time in three days, with Mr. Singh saying the Indian currency was finally at the appropriate level to maintain the competitiveness of the country's exports.
At this point, Mr. Singh exerts considerable muscle in the Government, partly because he has become the point man on economic policy, partly because of his candor and partly because of his reputation as a man without political or ideological baggage. But his critics say Mr. Singh's talk may not ultimately match his accomplishments, suggesting that he is politically naive and has failed to come to grips with the powerful realities of India's bureaucracy and business class, which have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
Mr. Singh, a thickly bespectacled 59-year-old former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, has held senior economic jobs with the Indian Government as well as the United Nations. He was an adviser to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who viewed American economic involvement with hostility.
 
Influence of the Soviets
 "The overall thinking of the economic profession of this country was greatly influenced by the Soviet model," Mr. Singh said. "With the collapse of the command economy of the Eastern European type, everybody is convinced that it is time for fresh thinking."
Mr. Singh said his travels, especially to Asia, left him "with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction about India's economic progress."
He said: "We have tremendous potential, a country of 850 million people, a vast domestic internal market; we have a tremendous reservoir of managerial, entrepreneurial and technological skills and our people, when they compete abroad, are second to none whether it's in terms of academic institutions or in terms of making money in the U.S. or U.K. Yet I found India has become increasingly marginalized.
 
'India Has to Wake Up'
 "There must be a deep examination of what has gone wrong. Why is it that South Korea is talked about? In 1960, South Korea had the same per-capita income as India. Today, South Korea's income is 10 times India's."
Other economies of Asia, including Indonesia, impressed Mr. Singh. "I got the message that India has to wake up," he said.
Foreign investment in India totals $100 million a year, of which $20 million comes from the United States.
"I would hope that this small trickle will turn into a flood," he said. "Japanese officials have already told Mr. Singh that Japan could invest $2 billion annually if India had the right policies."
But fundamental changes in the way India operates are a Herculean task, Mr. Singh acknowledged. Certainly the nation's crumbling public services, enormous poverty and illiteracy, mammoth bureaucracy, backwardness, social and caste systems and blurred ideology leave India almost locked in a cycle of economic despair. Politicians, within the Congress Party as well as the opposition, have voiced uneasiness, if not resentment, at the new Government's efforts.
And the labyrinthine bureaucracy has a vested interest in maintaining the blizzard of licensing that stirs considerable corruption. As Tavleen Singh, a colmunist in The Economic Times, wrote last week: "The trouble with our earlier finance ministers has been that they have made policies, even some very good ones, in the ivory towers without ever going into why the policies never seem to work on the ground. Has any finance minister gone into why an exporter still needs 200 signatures before he can export his first shipment?"
The Finance Minister said resistance on the part of the bureaucracy was possible. "I do not minimize the difficulties of the task," he said. "But I get the feeling that now is the time to do big things because most people now, in their heart of hearts, feel that the old habits of thinking have not yielded results."

HEADLINE: Court Choice Puts Nation's Racial Legacy on Table

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 7

 BODY:
It is 13 years since the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Allan Bakke that while public universities could not set strict racial quotas in admissions they could achieve diversity by considering the race of their applicants.
 "In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race," Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote in a separate opinion. It was a succinct and powerful statement of the rationale for affirmative action, the code words for policies intended to compensate blacks for their historical exclusion from the full range of economic and educational opportunities. That rationale still underlies as much of the Court's legacy in this area as has survived the erosion of the intervening years. 
But to Clarence Thomas, President Bush's Supreme Court nominee, taking account of race in government policy is itself the essence of racism, a harmful and constitutionally impermissible approach that demeans and discourages black achievement.
 
Thomas's View of Racism
 In his view, as expressed in speeches, articles and interviews over the last several years, racism is an enduring reality that American society is unlikely ever to "get beyond" in any event, and the Government can best serve racial minorities by treating all people equally.
 Judge Thomas has been forceful and articulate in this view. It brought the young black lawyer to the attention of the Reagan Administration, propelling him to the chairmanship of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to a Federal judgeship and to the threshold of the Supreme Court.
 His nomination brings the polarities in the country's view of affirmative action to the fore as the long-running debate over civil rights legislation has not really managed to do.
 While the legislative debate has often appeared to be mired in legal technicalities, this one promises to get back to principles, much as the battle over Robert H. Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court four years ago engaged the public in a debate over the constitutional dimensions of privacy. The question this time is the relationship between the country's racial past and its present, and the degree to which modern legal and constitutional understanding should reflect what has gone before.
 
Potential Court Role
 If Judge Thomas joins the Court, this abstract inquiry will very quickly take concrete form. The Court has agreed that in its next term it will decide two important cases involving the legacy of official segregation.
 His confirmation would put him in a position to influence a Court that is very much in flux on the full range of questions about public policy and race.
 One case to be argued in the fall, Freeman v. Pitts, involves a suburban Atlanta school district that was formerly segregated by law and has been under Federal court supervision since the 1960's.
 The other case, United States v. Mabus, concerns Mississippi's public university system, once segregated by law and and still essentially a dual system that is almost completely separated by race.
 In both cases, the issue is whether the government agencies in question have met their constitutional obligation to dismantle the legacy of segregation.
 The future of hundreds of public school systems in the South as well as the outlook for many historically black colleges will be shaped by what the Court decides.
 While the Court's current majority clearly wants to be able to return school systems to local control and to get Federal judges out of the business of administering local government institutions, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has lacked the votes to do so. Even after Justice William J. Brennan Jr. retired last year, there was a kind of deadlock as long as Justice Thurgood Marshall remained on the Court.
 
Affirmative Action Issues
 Several times in the last term, the Court denied review in cases presenting affirmative action questions that might have been vehicles for the Court to expand on its recent rulings in that area. The Court does not explain its refusal to hear a case, but a likely explanation is that Chief Justice Rehnquist could not be sure he would have the votes to accomplish the results he wanted.
 In short, there could not have been a more consequential moment for Justice Marshall to retire and for Judge Thomas to be in a position to succeed him. "The modern story of the Supreme Court has centrally been about race," Paul Gewirtz, a professor at Yale Law School, said in an interview.
 He added: "Race has also been the centerpiece of Thomas's public career. We know he is not simply another judge who is likely to move the Court in a conservative direction. His public career has stood for a set of ideas about race that have been at odds with the central story on the Court. He is engaged with this largest issue of American history in an utterly authentic and personal way."
 With the stakes so clear, the confirmation process is likely to be polarizing and divisive. But the intriguing question remains whether, assuming Judge Thomas is confirmed, his contribution to this debate as a Supreme Court Justice might not eventually help bring an end to the polarization over how to deal with the country's racial legacy.
 Equally intriguing is how Judge Thomas will come to terms, publicly and privately, with the richly ironic combination of politics and historical imperative that has brought him to this moment. His entire career has been spent arguing that race must be treated as irrelevant in government policy, yet its relevance to his selection Monday is beyond question.
 President Bush chose not to acknowledge the paradox, simply proclaiming his nominee the best possible choice, Judge Thomas himself will no doubt be pressed harder during his confirmation hearing, and he will no doubt have an eloquent response at the ready to explain the apparent contradiction between his life story and his life's work.
 The challenge, assuming he is confirmed, is whether he can reconcile the two in an approach to the law that contains both the intellectual rigor he prizes and the humanity that the Court and the country may need.

Innovations For M.B.A. Candidates

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
ABOUT a year ago, Scott S. Cowen, dean of the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, spoke about an innovative, even radical, new program at the school to be introduced that fall.
Under the program, as soon as they arrive, M.B.A. candidates take assessment tests to determine their writing and speaking ability and other skills. 
 The new program, five years in the making, came at a time when many business schools were revamping programs to meet the new influences on business -- the environment, ethics, internationalism, growing resentment of high executive compensation, to name a few.
At Case, in Cleveland, "we are moving from a teaching process to a learning process, a different emphasis," Dr. Cowen said in a telephone interview yesterday.
A year ago he spoke glowingly of the new assessment program to meet the needs of an ever more diversified group of students -- diversified because of different cultural and educational backgrounds and diversified in personalities and interests.
"Now we want to develop more skill modules for the course, one on computers, one on negotiating skills and one on interviewing, including even how to dress and act." Dr. Cowen said.
Dr. Cowen found new ideas such as the assessment program in unusual places. "We were inspired by Alverno College's innovative use of assessment in its liberal arts curriculum," he said.
Alverno, he explained, moved from the "brink of extinction" to being one of the five United States institutions most frequently cited by academic deans as having a successful general education program.
He described Alverno as a small women's liberal arts college, in Milwaukee, which assesses students so that they take courses that fill their educational needs -- an approach to handling diversity.
Another major change at Case, in addition to assessment, involves a reduction in the number of core, or required, courses, to 11 from 16, to make room for some additions.
Core courses have to be kept for an important reason, Dr. Cowen explained. "We have dual roles to fill," he said. "Students need the knowledge, skills and perspective of a general manager, but we must give them the flexibility to take a concentration in a particular area so they can get an entry-level job."
The 11 core courses provide students with a basic, homogeneous background on which to build more specific skills -- accounting, labor and human resources, management information, economics, finance, marketing, statistics, operations management, organizational behavior, policy and quantitative methods.
As for the new importance assigned by most schools to international aspects, he said: "We do it four ways. Almost every course has an international component. We offer international finance and other specialties as electives. We are developing semester exchange programs with Erasmus University, in the Netherlands, for example."
The fourth approach is through a new "perspective course" in global management, with faculty from the fields of religion, political science, history and economics. Dr. Cowen said most of the 300 M.B.A. students would take the course because they are required to take two out of three of the new perspective courses.
This fall the two remaining perspective courses will be introduced, technology management and industrial history. For the technology course the faculty will come from science departments, the engineering school, the medical school and the history department.
Students taking the industrial history course, Dr. Cowen said, will be formed into teams, each of which will focus on a specific industry, such as the auto, steel, or tire and rubber industries, along with newer areas like computers and the biomedical field.
Despite the popularity abroad of shorter M.B.A. programs such as the year program at Insead, in France, Dean Cowen said the Weatherhead school would keep the two-year format. "There is so much ground to cover, and we can't do it in a period as short as a year," he said.
At Case, the students see their dean in action almost as soon as they arrive on campus. He gives a half-day workshop on what he calls "value creation," using three short case studies that explore the role of individuals and companies in society.
The current agenda includes a case study on Donald J. Trump to discuss whether he is an American hero or nightmare. A second focuses on the Walt Disney Company and pay for performance, with discussion of high executive compensation, as well as the example of high management reward at Time Warner Inc., and the third case study considers the responsiblity, or lack of it, evinced by oil companies about price increases at the time Iraq invaded Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
On Approving Generic Drugs

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
IN a little-noticed move with broad implications for the $40 billion prescription drug industry, the Food and Drug Administration has started a debate on changing the way it approves generic versions of brand-name drugs.
Under one proposal, the maker of a brand-name drug would have to tell the agency more than it now does about what goes into its product. The F.D.A. would publish standards for the ingredients and for testing them. Years later, when a drug loses patent protection, other drug makers could refer to the publication, called a monograph, to speed F.D.A. approval of a low-priced generic version. 
 Generic-drug makers say they often face years of bureaucratic wrangling over the safety and effectiveness of their products, which mimic long-established drugs. "Now 10 different F.D.A. chemists review the same thing and come up with 10 different questions," said Harold Snyder, chairman of Biocraft Laboratories, a generic-drug maker based in Fair Lawn, N.J.
The leading drug companies have interests on both sides of the issue. At least two-thirds of generic sales dollars are generated by divisions of brand-name drug makers. But the biggest profits by far are in the brands, which sometimes retain as much as 40 percent of the market even after patents expire.
With much at stake for the companies, the monographs are certain to be debated on legal, economic and public policy grounds. But spokesmen for industry trade groups -- the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, representing brand-name drug makers, and the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association -- said the groups had not yet made up their minds about the issue. The F.D.A. Commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, is also proceeding with caution, buying time by naming a committee to study the pros and cons. For one thing, F.D.A. officials are said to disagree over whether the agency is empowered to require monographs without new legislation, which could open a Pandora's box of industry lobbying.
The proposals, which the F.D.A. published in the Federal Register on May 28, include suggestions by Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Subcommittee investigators found instances of generic-drug company employees bribing F.D.A. officials and submitting fraudulent test samples.
The agency said in the Register, "The lack of available information has created problems" for generic drug makers. It said a public monograph system might "streamline" the approval process, "help insure generic drug safety and effectiveness, and increase public confidence in generic drug products."
Even so, Hemant K. Shah, an independent securities analyst in Warren, N.J., said that "monographs would be a disaster for both the brandname and generic companies." He added, "If the F.D.A. told the generic companies how to make the drugs, the companies could not say 'my drug is better than the other drug.' "
Monographs with some information are already published by the United States Pharmacopeia, a private organization based in Rockville, Md. The Pharmacopeia leaves it up to the drug makers to designate and exclude "trade secrets," said Jerome A. Halperin, executive director of the Pharmacopeia, a drug reference publisher since 1820. He said the F.D.A. could require expanded versions of the Pharmacopeia's descriptions of ingredients and tests, which cover 90 percent of all drugs.
The Federal agency already uses monographs to approve antibiotics. The monographs describe the ingredients but do not provide a recipe for putting them together. Mr. Snyder at Biocraft said the F.D.A. formerly had a special unit that approved generic antibiotics speedily, but the unit was abolished and the process "slowed down."
After the fraud scandals, the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association last year created a committee that they said was intended to restore public confidence. The committee rejected the idea of F.D.A. monographs, saying it doubted that the agency's chemists would be competent to produce them. It suggested an alternative, which the F.D.A. says it is also considering: Several years before the expiration of patents on the largest-selling prescriptions, the F.D.A. would discuss generic versions with interested drug makers. Later, several generic versions would be approved on the same day, removing an incentive to cut corners to get lucrative rewards for being first to market.
Arguing against monographs, the generic industry committee said that brand-name drug makers might boobytrap the papers by inserting "unnecessarily narrow or restrictive criteria to discourage generic competition." But Mr. Snyder at Biocraft said: "There really aren't many secrets in the drug business. As far as manufacturing goes, if there is a secret, somebody will steal it."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops Amid Worries Over German Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined against most major currencies yesterday amid worries over German interest rates and a reduction of tensions in Yugoslavia.
Gold was slightly higher. 
 Dealers said traders were uncertain over whether the Bundesbank's policy-making council would move Thursday to raise German rates. The mark, like all currencies, would be supported by higher interest rates.
The German currency was also supported by apparent moves yesterday toward peace in Yugoslavia. In recent weeks the mark has been hurt by fears that the crisis could hurt Germany's economy.
The dollar fell to 1.8110 German marks in European dealings, down from 1.8336 late Friday. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.8058 marks, down from late Friday's 1.8265.
 
Yen Battered
 The yen, meanwhile, continued to be battered by news of Japan's securities scandal. The Finance Ministry suspended four brokerage houses from soliciting business from corporate clients for four days starting tomorrow. The Government also ordered them to stop compensating favored clients for stock market losses.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.48 yen, to a closing 138.75 yen, and it slid to 138.65 yen in European dealings. But in New York, the dollar edged up to 138.55 yen, from late Friday's 138.30.
Belal Khan, a corporate dealer for Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York, said the dollar was also undermined by a growing feeling that the economic recovery in the United States might be slower than expected. The sentiment came on the heels of Friday's Government report that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 7 percent in June.
In London, the British pound was higher, at $1.6275, compared with $1.6165 late Friday. The pound also gained in New York, where sterling fetched $1.6345, more expensive than late Friday's $1.6173.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late Friday, included: 1.5584 Swiss francs, down from 1.5745; 6.1325 French francs, down from 6.1840; 1,345.75 Italian lire, down from 1,358.00, and 1.14565 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14385.
On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold prices rose to $370.90 an ounce, up 70 cents from late Friday. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $370.20 an ounce, up 65 cents from late Friday.
In London, gold traded at $370.40 an ounce, up from late Friday's $370.00. In Zurich, the bid price was $370.15, up from $370.00 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 45 cents to close at $371.15.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Fell in May

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
Americans reined in their borrowing at a 1 percent annual rate in May -- the fifth pullback in six months -- because of a 14.1 percent plunge in automobile loans, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit fell by a seasonally adjusted $626 million after increasing at a 1.9 percent rate in April. The April gain, originally estimated at a 2.8 percent rate, was the first since installment credit advanced last November at a 4.5 percent rate. 
 Analysts attributed the decline to both consumer and lender caution, which they said could stall the economy's recovery.
Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, a Washington management consultant firm, said the consumer credit report suggested two things: that "consumers are still cautious, taking a wait-and-see attitude as to whether the economy really is recovering, and that lending institutions are not too willing to extend credit."
 
Consumer and Lender Caution
 "Putting both together -- consumer caution and lender caution -- suggests a real constraint on this turnaround," she said, adding that a sustained recovery would require both spending by consumers and lending by financial institutions.
Consumer credit includes all consumer loans except mortgages and home-equity debt. It helps finance much of overall consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
Analysts look to the consumer sector to lead the economy out of the recession.
Installment debt shrank at a six-tenths of 1 percent rate in December, the first dip since it inched down two-tenths of 1 percent in February 1989. And as the recession wore on, consumers continued to rein in their debt as their jobs and incomes became threatened.
Consumer credit fell at a rate of 3.7 percent in January, three-tenths of 1 percent in February and five-tenths of 1 percent in March. It was the first four-month stretch of declines since 1980, when credit controls were in place.
The automobile industry has been among the worst affected by the recession, and borrowing for new vehicles has not shown an increase since it posted a 3.6 percent gain in December.
In May, it was down a seasonally adjusted $3.3 billion despite industry reports that sales ticked up slightly that month. Auto loans had declined at a 4 percent annual rate in April.
"It says more people liquidated their old car loans than took out new ones," Ms. Shaber said. She said sales continued to improve in June, and the next consumer credit report should reflect new loans.
Despite their caution, consumers continued to use their credit cards in May. Revolving credit rose at a 7.7 percent rate, or a seasonally adjusted $1.5 billion, following a 6.3 percent advance a month earlier.

HEADLINE: 9 Republics Back Gorbachev in Summit Stance

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 8

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the backing of Boris N. Yeltsin and the leaders of eight other republics today for the case he will make to leaders of major industrial nations at their meeting in London next week.
Details of Mr. Gorbachev's presentation have not been made public. But the show of support from republics' leaders, with whom the President is negotiating a new union treaty -- and especially from Mr. Yeltsin, the politically powerful President of the Russian federated republic -- was intended to convince the Western leaders that Mr. Gorbachev will be speaking for at least a sizable portion of his country. 
 The common front was reached at a meeting at the village of Novo-Ogarevo outside Moscow, where the same leaders negotiated a truce in April, called the "nine-plus-one" agreement, that halted the struggle between the Kremlin and the republics and opened negotiations toward a new union treaty.
The main evening television news program, Vremya, showed a smiling Mr. Gorbachev bantering with Mr. Yeltsin and the other leaders in a spirit of camaraderie.
The six republics that have declared their independence of the Kremlin -- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia and Moldavia -- are not involved in the negotiations.
The leaders gathered in Novo-Ogarevo were those of Russia, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan and the five Central Asian republics. Since the "nine-plus-one" agreement was reached, they have been negotiating a new federation in which republics would play a determining role.
"We are united by the common responsibility that is at the basis of 'nine-plus-one,' a responsibility for the fate of the country, a responsibility to stabilize political life and emerge as quickly as possible from this profound and serious crisis," Mr. Gorbachev said.
Mr. Yeltsin declared that Mr. Gorbachev was heading for London "not only as a representative of the center, but as the representative of all nine republics, with their agreement."
"Here we demonstrated a common understanding that we can resolve all our problems, that we are one mighty economic market with a certain division of labor, that we are all interdependent," Mr. Gorbachev said. "All this was broadly discussed, and we understood that we must retain this market, that we must give it new breath, use the initiative of the people. These are weighty concerns, the decisions are grave, it cannot be minimized."
The negotiations over the new federation have run up against sharp disagreement between the republics and the Soviet Government on taxation. The republics demand a monopoly on taxation, which would guarantee them control over the purse strings. The Kremlin is seeking a dual system, in which it would have independent revenues.
The state of Soviet internal politics is one of the main criteria by which the heads of the seven industrial powers -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- are expected to assess Moscow's appeal for aid.
The broad strategy that has evolved among the seven is evidently to grant Moscow some immediate assistance, such as associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, but to link major aid to specific economic and political reforms. Mr. Gorbachev, for his part, may seek guarantees that reforms will generate specified amounts of aid.
The Soviet leader's presentation to the summit participants is expected to be based in part on a plan linking Soviet reforms with Western assistance that was worked out by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal economist, and a group of Harvard political scientists. He is also expected to draw on a less ambition program designed by his Prime Minister, Valentin S. Pavlov, who was with him today at Novo-Ogarevo. No details of Mr. Gorbachev's approach have been made public.

HEADLINE: NCNB Grows (but Profits Don't)

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 8

 BODY:
The NCNB Corporation's Hugh L. McColl Jr., hailed as a savvy regional banker who is reshaping the industry, has an impressive track record at invading and succeeding in new markets, but his record at generating profits in some of these conquests has been unimpressive lately.
The McColl formula is to buy banks, convert them to NCNB's aggressive sell-sell-sell sales culture and get the troops out there scrambling for market share. Along the way, profits can take a back seat for a while. 
 "Hugh McColl has proven that he's willing to sacrifice profitability for market share," said Alen R. Smith, president of Allen C. Ewing & Company, a brokerage in Tampa, Fla., that specializes in Southeastern banks. "But he wouldn't tolerate nonprofitability for a long time."
Aggressive selling and price cutting sometimes lead to bad loans. And bad loans eat into profits quickly. Last year, after two years of record profits, NCNB's earnings slipped for the first time since 1987, falling 18.2 percent, to $365.7 million. This year profits are still lagging, having fallen by 8.3 percent in the first quarter, to $128.4 million.
The problem is rising loan troubles in the two states where NCNB has operated for several years: Florida, where it was the first out-of-state bank to invade, in 1982, and in NCNB's home state of North Carolina.
By being an aggressive real estate lender in Florida, where it is now the third-largest bank, NCNB tried to gain ground on bigger rivals by offering easier credit terms. But recession and a real estate glut last year exposed the risks of such liberal lending policies.
Bad loans in Florida rose to a profit-draining 5.4 percent of NCNB's loans in the state at the end of March and caused a loss of $8.1 million in the unit last year. This year, the Florida division bounced back with a profit of $19 million in the first quarter, according to reports filed by Federal regulators. NCNB does not publicly report results of its banking operations by individual states.
In North Carolina, the loan portfolio has also taken its lumps. While Charlotte-based NCNB holds a bigger share of total deposits than its rivals, the Wachovia Corporation and the First Union Corporation, Mr. McColl, NCNB's chairman and chief executive, nearly doubled the loan-loss reserve for NCNB in the 12 months ended in March, to $309 million, because of growing problem loans. As a result, profits slumped at the North Carolina bank to $25.9 million in the first quarter, from $32 million a year ago.
Lately, according to Salomon Brothers, NCNB's profitability as measured by bankers and analysts slipped below the average for major regional banks last year, after NCNB had outpaced the group through the late 1980's.
 
Brighter Future Seen
 Kenneth D. Lewis, president of all non-corporate banking activities at NCNB, acknowledged in an interview today that NCNB's aggressive steps had pared its profitability compared with that of some rivals, but added that the benefits of the strategy would soon be apparent.
"When things settle down sometime during this decade, we're going to show that we can grind it out with the best of them," he said. "This is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Given all the things we've done, the record is rather remarkable."
Robert B. Albertson, senior banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, thinks NCNB has made the right moves. He said that while Mr. McColl is best known for leading NCNB's expansion beyond the Carolina borders, the 56-year-old former marine has assembled an organization that has proved masterful in wringing costs from merged banks. "That to me is the new wave of banking, not new products," Mr. Albertson said.
The company's bright spot has been its celebrated entrance in Texas in 1988, where it took over 40 failed banks of the First Republicbank Corporation with billions of dollars in Federal assistance. The prospering Texas unit, with half of NCNB's total assets of $66 billion, has been shielded from major losses so far by Mr. McColl's 1988 deal with Federal regulators.
NCNB requested and received a key ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that would allow losses piled up at the failed First Republicbank to provide a huge tax shelter for NCNB. The practical effect has been to reduce NCNB's taxes and increase profitability, giving it an invaluable edge over rivals that often find it difficult to match NCNB's terms for pricing new loans and other business. Last year, NCNB paid an unusually low tax rate of 16 percent on its income compared with an average of 34 percent for most banks.
Thomas H. Hanley, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, estimated that NCNB would pay little tax on its Texas profits through 1994 because of the more than $500 million it retains in unused tax benefits obtained from First Republicbank.
NCNB also has an unusually small portfolio of bad loans in Texas, thanks to an arrangement with Federal bank regulators that allowed NCNB to dump $8 billion in bad loans inherited from the First Republicbank into a separate "bad assets" unit that it manages at a profit for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
Merger Under Study
 Platoons of loan examiners from the C&S/Sovran Corporation will have to weigh all this as they examine NCNB's books to determine whether a combination of the two Southeastern banking companies will be profitable for them. One question is whether banking troubles in Florida and North Carolina will worsen this year or are about to abate, as NCNB executives maintain and many Wall Street analysts believe.
A gloomy report would give directors of C&S/Sovran one of the few practical reasons for rejecting NCNB's merger bid. C&S/Sovran, weakened by real estate loan troubles in the Washington area, would become part of a super-regional powerhouse in the Southeast and Texas by casting its lot with NCNB. Together, the bank, which Mr. McColl wants to rename Nationsbank, would be the second largest in the United States, with $116 billion in assets, behind Citicorp, which has $216 billion in assets.
Nationsbank would also be the dominant lender in North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Texas, and a major force in Florida.
But C&S/Sovran stockholders have been down the aisle before with not too pleasant memories. They saw the value of their shares plunge this spring after the merger of the Citizens & Southern Corporation, Georgia's biggest bank, and the Sovran Financial Corporation of Norfolk, Va. Executives at C&S/Sovran have cautioned that bad loans will continue to mount, and that a dividend cut is possible when C&S/Sovran's board meets on July 16.
Thus C&S/Sovran shareholders, including company directors, risk a falling market value again if NCNB's earnings tumble following a marriage of the two banking companies. Mr. McColl's initial terms apparently call for C&S/Sovran stockholders collectively to own 47 percent of NCNB following an exchange of three-fourths of a share in NCNB for each share of C&S/Sovran. Analysts say Mr. McColl might sweeten the deal to just under 50 percent of NCNB total shares.
 
Rise in Earnings Expected
 Most analysts doubt that NCNB will stumble in its effort to contain the loan troubles in Florida and North Carolina. "We believe the asset-quality deterioration will slow considerably in 1991," said Mr. Albertson of Goldman, Sachs. He added that a slowdown in problem loans should result in smaller increases in loss reserves and higher profits. Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers estimated that NCNB's earnings would rise by more than 13 percent next year.
NCNB established a troubled-asset division in the Southeast modeled after its Texas "bad assets" unit and stepped up its classifications of bad loans in the third quarter last year. Non-performing loans over all rose by 3 percent in the first quarter, to $759 million, the lowest percentage increase in five quarters.
But Charles W. Peabody, a bank analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York, is one critic of NCNB who believes that problem loans will rise in the second half of the year, and fester longer than the troubles at C&S/Sovran.
"Right now, C&S/Sovran is viewed as being more risky than NCNB" by investors, he said. "But that's the fickleness of the market. In the second half of this year, people will change their view of NCNB. There are still fundamental problems in their loan portfolio."
He said banks that compete with NCNB in the Southeast, like Suntrust, C&S/Sovran and First Union, have reported bigger increases than NCNB in bad construction loans this year, which Mr. Peabody said raised the question in his mind of whether NCNB had been slow in recognizing similar problems.
Mr. Lewis of NCNB would not rule out any increase in nonperforming loans later this year. But for now, he said, "the rate of increase in nonperformers has dramatically declined."

HEADLINE: Critics Fear Time Bombs In Dinkins Budget Tactics

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
In the scramble to limit the deep service cuts in New York City's $29 billion budget, the Dinkins administration found hundreds of millions in savings that will reduce costs now but increase the burden on future taxpayers.
Tucked away in the budget are plans to sell an $87 million city-owned mortgage on a middle-income apartment complex, even though city taxpayers will continue to pay off the bonds sold to build the project for years to come. And there are other plans: to refinance bonds to save $100 million in debt-service payments, to give bonuses to teachers who retire early, to sell assets including 1,000 city-owned apartments and to spend surplus cash in city-owned corporations.
 
Shifting Cost of Upkeep
 For example, when a painting crew descends on the Williamsburg Bridge in September for its first maintenance painting in years, it will mark the start of an ambitious new maintenance plan for the city's rusted and decayed bridges. But it will also mark the inauguration of a less-heralded city fiscal maneuver: the sale of bonds to pay for routine bridge work. 
 The $20 million bond sale will shift the cost of routine upkeep and building supplies from current taxpayers to future ones for the first time since the 1970's, when the city sold bonds to pay for textbooks.
"These kinds of practices -- bonding for bridge painting and the like -- are just what got New York City into trouble in the 1970's," said the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan. "The bucket of paint for the bridge used today will be paid for by taxpayers five years from now."
City budget officials say some of these maneuvers make economic sense when all the costs and savings are totaled, while others simply generate cash and avert the need for much deeper cuts amid a recession.
 
Fewer Budget Gimmicks
 And they say that with the city under intense scrutiny from bond-rating agencies this year, there are far fewer fiscal gimmicks than the $1 billion Mr. Regan counted in the last two years. They add that there are far fewer than found in the budgets of other state and local governments.
Why look at the city, asked Philip R. Michael, the budget director, when New York State used a panoply of gimmicks -- according to Mr. Regan, more than $2.7 billion in one-time revenues last year -- before it found itself in the midst of its own fiscal crisis?
"They sell highways and prisons in other places and throw them into the budget," Mr. Michael said. "We throw in these little crumbs and everybody comes down on us. We still budget better than anyplace else."
 
Disguising a Money Drain
 But many fiscal analysts say that the city's budgetary maneuvers can mean trouble in future years. Mr. Michael said he could not project the actual overall savings or costs of the maneuvers, but one thing is certain: When the city uses one-time revenues to balance the budget -- much like a homeowner who sells his car and furniture to pay his mortgage -- it temporarily disguises an imbalance between revenues and spending that will surface sooner or later.
That is precisely what happened to the city this year. A series of bond refinancings by the city in the late 1980's artificially reduced the city's debt-payment costs by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But the savings ended this year, forcing the city to cut spending or raise taxes by a like amount, just to pay the extra interest costs.
And in March, the staff of the state's Financial Control Board warned that the city faced a "structural imbalance" of more than $2 billion a year, in part because of such maneuvers, and said that the imbalance must be addressed before the city's fiscal troubles are over.
 
Early Retirees, Late Costs
 To avoid layoffs, the city developed an early-retirement program in which teachers who retired this year would receive higher pension payments. Because teachers hired to replace them would initially earn less than the retirees, the city would save $44.8 million this year if 2,800 teachers and administrators retired.
The program was carefully structured, officials said, to produce a theoretical savings over the life of the project, if the costs and savings all occurred this year, rather than over many years during which pensions are paid.
But in practice, all the savings will occur in the next three years, while costs of more than $2 million a year are projected to continue at least through the year 2012. Now city officials are saying that 3,486 teachers are requesting early retirement, while the teachers union puts the figure at 4,200, raising the costs and savings accordingly.
And city officials say that the program could be expanded to more than 150,000 other workers, in which case the costs could be far higher and theoretical savings nonexistent.
 
Cashing In a Mortgage
 Manhattan Plaza, the Federally subsidized development on 42d Street for artists and theater people, was born during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's. Now the city is seeking to sell its mortgage on the property to come up with cash in the middle of another crisis.
In 1975, after the city's fiscal problems forced it to default on its mortgage commitment to the developer, it came up with a plan to use Federal Section 8 housing money to pay for the project.
Now the $87 million, 8 percent city mortgage that was eventually issued is for sale for between $50 million and $70 million, officials said -- even though taxpayers will continue to pay principal and interest on the bonds sold to build the project for years to come.
Under state law, the city would have had to put at least $30 million of the sale price into an escrow fund, city officials said, to cover the cost of principal and interest due on the bonds.
But city officials, working quietly in the closing days of legislative session, won legislative approval for a two-year suspension of the law so that the $30 million could be used to pay part of the city's debt service this year on other projects, freeing up money for other spending.
The City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, raised questions about the measure, but in the end joined Mayor David N. Dinkins in supporting it to "assist the city with its short-term fiscal obligations," according to a memo she submitted to the Legislature.
 
Bonded Bridge Painting
 In 1971, as part of the scramble for cash that led to the fiscal crisis of 1975, the city convinced the Legislature to pass a measure permitting it to sell bonds of up to five years to pay for bridge painting. In a sign of the fiscal pressures of the times, the law was made retroactive to the previous year.
The practice was stopped in 1975, when the city's bonding practices came under attack. But while the laws authorizing bonding authority for school textbooks and vocational training were repealed, the bridge painting authorization remained on the books.
After issuing bonds for $4 million worth of painting last year under special circumstances -- only when it was part of major rehabilitation projects -- the city now plans to sell bonds to pay for $80 million in routine bridge painting over the next four years.
The city argues that the costs to it are less than they would be if the bridges eventually had to be rebuilt because of a lack of routine maintenance. "We will be painting 400 bridges over the next four years," said Joseph DePlasco. "The painting prolongs the life of the bridge."
 
Housing Money to Pay Bills
 The rehabilitation of scores of city-owned building shells for poor and homeless families was one of the city's success stories of the 1980's. Now budget officials have found away to cash in on it.
A thousand apartments, from Southern Boulevard in the Bronx to Madison Avenue in Manhattan, are to be sold for $66 million in Federal money to the New York City Housing Authority this year.
The housing authority, an independent agency, had been promised the Federal aid to build or renovate low-income housing. But it was stymied, officials said, by Federal rules that required it to build in mixed-income neighborhoods, where land was prohibitively expensive.
So far the city has sold $30 million in bonds to pay for the project, and under the amendment to the state finance law just passed by the Legislature, it plans to use this to meet current expenses, not pay off the bonds.
Since the city has not had time to sell bonds to cover the rest of the cost, the $36 million remaining would be used to reimburse the city for the cost of completing the renovation. One city official said if there had been time to sell the bonds, this too, would have been used for budget balancing.
Approval of the sale by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is pending.
 
Bonds to Pay for Interest
 When private developers put up an office tower, they include the cost of interest during construction when they figure the cost of the project. Why shouldn't New York City, budget officials ask?
City budgeters have included $50 million in budget savings this year and in the next few years from what they call capitalizing interest costs during construction of schools and other buildings: selling bonds to pay the interest incurred by the city during construction.
For example, if it took the city two years to build a $10 million school, the city would sell $11 million in bonds, including an extra $1 million to cover the cost of interest.
Since the city advances cash for its construction projects out of its regular tax collections, it would in effect, be paying interest to itself. The extra bond proceeds would go toward balancing the budget this year, but be paid off over the next decades.
In selling the bonds, New York will break ranks with most cities. Only Washington and one local government in Florida are known to have used it when selling general obligation bonds, city officials say.
Opponents of the measure -- City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman has so far blocked it -- say that a school is not an business, and that the city is not a businessman, making a precise calculaton of profit and loss. It is more like a homeowner, she says, who builds a house for his own purposes.
 
Bonds to Pay Off Bonds
 In the closing moments of the budget negotiations between the Mayor and the City Council, budget officials came up with a complicated bond-refinancing plan that they said could save the city $100 million this year.
The plan is intended to allow the city, which has little or no access to bond insurance, to sell $1 billion in insured bonds at rates far lower than the city now pays for its regular bonds. To do this, the city would sell other bonds to pay off insured bonds issued several years ago.
If the city's calculations are correct, this would save $100 million over the life of the bonds. And the refinancings would be structured so that the entire savings could be taken this year, officials said.
 
Lurking in the Shadows
 There are other one-time revenue measures and refinancings lurking in the shadows of the current budget.
Mayor Dinkins said he had hoped to get $350 million this year from a bond refinancing from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state agency set up during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's to sell bonds for the city.
But when Standard & Poor's suggested that the borrowing was a form of deficit financing and threatened to reduce the city's credit rating, the corporation backed off.
Under the plan, the corporation was to refinance $1 billion in bonds due over the next four years, so that they would be paid off between 1996 and 2008. This would save the city $1 billion over four years, but sharply increase the costs to city taxpayers after 1996.
And at the request of union leaders, the city is studying a plan to restructure the way it reimburses pension systems for unfunded liabilities, money the city owes the system from prior years.
Union leaders said the changes could save the city several hundred million dollars this year, but the city's chief actuary, Robert C. North, said it would increase the costs born by taxpayers in the next century.

 BODY:
The two newest Japanese luxury car divisions, the Nissan Motor Company's Infiniti and the Toyota Motor Corporation's Lexus, tied for the highest ranking in a consumer satisfaction survey for 1990 by J. D. Power & Associates, a leading automotive market research company.
The ranking is widely regarded as an unbiased assessment of how cars and trucks perform. Manufacturers with high quality ratings aggressively use the survey in advertising and marketing in the United States. The highest-rated American car line was the Cadillac, in eighth place in this year's listing. Mercedes-Benz was third, Acura and Honda tied for fourth, Toyota sixth and Audi seventh. The survey showed the Lexus and Infiniti divisions tied at the highest level of dealer and product satisfaction since the survey was created by J. D. Power in 1986.

HEADLINE: U.S. ARMS REQUEST BACKED BY MOSCOW

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had swiftly agreed to President Bush's request that he send his Foreign Minister to Washington this week in an effort to conclude a new nuclear arms treaty in time for signing at a summit meeting in Moscow in late July.
Arms analysts said that since Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev in a cable that he should not send Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh unless he was empowered to make the final deals needed to complete the treaty on long-range arms, the decision to send the Soviet team was probably the most positive signal yet that both leaders were finally serious about finishing the negotiations, which began in 1982.
 
'Plenty of Time'
 For the first time, Administration officials are also saying they really do believe that the talks should be able to conclude the treaty. 
"A lot depends on this meeting," Mr. Bush told reporters today, adding that there was "plenty of time" to complete the negotiations and still hold a summit meeting in Moscow by the end of July.
The Bush Administration, by holding up a full-scale summit meeting until the nuclear accord is completed, has been effectively saying to the Soviet leader that there will be no major breakthrough in other areas of United States-Soviet relations -- like economic aid -- until the treaty on long-range arms is completed.
While American officials insist that they have not promised the Soviets any more economic aid if the long-range arms treaty is finished next week, the mere fact of its completion would make it politically that much easier for the Bush Administration to justify whatever support it gives to the Soviet economy.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will meet for two hours in London on July 17, after the meeting of the leaders of the major industrial democracies.
A full-scale, two- or three-day summit meeting in Moscow had long been planned for the end of June, but it was repeatedly postponed because both sides insisted that it could take place only if they could sign the long-negotiated Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which would cut long-range nuclear arsenals by roughly 30 percent.
To speed the arms talks, the two leaders said they would hold a summit meeting in Moscow only after the treaty was done. But instead the treaty negotiations lagged and ended up putting all the other aspects of the relationship, including American economic help for Mr. Gorbachev's reforms, largely on hold.
 
'Starting to Become a Joke'
 "We made the Moscow summit contingent on finishing the treaty and we have postponed it now for so long it is starting to become a joke," said one Administration official. "We really can't get on with the rest of the relationship until this is done."
For the last two months the two sides have been trying to resolve the last three major issues holding up the treaty: how much missile test data to exchange, how to determine what constitutes new missiles that won't be covered by treaty limits, and how many warheads must be removed from each existing missile. Some progress has been made.
Ten days ago, a high-level American team of experts, carrying compromise proposals to overcome these differences, met with a team of Soviet experts in Geneva. The Soviet team, though, said it did not have the authority to accept any of the American proposals, and this is what prompted Mr. Bush's appeal to Mr. Gorbachev to send Mr. Bessmertnykh to Washington with the authority to make decisions on the spot, American officials said.
But there are other reasons for wanting to finish the treaty now. Mr. Bush and other American officials increasingly recognize that given Soviet economic and political turmoil, the potential for major disruptions in the United States-Soviet relationship is very high, officials said. They also said the instability in Yugoslavia is another source of uncertainty.
 
U.S. Officials See an Advantage
 American officials insist that the treaty is weighted to United States advantage because it requires the Soviet side to make big cuts in those areas, such as large land-based missiles, where they have numerical superiority, and requires the American side to make lighter cuts in their areas of superiority, such as air-launched and submarine-launched missiles.
These lopsided concessions were first made by Mr. Gorbachev four years ago when he was trying to persuade the West that the Soviets were no longer a threat, and he has been dragging his own military along ever since -- which is why so many American officials want to lock in the treaty before he loses his room for maneuver.
The Soviet leader, and to a lesser extent Mr. Bush, also want to be rid of the arms treaty because it is symbolic of the old Soviet-American agenda, which revolved mainly around arms control, and to get on with what officials call the new agenda, which revolves around broadening relations, economic ties and providing American assistance for a Soviet transition to political pluralism and market economics.
American experts say arms control is a useful vehicle for Mr. Gorbachev to achieve greater control over his military budget and military industrial complex.
Mr. Gorbachev informed the White House on Sunday through the Soviet Embassy in Washington that the delegation headed by Mr. Bessmertnykh will arrive on Wednesday evening.
The "good news" from today's announcement, said Richard R. Burt, who recently retired as the senior American arms negotiator, is that both President Bush and President Gorbachev have clearly made a political decision to finish the treaty. The bad news, he added, is that the endgame in such a negotiation is always a highly political phase, which makes agreement that much more difficult.

HEADLINE: Shock Lingers as Happy Land Trial Starts

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
An unemployed Cuban refugee went on trial in a Bronx courtroom yesterday, charged with committing the largest mass murder in American history: the arson fire that killed 87 people at the illegal Happy Land social club in the Bronx nearly 16 months ago.
Even before jury selection began yesterday, the judge agreed to admit into evidence three admissions made to the police by the defendant, 37-year-old Julio Gonzalez. 
 Mr. Gonzalez, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, is accused of starting the fire in a rage after he argued with a former girlfriend, who worked at the club, and was ejected by a bouncer.
The fire, set with a dollar's worth of gasoline, quickly engulfed the club and trapped its victims, who had gathered for an evening of drinking and dancing on the night of March 25, 1990. They could not escape from the crowded second floor, which had been been added on illegally and had no emergency exit. Only five people survived.
The owners of the Happy Land, at 1959 Southern Boulevard in the East Tremont section, had repeatedly ignored officials who cited the club for fire violations and ordered it closed. In the aftermath, officials closed scores of other illegal clubs around the city, many of them, like the Happy Land, sanctuaries for the city's growing Hispanic population.
 
Honduran Victims
 Fifty-nine of those who died at the Happy Land were from Honduras. And while the fire stunned the city and the nation for its circumstances and the sheer number of the victims, it cut its deepest swath through the heart of New York's Honduran community. Everyone, it seemed, knew or was related to someone who had died. In the months after the disaster -- as the case moved tortuously through pretrial proceedings -- the survivors and the friends and families of the victims waited with loneliness and frustration for the trial to begin.
At 12:45 P.M. yesterday, Mr. Gonzalez stood up from his seat in front of a large oak table in the fourth-floor courtroom in the Bronx County Courthouse, turned, and with a brief nod, faced 70 prospective jurors seated in the spectators' section. Mr. Gonzalez, who is being held without bail, has not denied that he started the fire, but has pleaded not guilty on the basis of a "lack of criminal responsibility because of mental disorder or defect."
In one statement to the police that was videotaped, Mr. Gonzalez said that after he was barred from the club, "I lost my mind," then bought gasoline, poured it over an entranceway and ignited it.
For relatives of the victims who came to the opening of the trial, the horror has remained vivid even as they became conditioned by time to their losses.
"I think about my father, how he was," said Maria Colon, the 14-year-old daughter of Ramon Colon, 40, who died in the fire. Surrounded by glaring television lights in the corridor outside the courtroom, the girl nervously answered reporters' questions, and her eyes filled with tears as she tried to talk about life without her father.
Jennie Dantzler, whose 31-year-old daughter, Natalie, died, said the sound of fire trucks still triggers painful memories, "and when I look at Natalie's daughter, I see my own daughter, so beautiful."
Justice Burton B. Roberts of the State Supreme Court denied a motion by the defense to suppress the three admissions made by Mr. Gonzalez, as well as physical evidence including sneakers with gasoline residue owned by the defendant.
In denying the motion, Justice Roberts ruled that the admissions had been made voluntarily and that the physical evidence had been seized properly. He said he would outline the legal reasoning for his decision in an opinion later in the trial.
 
Judge's Anger
 The first day of the trial was marked by repeated delays in bringing prospective jurors to the courtroom, logistical problems, and a blast of anger directed at the defense lawyer, Richard W. Berne, by Justice Roberts. He is the administrative judge of the Bronx, and has long been known for his florid style on the bench and before that as the Bronx District Attorney.
"I am not a martinet," Justice Roberts said after admonishing the lawyer, who had stepped out into the corridor during a wait for jurors. "You are not to try the case in the corridor," the judge said.
No jurors were seated yesterday, and jury selection is expected to take a week or more.
The case is likely to involve conflicting testimony by numerous expert witnesses about the state of mind of Mr. Gonzalez on the night of the fire.
 
Ex-Girlfriend Survived
 Mr. Berne and Eric Warner, the senior executive assistant district attorney who is in charge of the prosecution, did not elaborate on what witnesses they expected to call. However, the court-appointed defense lawyer said he had been to Cuba, apparently to investigate Mr. Gonzalez's background.
One probable witness is Lydia Feliciano, Mr. Gonzalez's former girlfriend, who escaped the fire. The prosecution contends that Mr. Gonzalez set fire to the club in an attempt to kill Ms. Feliciano, who was working as a coat-check attendant there.
Mr. Gonzalez, who has a full beard and was dressed yesterday in dungarees, a light blue shirt and a zippered navy blue and gray jacket, sat between his lawyer and a translator who rendered the court proceedings in Spanish.
Mr. Gonzalez faces a total of 178 counts, including two murder counts for each victim: one for acting with a depraved disregard for human life, and the other for felony murder -- death resulting during the commission of a felony, in this case arson. The other counts are arson and assault charges.
Mr. Gonzalez had been examined repeatedly by psychiatrists for both the defense and the prosecution.
Under an agreement worked out by the lawyers and Justice Roberts, if Mr. Berne abandons a psychiatric defense, the prosecutor will not be allowed to use information from its interviews as evidence.

HEADLINE: Bank Rules Gain Urgency After Collapse

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International may give added impetus to changes in bank supervision that regulators worldwide have talked about for years but have not yet put in place.
As more of B.C.C.I.'s operations were closed yesterday around the world, regulators from the central banks of the 10 leading industrial nations met in Basel, Switzerland, and began to assess what changes could be made in the wake of allegations of widespread fraud at the bank. 
 In London, a Treasury official said the Bank of England received an important tip about the problems in the bank from a new employee who came forward early in the year. [Page D6.]
B.C.C.I.'s speculation in the Treasury bond market -- on such a scale that it reportedly lost $500 million -- is a reminder that regulators in the United States and other countries do not have uniform standards for measuring or limiting the amount of risk a bank might assume in trading securities or foreign currencies. The authorities have said that part of B.C.C.I.'s fraud was an effort to cover up speculative losses.
"We have asked ourselves what lesson we can draw," said Jacques de Larosiere, head of the Bank of France and chairman of the Group of 10 regulators.
The official takeover of B.C.C.I. began on Friday in London and Luxembourg when banking authorities in each location said they had discovered a pattern of widespread fraud within the bank, which has operations in 69 countries.
E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said after the meeting in Basel that the existing system for measuring a bank's capital relative to its risk of loss from bad loans needed to be refined to include the risk of loss from trading activities.
Mr. Corrigan was named head of the Group of 10's bank regulatory committee yesterday. In the late 1980's, the committee developed a system requiring banks to hold capital equal to 8 percent of their assets, adjusted for risk, by 1992.
Mr. Corrigan said that system needed to be changed "to build in explicit allowances for market risks as it pertains to foreign exchange trading, debt securities and equities."
 
Regulators Act in Hong Kong
 In Hong Kong, the authorities closed B.C.C.I.'s local operation yesterday, after indicating on Friday that it would be allowed to remain open. The crown colony's banking commissioner, David Carse, explained that he was worried that there might be a run on the bank, although no such problem occurred on Saturday.
On Friday, Bank of England officials had indicated that they thought the operation in Hong Kong was well enough protected to remain open.
Operations were also closed or suspended in Tokyo, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Cyprus and in the special Shenzhen economic zone of China. For a third day, there was a run on the B.C.C.I. operation in Pakistan, but the bank was not closed. An operation also remained open in Thailand.
In addition, Swiss authorities did not close the Swiss operation of B.C.C.I., but the Swiss bank is under close supervision and cannot make payments to its parent company.
In Tokyo, the B.C.C.I. operation suspended its own operations on an order from Luxembourg, where one of the company's two main operations was established. (The other, in the Cayman Islands, was also closed.) Japan's Ministry of Finance said there was now no reason to freeze the assets and deposits of the bank.
The problems of supervising B.C.C.I., a privately owned bank, were far greater than a lack of knowledge about its trading. Until Bank of England officials obtained a report by B.C.C.I.'s auditor, the absence of a strong bank regulator in Luxembourg left regulators in other countries with little knowledge about the scope of the activities of the bank, its financial condition and its management policies.
 
Lack of Consolidated Review
 "The B.C.C.I. case provides an example of an institution not subject to consolidated review by any one regulator, which enhanced B.C.C.I.'s ability to carry out its operations without normal regulatory scrutiny," J. Virgil Mattingly Jr., general counsel of the Federal Reserve, said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing in May.
Mr. Mattingly was testifying about B.C.C.I.'s role, which was concealed from the Fed, in financing the purchase in the early 1980's of the Washington banking company now called First American Bankshares, as well as its purchase of smaller banks in California and Georgia.
The Fed is now convinced, Mr. Mattingly said, that legislation is needed to require that foreign banks obtain Fed approval for any new branch or office in the United States. The Fed should also have full authority to arrange for examinations of foreign banks and to obtain information to determine if American operations are complying with American laws.
Mr. Mattingly said stronger enforcement was needed because American regulators had been stymied by some banks' efforts to hide information by keeping it offshore.

HEADLINE: Kohl, in Shift, Is Reported to Favor Indirect Economic Aid to Moscow

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, July 8

 BODY:
As a result of his talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has decided against urging Western leaders to provide direct financial aid to the Soviet Union when they meet next week in London and instead will seek a consensus on granting Moscow some kind of "special status" that could lead to eventual assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, German officials say.
Faced with opposition from several Western governments to large-scale money grants to the Soviet Union, the Chancellor is instead hoping to win approval for the idea of indirect aid channelled through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Such aid is likely to be given only if the Soviets adopt sweeping economic reforms. 
 At the summit meeting of seven industrial democracies in London next week, Mr. Kohl is expected to urge that the Soviet Union be given "special status" membership in both financial institutions, and full membership as soon as possible. Mr. Gorbachev is flying to London to talk to the seven leaders at the close of their meeting.
In advance of this, Mr. Kohl, who has been the strongest advocate among Western leaders for aid to Moscow, flew to Kiev on Friday to confer with Mr. Gorbachev. With a week to go before the London meeting, diplomacy has intensified, with Mr. Kohl saying he planned to contact the other leaders -- from Britain, France, Italy, Canada, the United States and Japan -- to discuss the results of his talks.
Speaking to reporters aboard his return flight from Kiev, where he met with Mr. Gorbachev for nearly five hours, Mr. Kohl said he was optimistic that Western powers would support aid channeled through international agencies. He said he expected Mr. Gorbachev to present a reform program that would impress Western leaders.
"It would be foolish for the Western countries to sit back and calmly watch what happens in the Soviet Union," Mr. Kohl said in an interview with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
 
Political and Economic Issues
 In Kiev, the two discussed political as well as economic issues, people close to Mr. Kohl said. Both agreed that it was important for the Soviet Union to show that it was making progress on the "union treaty" that will redefine relationships between the central Government and the Soviet republics. In the absence of such a treaty, many foreign investors have been unwilling to launch projects in the Soviet Union because they do not know whether they should be negotiating with local authorities or federal agencies in Moscow.
Mr. Kohl told Mr. Gorbachev that if a union treaty could be concluded, and if the Soviet Union took other steps to attract investors, Moscow would not need long-term aid from abroad.
Another political problem that might have been an irritant between Germany and the Soviet Union was apparently resolved in Kiev. Mr. Gorbachev promised that Soviet troops would be withdrawn from eastern Germany on schedule, by 1994. He attributed reports that the withdrawal would be delayed to "outsiders," apparently referring to Soviet military officers.
The two leaders also drew up a list of projects in the Soviet Union where foreign aid could be well used. They included renovation of power plants, reconstruction of the Soviet rail network and construction of new oil and gas pipelines, which could help expand Soviet oil and gas exports, from which the country could earn large amounts of hard currency.
Because investor confidence in the Soviet Union is so low, these projects can only be financed with foreign aid or credits. German banks, for example, were last year willing to give loans to the Soviet Union if the Bonn Government guaranteed 80 percent of them, but they are now insisting on 100 percent guarantees.
"Everywhere there are growing doubts about the political and economic development of the Soviet Union," said Horst Kohler, a Finance Ministry official who is in charge of summit preparations for Mr. Kohl.

HEADLINE: Bush Sets Up Foundation to Start Model Schools

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
In a move he described as a milestone in the "educational revolution" he outlined in April, President Bush today announced the establishment of a foundation to foster the creation of model schools.
In a Rose Garden ceremony, Mr. Bush, who was accompanied by Education Secretary Lamar Alexander, introduced 18 business, education and political leaders as members of the board of the New American Schools Development Corporation, saying they would help "set aside stale preconceptions" about how schools should work and "seek nothing less than a new generation of schools." 
 Mr. Bush has said he hopes the private, nonprofit corporation will persuade businesses to donate as much as $200 million for the creation of 535 experimental schools intended to be models of reform for the nation. The schools, one in each Congressional district and two more for each state, are part of Mr. Bush's education legislation now being considered by Congress.
"We want to encourage and experiment," Mr. Bush said. "No one will conduct our educational revolution for us. We've got to do it ourselves. We've done enough hand-wringing about the state of our schools and now let's act."
The Rand Corporation's Institute on Education and Training will serve as the research arm for the new corporation. An advisory panel of educators is to assist the corporation.
Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey Governor and chairman of the corporation, said the group had already received $30 million in donations. Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher and former diplomat, is a member of the board and donated a $10 million "challenge" grant to encourage other corporations to help.
But with a recession, some companies that plan to contribute to the new program are cutting back on financial commitments to existing education projects.
The Exxon Corporation, for example, told Theodore R. Sizer, a professor of education at Brown University, that it would give him one year's worth of financial aid instead of the five years he had requested for his Coalition of Essential Schools, a nationwide group of schools that have been promoting innovative teaching and learning techniques.
Edward F. Ahnert, executive director of the Exxon Education Foundation, said, "We have not made a decision to cut back our longer-term funding but rather to review our long-term commitments to his program in the light of the New American School Program."
 Here is complete list of members of the board of the New American Schools Development Corporation.
 
Thomas H. Kean, president of Drew University and former Governor of New Jersey, chairman.
 
 W. Frank Blount, president of the Communications Products Group of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, president.
 
 Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of R. J .R. Nabisco, vice president.
 
 James K. Baker, chairman of Arvin Industries, vice president.
 
 Frank Shrontz, chairman of the Boeing Company, vice president.

HEADLINE: Oregon Peyote Law Leaves 1983 Defendant Unvindicated

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 8

 BODY:
As a drug and alcohol abuse counselor for American Indians in Oregon, Galen Black said he thought it was important to learn the ancient Indian art of spiritual healing. He took in sweat-lodge ceremonies and sun dances, and he even smoked the occasional pipe filled with sacred herbs.
Then one day in 1983, Mr. Black attended one of the most sacred healing rituals of all: As a guest, he and others ingested a small amount of peyote, a cactus containing the hallucinogen mescaline, in a ceremony of the Native American Church. 
 "My job required me to learn cultural-specific treatments," Mr. Black said. But his bosses at the Douglas County Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center disagreed and dismissed him, and Mr. Black's quest for vindication was ultimately denied by the United States Supreme Court.
Nevertheless, Mr. Black's legal battle has resulted in expanded religious rights for American Indians in the state. A new Oregon law, signed June 24 by Gov. Barbara Roberts, permits the sacramental use of peyote.
 
No Unemployment Benefits
 After telling of his experience, Mr. Black was dismissed by the center on charges of misconduct. Alfred Smith, an American Indian and a counselor who worked with Mr. Black, was also dismissed after admitting he had taken peyote.
The state did not seek criminal prosecution of the two men. But it said the men would be ineligible for unemployment compensation because under Oregon law, work-related misconduct can be the basis for denying such compensation. By 1990, the case went to the United States Supreme Court, which upheld the state's position.
Under the new law, Mr. Black and Mr. Smith, as guests, would still be subject to prosecution, while people practicing the religion would not.
Federal law and the laws of 23 states, including many with large Indian populations, exempt the sacramental use of peyote from criminal penalties. Idaho has a law permitting the use of peyote in "bona fide religious rites" of native American religious ceremonies.
While peyote is still illegal, the Oregon law provides a defense for people who use the hallucinogen in connection with "good faith practice of a religious belief."
The bill's chief sponsor, State Representative Jim Edmunson, a Eugene Democrat, said the new law was meant to counteract the Supreme Court's decision in April 1990. The Justices, voting 6 to 3, said state governments may prosecute those who use illegal drugs in religious ceremonies.
Opponents of the new law argue that peyote is a dangerous hallucinogen. State Representative Ron Sunseri, a Republican of Gresham, said he voted against the bill because it continued to allow the drug to be given to children and pregnant women in the sacred ceremony.
Though a lawyer for Mr. Black and Mr. Smith says there was no vindication of the actions of his clients, the men are relieved that the years of public scrutiny and court battles are finally over.
"It's all been traumatic for me," said Mr. Black, 43 years old, who lives in Cottage Grove, Ore., and who has spent about $10,000 on legal fees. "No one will hire me as a counselor, and I've had to take second-rate jobs. Several times after my job applications were declined, I knew they did so because of the scrutiny."
Mr. Smith, 71, now a freelance counselor in the Eugene area, specializing in Indian cultural affairs, said he was glad he endured the long fight.
"Over the years, I questioned whether the ceremony was worth losing my job over and being scrutinized by the nation," Mr. Smith said, referring to the religious ritual. "But I did nothing wrong. How could they tell me I was attending a drug party when the ceremony was one of the most sacred Native American ceremonies that has survived for thousands of years?"

HEADLINE: White House Called Ready to Lift Trade Sanctions on South Africa

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8

 BODY:
President Bush is likely to order the lifting or suspension of trade and financial sanctions against South Africa as soon as the middle of this week, a senior Administration official said today.
The State Department has concluded that South Africa has met or is in the process of meeting all five conditions specified in 1986 legislation for lifting the sanctions, the official said. And the State Department has recommended the sanctions be lifted, he added.
 
Early Action Seen
 "The President is reviewing it and will make an announcement about lifting the sanctions as early as midweek," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. 
 The United States Embassy in South Africa has concluded that the Government there has released enough political prisoners to satisfy the only condition that, according to the administration, had not already been met, the official said.
The President could still impose a temporary condition on the action, or may temporarily suspend the sanctions pending the actual release of all remaining political prisoners. But Administration officials felt that Mr. Bush was more likely to drop the sanctions.
The Administration's move, first reproted in The Washington Post's Tuesday issue, seems likely to meet surprisingly little opposition in Congress.
The shift in United States policy comes at a time when there is no more agreement on the effectiveness of the sanctions than when they were imposed in 1986.
Senator Richard Lugar, Indiana Republican and one of the architects of the sanctions, favors their removal. And a prominent Congressional opponent of any immediate removal conceded in an interview before word of Mr. Bush's intent to lift the sanctions that he did not have the support to block such a move.
"If the President does lift sanctions, I don't think we have the votes to override on either side, in the House or in the Senate," said Representative Edolphus Towns, the Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. The 26-member group has led an effort to introduce a more stringent basis for the sanctions.
 
Delaying End of Sanctions
 Mr. Towns said that while his group could not win on a vote to override, it would try to rally support in Congress to dissuade the President from taking action until recent political changes in South Africa have clearly become irrevocable.
If President Bush does act to lift the five-year-old sanctions, a reversal of the decision would require a majority vote in both houses within 30 days that not all the conditions had been met and that the sanctions should not be removed.
Administration officials have now concluded that South Africa has met the five conditions specified in the original legislation that authorized the sanctions. South Africa has lifted state of emergency regulations, ended bans on some political groups, given assurances that it will enter negotiations for a new system of government and abolished the legal foundations of the system of racial separation known as apartheid.
The last condition called for South Africa to release all political prisoners, but did not define closely just who qualified as such a prisoner. The United States Ambassador to South Africa, William Swing, reviewed South African compliance with this condition and determined that it had been met, said a State Department official who insisted on anonymity.
Mr. Lugar said that efforts to expand on the original conditions now were comparable to, "moving the goalposts."
But Mr. Towns said that his call for ensuring that change is irreversible in South Africa, "is not moving the goal posts, it's making sure the goalpost is up straight."
Much of the disagreement in Congress now on the sanctions reflects differences that have persisted for years over their effectiveness and purpose.
 
Prospects for Change
 Some experts on South Africa contend that freedom of political organization is limited while some opposition leaders remain in exile. They also note that discriminatory legislation remains on the books in South Africa, and say that even the recent repeal of major apartheid legislation may not bring immediate social change.
For example, the repeal of a law barring blacks from buying land in areas designated for whites will not result in an immediate change in the pattern of land ownership in South Africa because blacks there have limited financial resources and the process of land purchase takes time, said Phillip G. LeBel, the chairman of the economics faculty at Montclair State College in New Jersey and the director of the Center for Economic Research on Africa.
Nelson Mandela, who was elected president of the African National Congress last Friday, called for the sanctions to be maintained.
The sanctions barred most trade with South Africa, except for strategic minerals, and banned new investment there. The economic effect on both the United States and South Africa has been unclear, particularly because the sanctions coincided with strong public pressure and local laws in the United States aimed at forcing companies to shut down operations in South Africa.
According to a report last month by the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a non-profit group in Washington, the number of American companies doing business in South Africa has plummeted since the beginning of 1984, from 323 to 114. Mr. Lugar estimated that the trade and investment restrictions had depressed South Africa's entire economic output by 1 to 3 percent annually since the sanctions were put in place.
 
More Trade With Neighbors
 But the trade restrictions did not severely reduce South Africa's overseas commerce because other countries stepped in to take the place of the United States, said Michael D. Johns, a foreign policy analyst specializing in African issues at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. South African exports to its neighbors and the Soviet Union increased when the American market was closed to them, he said.
"They did adjust, to the extent they could, to develop markets elsewhere," Mr. Johns added.
At the same time, however, the sanctions have not been as painful for the United States economy as many people feared, Mr. LeBel said. Gold has lost much of its former role in international trade and finance, and this has made South Africa's production less important, he said.
Even more debated than the economic effectiveness of the sanctions has been their political role. Mr. Towns said that the sanctions had forced the various factions in South African politics to begin negotiating seriously with each other, and that these negotiations were less likely to continue if the sanctions were dropped.
President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa, "needs sanctions to keep people talking," Mr. Towns said. "The moment sanctions are lifted, I'm not sure he can keep people at the table."
Mr. Lugar said that Congress's action in 1986 had contributed to the release of Mr. Mandela from prison and other changes in South Africa, and may even have helped avert a civil war there. But he also contended that the spirit as well as the letter of the law imposing sanctions had been satisfied, and that Congress would support any move by President Bush to lift the sanctions.
Mr. Johns said that the effect of sanctions had been modest, and that their apparent success mostly reflected the fact that they were imposed at the same time that the Cold War was waning and Communism was in collapse. The severing of economic ties has eroded American influence in South Africa and made it difficult for United States policymakers to affect the rapid changes now taking place, he said.

HEADLINE: Russian Seeks U.S. Buyer For World's Biggest Rocket

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
DR. BORIS IVANOVICH GUBANOV is the designer of the world's most powerful rocket, a 20-story giant with eight engines that can hurl more into orbit in one stroke than 100 small launchings did at the start of the space age.
He is also a salesman, forced by circumstance to wander the globe with a battered suitcase, trying to drum up business. 
 His timing could be auspicious. As the Western powers prepare for an economic summit later this month, and debate how to help the Soviet Union, they may conclude that the best way to help is to buy its products. And services like those of Dr. Gubanov are among that country's few competitive goods.
At 61, the gray-haired Soviet scientist shows little unease over his predicament. He smiles effortlessly, sipping coffee and speaking with pride of his rocket and with reluctance of the Soviet Union's economic ills that are gnawing at his program.
Planned firings of his rocket, known as Energia, have repeatedly been delayed "because of difficulties in my country," he said last week during a New York visit.
His rocket had its debut in 1987, thundering from central Asia into the night sky atop a huge column of red flame, its engines strong enough to lift 100 tons of payload. But Energia has flown only once since then, in 1988, when it launched the Soviet space shuttle on its maiden voyage. The rocket's next flight is set for 1992. But Western experts say economic crisis in the Soviet Union could cause the program to be canceled.
"We have spent a lot of money," Dr. Gubanov said with a sigh. "We have very powerful rockets. The tragedy is that we go very slow."
His goal in the West is to sell launching services or rocket engines or nearly anything else related to space in order to generate revenue for his beleaguered country and keep production lines open for his rocket. Dr. Gubanov recently spent two weeks in the United States to address a rocketry conference and talk with Western companies and space experts about the possibility of joint programs and business deals.
 To some analysts, the solicitations of such a high official indicate a new level of desperation in the Soviet space program -- and perhaps a new opportunity for the West.
With the end of the cold war, Western experts have increasingly called for cooperative space ventures. Last month a Stanford University study suggested that an Energia-based effort between East and West could put people on Mars for $60 billion rather than the $400 billion to $500 billion estimated by the space agency.
"The Energia is the only way to go to Mars soon and at a reasonable cost," said Dr. Bruce Lusignan, a Stanford engineer who directed the study. "There's nothing that we currently have that can do it."
The White House welcomed the study, saying it enriched the mix of Mars options. Moreover, some private experts say the moment is ripe for a major East-West endeavor.
"We're talking about giving them all this economic aid," said Chris Faranetta, an official at the Space Studies Institute in Princeton, N.J., a private group that promotes space exploration and is trying to help Dr. Gubanov market his rocket. "Energia could be the payback. This is what they have to offer."
The notion of a Soviet bailout by the West, once dismissed as a waste of money, has risen in respectability and could well be the top issue at the London economic summit meeting later this month.
But skeptics say a payback with Energia, however appealing in theory, is extremely unlikely in practice.
"The Soviets are too naive to realize that we spend aerospace money in our own country as a matter of policy," said James E. Oberg, the author of "Red Star in Orbit" and an expert on the Soviet space program.
"We want to enhance our own industrial capacity," he said. "It's not in the cards that we're going to realign our whole program to foster their political stability, even though it's probably the most rational thing to do."
Starting around 1987, the Soviet space program, once wrapped in extreme secrecy, began a crash effort to sell a diverse line of goods and services to all who had the money. The blitz was complete with slick brochures and managers eager to cut deals, offering everything from launching services and communications satellites to space photographs that rivaled those from spy satellites.
But the effort was stymied by Soviet inexperience and by political resistance in the West. The United States banned the launching of most of its payloads atop Russian rockets, ostensibly for reasons of security. With the deepening economic crisis in the Soviet Union, however, officials there have redoubled the push, most recently with the campaign of Dr. Gubanov.
He carries considerable weight as a prominent official at the height of his career after four decades in the inner sanctum of Soviet rocketry.
Born in Leningrad on March 14, 1930, he studied at the Aviation Institute in Kazan and in 1953 joined the secretive Yangel Design Bureau (later renamed the Yuzhnoye Bureau) in the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk, near the Black Sea. Yangel was a nerve center of the cold war, devising many of the missiles that threatened the West with nuclear annihilation, including the SS-4, the SS-7, the SS-9, the SS-18 and the SS-24. The fearsome SS-18, dubbed "Satan" in the West, can deliver 10 or more nuclear warheads with great precision half way around the world. Its abolition has long been the principal goal of American arms negotiators. The SS-24 is a new, solid-fueled missile similar to the American MX that is based in underground silos and on trains.
Dr. Gubanov rose rapidly through the ranks at Yangel, helping design several weapons and variations of them to loft military and scientific satellites into space.
Never, Dr. Gubanov said in an interview, has he witnessed the launching of one of his creations. Instead he always monitored their performance from the safety of a bunker.
 
Fueled by Liquid Hydrogen
 In 1982 he left the military bureau to become chief designer of the Energia, working in Kaliningrad outside Moscow. The pinnacle of his career came on Nov. 15, 1988, he said, when Energia flawlessly lifted the Soviet space shuttle Buran into space. He was technical director of the overall endeavor.
"For every rocket man," he said, "the first flight of his child is very, very important."
Designed to loft both shuttles and unmanned cargo craft, Energia is the first launcher in the Soviet Union to burn liquid hydrogen, a high-energy fuel crucial for boosting heavy payloads. The rocket's four main engines burn liquid hydrogen, and its four strap-on rockets use room-temperature kerosene, which is about half as efficient. A similar arrangement was used on America's moon rocket, the Saturn 5.
Speaking two weeks ago at a rocket conference in California sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a professional group based in Washington, Dr. Gubanov outlined how Energia's elements could be rearranged to boost or lessen its power. For instance, it could be configured with eight strap-on booster rockets to hurl 200 tons of payload into orbit. So, too, he said, a cut-down version known as Energia M with only two strap-on boosters could loft payloads up to 35 tons.
In an interview, Dr. Gubanov sketched a range of possible East-West ventures that might use Energia, including the lofting of huge solar-power satellites to beam energy to Earth, the building of NASA's space station and the mounting of manned expeditions to the Moon and Mars.
"The young people will hate us for not making a decision to go to Mars," he said. "To have on our planet this technology, and not use it for all the countries, is not good. Everybody should get together."
Dr. Gubanov dismissed Western speculation that the Energia program might be canceled if no international clients were found, saying a more likely outcome would be a reduction of program size to focus on smaller vehicles such as Energia M.
Dr. Gubanov has pitched his wares at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the group most likely to employ his services. But NASA has shown little interest.
The agency, struggling to develop its own heavy-lift launcher and advanced technologies, has shied away from all but minor cooperation with the Soviets. A key question, officials say, is whether the Soviet Union is politically stable enough for long-term teamwork, which in the case of a Mars mission would go on for decades.
"It's premature to think of a joint Mars program, given the uncertainties over the budget, the technology and need to re-establish our working relationship with them," said Debbie Rahn, a spokeswoman at NASA headquarters in Washington.
Samuel W. Keller, NASA's associate deputy administrator, said of the West's use of Energia: "If we already had 10 years of cooperation with the Soviets, you might come up with a different answer than you would today," adding that "supplier reliability" was a key issue.
But other experts say shifting political winds might tip the balance more rapidly. Aviation Week & Space Technology, a respected industry publication, said in its current issue that the Federal Government was preparing a plan in which Soviet astronauts would ride aboard the American space shuttle in exchange for a Soviet launching of American astronauts to the Mir space station. The plan, it said, might be made public during the summit meeting later this summer between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
Some experts foresee a possibility, however slim, of an East-West accord in the near future that might include the use of Energia.
"As a political decision, it would make a great deal of sense," said Dr. Jerry Grey, head of science and technology policy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. "But as an engineer, I'd hate to carry it out. Just matching up payloads to the rocket would not be easy. Everything has to be compatible. All things considered, it's hard to see this as a realistic alternative."

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Little-Known Doctor Who Found New Use For Common Aspirin

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
DOCTORS have long tried to find new uses for old drugs, and in this quest centuries may pass before someone discovers hidden benefits in standard medications. Yet even when important new uses are found, it may be decades before the benefits are confirmed and widely recommended.
A case in point is aspirin, which is one of the oldest and most commonly used drugs. In a new use documented only in recent years, aspirin is now recommended for millions of Americans who are at risk for the prevention and treatment of heart attacks and strokes. 
 And only in recent weeks has the modern generation of doctors begun to appreciate that the new use derives from observations made by Dr. Lawrence L. Craven, a general practitioner in Glendale, Calif., more than 40 years ago. Dr. Craven noted an unusual incidence of bleeding complications among children who chewed gum containing aspirin to relieve the pain from a tonsillectomy.
Probably no other new use for an old drug took longer to discover, has had a greater impact on public health, and has had as fascinating a history.
The history of aspirin and related compounds can be traced to two Greek physicians, Hippocrates, who lived from 460 to 377 B.C., and Galen, who lived from 130 to 200 A.D. These physicians recommended that their patients treat a variety of ailments by chewing willow bark, which contains salicylic acid, a close chemical cousin of aspirin.
Aspirin, which is acetyl salicylic acid, was first synthesized in the 19th century, but it lay dormant on the shelves of the Bayer Company in Germany until it began to be used in a few patients just before the turn of the century. But no one seems to have seen aspirin's potential against heart attacks and strokes until Dr. Craven began his studies in the late 1940's, according to an article in the June issue of The Archives of Internal Medicine by the journal's editor, Dr. James E. Dalen, of the University of Arizona in Tucson.
One reason such a link could not have come much earlier is that doctors began to diagnose heart attacks in patients who lived through them only after 1912. Before then, nonfatal heart attacks were passed off as indigestion, gallbladder attacks or other problems.
Little is known about Dr. Craven, who was a graduate of the University of Minnesota medical school.
The crux of his discovery was his observation of the bleeding among children who chewed aspirin gum after tonsillectomies. Noting reports that aspirin affected blood's ability to clot, he inferred that aspirin would be safer than dicumarol, an anti-coagulant that doctors had begun prescribing for heart attack patients in the 1940's.
Dr. Craven recommended an aspirin a day for healthy men between the ages of 45 and 65, particularly those who were overweight and led sedentary lives. He made the same recommendation for people who had recovered from heart attacks.
His advice was based on studies of nearly 8,000 patients. He reported the studies, from 1950 to 1956, in obscure medical publications, including the Mississippi Valley Medical Journal. Dr. Craven was astonished by his own findings: no detectable cases of heart attacks and strokes among those studied.
It was a time when the statistical techniques used in modern clinical trials were just being pioneered, and Dr. Craven was aware that he lacked a comparison group. Before he died in 1957 at the age of 74 from angina, a year after publication of his final article, Dr. Craven invited others to test his thesis with more sophisticated techniques. Larger studies did come, but it took more than a decade for them to start.
The reasons for the delay are not clear but they partly reflect the tendency of scientists to insist on understanding the biological mechanism for a treatment before studying it.
 Dr. Craven's reports help refute the dogma that discoveries come only from full-time scientists working at research institutions and demonstrate that inquisitive doctors can do research in any setting.
But observations alone are not enough to change medical practice because they may be wrong and may have resulted from unrelated and confounding factors. Also, therapies based simply on observation may turn out to be more hazardous than beneficial.
Paradoxically, aspirin poses risks of bleeding that can cause strokes, and aspirin can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms. But studies have shown the benefits generally outweigh the risks.
Although Dr. Craven noticed the bleeding that his tonsillectomy patients suffered, many doctors overlook similar clues that abound in everyday medical practice.
Doctors do detect many other clues, but they usually do not take the next steps of reporting the observation and starting studies to document the effect. Those are the crucial steps that help distinguish the gadfly from the true scientist.
The link between rubella (German measles) and birth defects is among the crucial findings that astute practitioners have made. In 1941, by studying a small cluster of cases in Australia, Dr. N. M. Gregg first noted that the rubella virus could cause cataracts, deafness, heart deformities and mental retardation. Until then, doctors considered rubella another harmless childhood disease.
Medical dogma holds that many discoveries result from taking observations made by clinicians at the bedside into the laboratory. There, by seeking the biological mechanisms and explanations for the observations, researchers come up with new therapies that are then brought back to the bedside for testing.
Although that process appears to have been at play in the recognition of aspirin as a treatment against heart attacks and strokes, the lack of credit to Dr. Craven is striking. A spot check of several pioneering studies of the aspirin link found none that credited Dr. Craven, although his papers were included in the standard international index of medical reports.
The omission possibly reflects a well-known bias of scientists in research centers to overlook contributions from practitioners, despite the dogma that advances often come from observations at the bedside.
Another factor that may have contributed to the delay in confirming Dr. Craven's findings is the economics of the drug industry. Because the patent on aspirin had long expired, experts say that drug companies had less incentive to push research on its benefits than they would on a new drug that they could have sold at a much higher price.
To help overcome the problem, Dr. Silvio Garattini, who heads the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, Italy, a non-profit pharmacology center that says it is independent of the drug industry, has recently suggested that drug companies be issued new patents for finding important new uses for old drugs.
Practitioners who make what they believe are important observations must still persuade editors of medical journals to publish the findings.
Dr. Dalen, the editor of The Archives of Internal Medicine, which is published by the American Medical Association, said in an interview that he did not know whether Dr. Craven's reports had been rejected by more prominent medical journals. Dr. Dalen said he wondered whether wider publication might have led to quicker confirmation and postponed the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans from heart attacks and strokes.
Yet Dr. Dalen said he was uncertain whether he would have published Dr. Craven's article if it had been submitted to his journal. The journal rejects most of the 500 letters it receives from doctors each year, Dr. Dalen said, adding that "every time I reject one that relates to a proposed therapy, I wonder if it is one that should lead to further studies."

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Big Belmont Weekend Lacks Proper Crowd

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
They tried hard to get you to go to the race track in New York over the Fourth of July weekend.
They imported champion horses. They staged landmark races. They matched Meadow Star against Lite Light in the battle of the royal fillies. They printed 25,000 lapel buttons bearing pictures of the fillies looking like politicians. They even matched their owners like heavyweight contenders in newspaper ads, Carl Icahn against M.C. Hammer, the financier against the rap singer. They even had the Hammer dancing in the aisles en route to the winner's circle. 
 But they didn't have many people watching.
On the final day of the long holiday weekend at Belmont Park, the horses were strutting in the paddock before the Dwyer Stakes, which has been run for three-quarters of a century and has been won by Man o' War, Gallant Fox, Johnstown, Whirlaway, Damascus and a herd of other champions. And one of New York's prominent horsemen, who owns a champion himself, looked around the elegant but tranquil scene and asked: "Where are the people?"
"I know where they were," said Gerry Lawrence, executive vice president of the New York Racing Association. "They were on the New York Thruway. I was driving down from Saratoga on Sunday, and the Thruway was jammed with all those people who weren't at the track."
Lawrence was allowing himself a bit of gallows humor. But he conceded that the question of the lost multitudes has been asked for years in racing circles, and lately with increasing urgency.
Horse racing is a betting sport, but you no longer have to go to the race track to bet. You can do it from the offtrack betting shop next to your corner drugstore, or from your favorite casino, or from a plush lounge that's wired into the track, or even by telephone from your home, office or Mercedes.
So, you can bet and also go to the beach or to the family barbecue, which may be what people were doing when this particular holiday weekend opened Thursday at Belmont with the Suburban Handicap, the 105th running of a classic race won last year by Easy Goer, the toast of the town. On the grounds: 18,664 people.
On Saturday, they offered the show-stopper: Meadow Star against Lite Light, the return match between the top fillies, with Icahn and his $150,000 on the line against Hammer and his $200,000. And there was the Hammer stripping off his shiny aquamarine leather shirt and dancing for joy when Lite Light won by seven lengths, reversing the famous photo finish of a month ago. On the grounds: 17,472 people.
Hammer draws more than that for a concert, without his horse. The Yankees drew 11,000 more than that into Yankee Stadium the same day for their game against the Baltimore Orioles. The St. Louis Cardinals, playing in a city about one tenth the size of New York, drew 30,000 more than that for their game against the Chicago Cubs.
On Sunday, they rang down the curtain on Belmont's weekend with the Dwyer Stakes, a headline race that featured Fly So Free, last year's champion 2-year-old colt and the favorite in this year's Kentucky Derby. He ran third before 14,304 spectators.
"For years racing was recession-proof," Lawrence said. "People always came out to get rich quick. Now they've got casinos and lotteries where you can get rich quick.
"I also think, with this economy, that people are changing their recreation habits, even their vacation habits. People who used to go away for two weeks may now be taking day trips. And the day they take it may be the Fourth of July. We're looking at a changing pattern."
But when you race Meadow Star against Lite Light and bill it as the battle of the ages, where do the people go?
"If they want to place a bet," Lawrence said, "they may go to their OTB parlor and skip the drive to Belmont, the bridge tolls, the traffic. In that sense, our business is gaining: People are betting more money. But we still have to find a way to draw more of them to the race track, whether they bet or not. We have to find a way to make it more entertaining."
More entertaining than Meadow Star against Lite Light? Well, it took them two minutes to run the mile and a quarter Saturday. So, maybe you have to offer more. One month earlier, the Belmont Stakes featured Hansel and Strike the Gold and Best Pal, and it was preceded by four other stakes races with stars like Fly So Free and Farma Way and Festin and Jolie's Halo. On the grounds: 51,766.
But you can't run blockbusters every day, so racing is left with its changing patterns. The omens are there: The 12 largest betting days at New York race tracks all were recorded since 1980. The 12 largest crowds at New York race tracks all were counted before 1980.
They can't all be stuck on the Thruway.

HEADLINE: $2 to Enrich Democracy

 BODY:
Democracy is priceless but running for President is costly. Representative Al Swift of Washington offers a sensible way to pay for both -- a $2 increase in the taxpayer checkoff for Presidential campaigns.
Public funding was an urgent necessity when Congress adopted it in 1974. President Nixon's scandal-ridden 1972 campaign had debased private fund-raising; the integrity of the Presidency was in tatters. To protect that integrity now, it is just as urgent that the Federal campaign fund be rescued from running dry. 
 The 1974 law had a fundamental flaw, unnoticed at the time. The fund pays out more each time for campaigns and party conventions, to offset inflation. But there is no parallel provision for increasing the fund's income.
Taxpayers feed the fund $1 each time they check the "Yes" box at the top of their Federal tax returns. Lately that has been bringing in about $33 million a year. If the checkoff had been indexed for inflation, the fund would now be brimming. As it is, there may not be enough money to fully finance next year's campaign, and there definitely won't be enough for 1996.
Running out of money is not the only threat to Presidential campaign financing. Congress must also plug the loophole that lets sewer money gush into the national campaign -- indirect contributions to Presidential candidates via state party organizations. But in a session where President Bush and his party have dug in to block the expansion of public financing to Congressional campaigns, it is particularly important that the existing Presidential fund not be wiped out.
Representative Swift, chairman of the House Elections Subcommittee, would replenish the fund by raising the checkoff to $3 and indexing it in the future. His sound bill would also allot funds to primary candidates before the parties get money for their conventions -- not afterward, as the law now provides.
Finally, and most urgently, the bill would undo a recent Treasury Department decision that shortchanges next year's primaries. The Treasury plans to count only money on hand on Dec. 31 in setting 1992 allocations. Mr. Swift would also count checkoffs at tax time next spring, when people will be paying more attention to the elections.
Public financing's opponents, mostly Republican, contend that the fund is a flop, noting that two out of three taxpayers check the "No" box. But the 33 million taxpayers who checked "Yes" in 1988 constituted nearly half the 69 million who voted for President.
The Presidential fund has collected and distributed $500 million for the four elections since 1974. That's half a billion of campaign financing with no special-interest strings. Far from being a flop, it's a clear win for the public interest.

HEADLINE: Some Housing Is Better Than None

 BODY:
Andrew Cuomo, founder of HELP for the homeless, wants to build affordable housing on East 13th Street in Manhattan. He has a detailed plan that qualifies for available public funds and has won community backing. Ordinarily, it doesn't make sense to build subsidized housing on prime Manhattan real estate. But this plan warrants approval by the Dinkins administration.
Generally, the city is better off selling valuable property and using the proceeds and the taxes to build more low-income housing on less costly land. That's what the Koch administration tried to do with this city-owned site that runs from 13th to 14th Streets, between the old Luchow's restaurant and the Palladium. But the city failed to sell it even when the economy was booming. It has been occupied by a parking lot and vacant buildings since the early 80's. 
 Mr. Cuomo proposes using city and state housing funds to build 100 apartments, with support services, on the 13th Street side of the property -- 50 for homeless families, 50 for the working poor. The city could still make money by selling the 14th Street side for commercial development.
The Housing Authority chairman, Laura Blackburne, has talked of building 200 apartments on the property but it's not clear where the money would come from. And because her idea calls for more density, it would require a time-consuming zoning change that would probably attract opposition.
In healthier times, the city would be wise to try selling the site for the highest price. But waiting for the economy to rebound means depriving people who need housing now. One hundred families could soon be living on East 13th Street if City Hall backs Andrew Cuomo's sensible plan.

Let 'Em Eat Photo Ops

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
Washington's serenity is amazing. What do these Bush people take? They'd faint if offered pills or smoke, and you can't get Peruna anymore unless you know somebody with a great cellar. So how do they manage to stay way out in space treating the wrack and ruin with this magnificently cool indifference?
 Whole states are going broke, cities bankrupt, booming unemployment -- boy, there's a dull word -- and Washington's response? Jim dandy, double-peachy photo ops: President at Mount Rushmore. President at good, old-fashioned, salt-of-earth, Middle Western Fourth of July parade. President saluting heroes of gulf war. President setting up 10-second spots for next year's Monster Battle of TV Commercials, a.k.a. the 1992 Presidential campaign.
 
 Should the Feds do something about the wrack and ruin? Sure, but you can bet this crowd won't. They hate domestic problems. Press them about people sleeping in the streets or 34 million Americans without medical care, and they talk public-relations cant about "points of light."
 Besides, refusing to concede that domestic problems should concern them is justified by the wisdom of the philosopher Reagan. "Government is the problem," he declared. George ("Read My Lips") Bush hews faithfully to this Gipperesque principle, and with sound reason.
 It was Federal government that led the states, cities and counties into the present pickle. They used to get back a lot of the money their voters sent to Washington. Then, obedient to Reagan philosophy ("Government is the problem"), Washington adopted a new policy. Basically, it said, "Your buck stops here."
 The theory was that once you sent your buck to Washington, it became a government buck. And since government was the problem, terrible things would result if any fragment of this tainted money got back to its source. People would get hooked on good schools, fancy police work, clean water and such.
 The government buck had to be disinfected, as it were, to prevent it from infesting the country. So it was sent to the Pentagon, which used it to buy goods for countries like Panama and Iraq, where its evil effects wouldn't matter much, since they needed to be taught a lesson anyhow.
 Still the problem that government had caused long before Reagan made everyone see the light was gnawing at the national vitals. States, cities, towns, counties had become dangerously accustomed to getting their tainted bucks passed back.
 So when Washington said, "The buck stops here, for your own good," the states, the cities, the towns and the counties were not altogether sincere when they said, "Mighty art thou, O Gipper and O Bush, and we thank thee for not burdening us with the terrible problem-causing buck which we have rendered unto thee."
 (All right, governments don't speak such language, but wouldn't they be more lovable if they did?)
 Why were they not altogether sincere? Because if the buck stopped in Washington, they couldn't replace it with the buck necessary to keep state, city, town and county voters contented unless they raised state, city, town or county taxes. Disaster! Because Reagan and Bush, preaching hellfire against evil government, had persuaded people that tax-raisers must be destroyed.
 The states et al. had to avoid raising taxes without cutting services taxpayers demanded. In short, they had to pass a miracle once Washington, having decided that domestic governance was bad for people, got out of the business and turned it over to states, cities, towns and counties.
 The end of all this is predictable: Hordes of governors, mayors and county supervisors will be voted out of business in 1992. At the same time the usual 95 to 98 percent of Congress and President Bush will enjoy re-election, on ground that by doing nothing about the wrack and ruin they are saving us from that awful government that is the problem.
 All right, much of this is ham-handed irony. I don't apologize. Stating some of the truly silly arguments conservatives invoke to explain why "government is the problem," such as the theory that welfare breeds unemployment, would make me indictable for high-school sarcasm.
 In Washington there are people who believe such stuff, those cool, cool, serenely re-electable Washington cats.

HEADLINE: Teaching American History Without Blinders

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Arguing About America" (news analysis, June 21), on "One Nation, Many Peoples," the blueprint presented to the New York State Education Commissioner for revising how United States history is taught, misunderstands the argument. 
 The goal is not simply to edify ethnic groups or diversify the curriculum. Nor is it the old mythmaking with a new complexion. It seeks to understand both slaveholders and enslaved people, lynch victims and lynch mobs, women and men, working people and employers, the rich, the poor and how all of these relationships are interconnected to American culture, the economy, politics, power and tradition. The intention is not to add more color to the painting, but to revise the painting altogether.
As early as 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois showed that African-Americans were not peripheral, but central to the history of the Civil War. More recently, such historians as Nell Irvin Painter, Eric Foner, Vincent Harding, David Roediger and Sylvia Frey have written compelling narratives that call into question any efforts to write or teach American history without seriously considering the centrality of women, people of color and working people. Thus, while the proposed revision of the curriculum might be regarded as radical, it is not new.
When you argue that "the peddlers and shoemakers . . . seldom demanded that their cultures be taught in the school curriculum," you miss a fundamental point about the relationship between race and power. Even partial cultural assimilation into that social construction called white America benefited those who had the proper skin qualifications; people of color, no matter how much they sounded or acted like mainstream Americans, could not escape their appearance. Besides, how many eighth- or ninth-generation German or French descendants know or even care about their European heritage?
By sidestepping questions of race and power, and by ignoring history altogether, you and several dissenting members of the report panel blame people of color for failing to pass down their own traditions. But the poorly funded, overcrowded black schools of the segregated South taught African-American history in one form or another, and so did many black parents and community institutions. Indeed, historical lessons were frequently inscribed in culture, from folklore and toasts, to quilts and biblical interpretations.
But through most of the 20th century African-Americans, especially in the urban North, also tried to broaden the scope of public school curriculums through organizations such as the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, founded in 1915 by the historian Carter G. Woodson, the originator of Black History Month. These efforts were intended to teach the entire country that the contributions of African-Americans to the United States and the world make them deserving of full citizenship and equality. With racism and sexism on the rise again, this argument has an oddly compelling resonance.
In the end, the issues are too important for those engaged in the debate to obscure genuine efforts toward historical corrective with rhetorical slogans such as "political correctness."
As the historian Nathan Huggins once wrote, "The problem for Afro-American and women's history is that they are so essential to American history that it is perverse to think of it without them. A white American history and a male history ought to be, common sense tells us, unthinkable."

HEADLINE: How Japan Feels About the Persian Gulf

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leslie H. Gelb, in "Whining, Excuses, Hysteria," an otherwise rational column on United States-Japan relations (June 23), makes a totally erroneous statement about the policies of Ronald Reagan's Presidency. Mr. Gelb contends that the United States is telling Japan "to go on a consumer binge and increase government deficits, or, in effect, to adopt the self-destructive polices of the Reagan Administration." 
 The policies of President Reagan reduced tax rates so that consumers would have more control over how their hard-earned money was to be spent, but it certainly never advocated or encouraged binges. Rather, it provided sound fiscal policies that benefited all Americans during the longest peacetime economic expansion in modern history.
Likewise, increasing deficits was neither the objective nor the outcome of Reagan policies. It was the failure of Congress to cooperate with the Administration in a bipartisan effort to control the growth of Federal spending that led to significant deficits -- a pattern that occurred both before and after Ronald Reagan's tenure in office.
It is unfortunate that a sound analysis of Japanese-bashing should be tarnished by such a transparent and unfair attempt to bash a successful President.

HEADLINE: Apple Growers Bruised and Bitter After Alar Scare

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 5

 BODY:
Four generations of the Bernath family tended a small apple farm in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains, surviving drought, winter cold and the vagaries of the market. Last month, a bank foreclosed on them, forcing the Bernaths to give up their 54 acres and move to the city.
What brought them down, they say, was the most unlikely of storms. The Bernaths awoke one morning two years ago to hear that apples, the very embodiment of healthy food, were being called potentially cancerous if sprayed with Alar, a chemical that regulates growth. 
 The Bernaths had never used Alar, but that did not spare them from the panic that plunged apple prices so low the family could not meet its monthly payments. Many scientists, while acknowledging studies that indicate Alar could cause cancer, have since concluded that because the risk is so low and because fewer than 15 percent of apples were sprayed with Alar, the Alar crisis was greatly overblown. But farmers from upstate New York to Michigan to the Pacific Northwest are still wondering what hit them.
 
Growers Sue Alar Critics
 They may yet find out, if a lawsuit filed in a state court in Yakima County ever goes to trial. Angered by what they say was an orchestrated scare, apple growers here have filed suit against the Natural Resources Defense Council, the nonprofit environmental group whose analysis led to the news storm; Fenton Communications, a public relations company hired by the council to direct the news campaign, and the CBS News program "60 Minutes," which broadcast an illustration of a skull and crossbones over an apple in its report on Alar.
The farmers have charged them with product disparagement, an injury that lawyers from both sides say could be extremely hard to prove. And while the lawsuit may hinge on issues of free speech, it has raised questions about food scares, which have buffeted American consumers in recent years with numbing regularity.
Alar, (pronounced AL-lahr) trade name for daminozide, a chemical used to keep fruit firm and full-colored beyond its natural shelf life, has not been used since 1989, when growers voluntarily stopped using it in the face of a public outcry. Growers say their work is somewhat harder and labor costs higher, but the price of apples and the size of the crop have recovered to the levels common before the Alar scare.
Alar's journey from orchard to broadcast notoriety to courtroom tells much about the public's attempt to understand which chemicals constitute a true health hazard in the food supply. Faced with conflicting scientific reports, consumers are subject to "scare of the week" stories by environmental groups and self-serving reports made by the chemical industry, said people on both sides of the issue.
"Until we have some better way to weigh the risks of these things, there's always going be another Alar scare," said Dr. Joseph D. Rosen, a professor of food science at Rutgers University, whose study, "Much Ado About Alar," appeared in the fall 1990 issue of Issues in Science and Technology, the official journal of the National Academy of Sciences. He concluded, "There was never any legitimate scientific study to justify the Alar scare."
Even Dr. Rosen, who was among the critics challenging a Federal ban on Alar as an overreaction, acknowledges that the scientific debate has shifted little in the more than two years since the "60 Minutes" report. Experts who say Alar poses some risk of cancer still hold that view; others, who have doubts about the way cancer risk is assessed, still seek to emphasize those doubts.
CBS executives will not comment on specifics because of the pending lawsuit, but they say their broadcast was a fair and accurate rendering of an issue with widespread public interest. And officials of the Natural Resources Defense Council, while expressing regret that the Alar outcry may have hurt some farmers, say the Government is to blame for not doing a better job of regulating pesticides and other food chemicals.
"We didn't set out to hurt apple farmers," said Frances Beinecke, deputy director of the group. "The original report was about pesticides in more than 20 kinds of food. What happened was, the media simplified it and focused on apples. We are concerned and not happy about the consequences to those growers who were hurt."
Although there are no precise figures on how many farmers may have been forced out of business by the Alar scare, or how much other factors like bad weather and poor-quality fruit contributed to the losses, the United States Department of Agriculture said Washington apple growers lost at least $125 million in the six months after the initial uproar. The Washington growers produce about 60 percent of the nation's apple crop.
 
Regaining Consumers' Trust
 Jim Clements, who has a 300-acre apple orchard in central Washington, says the panic over Alar broke a bond of trust between farmers and consumers. The growers' lawsuit, seen as a chance to present the farmers' case, is attracting support around the country.
"The whole farming community is behind us," said Mr. Clements. "Pesticides, what we put in our food, deserve scrutiny. But we got hit with a knockout punch, and the result was that many innocent people went under."
Of all the foods that have come under scrutiny in recent years, few have attracted as much attention or emotion as apples. Production and consumption of apples more than doubled over the last two decades as the fruit was touted as a perfect snack, low in calories, high in natural sugar. Since the early 1970's, a small percentage -- no more than 15 percent and down to 5 percent in 1988, according to Government estimates -- of apples were sprayed with Alar, made by Uniroyal Chemical Company, based in Middlebury, Conn.
In 1973, a private study found that lab mice fed very high doses of Alar developed tumors. The report triggered a review by the Environmental Protection Agency, which noted errors in scientific procedure and said the data were not sufficient to justify banning Alar.
 
Inconclusive Tests, but a Ban
 That study and a follow-up used doses for mice that were 35,000 times the highest estimate of the daily intake by schoolchildren, considered the group to be most at risk. Of course, all cancer studies are done at levels well beyond human intake. But the Alar tests went beyond the environmental agency's threshold for studies, Dr. Rosen said.
The Government asked Uniroyal to provide other studies, which showed similar results at very high doses. By law, the E.P.A. must ban use of any chemical that could cause more than one cancer case per million people over a lifetime. Extrapolating from the high-dosage studies, the agency said Alar posed a cancer threat to 50 in a million people over their lifetimes. On Feb. 1, 1989, the agency announced that it was banning Alar. Noting that the test results showed no immediate health threat, it said growers could use the chemcial for 18 more months.
"Few realized that its conclusion was based essentially on a questionable interpretation of one study," wrote Dr. Rosen in his National Academy of Sciences report.
The E.P.A. announcement prompted some attention in the news media, including a front-page article in The New York Times. But there was no great public outcry.
At the same time, the Natural Resources Defense Council was preparing a study of the harm posed to children by pesticides in food. The group did no laboratory studies of its own but reviewed the existing findings that Alar posed some risk of causing cancer and that children eat proportionately more apples than adults. The council concluded that Alar could cause cancer in thousands of children.
The group hired Fenton Communications, a public-relations concern that has had many liberal and leftist clients, to publicize the report, "Intolerable Risk."
Fenton offered the study to "60 Minutes" as an exclusive. On Feb. 26, 1989, CBS broadcast a report by Ed Bradley in which Alar was called "the most potent cancer-causing agent in the food supply today," a contention that has been challenged by some scientists. The next day, the environmental group's report was released at news conferences around the country, and the actress Meryl Streep was enlisted to help get the message out.
The following month, schools in New York and Los Angeles canceled supplies of apple juice, supermarkets under public pressure removed apples from their shelves, and farmers, unable to sell their produce, dumped tons of apples in ditches or gave them away to organizations for the homeless.
Alarmed at the panic, the Federal Government issued a statement saying it was safe to eat apples. But apple prices fell to their lowest in years -- around $7 for a 42-pound box, well below the $12 break-even level -- and remained depressed for most of 1989. Seeking to regain the apple's healthy image, growers announced a voluntary ban on the use of Alar.
Later, in a memo sent out to various parties, and published in The Wall Street Journal, David Fenton, the president of Fenton Communications, told of his publicity strategy. He did not return phone messages for an interview for this article.
 
Giving Story a Life of Its Own
 "Our goal was to create so many repetitions of N.R.D.C.'s message that average American consumers (not just the policy elite in Washington) could not avoid hearing it, from many different media outlets within a short period of time," he wrote. "The idea was for the 'story' to achieve a life of its own, and continue for weeks and months to affect policy and consumer habits."
The apple growers in this state, who are among the last of the nation's true family farmers, with orchards averaging just over 40 acres, saw shipments to Asia, their primary export market, slump along with domestic sales.
"The Alar thing just killed us," said Cathy Bernath. "No money was coming in, so we had to go to the bank to get next year's crop in shape. That put us in a hole that we never recovered from. What made me especially mad was that we had never used Alar."
Two reviews of the Alar findings, one by Britain's Advisory Committee on Pesticides, the other by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, have concluded that the cancer risk from the amount of Alar normally used on apples was minuscule.
In an interview, Dr. Rosen called the Natural Resources Defense Council "irreponsible" and added, "I don't know if they knew that the results on which they based their study were discredited, but they had to know the arguments on the other side of the issue."
The scare came about, said Lawrie Mott, a senior scientist for the environmental group, because news organizations distorted and simplified the findings. "Our report did not lack context or perspective," she said. "But most of the press reports did."
 
Debate and Bitterness Linger
 Citing the pending lawsuit, "60 Minutes" producers said they could not talk about the case. "CBS believes the broadcast highlighted an important public health question," the network said in a statement. "It was well researched and well documented."
Network lawyers are trying to get the lawsuit, filed last November in Yakima County Superior Court in Washington State, moved to a Federal District Court. The suit may take years to come to trial.
If the case goes to court, "it may require that we chart some new ground," said Scott Jonsson, a Portland, Ore., lawyer hired by the apple growers. "We need to prove that the defendants recklessly disparaged the product, apples."
In the meantime, the debate over Alar continues. The Government has never concluded whether it posed a serious cancer risk. Farmers who did use it say they now realize they can get along fine without it. Prices for apples have stabilized, and grower groups say they think they have won back most of the consumers they lost.
The ill feelings remain. "We farmers are taking a hard look at what chemicals we're using, and that's a legitimate concern," said Tom Hale, president of the Washington Apple Commission, which represents growers. "But you never really get over the bitterness of that image that was created, that we were somehow trying to poison children."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 18, 1991, Thursday
PUB-DATE: August 15, 1991

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on July 9 about apples and the chemical Alar misstated the response to telephone calls seeking comment from David Fenton, a public relations executive. His office indeed returned the calls; his secretary said he was on vacation and unavailable.
A front-page article on July 9 about the use of the chemical Alar on apples misstated the Federal law governing Environmental Protection Agency decisions on banning chemicals believed to cause cancer. The law requires the agency to balance the risks and the economic benefits of such chemicals. It is an agency goal to ban chemicals that could cause more than one cancer case per one million people over a lifetime. The error was pointed out by readers as early as July 11; this correction was delayed by a succession of editing lapses.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
More Fishing, Fewer Fish

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IN medieval European villages the common pastures belonged to everyone -- and thus, economists love to explain, to no one. Overgrazed and poorly drained, the land was far less productive than privately held acreage.
This "tragedy of the commons" has an obvious modern parallel in the perilous neglect of the world's tropical rain forests. But according to Eleanor Dorsey, a staff scientist at the Conservation Foundation of New England, common ownership also explains an economic and environmental mess that is closer to home. 
 Any American with a down payment on a boat is welcome to toss a net into the rich fishing waters off New England. And in Ms. Dorsey's view, far too many of them take advantage of the offer. Boats equipped with the newest-fangled fish-finding technology are now landing just half the tonnage caught in 1960. That is why the foundation is suing the Commerce Department to protect the region's rapidly depleting fishery -- and why many economists think the only long-term solution to the problem of overfishing is to privatize the harvest.
The fishery's current woes can be traced to the Magnuson Act of 1976, which drove foreign trawlers from a 200-mile zone along the coast. With fishing reserved for Americans, the domestic catch doubled in four years, attracting hundreds of new boats to New England waters.
The bonanza proved short-lived. Landings of diverse species of groundfish have fallen by two-thirds since the 1980 peak, and the harvest is still on the decline. A fishery that by Federal estimate could sustain a 360-million-pound catch is now producing less than 200 million.
Who is to blame? Government scientists are supposed to keep track of the marine environment and set safe targets for fishing. But the law leaves it to seven regional councils to advise the Commerce Department on how to contain the catch.
These industry-dominated councils generally limit the total fishing effort by limiting the length of the season for individual species. In Alaskan waters, for example, halibut are fair game for only a few frenzied days each year. But the New England council has never hammered out a politically acceptable formula for saying no.
The only constraint on New England fishing is a minimum mesh size for nets -- a rule that has not prevented the hard-working fleet from stripping the fishery bare. The State of Massachusetts estimates that overfishing reduced the region's income by about $350 million annually during the late 1980's.
Ms. Dorsey is not about to offer suggestions on how to limit the catch. But other experts are less shy. Lee Anderson, an economist at the University of Delaware and a member of the Middle Atlantic council, thinks the way to get individual fishermen to guard the natural resource is to give them a direct stake in its future productivity.
The Middle Atlantic council privatized the harvest of two varieties of clams this year. Owners of individual boats have been assigned permanent quotas in proportion to their past catches. These quotas can be bought and sold, giving owners the choice of amassing sufficient rights to keep their boats working full time or to bow out of the business with a fat severance bonus.
Economic logic suggests that most boat owners will eventually take the money and run. To keep the catch at sustainable levels last year, individual boats were only allowed to harvest a total of 144 hours. Thus just 15 or 20 vessels could have done the work of the entire 140-boat fleet.
The Middle Atlantic council is not the first regulator to experiment with individual transferable quotas: Canada has privatized its Pacific harvest of both halibut and sable fish, a scarce species mostly exported to Japan. Nor is it likely to be the last. The North Pacific council is planning to follow Canada's lead with the same two species.
Applying a similar plan to New England would be more complicated because boats net a dozen different species in proportions that vary by chance. But a workable solution is not beyond the realm of imagination or technology.
Owners might, for example, trade quotas after the fact, buying extra rights at the dock to cover unanticipated catches. Trading could be managed by computer, the way the stock exchanges automatically match buy and sell orders for I.B.M. and General Motors.
Commerce Department officials number among the believers: The department's National Marine Fisheries Service has begun lobbying the regional councils to adopt transferable quota plans. The immediate question, though, is whether the courts will force action where regulators, Federal and regional, have been too timid to insist.

HEADLINE: Europeans Propose Cut In Farm Output and Aid

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STRASBOURG, France, July 9

 BODY:
The executive commission of the European Community today approved a farm proposal that could restart world trade talks that have been stalled since last December.
The plan, which must still be acted on by the 12 member nations, would revamp the community's agriculture program by slashing production and cutting subsidies to farmers. 
 The proposals "represent the most fundamental reshaping" of the common agricultural policy "since its inception 30 years ago," the commission said in a statement.
 
Impasse at Trade Talks
 Lack of an agreement on a farm proposal helped bring an end to the world trade talks last year. The United States and some other farm exporters wanted the community to cut farm supports and eliminate export credits so that farmers in the United States could better compete with their European counterparts.
But the community proposed less substantial cuts than the United States was looking for, and the four-year, 108-nation effort to lower world trade barriers collapsed.
The plan announced today is an attempt to sever the link between production and guaranteed prices, which has encouraged farmers to grow more to earn more. This has resulted in millions of tons of surplus crops and soaring budget costs.
The plan would slash cereal prices by 35 percent, milk prices by 10 percent and beef prices by 15 percent. Farmers would be compensated for the big price cuts, with direct assistance geared more toward small- and medium-sized farmers.
Farmers who are at least 55 years old would be eligible for a new early retirement program.
The commission estimated the proposal would cost about $4.2 billion in its first year and less in subsequent years. It would take effect in 1993 and be fully in place by 1996.
The world trade negotiations are expected to come up at next week's economic summit meeting in London of the leaders of seven industrialized nations. Last month, trade ministers of two dozen nations called for the negotiations to end by December.
The talks were started in Uruguay in 1986 in an effort to rewrite world trade rules and lower barriers in 15 areas, including textiles, agriculture and manufactured goods and services. The talks are being held under the auspices of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum for liberalizing world trade.

Split on Patents and Names
 BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) -- Delegates at world trade talks are close to an agreement on an accord to end the piracy of intellectual property, but tough problems still remain. The chief negotiator for the European Community, Hugo Paemen, said today that there were disagreements on whether pharmaceuticals should receive patent protection and whether names for products like wines and foods should be protected against copying.

HEADLINE: U.S. WEIGHS MOVES ON CHINESE TRADE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
On the eve of a vote on the issue in the House, the Administration is still trying to decide whether to make a series of concessions to persuade a hostile Congress to extend normal trading privileges to China for another year.
The House is now expected to vote overwhelmingly to renew the so-called most-favored-nation status for China, but with conditions for future renewal, such as the improved observance of human rights, that the White House has promised to veto. Instead, the Administration is leaning toward making a series of promises, including a possible major shift on United States policy toward Taiwan, that would satisfy some Congressional objections without being set in legislation. 
 At stake is not only the level of Chinese-American relations but also President Bush's reputation for consistently being able to persuade Congress to support his foreign policy positions.
 
Private Sector of Economy
 Many Democrats and some Republicans have contended, sometimes heatedly, that China's poor human rights record, arms exports and ballooning trade surplus with the United States justify limits on Chinese access to the American market. But the Administration has countered that raising tariffs would seriously hurt American-Chinese relations and would hurt the private sector of the Chinese economy, the group the United States would most like to see succeed.
Congressional leaders and Administration officials say that President Bush is likely to veto any of the alternative measures now being circulated on Capitol Hill. These bills and resolutions would either attach conditions to the renewal of normal trade relations with China, such as requiring human rights improvements and an end to Chinese support for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia, or cancel it outright. There are enough votes at least in the House to override a veto of any of the measures, the officials agreed.
The Senate is expected to vote next week, and the outcome has been less clear there than in the House. Senate Republicans are more nearly united in support of the President while some Democrats support a renewal if the Administration agrees to other changes in economic policy toward China and Taiwan. Chinese and Administration lobbyists have been slowly lining up votes among farm state legislators in both houses by highlighting China's position as the biggest export market for American wheat last year.
An announcement on concessions is expected within the next several days, a senior Administration official said. At least some concessions are likely, said the official, who insisted on anonymity.
 
Concession on Taiwan Proposed
 One concession proposed to the Administration is for the Administration to drop its opposition to Taiwan's immediate admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a group of countries that agree to abide by a set of free-trade principles.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on international trade, organized a bipartisan group of 15 senators who sent a letter on June 19 to President Bush asking for this and several other concessions in exchange for their support for normal trade status for China.
But a spokesman for the Chinese Government, which has long insisted that it is the sole legitimate government of all China including Taiwan, condemned any United States support for Taiwan's position in an interview on Wednesday, calling it "totally unacceptable," even though Taiwan has applied to join the GATT as a customs territory rather than as a sovereign country.
 
U.S. Policy Change Sought
 The Commerce Department, Treasury Department and the office of the United States Trade Representative have long advocated in interagency talks a change of the American policy toward Taiwan. The State Department and, to a lesser extent, the National Security Council have been opposed on the grounds that this would infuriate China and result in lasting damage to a strategic relationship with the world's most populous country.
Another, less sensitive concession called for by Mr. Baucus and his allies has been for the Administration to take broad legal action against Chinese import barriers. This issue has also divided the Administration, with some officials contending that there are so many barriers that it is better to tackle them with a series of small measures.
"You look at China and say, 'What's wrong with China?' and you fill up books," the senior Adminstration official said.
Other concessions urged by Mr. Baucus and more widely supported within the Administration include new requirements that China prove its exports are not produced by prison labor, a renewed effort by the United States to block loans by multilateral agencies to China and the negotiation of strict controls on Chinese exports of arms and nuclear technology.

HEADLINE: Fed Decides Not to Trim Money Targets

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Signaling that a strong recovery from the recession is at least as high a priority as reduced inflation, Federal Reserve policy makers voted last week not to change their target range for growth in the nation's money supply next year.
The decision, made behind closed doors at a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on July 2 and 3, was confirmed today by Government officials. 
 Some policy makers advocated setting a slightly lower range for money growth to emphasize the goal of reducing inflation. But they were outvoted by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and others who argued that they should not risk retarding the recovery, officials said.
The decision, to be announced by Mr. Greenspan in testimony before a House subcommittee next Tuesday, was first reported today by The Wall Street Journal.
The Fed's target in 1992 for growth in M-2, the most common money supply measure, will be 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent, the same as this year.
The decision not to lower the range to between 2 percent and 6 percent, as some officials urged, was largely a symbolic one. No one expects the growth rate of M-2 (primarily cash, checking, savings and money market accounts and small certificates of deposit) to fall as low as 2 percent or to rise as high as 6.5 percent.
But the action gives the financial markets an indication of the Fed's priorities. In theory, a larger increase in the money supply leads to lower interest rates and stimulates the economy but also runs the risk of more inflation. A smaller increase limits inflation but also restrains economic growth and results in higher interest rates.
Economists said today that the decision showed that the Fed would be careful next year not to strangle the recovery even if that meant the inflation rate would not come down further.
Some members of the Open Market Committee, like W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, have argued publicly that the Fed should work more rigorously to reduce the inflation rate, which has been around 4 percent for almost a decade. Presumably they were the ones who advocated lowering the money supply target.
 
Pressed by Administration
 Mr. Greenspan, on the other hand, has been under pressure from the Bush Administration to cut interest rates and promote a stronger economy in the short run. Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman expires on Aug. 11. While it is widely expected that he will be given another four-year term, the White House has not announced the reappointment.
Some Fed watchers in Washington and on Wall Street suggested that Mr. Greenspan and his allies on the board were reluctant to tighten the money supply while his future as chairman was still being decided, but there is no concrete evidence of that.
The policy makers themselves would not comment on their meeting, and the officials who knew about the decisions provided only sketchy accounts of who said what.
The Open Market Committee consists of the five Fed governors -- there are two vacancies -- and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. All members of the committee may participate in the deliberations, but only the governors and five of the bank presidents can vote.
 
Speedups and Slowdowns
 Until now, the Fed has reduced the money supply target each year since 1988, when the growth range was 4 percent to 8 percent. Within the range each year, there have been a number of speedups and slowdowns in M-2 growth, but since early 1990, the growth rate has been at the low end of the target range.
Since July 1990, when the recession officially began, the money supply has grown by only 3.6 percent, almost a full percentage point less than the rate of inflation over that period. Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, said in his latest newsletter to his bank's customers that this was the lowest rate of M-2 growth during any recession in the last three decades.
Mr. Chandross is one of many economists who say the Fed contributed to the onset of the recession by keeping money too tight.
 
'Most Evidence' Cited
 Another is G. Thomas Woodward, a research economist at the Library of Congress, who maintained in a paper last winter that "most evidence seems to point to Fed policy as the reason for the slowdown in economic activity."
Mr. Greenspan, on the other hand, has blamed the uncertainty following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and credit restrictions imposed by banks for the downturn.
The prevailing view on Wall Street is that the Fed policy makers decided at their meeting last week not to change interest rates for the time being. That was the unanimous position taken by the Open Market Committee at its meeting in mid-May. A summary of the proceedings at the May meeting was released by the Fed on Friday.

Bid by United For Pan Am Routes Seen

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
United Airlines is expected to make a proposal today to buy Pan Am's Latin American and Caribbean routes as well as some of the carrier's European routes in which Delta Air Lines has already expressed an interest, industry executives said yesterday.
The offer could touch off a bidding war between United and Delta. Delta has said that it is not interested in the Latin American and Caribbean routes but that it wants Pan Am's European routes, shuttle service and 45 airplanes. Delta currently serves some major European cities and is particularly strong in Germany. 
 United could also end up making an offer for some of Pan Am's airplanes, which could mean that some of Pan Am's crews could be hired. The industry executives, who spoke on condition that they not be named, gave no details of the proposal.
 
Welcome Competition
 A competition for the European routes between two major carriers would be welcome at Pan Am, which has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors since January.
Thomas G. Plaskett, the president and chief executive officer, has been seeking a way for to close the carrier as gracefully as possible. He is trying to save as many jobs as he can for his 22,000 workers and to guarantee creditors the best price in the sale of most of the carrier's assets.
His main strategy, said several people who have advised him, is to have most of the airline's assets sold before the carrier is forced to liquidate, which could be as early as this fall.
"Everyone has been looking to the winter when Pan Am wouldn't make it through," Edward Starkman, the airline analyst for Paine Webber said. He added that the combination of the recession and the gulf war was too much for Pan Am, even depleting its cash hoard of $400 million that it received from the sale of its London routes to United last fall.
He added that it was not Mr. Plaskett's fault that Pan Am was in its present position. "He deserves a lot of credit for keeping the airline as pretty as it's been by making some strategic sales," Mr. Starkman said.
 
Progress in Phase-Out
 Last week, Mr. Plaskett made progress in his phase-out strategy by getting Delta to consider making a bid for the European routes, the shuttle and the airplanes.
If a deal is reached, Delta said it might be able to offer jobs to 6,000 Pan Am workers. The jobs would probably go mostly to those connected with the airline's overseas operations.
Now Mr. Plaskett will turn his attention to completing an asset deal with United.
His aim, said those who have worked with him on the strategy, is to be able to present a plan to Judge Cornelius Blackshear of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York under which most of Pan Am's assets would be sold and the rest of the airline liquidated.
Mr. Plaskett also hopes to have the unsecured creditors committee approve his plan before he presents it to the bankuptcy court, the people said.
Pan Am filed for bankrupty protection on Jan. 8. It had hoped to be able make a comeback with the $400 million cash infusion from the London-route sale, a $150 million loan from the Bankers Trust Company and a reorganization of its European routes around a hub in Frankfurt.
The gulf war, however, disrupted international air traffic and doubled fuel prices. Operating costs soared at Pan Am, where many of its Boeing 747's are old and inefficient. Pan Am's traffic, for example, fell 20.6 percent in first six months this year.
As Mr. Plaskett seeks to bring down the curtain on the carrier that opened the Pacific to air travel, pioneered the jet age and was so well respected that it was considered the carrier that represented the United States around the world, he is largely standing hat in hand.
The main leverage he holds in his talks with Delta and United is that it is in their interest to make offers acceptable to the court and the creditors soon, because if they wait too long they may have to bid on them in the free-for-all of a liquidation.
 
Potential for Savings
 Selling most of its assets before a liquidation saves the huge cost of the liquidation, could bring higher prices for the assets, and would insure that a part of Pan Am's work force continues to have jobs. Under a liquidation, much money would to be spent preserving the airline's assets and keeping on enough people to oversee the asset sales.
In the case of a shutdown of the carrier, customers would be protected, since Pan Am signed a $100 million agreement with United Airlines last fall that would guarantee reimbursements for ticket holders.
The carrier is now in the midst of what is normally the height of its travel season when it generates most of its cash. But its traffic has continued to be disappointing. It was down 11 percent in June, compared with June last year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Increases Slightly; Gold Declines Moderately

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher yesterday as traders expressed some optimism in advance of this week's meeting of Germany's central bank.
Gold fell moderately, dropping $1.50 an ounce, to $369.40, on New York's Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $369.00 an ounce, off $1.20 from late Monday. 
 Currency dealers said traders generally did not believe that the German Bundesbank would raise interest rates at the meeting of its policy-making council tomorrow.
A report yesterday of lower-than-expected German inflation fueled optimism that the Bundesbank would not tighten credit as a way to counter German price increases, said John Duffy, manager of foreign exchange for Oesterreichische Landerbank in New York.
Caution, however, is keeping the dollar in a tight range. The German mark, as all other currencies, is supported by higher interest rates.
In addition to the Bundesbank meeting, traders are wary ahead of the meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations on Monday.
"There is still a longer-term bull trend that seems to prevail," said Betsy Reetz, a currency dealer for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. "But there are a few things casting a shadow over the dollar right now,"
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6215, from $1.6275 late Monday. Sterling was also lower in New York at $1.6233, less expensive than late Monday's $1.6345.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.15 yen, to a closing 138.60 yen. Later, in London, it also was quoted at 138.60 yen. In New York the dollar closed at 138.76 yen, slightly higher than late Monday's 138.55 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.8175 German marks, up from 1.8058; 1.5759 Swiss francs, up from 1.5584; 6.1660 French francs, up from 6.1325; 1,352.55 Italian lire, up from 1,345.75, and 1.14825 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14565.
In the precious metals market abroad, gold fell in London to a late bid price of $369.15 an ounce, down from $370.40 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $368.75 from $370.15.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.82 to close at a bid $369.33.
Silver fell in New York to $4.431 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down 3.6 cents from late Monday. But the metal was steady in London at a late bid price of $4.46 an ounce.

HEADLINE: West Urges Bulgarians to Shut Reactors

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 9

 BODY:
Alarmed by leaks in emergency equipment and by the danger of flooding and fires, Western experts have urged Bulgaria to shut down its Soviet-made nuclear reactors for repair as soon as possible.
The specialists, who inspected Bulgaria's sole nuclear-power-generating complex last month on behalf of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in a report that four of the six reactors there were so full of hazards that "continued operation would be imprudent." 
 They said that conditions at the complex at Kozlodui, 130 miles north of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, have worsened in recent weeks because the Soviet specialists responsible for safety and operation left Bulgaria after a wage dispute.
Specialists have warned of the possibility of an accident exposing people living nearby to radiation -- there are apartments two miles away -- but so far there have been no reports of radioactivity being released into the atmosphere.
Inspectors did, however, find releases of radioactive steam within the plant; it was not disclosed how serious these releases were nor was it immediately clear whether the health of anyone at the plant had been endangered.
At a special meeting in Vienna today, officials from six Western nations, including the United States, met with Bulgarian and Soviet specialists on the safety problems at the Bulgarian plants. But they failed to reach agreement on how much help the West would provide or what steps Bulgaria was willing to take.
 
Not Up to Western Standards
 "We think safety standards can be raised, but at enormous expense," said Klaus Topfer, the German Environment Minister. But even if improved, the reactors could not meet Western safety standards, he said.
Western experts have long worried about the lack of safety of the oldest type of Soviet-designed nuclear reactor. There are about 20 of this type still in operation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria's four.
They are pressurized water reactors, of a design different from the Soviet Union's ill-fated Chernobyl plant. Germany closed five such reactors last year in the eastern part of the country, the former East Germany.
The findings in Bulgaria have set off a near-panic among specialists, as the report has circulated in Europe.
A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency called the findings "without precedent" and said the inspectors discovered numerous oil, steam and water leaks. He said the report cited unsealed and loose electrical cables and valves with missing wheels. Also cited was severe shortage of staff members.
Ferdinand Frantzen, an agency safety specialist, told the journal Nucleonics Week that radioactive steam was escaping within the plant at a high rate.
Most significant, the system meant to cool the reactor core in an emergency was found to be leaking.
"It's a miracle there has been no accident so far," said a German nuclear specialist in Bonn familiar with the inspection. "But the place is a disaster waiting to happen."
Bulgaria has asked the West for $ l billion to modernize the oldest reactors and insists that it can shut down only parts of the plant because the country depends on nuclear energy for as much as a third of its electricity.
In Vienna today, Bulgarian nuclear officials promised that they could temporarily switch off two of the reactors in about a month and make fast improvements on two others at an immediate cost of about $50 million.
President Zhelyu Zhelev on Monday ruled out closing the Kozlodui plant altogether, saying that would mean "the collapse of our entire economy." Moreover, the President said, "there is no immediate danger of an accident."
The four reactors causing the greatest concern are known by the designation VVER, Model 230. The 440-megawatt machines were built in the l970's. Bulgaria says two are working normally, one is shut down for refueling and one works at half-capacity because of oil leaks.

HEADLINE: Caution on Helping Soviet Economy Is Emphasized by Industrial Nations

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 9

 BODY:
When leaders of the seven leading industrial nations meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev here next week, they almost certainly will promise him aid that will not necessarily cost a lot of money but will signal the West's intent to play a constructive role in helping the Soviet Union become a free-market democracy, American and European officials say.
The immediate things they might give include a big increase in expertise to help the Soviets draw up and put into effect plans for changing their economy and overhauling specific sectors, especially oil and gas and agriculture; an easing of trade restrictions, and perhaps an increase in providing financing to buy goods. 
 The offer of expertise almost certainly will include a promise of associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, American officials said. They were confident that Japan, the one holdout on the associate membership idea, would go along, although the Japanese still appear to be tying their consent to progress in persuading the Soviets to return the northern islands in the Japanese archipelago, which were seized at the end of World War II.
 
Other Forms to Be Discussed
 There are other forms of assistance that will be discussed by the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- and of the European Community, who will also be at the summit meeting. Because of big differences among the seven, however, it appears unlikely that there will be any immediate promises on these things made to Mr. Gorbachev at the July 17 meeting.
One is a stabilization fund of perhaps $5 billion to $8.5 billion to support the Soviet ruble when the Soviets go through the process of making it convertible into Western currencies, reining in its rapidly expanding money supply, freeing prices and slashing subsidies. Another idea of some Europeans is a promise to provide emergency food supplies to allay Soviet fears that they will suffer famine or rocketing food prices as they go through agricultural changes.
 
Rescheduling May Be Asked
 The stabilization fund and food program would only be expensive if the Soviets tapped them. Poland never drew upon its $1 billion stabilization fund.
Some Western officials think Mr. Gorbachev may ask for a rescheduling of his country's hard-currency debt, which, including interest due, totals an estimated $62 billion to $65 billion. But given the Soviet Union's struggle to service this existing debt, he may not be interested in a big increase in trade credits, which could be tied to the purchase of goods that the Soviets do not particularly want.
American officials think Mr. Gorbachev will make one or two big requests in London, whether for a stabilization fund, debt restructuring or a high-profile program for giving the Soviets help in, say, modernizing their oil and gas industry, which is now grossly inefficient and plagued by leakages.
Mr. Gorbachev today said that one request would be for Western investment in industry. An aide said the possibilities included oil and gas and light manufacturing. It was not clear whether Mr. Gorbachev wanted these to be in the forms of loans or equity investments by Western companies or investors.
 
Several Things Required
 American, British and Japanese officials stress that several things must happen before they consider helping. One is for Mr. Gorbachev to present a serious plan for economic changes that includes commitments to things like private ownership and property, enforceable business contracts and investor-owned enterprises whose shares can be traded. The second is for him to demonstrate by action that the Soviet Union has the intent and the internal support to put a plan for changes into effect.
A third could be for him to make some concessions to the West on other fronts. For Japan, this could mean giving back the disputed islands. For the United States, it could mean ending or greatly reducing the Soviet support of the Communist regimes in Afghanistan or Cuba or putting into effect big cuts in the size of Soviet military forces or production, American officials say.
But one American official said the Bush Administration neither expected nor wanted Mr. Gorbachev, when he comes to London, to make a dramatic offer on military cuts that are tied to an upfront Western commitment to provide large-scale aid for economic changes. "If he is foolish enough to call for something grandiose and to try to lay this child at the Western doorstep, it's not going to be taken in because by definition it's not serious" in terms of showing a commitment to economic change, he said.
 
Promises Made Previously
 Mr. Gorbachev said this week that he would present Western leaders with a plan for economic changes that has the backing of nine of the 15 Soviet republics, including Russia and the Ukraine. But it is unclear how radical the plan is and Mr. Gorbachev has promised before to take the plunge and then pulled back, Western officials say.
The United States, Japan and Britain have been the most insistent that Mr. Gorbachev not be promised large-scale aid. The Germans, Italians and French have been more sympathetic.
Even Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who has been perhaps the most enthusiastic advocate -- and provider -- of large-scale aid, concedes that the summit meeting will produce no such package.
A State Department official said: "The political objective is to have the meeting with Gorbachev happen in a way that the conclusion seems positive, that Gorbachev has explained some of his difficulties, it is heard with sympathetic ears and he is given the chance to put one foot through the Western economic door: that is associate membership in the I.M.F. And I imagine there will be renewed offers, perhaps precise offers, of technical assistance. I don't think it's going to go much further than that."
 
Advantages of Membership
 Associate membership in the I.M.F. and its sister organization, the World Bank, a new status at the institutions, would enable their experts to help the Soviet Union draw up and put into effect plans for becoming a free-market economy, with a Western-style financial system and overhaul specific sectors of its economy. It also would enable Soviet personnel to be trained by the two institutions but would not entitle the Soviets to get money from them.
Defenders of associate I.M.F membership say it is important because then the monetary fund could help devise a Soviet plan for economic change and monitor its being put into effect. Such I.M.F. involvement, and World Bank involvement with individual projects, would give Western investors and individual governments the confidence to invest in the Soviet Union once it began putting a plan for change into effect.
Critics of associate membership question whether it would pull in the needed amount of financial help fast enough. One is Jeffrey Sachs, one of the Harvard economists who, along with Soviet economists, helped to write a radical plan for Soviet changes.
 
$100 Billion in Aid
 Known as the Yavlinsky plan after one of its Soviet authors, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the plan proposes that the West provide at least $100 billion in aid over five years in installments tied to Soviet progress in becoming a free-market democracy.
On Monday, David Mulford, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, said the Bush Administration opposed the Yavlinksy plan. Because its program for economic change is tied to large-scale Western aid, "the Yavlinsky package is really not a working proposition, although the economic pieces of it are constructive and important and certainly can be used by the Soviet Union as it develops its economic reform program," he added.
Echoing a view widely held in the Bush Administration and by the British Government, Mr. Mulford said the Soviet Union did not need huge amounts of Western aid but required aid in exploiting its wealth of natural resources more efficiently.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Said to Approve Military Base Closings

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to approve a Federal commission's recommendation to close 25 military installations and consolidate or reduce 48 others, Administration and commission officials said today.
The President has invited members of the commission that decided on the base closings to come to the White House for a ceremony on Wednesday morning. 
 Congress will have 45 days to accept or reject the report after Mr. Bush endorses it, but has no power to change any element without rejecting the entire report. It is considered unlikely that lawmakers in whose districts bases are to be closed will be able to persuade enough of their fellow legislators to overturn the bill.
Mr. Bush said last week that he would rely on Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's advice on the commission's work, which was completed only hours before its July 1 deadline.
 
'A Good Piece of Work'
 Mr. Cheney wrote Mr. Bush last week offering his assessment of the base closing report and recommending that it be approved. His spokesman, Pete Williams, said today that Mr. Cheney considered it "a good piece of work."
The panel, known as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, voted to close all but four of the installations that Mr. Cheney recommended for closing in April. That would eliminate 80,000 military and 37,000 civilian jobs. The closings proposed by the commission would cost $4.1 billion from 1992 to 1997, but save about $1.5 billion a year after that.
The commission also voted streamline the Army Corps of Engineers, eliminating 2,600 jobs for an annual savings of $112 million.
On Monday, members of Congress from Pennsylvania and New Jersey filed suit in Federal District Court to block the closing of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Naval Station. The eight members of Congress were joined in the suit by the State of Pennsylvania and the City of Philadelphia. The suit charges the Navy, the Pentagon and members of the base closing commission with violating the law in ordering the shipyard closed.
 
Some Lawmakers Still Upset
 Last week, nine Senators and Representatives wrote Mr. Bush, asking him to urge the commission to reconsider the decisions to list Carswell Air Force Base in Texas, Castle Air Force Base in California and Loring Air Force Base in Maine, saying they were add to the list in a "highly irregular finale."
Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who is a plaintiff in the Philadelphia suit, said he remained "aghast" at the outcome of the base closing process and is distrustful of the Pentagon's role.
He said the decision would force him to look twice at Pentagon requests for money for the B-2 bomber "and other big-ticket items."
"My opinion of the credibility of the Department of Defense right now is not very high," Senator Specter said.
But such objections were apparently to no avail. Many other members of Congress have said they are resigned to the base closings as proposed and have begun focusing their efforts on finding new uses for the sites and new jobs for those left unemployed.
The commission voted to save four bases that were on Mr. Cheney's original list: Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Oak Harbor, Wash., Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., and the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Fla,
Among the largest bases the commission voted to close were Fort Ord in Seaside, Calif.; Fort Devens in Ayer, Mass.; the Philadephia sites; Long Beach Naval Station in California, and Carswell Air Force Base.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mixed as Dow Declines by 14.76

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices turned mixed yesterday as investors seemed to shy away from the blue chips and concentrated on some of the smaller high-technology stocks. Trading picked up just a little.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.76 points, to 2,947.23, and the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.83, to 376.11. But the Nasdaq composite rose 4.13, to 483.64, as big money continued to pour into the little over-the-counter stocks. 
 In spite of the additional hour of activity since mid-June, trading on the New York Stock Exchange rose only slightly, to 151.8 million shares, from 139.1 million the day before. Every day of slow trading means that Wall Street brokerage firms have to work exceptionally hard to stay in the black. The old rule of thumb was that brokerage firms needed at least 150 million shares a day to make money, but today brokers need a lot more just to break even.
Even professional program traders took a breather. Birinyi Associates, which monitors computer-driven programs, said it spotted only two big sell programs starting around 2:30 and that they knocked 24 points off the Dow.
Among the big O-T-C movers were several technology stocks -- T2 Medical, up 4, to 51; Centocor warrants, up 3 1/2, to 53 1/2; Cytogen, up 3 1/4, to 63 1/2; Borland International, up 2 5/8, to 49 5/8, and Alias Research, up 2 3/8, to 18 5/8.
Millipore, though, another strong technology stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange, slid 5, to 35 3/4, after announcing Monday that second-quarter sales will be "below our expectations." Jonathan W. Osgood, technology analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons, downgraded his rating on the stock from "strong buy" to "buy."
Asked why the market seemed to be dragging its feet, Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist for County NatWest Securities, argued that the stock market "has held up rather well despite a weak bond market and a shaky Japanese market."
He maintained, moreover, that "earnings are coming over the next four weeks and that's pretty much paralyzed investors."
Bond prices, which often help to determine what happens to stock prices, are responding to fears over next month's big Treasury refinancing and the huge stock selloff in Tokyo, he said, fears that Mr. Canelo called "overdone."
He argued that while the Government would indeed borrow huge amounts of money, the public was not because of what he called "the weak economic recovery."
Still, bond dealers said there were fears that today's $9 billion Treasury note auction could hurt prices as dealers mark them down to sell the notes. A weak bond market could weaken stock prices, too.
As for concern that the Japanese might dump their American stock holdings to meet obligations in Japan, Mr. Canelo called such fears "unjustified." He noted, for one thing, that while the Japanese market has been "horrible" over the last two months, "our market hasn't done anything."
For another, he said, speculators who would supposedly dump American stock do not own any and institutional investors that do probably want to keep them to benefit from the strong dollar.
Although the Nikkei index of 225 stocks recovered almost 2 percent in Japan yesterday, the Dow bounced ahead and behind before dropping in response to program selling late in the day.
In one of the few strong gains, J. P. Morgan rose 1 3/8, to 53 1/2, in brisk trading. Losses of a point or more came in Chevron, United Technologies, I.B.M., Merck and and Philip Morris.
Intel, again topping the Nasdaq active list, rose 1 1/8, to 45 1/4, on 2.8 million shares. Bloomberg Business News reported that Abbey Joseph Cohen, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs, said its analysts recommended Intel among high-tech stocks it felt should be overweighted.
Others included Hewlett-Packard, up 7/8, to 54; AST Research, up 3/4, to 23 1/2; Dell Computer, up 1, to 28 1/2; Apple Computer, up 1/8, to 46 7/8; Exabyte, up 3/4, to 15 5/8; Convex Computer, up 1/4, to 14 5/8; Micron Technology, up 3/8, to 12 3/8, and Advanced Micro Devices, up 3/8, to 11 7/8.
Among other Goldman, Sachs recommendations were Sun Microsystems, up 7/8, to 29 5/8; Microsoft, up 7/8, to 67 7/8; Silicon Graphics, up 1 1/2, to 32 3/8; Cadence Design, up 1 1/8, to 18 5/8, and Sequent Computer, up 3/8, to 9 3/4. Sun and Microsoft also made the Nasdaq active list, raising the total to six of the top 10.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Budget Slugfest: Will Veto Be Vetoed?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 9

 BODY:
Propelled by a wave of anger, frustration and desperation, Connecticut's legislature moved today to try to override Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s veto of the legislature's budget plan.
If the lawmakers succeed, it would be yet another counterblow in the five-month tussle with the Governor over an income tax. 
 Like so much of what has happened in the state's budget struggle, overriding a governor's veto and imposing a budget over his vehement objections would be uncharted territory for a legislature that has historically followed the chief executive's lead. But to some who openly dislike Mr. Weicker, that has an appeal in its own right.
Others say the effort is doomed by deep divisions in the majority Democratic Party and by the awareness among leaders that forcing a budget on Mr. Weicker could burn whatever bridges of communication are left between the legislative and executive branches.
A preliminary count in a House Democratic caucus fell short of the margin needed to override. An override vote requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate.
"An override is bad for the state, bad for the General Assembly, bad for the Democratic Party, and I intend to speak against it," said Representative Jonathan Pelto, a Democrat from Storrs who is also the political director for the party and the deputy majority leader in the House. "But I'm realistic enough to know we don't have any other options, either."
A vote to override would resurrect a plan to resolve Connecticut's projected revenue shortfall without an income tax. Instead, existing taxes would be increased by $1 billion. The 8 percent sales tax would be extended to an array of new purchases, from haircuts to car repairs.
Mr. Weicker, who in February proposed an overhaul of the state tax system and an income tax, vetoed the legislature's counterproposal on July 1, only a few minutes after the start of the fiscal year at midnight. He said the lawmakers' fiscal plan would deepen the recession.
The Senate had approved the package 24 to 12, and thus assumedly has the votes to override the veto; the House approved it 83 to 66 and would need 18 converts to reach the two-thirds level of 101 votes to override.
 
Democrats at Crossroads
 If the Republicans, the minority party in both chambers, vote overwhelmingly to override, as they did for the legislative counterproposal, the burden to reach two-thirds would fall on the Democrats.
"We just need to do something and get out of there," said Representative Doreen Del Bianco, a Democrat from Waterbury who voted against the legislative counterproposal but who finds herself torn on the second go-around.
Ms. Del Bianco, who supports an income tax, noted that with no apparent movement toward any other budget plan, interest costs of $100,000 a day from last year's unresolved deficit were piling up. On the other hand, she said the legislative sales-tax plan did not really work.
And then there are lawmakers like Joseph S. Raia and Alex Knopp. Both are House Democrats and both were opposed to an income tax, but they switched their votes at the end of June under pressure from party leaders and voted for a compromise income tax. The compromise died later in the Senate, and both said today that they were soured by the experience and would likely never vote for an income tax again.
"There were a lot of repercussions in my district," said Mr. Raia, a Democrat from New Britain who indicated he would vote to override the Governor's budget veto. He voted earlier in favor of the legislative tax package.
Mr. Knopp, a Democrat from Norwalk, who voted against the legislative package, said he would vote to override even though he thought the lawmakers' package contained elements that might hurt his district.
Mr. Weicker said at a news conference that if the lawmakers did override his veto, he would order the General Assembly back into session at the first sign that the plan was not generating enough revenue.

HEADLINE: KREMLIN TO LOOK FOR INVESTMENTS AT LONDON SUMMIT

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 9

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he would be seeking Western investments in the Soviet economy rather than outright financial aid in his lobbying for help next week at the summit meeting of leading industrial countries.
The Soviet leader will also be offering a specific plan at the meeting on July 17, a plan that will focus on basic Western concerns like demilitarizing the Soviet economy, making the ruble convertible on the open market with other currencies, and suggesting some initial investment possibilities for foreign countries, his spokesman said. 
 Denying an earlier assertion by Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov that Mr. Gorbachev would not be presenting a detailed plan, the Presidential spokesman, Vitaly N. Ignatenko, said Mr. Gorbachev was working on his own economic recovery program and would be presenting it by way of a speech as well as a written document at the London industrial summit meeting.
 
No Plea for Money Expected
 No mention of specific sums was likely to be in Mr. Gorbachev's outline of his hopes for industrial help, Mr. Ignatenko said, insisting the Gorbachev plan would be comprehensive and based on a variety of sources, including the list of suggestions submitted to the Kremlin by a group of Soviet and Harvard academics on how to encourage Soviet economic recovery.
President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, stressing the "mandate" and solidarity that Mr. Gorbachev will carry to London from the leaders of most of the nation's republics, said the Soviet and republic leaders had agreed in advance that "Gorbachev will not ask for money."
"The aim of the trip is to say firmly that the center and nine republics are committed to radical reform, transition to a market-based economy, to diverse forms of ownership and privatization," Mr. Yeltsin told news reporters.
With such a mood of domestic political truce in hand for the moment, President Gorbachev seemed ebullient about his mission as he spoke at a press conference with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, and outlined his approach to the "major event" awaiting in London.
 
Investment Possibilities
 Asked how the atrophied Soviet economy could absorb additional debt beyond its obligation estimated at $55 billion, Mr. Gorbachev cited the United States' national debt -- which Washington estimates at $3 trillion -- and said the Soviet obligation was commensurate with its resources and its record as a good credit risk.
Investments from foreign countries is his goal, he said, so that output can be increased and debt serviced. That will be "the principal direction of our economic cooperation with other countries," Mr. Gorbachev said.
His spokesman, Mr. Ignatenko, cited investment possibilities like oil and gas resources, light industry and banking reorganization as examples the Soviet President might point to as promising foreign investments. In advance of the London meeting, Mr. Gorbachev noted, the Soviet Parliament passed a law intended to ease some of the longstanding disincentives to foreign investors, allowing them full control of enterprises rather than limiting them to minority holdings.
The Soviet Union in recent years has had difficulty enticing major Western companies to invest significantly in the Soviet Union because of the nonconvertibility of the ruble, and the political chaos that made it difficult for companies to know if they should be doing business with individual enterprises, republics, or the central Government.
 
Disputes With Republics
 By promising to set a date when the ruble will be convertible, and assuring the foreigners more control over their activities in the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev seems to be appealing for much more direct involvement of the West in the Soviet economy, which has faltered badly.
President Gorbachev, underlining his main selling argument as he prepares for London, stressed that the issue reaches well beyond Soviet borders, with "enormous global benefits" likely to accrue from a successful market transition aided by other countries.
He also cited the recent civil unrest and military fighting in Yugoslavia as a lesson for Soviet separatists on the need to retain a creative union rooted in democratic constitutional law.
"The people in our republics are watching very closely what's going on in Yugoslavia," he said.
Touching on his own continuing negotiations with the sovereignty-hungry republics over rewriting the Soviet nation's union treaty, Mr. Gorbachev said he hoped that the final consideration of proposed amendments would be completed in a week or two with final approval following without delay.
But as he heads to London, several critical differences remain unsettled with the republics. Most important there is the issue of taxation, with the republics insisting that the central Government should no longer be the dominant tax funnel and should be dependent on the republics for allocation of tax support.
That is only one issue in one area of the complex web of national reconstruction that Mr. Gorbachev is attempting in the nation's economic and political life. Repeatedly at his news conference, the Soviet President expressed confidence that the task eventually would prove successful.

HEADLINE: Support for Pretoria Sanctions Weak

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 9

 BODY:
Congress will probably not try hard to stop President Bush from lifting a wide range of trade and investment sanctions against South Africa, Administration and Congressional officials said today.
Several Democratic lawmakers were strongly critical of the President's move, which is expected to be formally announced on Wednesday, but the critics were skeptical that anything could be done to block it. 
 "They will be removed, and it will be tragic," said Representative William H. Gray 3d, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is the majority whip. "If you lift them too soon, you lock in apartheid."
The South African Government has been dismantling its legal system of racial separation, but discrimination, including denial of voting rights to the black majority, persists.
The State Department has concluded that South Africa has met all five conditions specified by law for the removal of many sanctions, an Administration official said Monday evening. These sanctions include a ban on many imports from South Africa; a ban on the sale of oil, computers, munitions and nuclear technology; and a provision that taxes paid by American companies in South Africa cannot be deducted against Federal taxes.
Federal sanctions that cannot be lifted without Congressional action, such as a 1983 law that bars United States support for loans by the International Monetary Fund to South Africa, would not be affected. Nor would there be any direct effect on state and local laws limiting dealings with companies doing business in South Africa.
Representative Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat and former chairman of the House Africa subcommittee, said lifting sanctions would be premature while obstacles remained to the creation of democracy in South Africa. But he added, "As long as there is continued, demonstrable progress in South Africa toward the removal of the obstacles, I think Congress will adopt a wait-and-see attitude."
Mr. Wolpe said he had spoken to several colleagues today and knew of no broad-based effort in Congress to extend sanctions if Mr. Bush takes action.
 
Carter Favors Lifting Sanctions
 Many Republicans and some Democrats today supported the impending move. "I think now is the time to start removing those sanctions," former President Jimmy Carter said today at a news conference in Atlanta.
While new American investment in South Africa has been banned since 1986, a lifting of this ban is unlikely to prompt an influx of American money. Many American cities and states have their own restrictions on dealings with companies that operate in South Africa, and these restrictions would continue to discourage investment even after Federal sanctions are lifted.
"The companies that used to be in South Africa, they're not considering going back in," said Alison L. Cooper, the senior analyst at the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a non-profit group in Washington.
But trade in gold coins, steel and minerals, banned by the 1986 law that imposed most of the sanctions, is more likely to resume, said Timothy H. Smith, the executive director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based group of Christian churches.
Because many anti-apartheid campaigners argue that change in South Africa has not yet gone far enough, any company that does invest in South Africa now "will clearly become a target of the U.S. anti-apartheid movement," said Richard V. Knight, a spokesman for the American Committee on Africa, a New York-based group.
The White House contended last month that that South Africa had already met four of the five conditions specified in the 1986 legislation that authorized most of the sanctions. These four conditions called for South Africa to legalize anti-apartheid groups and allow their participation in politics; lift state-of-emergency regulations; abolish certain discriminatory laws; and enter good-faith negotiations with black leaders for a new constitution.
 
Release of Political Prisoners
 The State Department has now concluded that South Africa is in the process of meeting the fifth condition, the release of all political prisoners.
But Mr. Gray, the House majority whip, said that several conditions had not been satisfied.
Some people detained under the state of emergency have not been released, not all political prisoners have been freed, black participation in politics is limited by the lack of voting rights for blacks and good-faith negotiations have not begun, Mr. Gray said.
Representative Edolphus Towns, the Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that he also did not believe the conditions had been met. But he added that any legislative challenge to the President was unlikely to succeed.
"I'd be the first to admit that the coalition we had at one point has broken down," Mr. Towns said.

HEADLINE: New York Losing Weapons Against Poverty

SERIES: The Budget Fallout; A periodic look at the effects of New York City's financial plan on various agencies and services.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
New York City's new budget means that Ethany E. Watley, an 80-year-old widow who uses a wheelchair because of arthritis, no longer has a daily lunch delivered to her home in East Harlem.
It means that Trina McNair, a young mother who lives in Brooklyn, lost the caseworker who helped her get prenatal care and who would have found day care for her newborn twins. 
 It means that Ronna Weiss, a psychologist, had no drug treatment to offer the scared, pregnant crack addict who came to North Central Bronx Hospital for help this week.
 
Cuts Despite Fiscal Maneuvers
 Though last-minute fiscal maneuvers saved services like shelters for homeless women and free medicine for the uninsured working poor, the budget that took effect on July 1 severely reduced many other social programs.
Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council restored $51 million to avert some of the harshest proposed cuts in health, housing and social services, but the city still cut spending in those areas by $263 million.
Hardest hit were some of the city's most innovative programs that were intended to break the cycle of poverty for children. Successful initiatives to reduce infant deaths and prevent lead poisoning of children were deeply cut. So was a planned expansion of drug treatment for pregnant women, and so were school health programs and inspections of day care centers.
 
An Even Worse Landlord
 Many other services to the poor were cut, too. For example, the city will now crowd more homeless people into fewer shelters and no longer provide special social services for homeless families placed in permanent housing. It also ended home-delivered meals for 1,000 of the frail elderly.
And the city will be an even worse landlord to 125,000 residents of city-run housing. Tenants will have to live with holes in their walls, broken-down lobby doors, grimy, chipped paint and dripping faucets. The city Department of Housing Preservation and Development will have even fewer managers to respond to a backlog of requests for repairs that already numbers 100,000.
"We're falling further and further behind," said William E. Spiller, deputy commissioner for property management at the housing agency.
In the last few months, as politicians jockeyed over the cuts, directors of many programs have lived with maddening uncertainty as they received mixed signals about financing.
 
'Enormously Frustrating'
 One example is the city's program to reduce infant mortality. After the program was eliminated in the Mayor's proposed budget, the Health Department sent layoff notices to most of the program's employees. Now, with half the money restored, managers are scrambling to regroup.
"It's been enormously frustrating," said Ellen Lovitz, Deputy Health Commissioner. "We'll get letters out as quickly as possible to people who will be called back to work."
Advocates for the programs continue to hold on to the slender hope that municipal unions will agree to wage and benefit concessions that can be funneled to social services.
But city agencies are operating on the assumption that they will not get any more money, and so they are performing financial gymnastics to come up with the funds internally.
One such agency is the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Without an extra dollar from the city, it will keep open most of the 28 pharmacies that provide free prescriptions to the uninsured, as well as walk-in medical clinics. All were about to close.
That the corporation, the largest municipal hospital system in the nation, was able to find the money in its own nooks and crannies suggests how carelessly it spent money when times were flush, critics said. The corporation plans to raise $10 million by collecting private insurance and Medicaid payments that it is entitled to.
 
Hospital System Accused of Waste
 Steven J. Matthews, a spokesman for the corporation, said it planned a system to collect the money even before the fiscal crisis. But Kildare Clarke, associate medical director for emergency services at the Kings County Hospital Center, said the corporation had wasted huge sums of money and should have improved its inefficient collecting of revenue years ago.
"If this was a private corporation, a lot of senior executives would have been fired," he said.
A city government trying to trim the fat is also cutting a lot of muscle. The most devastating and fiscally shortsighted cuts are in programs for children, said advocates and city officials.
"What's so sad," said Jane Knitzer, who heads the Citizens' Committee for Children, "is that we're embarking on a path with perfectly predictable consequences -- more damaged children who will bounce around in foster care."
 
Fewer Lead-Paint Inspections
 The city will inspect thousands fewer apartments for lead paint, which can cause brain damage in children.
The Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which is losing more than one-fourth of its code inspectors, is discontinuing about 1,000 apartment inspections a year in neighborhoods with high reported levels of lead poisoning. The Health Department lost about half the money that paid for 4,500 inspections last year.
The city also halved the financing for a program that helped reduce infant mortality rates in poor neighborhoods, where babies die at rates as high as those in some third-world countries.
Last year, the infant mortality initiative paired 5,800 pregnant women and mothers of babies with caseworkers and public health nurses.
Trina McNair, 25, who had twins three weeks ago, has not heard recently from her caseworker, Patricia Prescott, who has been laid off.
Mrs. Prescott had helped Ms. McNair get prenatal care and accompanied her to the hospital when she was treated for syphilis. "The twins could have been born blind or dead," the caseworker said last month, before she was laid off.
Instead, Ms. McNair's babies are healthy. She had been counting on Mrs. Prescott to help her in the next year.
"I was talking to her almost every day when I was pregnant," Ms. McNair said. "She'd give me a call. I'd call her. I was hoping she could help me find day care. I'm going back to work in August. I'm very sad to hear she's laid off."
 
Less Help for Pregnant Addicts
 The city's sharp scaling back in its planned expansion of drug treatment is also bad news for children. About 1,200 fewer pregnant women and 600 fewer mothers of young children will get help than expected.
A frightened young crack addict, six months pregnant, came to the North Central Bronx Hospital this week to be treated for syphilis. Ronna Weiss, director of the hospital's substance abuse program, said she chased the trembling woman as she tried to flee the hospital Monday evening.
Ms. Weiss coaxed her back to the hospital and bought her a hamburger and french fries at a coffee shop, but had no drug treatment to offer.
"We have literally 350 of these women a year, and there's no program for them," Ms. Weiss said. "It's unbelievable, but almost every substance abuse program will not take a pregnant woman." Few drug programs nationwide will do so either, largely because of liability problems posed by high-risk pregnancies.
 
Fewer Meals for the Elderly
This year, programs for the elderly, usually protected in the budget because of their voting strength, were also hit. About 5,000 fewer people will be able to get free meals in senior centers, in addition to those who will no longer get home-delivered meals.
Mrs. Watley, who has lost her home-delivered meal, needs the service because she is physically infirm. Leg spasms caused her to fall four times in the last two weeks, and twice she called the police to help her up, she said.
The 80-year-old widow has lived for 25 years in a second-floor apartment at First Avenue and 114th Street. In the living room is an orange-striped couch, where two teddy bears sit near yellow pillows she crotcheted. A book on a small end table is titled "Life Does Have a Purpose."
 
The Series So Far
 The first article in this series about the impact of the New York City budget appeared last Thursday. It described how the city's Police and Fire Departments were spared the brunt of the budget cuts that have sapped other city agencies.

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
DO you come home from work physically or emotionally drained with little energy or enthusiasm left for dealing with family or personal matters?
Do you find it hard to get out of bed in the morning knowing what you face at work that day? 
 Do you often suffer from headaches, backaches, digestive upsets or insomnia that you trace to distress at work?
Have you noticed that you are drinking too much alcohol, smoking too many cigarettes, or becoming dependent on drugs that pep you up or help you sleep?
You may be among tens of millions of American workers who are suffering from job-related stress, a problem far more common than either workers or their employers realize.
At a time when many people are suffering the effects of unemployment, it may seem inappropriate to talk about stress on the job. But as a recent national survey revealed, cutbacks in personnel and shrinking employee benefits are major contributors to what the survey researchers called a national epidemic of job stress.
 
Survey Findings

Among a random sample of 600 full-time American workers in all types of jobs, 72 percent said they suffered from three or more stress-related conditions very often or somewhat often. These include exhaustion, anger or anxiety, muscle pain, headaches, insomnia and gastrointestinal disorders. Some workers were often beset by as many as eight or more stress-related ailments.
Scott Knowlton, disability manager for the Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, the Minneapolis-based company that sponsored the survey, said, "We are seeing twice the incidence of stress disabilities in our caseloads over just 10 years."
The growing problem of job stress also exacts a toll on employers by increasing job turnover and absenteeism and decreasing productivity.
Seven of 10 workers surveyed said that excessive job stress was cutting into their productivity, and nearly one in five said they missed one or more days of work last year because of workplace stress.
Fully one-third seriously considered quitting last year to reduce their stress, and 14 percent actually did quit or change jobs within the past two years because of workplace stress. Furthermore, 35 percent of new employees said they had left their previous jobs because of stress. Many of the stressed-out employees who stayed on the job presumably functioned at less than an ideal level.
A report on the survey quoted several people's expressions of concern. "I feel run down all the time," said a blue-collar worker from Wisconsin. "I can't concentrate. I make more mistakes on the job."
A professional from the same state said, "The only thing I can do is hang on where I am and suffer through it."
A business executive from California was even more blunt: "Burnout makes me feel tired, angry and fed up. I am less productive, and I have no job loyalty."
 
Causes of Job Stress

A dozen major causes of job stress were identified through the survey, which was conducted for the insurance company last January and February by N. K. Friedrichs & Associates , an independent research company in Minneapolis. The surveyors interviewed a representative sample of 600 American full-time adult workers who are not self-employed. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
The researchers said they were surprised to discover that a hiring freeze and forced time off without pay, common in the recession, did not significantly increase worker burnout.
But three of the four leading factors related to burnout involved changes typical of current economic conditions: a substantial reduction in employee benefits; merger, acquisition or a change of company ownership, and a reduction in the size of the work force or elimination of positions at the company.
The leading identified cause of burnout -- "little personal control allowed" in doing one's job -- is prevalent at all times, irrespective of the economy.
Other factors associated with burnout and an increased likelihood of suffering stress-related illnesses included major departmental reorganizations and frequent requirements for overtime work. More than half the workers suffering burnout said their employer did not have supportive work and family policies and did not have effective lines of communication with manangement.
Forty-nine percent of burned-out workers said their employer did not provide health insurance coverage for mental illness and chemical dependency and 39 percent complained of inflexible work schedules.
On a more personal level, more than half the workers rated as most stressful either having too much work to do or having to work with the public. Blue-collar workers were more likely than white-collar workers to cite their bosses as a major source of job stress.
 
Possible Solutions

The survey findings suggest some important messages to both employers and employees.
As many people have realized in rearing children, there are often situations in which parents, instead of dictating a course of action, could offer children a choice and an opportunity to decide for themselves. This gives children an emerging sense of power and control over the course of their lives. Similar circumstances often prevail in the workplace, even for highly stereotyped jobs like assembly-line work. Workers can be permitted to at least participate in decisions that affect the quality of their work lives. They should know that management listens to them and takes them seriously.
The strong link between cuts in employee benefits and the occurrence of stress-related illness and burnout among workers suggests a need for a more humanitarian approach to employment. Nine of 10 workers said that health plans should cover treatment of stress-related illnesses, including emotional disorders and chemical dependency.
Indeed, based on 3,896 disability cases, the Northwestern National Life researchers calculated that the average cost of rehabilitating an employee disabled because of stress was $1,925. If they are not rehabilitated, experience has shown, companies will need to hold in reserve an average of $73,270 or more to cover disability payments for employees disabled by job-related stress.
Workers in the stress survey also indicated a strong need for more consideration of family and personal needs in establishing work schedules and policies. Especially now with both parents working outside the home in so many families, workers want more flexibility in their hours, paid or unpaid time off to help out at home, company assistance in child care and the opportunity to share jobs.
The survey showed that employers who offer stress-reduction or exercise programs have more employees with healthful habits. In these companies employees lived more healthfully whether or not they participated in the company-based programs. Furthermore, those with more healthful habits reported higher productivity, lower turnover and less absenteeism. In other words, a company's small investment in worker health can pay off in big bottom-line dollars.

Airline Entrepreneur Faces Daunting Task

 BODY:
As he sets out to create a new airline from the scraps of the bankrupt Eastern Airlines, John R. Mitchell acknowledges that he is contending with heavy skepticism.
"If everyone could see the heart of the deal and could know everything we know, they wouldn't be so skeptical," Mr. Mitchell said yesterday, one day after announcing plans to invest $550 million to start up an airline to serve 12 East Coast cities from Atlanta beginning in November. 
 "I'm sure the industry is going to be skeptical until we fly that first flight," said the 34-year-old Mr. Mitchell.
To characterize the initial response from the aviation industry as "skeptical" would be charitable to the new start-up. Most are openly scornful.
"It just doesn't make any sense," said Kevin Murphy, aviation industry analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company. "A third of the industry already is in bankruptcy. The marketplace has spoken."
Eastern ceased operations on Jan. 19 after failing to recover from the effects of a March 1989 strike by unionized machinists. The company had been trying to restructure under bankruptcy protection since the early weeks of that strike.
Mr. Murphy noted that the new airline would have to compete with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines in its home market. "Going against the likes of Delta is a daunting proposition," Mr. Murphy said.
The project has also met with a cool reception from officials in the Atlantas Aviation Department, which controls 33 gates at Hartsfield International Airport abandoned by Eastern. The new airline hopes to acquire rights to some or all of those gates.
"For a group with no employees, no gates, no flights and -- as far as we can tell -- no money, they have just not been very forthcoming about their plans," said John R. Braden, a spokesman for the Aviation Department. "I think it's time for them to put their cards, if they have any, on the table."
Mr. Mitchell said the proposal he had advanced in cooperation with a group of 170 pilots, most of them former Eastern employees, would make economic sense. The new airline would fly only small, two-engine jets bought from the Eastern bankruptcy estate, and each plane would have only two pilots and would fly only short routes with high yields, he said.
Mr. Mitchell said he had been brought into the deal by the Eastern pilots group because of his expertise in raising foreign money. Mr. Mitchell said he had sought financing from companies in Mexico and the Middle East. But he acknowledges that aviation law in the United States will require him to raise 51 percent of the airline's equity from domestic sources.
Mr. Mitchell is a 1978 graduate of the University of Cincinnati. He established the Sterling Financial Group in Atlanta in 1982. He has previously worked as vice president of mergers and acquisitions for the Atlanta-based Andover Group. While there, he arranged acquisitions of nine manufacturing and distribution companies in the Southeast.

HEADLINE: Yields Mixed On C.D.'s and Bank Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and money market accounts were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest-rate publication, fewer financial institutions are lowering rates. For example, last week the New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston market averages for six-month certificate were unchanged from the week before, while movements in other markets were only one basis point up and down. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Analysts at The Monitor said that the lack of movement in bank yields might indicate that the current rate cycle was near its end. But the foundation for a new cycle has not materialized, they said, adding that the pace at which rates will rise in the next cycle will depend on the strength of the economic recovery.
At the Treasury Department's weekly auction on Monday, average discount rates were narrowly mixed and still at their highest levels since the beginning of June. The three-month bill slipped a basis point, to 5.58 percent, while the six-month bill was unchanged at 5.71 percent.
Analysts said savers should take into account the rise and fall in rates that tend to occur at the end of a recession and stay with maturities ranging from three months to a year.
The largest yield changes in banks in the New York area this week were at Citibank, which lowered the yield of its money-market account by 13 basis points, to 5 percent, at First Nationwide, which raised the three-month certificate of deposit by 15 basis points, to 5.5 percent, and the European American Bank, which raised the yield on its six-month C.D. by 11 basis points, to 5.76 percent.
Among commercial banks, the average money-market account fell by 2 basis points, to 5.17 percent, while the three-month and six-month certificates of deposit each rose one basis point, to 5.47 percent and 5.65 percent, respectively.
Depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on a money-market account rise one basis point, to 5.55 percent, while a three-month certificate remained unchanged at 5.75 percent. The yield on a longer, six-month maturity, rose by one basis point, to 6.01 percent.
By comparison, at the 20 large banks around the country outside the New York market the average money-market yield was unchanged at 5.24 percent from the previous week, while the average yield of a six-month certificate fell one basis point, to 5.73 percent.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'Bank Money Accounts'
 
Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, July 10, 1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Dark Side of Disunity

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Americans seem fated to ignore the dark shadows of idealism in foreign policy. Yugoslavia is the most recent case in point.
 Some of America's finest essayists and talk-show artists are doing a devilishly effective job of selling a cleverly unshaded argument. Their pitch is that America's basic choice in Yugoslavia (and the Soviet Union) boils down to this: self-determination, freedom and democracy versus order, stability and dictatorship. 
 If that were the real choice, the decision would be easy. But it is not.
 Self-determination has its dark side -- virulent and oppressive nationalism. Stability and order have a positive side -- a context for peaceful change.
 The fact that Croatia and Slovenia have freely chosen to separate themselves from Yugoslav and Serbian domination does not suggest, or guarantee, a free and democratic future for their citizens. Croatia is known more for its Nazis than for its democrats. Slovenian leaders are largely unknown quantities. The Balkans are not exactly a tinderbox of democracy.
 Yugoslavia is rife with ethnic inequality, with the Serbs at the top of the food chain. But separated republics could treat their minorities still more unfairly. Perhaps the large Serbian population in Croatia has more to fear from an independent Croatia than Croatia does from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. Minority rights are every bit as essential to democracy as majority rule.
 The economic effects of separation could also be devastating. Slovenes and Croats expect that after independence their standard of living could plunge by one-third. Many who voted for separation might then vote with their feet and flee westward, creating enormous problems in Eastern and Central Europe. Many who stay might find themselves freely electing dictators to restore order.
 As a practical matter, where should self-determination begin and end? Why can't the Serbian minority in Croatia vote to join Serbia? Why can't the Germans in Poland elect annexation to Germany? Why shouldn't northern Italians freely choose to separate themselves from southern Italy? If the Russian republic can declare its independence from Moscow, why can't Russia's own 16 autonomous republics freely establish their own sovereignty?
 Fragmentation could have frightful consequences. Most new states would quickly become economic basket cases, begging for aid and loosing refugees on their wealthier neighbors. The opportunities for mischievous diplomacy and war would multiply as the new states jockeyed to survive.
 None of this is to say that the U.S. should forsake its commitment to self-determination, for which Americans died in two World Wars, a conviction that springs from our own revolutionary heritage. It is to plead that our actions -- like those that we and the European Community are now pursuing in Yugoslavia -- be tempered by common-sense guidelines:
* We cannot and should not stop peoples from seeking self-determination. But we can and should employ our influence to urge extended cooling off periods -- as was just arranged between Slovenia and Yugoslavia. This gives time for all to reflect on the risks as well as the rewards of independence.
 * We have to make plain that spilling blood or provoking bloodshed is no way to gain our support. Economic and political pressures are fair instruments; killing is not.
 * We have to insure that the parties understand we will not help bail them out of whatever economic mess they create. If they simply act unilaterally, they will have to fend for themselves.
 * We ourselves have to understand that there is no one, final answer to the problem, and that those states closest to the problem generally must be the principal diplomatic midwives.
 It is no accident nor is it merely an act of selfishness that every European state except Germany and Denmark opposes uncontained, unilateral self-determination in Yugoslavia. And to them all, stability and order are not abstractions. For them, nasty nationalism and dictatorship loom in the shadows of self-determination unchecked by reason and history. Americans ought to hear out these European worries and appreciate our State Department's own agonies before we start leading the self-determination parade.

HEADLINE: Yugoslav Marriage Needs a Trial Separation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Psychodrama in Yugoslavia" (Op Ed, June 27), Srdja Popovic portrays the popular movement in Slovenia and Croatia as a manifestation of dangerous and irrational needs of adolescent nations. In his view, these movements must be repressed or contained by force of more mature statesmen. He fails to address the question of whether or not these psychological needs have roots in serious and justifiable grievances. 
 Considering how the Yugoslav project started 70 years ago, the maze of ethnic rivalries engulfing Yugoslavia is unsurprising. In lieu of the land of Southern Slavs, imagine a country comprising Israel, Lebanon and Syria. Imagine that this state came into being during the disintegration of a large empire, as an extension of Syria, which contributed in blood to the empire's defeat. Syrians, proud of fathering the new state, dominate the government and army. The capital is in Damascus.
Would it really be so surprising, or manifesting national immaturity, if Israel or Lebanon wanted the Syrian-dominated state reorganized, threatening to secede if the status quo remained? And would it be strange if Syrians viewed the weakening of control from Damascus as a betrayal?
Mr. Popovic wants the Yugoslav Gordian knot to be cut by the sword of the Army. But the blood spilled by the predominantly Serbian and Communist military leadership would only seal the fate of the Yugoslav idea in the long run. The West should not support a forced continuance of a bad marriage, but a "temporary separation" of feuding Yugoslav ethnic groups. Such a separation would allow strong nationalist passions to subside, while putting a halt to mutual accusations of exploitation.
At the same time, economic realities would soon begin to press toward larger integrations. A fertile soil would thus surface for genuine bonds of commonality among Yugoslav nations to emerge. A road to such a separation would be for the political leaders to agree to some sort of confederation. The West should exert pressure on these leaders to move toward a looser union, rather than unwittingly encouraging a military dictatorship.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Alters Banking Rules on South Africa

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
On the day President Bush announced an end to five years of United States sanctions against South Africa, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday announced broad new rules that would limit city business with banks that have ties to South Africa.
Saying that South Africa had not made enough progress toward introducing democratic reforms, Mr. Dinkins declared that banks would be rated on compliance with the new rules. 
 The City Council's Government Operations Committee a year ago unanimously approved the bill on which the rules are based. At the time, city officials conceded that the handful of banks without ties to South Africa would not be large enough to handle most city transactions, but they said the measure would prompt discussion and perhaps changes in the practices of bigger banks.
"The rules keep the pressure on the Government of South Africa by telling our banking community that doing business with an apartheid system is a severe liability at home," Mr. Dinkins said. "Alternatively, if a bank demonstrates its opposition to apartheid through meaningful action, the City of New York will recognize that commitment and reward it."
The new rules, issued by the city's Department of Finance, will provide a guideline for city agencies to use when deciding where to deposit city funds.
To qualify for the top rating, a bank cannot have an office, plant or employees in South Africa or investments there; cannot provide loans or trade credits to South Africa; cannot have deposits from South Africa, and cannot have licenses or agreements allowing the use of the bank's trademarks, copyrights or patents by the South African Government.
The guidelines also say that banks must have divested all outstanding debt owed them by the South African Government or its entities.
In 1990, the city had deposits in 20 banks with an average balance of $250 million and obtained banking services costing $40 million, according to the Mayor's office.
The rules were published in yesterday's City Record and will become effective in 30 days.
"While the Bush Administration believes the end of apartheid is near and the time has come to lift U.S. sanctions against South Africa, I am proud that New York City is moving forward with plans to put in place a set of regulations that is so broad in spectrum," Mr. Dinkins said. "It is our firm belief that without these measures on the local, state, Federal and international levels, the pursuit of democracy in South Africa will be stalled."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Up

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in thin trading yesterday, buoyed by a successful auction of new seven-year notes.
Bids on the $9 billion issue produced an average yield of 8.26 percent, a bit higher than had been anticipated and well above the 7.93 percent average yield at the last seven-year note sale on April 10. 
 Retail demand for the new securities was quite light, which left dealers holding more of the issue than usual. Those conditions often lead to a slide in prices after the Treasury releases the auction results. That did not occur yesterday.
"The market did better after the results were published, in part because the market's worst fears about the sale were not borne out," said William V. Sullivan, Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The history of seven-year auctions has been to disappoint. This sale failed to do that."
Market participants apparently saw value in the new securities, because by late yesterday the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.21 percent, well below the auction level.
Despite the price improvement, some traders said the fact that so much of the issue remains in dealers' inventories remains a worry.
"Everyone is trying to breathe a sign of relief, but if activity stays as light as it is then yields may have to move higher," in order to sell the securities, one government securities trader said.
 
Reappointment of Fed Chairman
 Alan Greenspan's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board was announced after traders had gone home, and consequently had no impact on movements in prices. The issue, however, was raised earlier in the day at a White House press conference, where President Bush told reporters that he would make a decision on the reappointment "soon."
"Our market trades on the expectation that Greenspan will be reappointed," Mr. Sullivan said.
Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm, said: "The shock would have been had he not be reappointed, and the Administration knew that. The last thing the market and the economy needs right now is more uncertainty."
While many economists have expressed surprise that the decision to reappoint Mr. Greenspan took so long, the fact that the process was so drawn out may have raised the Fed chairman's credibility in the fixed-income markets, Mr. Crandall said.
"Just a few months ago, after he was appointed chairman of the comission to study the advisability of cutting the capital gains tax, the word on the Street was that Greenspan was too close to the Administration," Mr. Crandall said. "This whole reappointment episode has made his relationship with the Administration look a little less cozy. That is probably good for the Fed."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices began to rise shortly after results of the seven-year auction were announced.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 95 27/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.50 percent, down from 8.52 percent late Tuesday.
 
10-Year Note Offering
 Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 97 27/32 late yesterday, up 5/32, to yield 8.32 percent. The 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 99 5/8, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.96 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes rose by 2/32 point, to an offered price of 100 5/ 32, to yield 6.91 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.55 percent, down three basis points, or three one-hundreths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 5.67 percent. And one-year bill rates dipped by three basis points, to a late rate of 5.87 percent.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were up by about 1/8 point in very quiet trading.
Continued strong demand from retail investors helped to push up prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds.
Prices of most widely quoted issues improved by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: School's Budget Cuts: Looking for Magic

SERIES: The Budget Fallout: A periodic look at the effects of New York City's financial plan on various agencies and services.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
When school opens in New York City on Sept. 11 more classrooms will be strained to the breaking point. Fewer teachers will be around to offer art, music and the electives that give high school its pungency.
Fewer guidance counselors will be available to help the most aimless and unruly youngsters, and ragged textbooks will have to make it through another year patched together by tape and glue. 
 These are the current prospects.
But even after both the city and state last week settled on budgets that will require school cuts of $464 million, much remains uncertain because some potential fiscal sleights-of-hand could spare some of the worst ravages.
The administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins is negotiating with its labor unions to gain up to $600 million in concessions on salaries, benefits and work practices. Some of that money could be funneled to schools. There could be also be a further infusion of cash from the Municipal Assistance Corporation that floats bonds on behalf of the city.
For many Board of Education officials, though, the only lingering question is whether life will be miserable or merely bleak. Some deprivations have already begun.
In recent weeks, between 3,500 and 4,270 teachers have taken advantage of a retirement incentive program intended to save $50 million by eliminating those who are most highly paid. But their departure will not only shrink the teaching force but also bring many new teachers without any experience into the system. At the same time, the money once available to provide on-the-job training is depleted.
"We're getting more and more people who are coming in absolutely green," said Frank Arricale, superintendent of District 11 in the northeast Bronx, who worries he may have to eliminate his 30 teacher trainers. "If you want to do more than babysit, you have to train them in how to teach."
The budget crisis also threatens to abolish experimental programs that have been keeping children in school. School District 18 in the East Flatbush and Canarsie sections of Brooklyn deploys "health aides" in each school who, under the supervision of a part-time pediatrician and two nurses, to make sure children receive checkups and vaccinations.
One child displaying tantrums, said Dr. Harvey Garner, the district's superintendent, was discovered to have a heart defect that was soon corrected. A tubercular third-grader has been badgered to make regular clinic visits that his family might not pursued so rigorously.
At Edward R. Murrow High School in Brooklyn, known for its magnet programs in journalism, law and sociology, some elective courses will be eliminated and others will be more crowded, said the principal, Saul Bruckner. Students will not be allowed to take so many subjects as they do now, forcing those who fail courses to spend an extra term or two before they can graduate.
 
Deep Cuts at CUNY
 Money that pays teachers to call parents of truants is gone. Fewer clerks are available to help pull together college applications. The school's eight guidance counselors will each have to advise more students because the number of students is rising but the number of counselors is not.
The picture is almost as grim at the City University of New York, with more than 200,000 students at 21 colleges and graduate centers. Some time later this month, the university's trustees are expected to raise the $1,450 tuition by $400 at the senior colleges and $300 at the community colleges.
The increases are smaller than the $500 that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed, which sparked a shutdown of much of the university last spring. But coming on top of reductions in state financial aid, the tuition increases may still discourage some impoverished students from enrolling.
 
Opportunity Lost
 University officials are most concerned about the decimation of one campus, New York City Technical College in downtown Brooklyn. Officials say that a 50 percent cut that was imposed by the state and that the city cannot afford to make up will mean the elimination of 31 of 38 two-year degree programs. These programs, enrolling 4,500 of the school's 11,000 students, train X-ray technicians, dental hygienists, eyeglasses makers, nurses and restaurant managers.
"We're talking about first-generation college students who have an opportunity to really change their lives," said Dr. James W. Merideth, the college president. "We're talking about nursing students coming off welfare and going into $35,000-a-year jobs."
The John Jay College of Criminal Justice has also been stripped of funds for its two-year programs in police work, correction and security, endangering the career plans of 2,000 of its 8,500 students.
The foreboding hanging over the city's 984 public elementary and secondary schools was heightened this week by a status report from Stanley S. Litow, the Deputy Schools Chancellor for Operations.
 
Lack of Alarm
 Cutting $464 million from a $7 billion budget, he said, would require the elimination of 7,181 jobs, including 3,006 teachers, 312 assistant principals, 312 guidance counselors, 565 secretaries, 128 security guards, 428 paraprofessionals, and 2,112 school aides.
The internal memo was sent to City Hall and to such power brokers as Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, as an unblushing appeal for rescue. But City Hall officials view Mr. Litow's figures with something less than his alarm.
The Mayor's acting press secretary, Leland T. Jones, described them as "placeholders" -- figures that should not to be taken literally but which suggest the scope of raw job cuts if no other measures are taken.
But Mr. Litow contended that he was not crying wolf. His list, he said, was compiled from estimates made by the city's 32 district superintendents and the high school superintendents.
"It would be the gravest mistake to understate the results of this budget," he said. "If this litany of things doesn't spell devastation, it's hard to imagine what does. It means the school programs will be radically different than what we've had in New York City, and keep in mind that New York's is not as good as what other districts in the state have."
The Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, said again yesterday that he was considering suing the city for violating the Stavisky-Goodman Law, which requires the city to spend as much on education in a particular year as the average of the previous three years. But former school officials say the law is difficult to invoke because the city can manipulate statistics to assert that it is not in violation.
Mr. Litow predicted that the school system would have 4,000 fewer teachers than the 65,884 it did for the past school year. With enrollment expected to grow by 25,000 students to 980,000, average class size is expected grow by three students, he said. The average number of students per class last school year ranged from 24.8 students in primary grades to 30.4 in high school.
In addition, he said, there would be a $19 million cut -- about 63 percent -- in money for textbooks, library books and equipment, and a $20 million cut in staffing for after-school and extracurricular activities.
These cuts will be translated down to the local level sometime in the next two weeks when the district superintendents are given their September allocations.
Mr. Arricale, the Bronx superintendent, said he expected to cut close to $5.6 million from his $60 million budget, a figure he said is far more painful than it might seem.
"Fifty million of the $60 million is mandated -- a teacher for every classroom, a principal for every school," he said.
With the remaining $10 million cut in half, he said, he will lose 15 assistant principals and 40 guidance counselors. If youngsters cannot get help from guidance counselors, he warned, more of them will be referred to the special eduication classes for the emotionally disturbed, where guidance is mandated.
Dr. Bertrand Brown, superintendent of District 5 in Harlem, said the possibility that he may have to dismiss between 30 and 40 teachers reminded him of the hardships of the city's last fiscal crisis, when the school system laid off 14,000 teachers.
"We'll be back into the 1970's," he said. "We'll start at ground zero."
The prospect of a last-minute cavalry charge bringing additional money is by no means certain. Mr. Rohatyn said in an interview that the Municipal Assistance Corporation would not turn over $1 billion over the next four years -- the proceeds from the refinancing of its maturing bonds -- unless the city comes up with a long-term financial plan that indicates that its books will be balanced permanently.
"Obviously I'm very sympathetic to his problems," he said of Mr. Fernandez. "On the other hand, M.A.C. doesn't know whether it will be in a position to play any role. We would certainly need a credible city plan to give our bondholders assurance of repayment."
To establish such a plan, he said, the city would need to obtain agreements from its unions to reduce wage scales and economize on other contract terms. That process is filled with snares.
For one thing, the city wants the United Federation of Teachers, which last year helped avert layoffs by agreeing to a partial wage deferral, to join these negotiations. But a union spokeswoman, Susan Amlung, argues that "our position is we gave already."
 
The Series So Far
 The most recent article about the impact of the New York City budget appeared yesterday. It described how social services would be severely reduced under the new spending plan. A previous article said the city's Police and Fire Departments were spared extensive cuts.

HEADLINE: BUSH LIFTS A BAN ON ECONOMIC TIES TO SOUTH AFRICA

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
President Bush today lifted the American economic sanctions imposed on South Africa in 1986, saying Pretoria's moves to end its system of racial separation and white minority rule were "irreversible."
Mr. Bush said the State Department had advised him that with the release of all political prisoners in recent weeks, President F. W. de Klerk had met all five conditions laid down by the sanctions legislation and therefore by executive order he was immediately ending the ban on trade with South Africa, bank loans to its Government, new investments there and airline connections. 
 But Mr. Bush noted that though he was ending the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, several other separately legislated American sanctions will remain in force. Those include limitations on South Africa's lending from the International Monetary Fund or the Export-Import Bank, a ban on all exports to South Africa's military and police, a mandatory United Nations arms embargo on South Africa, and a ban all intelligence sharing.
 
Pretoria's Eroding Isolation
 Mr. Bush's announcement at a White House news conference came only a day after the International Olympic Committee ended a 21-year ban on South African participation in Olympic competition. That and the end of American sanctions go a long way toward ending the international isolation of South Africa.
Before signing the executive order, Mr. Bush called Nelson Mandela to notify him. While Mr. Bush said he told Mr. Mandela that lifting sanctions now was "the right thing to do in order to encourage continued change," the African National Congress leader responded that Mr. Bush should have waited for more progress in dismantling apartheid before he acted.
That view was echoed with passion and anger by top Democratic leaders, the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who dispute, among other things, the State Department's assessment that all political prisoners have been released.
 
Override of Veto Is Unlikely
 But opponents of the President's decision almost certainly do not now have the two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress that they would need to reimpose sanctions over a Presidential veto.
Mr. Bush, who as Vice President opposed the original sanctions legislation as politically useless and economically harmful to the black majority, said that since the five conditions had clearly been met, he had no choice but to fulfill the law.
He pointedly added, "During the past two years we've seen a profound transformation in the situation in South Africa -- I really firmly believe that this progress is irreversible." [Excerpts from the news conference, page A10.]
The President, referring to the fact that negotiations between South African blacks and whites to establish a nonracial, multiparty democracy are still incomplete, said that "much remains to be done -- let's be very clear on that point -- and we will use all available means to encourage this process through its successful conclusion."
Pressed as to how he intended to do that without the leverage of broad economic sanctions, Mr. Bush could not point to anything specific, other than to say that he would personally discuss the situation by telephone Thursday with President de Klerk, whom he believes is committed to transforming South Africa into a multiracial democracy, and would "indicate to him, we expect progress to continue."
Apparently in an effort to blunt some of the criticism from blacks in the United States, Mr. Bush announced that he had ordered a doubling of American assistance to black South Africans, from $40 million to $80 million, for housing, economic development and education programs.
The Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen, said the Administration hoped that the lifting of sanctions by the Federal Government would also spur colleges, universities, states and local governments to immediately rescind their sanctions on South Africa, like divesting stock in multinational companies with factories there.
 
Looking for a Test Case
 Mr. Cohen said the Justice Department would be "studying possible methods" to push institutions in that direction, including possibly bringing a test case against some institution that refuses to comply.
The Justice Department, he said, "will be looking into the legal implications of states and local governments carrying out their own foreign policy with respect to South Africa."
Speaking of cities like New York, and universities that have imposed their own sanctions, Mr. Cohen said, "We would like very much for them to follow what the Federal Government has done."
Congress imposed economic sanctions on South Africa in 1986, after a bitter political battle with President Reagan, whose initial veto of the bill was overridden. The legislation banned all trade with South Africa, including the import of South African gold and other minerals, coal, textiles and agricultural products, prevented South African Airways from flying into the United States, and blocked American banks from lending money to the South African Government or making new investments there.
 
Sanctions and Investments
 Mr. Cohen said that in 1986, 250 American companies had investments in South Africa worth a total of $2.5 billion. After nearly six years of sanctions, there are only 125 companies worth about $1 billion.
When asked today whether in retrospect the sanctions worked and he should have supported them from the start, Mr. Bush equivocated.
"I can't say that sanctions had no effects," he said. "But far more important than sanctions was the fact that you had a forward-looking man of Mr. de Klerk's stature."
The end of sanctions appeared increasingly likely during the last two years, as one condition after another was apparently met.
 
State Department's Decision
 Those were: lifting the state of emergency that gave the Pretoria Government extraordinary police powers; legalizing democratic political parties; repealing the Group Areas Act, which stipulated those areas of South Africa where blacks could live, and repealing the Population Registration Act, which stipulated that all South Africans register their race at birth and accorded them different rights on that basis for the rest of their lives, and beginning serious political negotiations with "truly representative" black leaders to establish a democratic political system.
At the end of June, the State Department sent a team to investigate whether the fifth condition -- the "release of persons persecuted for their political beliefs or detained unduly without trial" had also been fully met. The South African Government had committed itself to such a full release by April 30.
After examining hundreds of case files, the State Department informed Mr. Bush on Friday that it had determined that all political prisoners -- according to its definition -- had been freed. That referred to people jailed or detained for trying to express their political beliefs, but not those incarcerated after receiving due process for crimes of violence -- even if politically motivated.
The African National Congress argues that that definition excludes many legitimate political prisoners.
Randall Robinson, President of the anti-apartheid organization, TransAfrica, argued that independent human-rights groups, like the South African Human Rights Commission and Amnesty International, affirm that there are at least 850 legitimate political prisoners remaining in South African jails.
Representative Ronald V. Dellums, the California Democrat who was the leading author of the sanctions legislation, said that in view of the still incomplete constitutional negotiations between leaders of black organizations and Mr. de Klerk, South Africa's black majority still "cannot vote and cannot hold office," so the country is still a long way from being a nonracial democracy, with one-man, one-vote.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Named for New Term As Chairman of Federal Reserve

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
President Bush announced tonight that he would nominate Alan Greenspan to another four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
The announcement was expected here and on Wall Street. But with Mr. Greenspan's current term expiring Aug. 11, mild jitters developed in the financial community in recent weeks when no word from the White House was forthcoming. 
 Appearing with Mr. Greenspan in the White House pressroom about 6 P.M., Mr. Bush said, "The respect that Alan Greenspan has around the world and in this country, particularly in financial marketplaces, is unparalleled."
Asked about his occasional complaints and those from other top Administration officials that Mr. Greenspan retarded economic expansion by keeping interest rates too high, the President said the chairman was "strongly committed to growth."
 
Influence Over Rates
 The nation's large budget deficit prevents the President or Congress from using tax and spending policies to influence the economy, and that leaves Mr. Greenspan far and away the most important economic policy maker in the Government. By controlling the money supply, the Federal Reserve has considerable influence over interest rates, a main factor in the state of the economy.
Mr. Greenspan's goal as chairman was to achieve what he and other economists often called a "soft landing" after the rapid economic growth of the mid-1980's. During his term, economy showed slow but rather steady growth until last summer, when the recession began. The inflation rate has remained in the neighborhood of 4 percent.
Speaking to reporters after his renomination was announced, Mr. Greenspan repeated what has become almost a mantra for him when he is asked about his views on the economy. He said he would "try to maintain the maximum sustainable long-term economic growth that is possible." Keeping inflation under control, he continued, is a "necessary condition" to achieve the goal of maximum growth.
Mr. Greenspan, who is 65 years old, is unusually popular in Congress, and his confirmation is unlikely to be a problem. A spokesman for Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, said the committee would hold confirmation hearings as soon as it received the formal nomination papers from the White House.
Mr. Bush did not announce today whom he intended to nominate to fill the vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board created by Martha R. Seger's resignation last spring. Senior officials said the White House had settled on Susan M. Phillips, a former chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, but apparently the final background checks have not been completed.
The Banking Committee, however, did vote today to confirm Lawrence B. Lindsey, a White House economist, to fill another vacancy on the board and to promote David W. Mullins Jr., a current member, to be vice chairman. Senator Riegle and four other Democrats voted against Mr. Lindsey, whom they view as too conservative.
The full Senate is expected to vote on those nominations this week or next, and confirmation is not in doubt.
On Wall Street, leading market strategists said they were reassured by Mr. Greenspan's reappointment and believed it indicated monetary policy would continue on its current course.
"This is a reaffirmation of support by the Administration for the monetary policy that is in place," said Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company, an investment advisory firm in New York. "I think the markets would have been greatly distraught if the chairman had not been reappointed."
Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and critic of Federal Reserve as an institution, said of the central bank, "As long as it exists, Alan is as good a person as there is."
In addition to naming Mr. Greenspan to another four-year term as chairman, Mr. Bush nominated him for an additional 14-year term as member of the Federal Reserve Board. But governors rarely serve their full terms, and no one expects Mr. Greenspan to continue on the board when he is no longer chairman.
 
Replaced Volcker
 Mr. Greenspan, a professional economic forecaster and consultant who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Ford Administration, took his seat as Fed chairman on Aug. 11, 1987, replacing Paul A. Volcker, who had served the previous eight years.
Mr. Greenspan has run the Fed in a much more collegial way than Mr. Volcker did, encouraging other governors to express their views. At times, that has made it appear as if the central bank was speaking with more than one voice. But Mr. Greenspan has never been in the minority on a vote and, so far as is known, the Fed policy has been basically his.
The Greenspan style has been not to impose sweeping changes but to make regular small adjustments in the interest rates the central bank controls, particularly the Federal funds rate. That is the rate banks pay each other for short-term loans and often serves as a benchmark for commercial rates.
 
Worried About Inflation
 That rate was 6 1/2 percent when Mr. Greenspan became chairman. Worried about inflation, he allowed it to rise steadily until it reached almost 10 percent in the spring of 1989. Since then, he has slowly driven the Federal funds rate down to 5 3/4 percent, where it now stands.
The most controversial aspect of Mr. Greenspan's tenure was his judgment to leave the rate unchanged from December 1989 until July 1990. The economy hardly grew at all during that period, and many economists felt he should have lowered rates to give it a lift.
In part, Mr. Greenspan was hamstrung by his promise to lower rates if the President and Congress agreed on a way to reduce the budget deficit. With the politicians deadlocked for months, Mr. Greenspan had little room to maneuver.
 
Blame for the Recession
 Records now show that the recession began in July. Mr. Greenspan has attributed the downturn primarily to the uncertainty that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August and on the unusually tight lending policies at banks. Many economists, however, hold Mr. Greenspan and the Federal Reserve primarily responsible for the recession.
Once the President and Congress struck the budget deal in October, the Fed began to drive down interest rates on an almost weekly basis.
Mr. Bush's renomination of Mr. Greenspan almost certainly means that the Bush Administration has decided that the recession is a short and mild one that the President can weather politically. Had the recession been long and deep like the one in 1982 and 1983, Mr. Greenspan would probably have been made a scapegoat, much the way the owners of baseball teams fire their managers in a losing season.
In the months ahead, Mr. Greenspan will be faced with the question of how much to encourage the economy to grow during what most forecasters believe will be a rather tepid recovery. The first sign of Fed policy came last week when, according to Government officials, policy makers decided not to change the targets for money supply growth for 1992.
Some Federal Reserve officials wanted to lower the range slightly to signal the markets that the Fed was determined to wring inflation out of the economy. The decision that was made seemed to indicate that the central bank regarded a strong recovery as at least as important as reducing inflation.

HEADLINE: Raising Hurdle for Coliseum, Judge Orders Clean-Air Plan

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
A Federal judge ruled yesterday that a massive, long-disputed skyscraper project in Columbus Circle can go forward but will be halted if New York City fails to come up with a plan by late next year to meet Federal air-quality standards in all five boroughs.
The ruling creates another hurdle for a project that has been hobbled by lawsuits and declining economic conditions. It has been revised and scaled down twice since it was proposed in 1985. The ruling also appears to hold the project hostage to force the city to meet the federally imposed deadline by November 1992 to specify how it will control air pollution. 
 The judge, Shirley Wohl Kram of Federal District Court in Manhattan, dismissed many of the claims against the project. But opponents said that the order she issued could be fatal to the office, commercial and residential complex because the city has been unable to meet earlier deadlines for a plan.
"If you were a developer planning to spend X hundreds of millions of dollars, would you do it with that threat hanging over your head?" said John T. Van Der Tuin, a lawyer who represented two coalitions, a travel agency and three individuals in the civil lawsuit filed against the city and the developers last year. "My conclusion is that it will not be built."
City officials gave a mixed reaction to the ruling. Victor A. Kovner, the city's Corporation Counsel, said he was pleased that the judge approved the start of the project but added that "we are very troubled that the judge has found the city in violation of the Clean Air Act."
 
Talk of an Appeal
 "We will in all likelihood seek appellate review on that issue," he said.
Representatives of the developer, Boston Properties, owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, said they could not comment because they had not yet read the decision. At present, Mr. Zuckerman has agreed to buy the 4.5-acre site from the city if the project is approved. But he has not yet signed an agreement with any large tenant.
The latest blueprint for the project calls for a 752-foot-high, twin-towered structure to be built at the southwest corner of Central Park. The sale of the city-owned land for the complex would mean $338 million in revenue at a time of severe fiscal distress. Because of the slumping real estate market, questions had arisen lately about who would occupy the office space.
The project has fueled controversy since its inception. The original proposal would have built a 925-foot-high tower whose shadow, opponents claimed, would have blocked much of the sunlight over Central Park. That plan was defeated in court.
In reaching her opinion on summary judgment, which both sides had requested in lieu of a trial, Judge Kram reviewed the history of the city's compliance with Federal air-quality rules. She did not seem to find it encouraging.
"The city officials' intentions, or indeed the amount of money they have allocated to the problem, unfortunately do not necessarily bear any relation to the likely success of this program," Judge Kram wrote. "By all indications, the city is well on its way to missing the Nov. 15, 1992, deadline, as it has missed each of the others set for it by Congress."
"The city is depending on income from this project to put towards subway improvement and other public programs," the judge wrote. "The public's interest in funding these other city undertakings must be considered as well.
 
$15 Million Minimum Fine
 "Nevertheless, the court will not permit the city to persevere, undeterred, in its violation of these congressionally mandated and agency-implemented deadlines," she said.
The judge included an order that would stop work on the project unless the city meets a deadline of Nov. 15, 1992, for an air-quality plan. She also set a $15 million minimum fine for the city and the developers, which "will be followed by additional fines until such time as the city and the project sponsors fully comply with their statutory obligations."
In discussing air-quality requirements, the judge focused on carbon-monoxide levels already present in New York City's air. Under rules put into effect last year by the Environmental Protection Agency, new projects must figure out a way to help control air-quality violations even if they did not cause them, especially in "hard-core hot spots," like 59th Street near the site. 
On other specific complaints in the lawsuit, Judge Kram ruled in favor of the defendants or dismissed the complaints. For example, on a question of whether there were plans to enlarge a garage at the site, she found in favor of the city, which had moved to dismiss the claim. On the question of whether a conflict of interest existed because a former Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee, Robert Selsam, went to work for Boston Properties, Judge Kram dismissed the claim because the plaintiffs did not specify what relief they wanted.
Other points raised in the lawsuit include the sale of city Industrial Development Authority bonds for the complex. The plaintiffs, who included two coalitions, three neighborhood residents and a travel agency that would be displaced by the construction, had said the Industrial Development Authority was illegally involved in a residential project. But the judge ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing to raise the issue, and dismissed the claim.

HEADLINE: Newmark & Lewis to Close 11 Jersey Stores

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Newmark & Lewis Inc., the New York area's biggest retailer of electronics and appliances, will close 11 of its 14 stores in New Jersey because of poor business and high operating costs, the company said yesterday.
There had been persistent reports in the appliance industry that Newmark & Lewis was about to close the stores because of continuing losses from slumping home-appliance sales. Asked yesterday about those reports, Warren G. Hyman, Newmark & Lewis's co-chairman and co-chief executive, confirmed that the company had placed advertisements today in New Jersey newspapers announcing the closings and a liquidation sale of floor models. 
 Newmark & Lewis bought the 14 New Jersey stores in May 1990 by acquiring Brick Church Appliance Inc. for $7.8 million.
The stores to be closed, which represent about 25 percent of Newmark & Lewis's total sales, will leave the chain, based in Hicksville, L.I., with 56 stores in the New York area. The company's inability to turn around the former Brick Church stores reflects the severe pressures of cost-cutting, low margins and slow sales that have afflicted many appliance and electronics retailers around the nation.
In the last two years consumers have sharply curtailed their purchases of televisions, washers and dryers, and other household durables.
One of the country's largest electronics chains, Highland Superstores, based in Plymouth, Mich., recently took steps to stem losses by closing more than 30 stores in several states and eliminating six vice-presidential positions. Highland in the first quarter, ending April 30, had sales of $170.1 million, down from $185.3 million the year before. Its net loss increased sharply to $90.1 million from a loss of $6.6 million a year earlier.
But Circuit City Stores, the industry's largest electronics chain, has begun solving its problems. Circuit City reversed its 1990 quarter loss of $43 million with a net profit of $8 million in the first quarter. Sales rose to $562.1 million from $490.1 million.
Mr. Hyman said yesterday that Newmark & Lewis was closing the stores because of "the severity of the retailing climate in the Northeast and the fact that we want to consolidate our assets."
"A major problem," he said, "was the high cost of advertising and distribution in New Jersey."
He said that the stores in Paramus, Wayne and Jersey City would remain open. Those being closed are in Edison, Greenbrook, Marlboro, Tinton Falls, Toms River, Union, Hanover, Orange, Rahway, Rockaway and Newark. All the properties are leased by Newmark & Lewis.
The closing stores have a total of 60 to 80 employees, and a company spokesman said some of them would be offered jobs at other Newmark & Lewis locations.
Newmark & Lewis had a net loss of $5.26 million in the quarter ended April 30, compared with a loss of $1.14 million in the corresponding period in 1990. Sales were up for the more recent period, rising to $55.1 million, from $52.2 million the year before.
But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange and Commission this week, the company said that same-store sales in the recent quarter fell 15.2 percent, "reflecting the deepening economic decline of the Northeast."
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, the company reported sales of $246 million, compared with $238 million the year before. But net profits amounted to only $71,000, compared with $2.36 million in the prior year.
Newmark & Lewis told the S.E.C. that its 14 New Jersey stores had sales of $61.3 million for the year ended Jan. 31, translating into a net annual loss for the group of $1.96 million. The company said it was taking a $3 million write-off for the 11 stores to be closed.
Some competitors said Newmark & Lewis's New Jersey stores farthest from New York City were plagued by the highest distribution costs.

HEADLINE: Patricia Robbins Beatty, Wrote Children's Books on the West, 68

BYLINE: By JOAN COOK

 BODY:
Patricia Robbins Beatty, an award-winning author of 50 children's books, died on Tuesday at the Riverside (Calif.) Community Hospital. She was 68 years old and lived in Riverside.
She died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said. 
 Mrs. Beatty's books were generally admired for their evocation of both the humor and the harsh realities of the American West in the 19th century. Her more recent novels, including "Charley Skedaddle" (1987), which won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, dealt with the Civil War.
She was born in Portland, Ore., and spent much of her childhood in the Northwest, sometimes living on Indian reservations. She graduated from Reed College in Portland and became a children's librarian and a high school teacher of English and history.
She began to write when her children were small and drew on her knowledge of the Quileute Indians for her first book, "The Indian Canoe Maker," published in 1960 by Caxton Press. Eleven books that followed were written in collaboration with her first husband, Dr. John L. Beatty, a professor of history at the University of California at Riverside, who died in 1975.
In 1974, she received an award for a distinguished body of work from the Southern California Council on Children's Literature. In 1988, she established the John and Patricia Beatty Award through the California Library Association to encourage the writing of children's books about the culture and heritage of California.
A forthcoming book, "Jayhawker," the story of a young abolitionist during the Civil War, is to be published by Morrow Junior Books in October.
She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Carl Uhr, a professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside; a daughter, Alexandra Beatty, and two grandchildren.

A Plan for Saving the Children

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

When the Bough Breaks
The Cost of Neglecting Our Children
By Sylvia Ann Hewlett
Illustrated. 346 pages. Basic Books/HarperCollins. $22.95.
Yes, another Cassandra come to warn us about what we are doing to the children. But Sylvia Ann Hewlett doesn't only wring our hearts in her passionately argued "When the Bough Breaks: The Cost of Neglecting Our Children." She tries to wring our pocketbooks as well. And she makes some very good sense. 
 Surveying the wreckage of the homeless poor and the untended rich, Ms. Hewlett points out some of the obvious landmarks. More and more American women are going to work these days, either out of financial need or in a search for psychic self-fulfillment. The consequences for their children, she insists, are often malign. Parental neglect leads to emotional instability, which in turn produces poor performance at school, which in the longer run weakens the work force, making America less competitive in the world economy.
While the children suffer this parental neglect, the state, in its rush to Reaganomics, has abdicated its responsibility to provide a safety net, she argues. "True, some children continue to be raised in supportive communities by thoughtful, attentive parents, but the larger fact is . . . an anti-child spirit is loose in the land."
As an economist and a former director of a labor-management think tank, the Economic Policy Council, Ms. Hewlett has gathered persuasive evidence to back up her argument. And where concrete illustration fails, she pelts us into submission with statistics.
The case she makes has dire implications. As the national work force shrinks, owing to the end of the baby-boom generation, employers are growing increasingly dependent on women and minorities. So we are caught in the proverbial vicious circle. In the short run, the problem of neglected children is exacerbated. In the long run, a consequently weakened work force is less and less able to fill increasingly demanding jobs.
Ms. Hewlett has imaginative solutions to these problems. But they depend on reversing certain trends in contemporary American culture, and here her book gets into difficulty. She blames the declining status of our children on a national spirit of "Now-now-ism," an unwillingness to sacrifice for the future.
She blames a new "therapeutic mentality," which "focuses on the self, rather than on a set of external obligations." She blames no-fault divorce laws that allow fathers too easily to escape paying for support of their children. She blames the political right for overvaluing the family, and thereby denying its need for state aid. She blames the left for undervaluing the family, by putting too much emphasis on individual fulfillment.
All of which may be valid so far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. By calling the search for self the "therapeutic mentality," she sullies legitimate forms of psychotherapy, which demand transcendence of the self. More important, she has failed to grasp the root of whatever it is that has driven our age to self-indulgence, whether it be the bomb or the death of God or the accelerating pace of technological change or simply sunspots.
But then Ms. Hewlett has a tendency to simplify things. She writes of Tom Wolfe's recent novel about New York as if its title contained no irony: "Despite the excesses of the 1980's, when this nation built a great 'bonfire of the vanities.' . . ." Of course, that's exactly what this nation didn't do. And after a passage describing the profoundly complex problem of crack babies she appends the comment, "All of which could so easily be avoided." Oh, yes, so very easily.
Still, if one could reverse the flow of history by waving a wand, or by shouting from a rooftop, or by writing a book, her prescription would have enormous appeal. It would profit corporate America, she insists, to create a family-friendly workplace. Such policies would improve recruitment, reduce absenteeism, diminish turnover, increase productivity and enhance company image. In fact, they already have, she concludes, to judge from many coporate programs that have recently been started.
But "a thousand points of light" will not suffice, she writes. "Government cannot pass the buck and pretend that business can somehow 'fix' the problem of underachievement and failure among our children." So Ms. Hewlett calls for a Federal plan involving a "National Task Force on Children," "parenting leave," "prenatal and maternity care," "child care," "educational reform," "housing policy," "tax reform," "workplace policy," "divorce reform" and "volunteer efforts." Such a plan would not only pay, she argues, it would also be "the right thing to do."
Despite her evangelical tone and an occasional shallowness in her reasoning, what is compelling about Ms. Hewlett's case is her argument that America's greatest weaknesses of the moment could be turned to its advantage. Any investment now would eventually pay for itself and then some, she reasons. As Benjamin Franklin observed in Poor Richard's Almanack (1758), "What maintains one vice would bring up two children." Ms. Hewlett lends new life to this simply practical remark.
Some three decades later, in 1791, Georges Jacques Danton, the revolutionist, told the French Convention, "The time has come to establish the principle that children belong to the Republic before they belong to their parents." Ms. Hewlett's book revivifies this observation too. She wants a new revolution to happen. But she wants its cutting edge to be not the guillotine, but the restoration of the family.

Brazil Coach Inherits Tradition and Little Else

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
After a decade of decline, when money, talent and fans were in short supply, Brazilian soccer has taken the first step in its effort to dominate the sport worldwide again.
The short-term goal is to win the 1994 World Cup, to be held for the first time in the United States. With that in mind, but with little in the way of resources to make it happen, the Brazilian Soccer Federation has placed its hopes on a new coach and hired Paulo Roberto Falcao to guide the team. 
 After enthralling fans in Brazil and Italy with his elegant style on the field in the 1970's and 80's, Falcao was appointed coach of Brazil's national soccer team late last year. Fans hope that he can do for soccer-crazy Brazil what Franz Beckenbauer did for West Germany in 1990: switch from star player to coach of a World Cup winner.
 
Those Were the Days
 But the 37-year-old Falcao has an uphill battle ahead of him. The country that produced three World Cup champions and some of the most creative soccer in the world now finds its game in deep crisis.
The days when Brazilian players were distinguished by their ability to use their feet for dazzling dribbling, their brains for sudden improvisation and their souls for almost poetic touches are gone.
These days, the Brazilian national team dazzles only for its inability to score goals or even make easy passes.
"There is a lack of talent here and in the rest of the world," Falcao admitted in a recent interview as his car made its way through a traffic jam in downtown Rio. "The country's unstable economic situation led clubs into financial crisis. They have no money to invest in the juniors category, where potential talents are developed."
 Moreover, leaders of the soccer federation have been criticized for putting more effort into keeping their positions in the organization than improving the team, as well as for the erratic nature of their scheduling. For example, schedules have been changed at the last minute, an enormous logistical imposition in a country so large.
The federation "is the stepmother of Brazilian clubs," says Marcio Braga, president of Flamengo, Rio's most popular team. "There is no way of making a strong team without strong clubs. Falcao has the skills to do a very good job, but he arrived at a very bad moment."
Modest enough to recognize that Brazil is no longer a soccer powerhouse, Falcao is working to put together a Brazilian team that blends physique and technique. The European style of playing -- faster and more physical -- has imposed itself on the game, obliging Brazil to de-emphasize its artistic style.
 Falcao is hampered by the fact that many of the best Brazilian players have gone to play in Europe. These clubs will not release the players for the Brazilian national team's warm-up games. So he is experimenting with different players from different clubs each time the national team plays a game. So far, however, the results have been less than impressive.
In 10 warm-up games for the current America Cup tournament in Chile, there were two victories, two defeats and six ties. There were signs of progress last month when Brazil beat Bulgaria, 3-0, in its best game since Falcao took over.
On Tuesday night, Brazil played its first match in the America Cup and defeated Bolivia, 2-1, at Vina del Mar, Chile. It will face Uruguay tonight in its next first-round game of the tournament.
"These scores don't bother me," Falcao said of the warm-up matches. "My goal is to win the 1994 World Cup. Until then, I have plenty of time. Meanwhile, I must work with what I have, and what I have are good players who need to be trained. Practice plays, step by step, until they know them by heart. Then -- and only then -- will they be able to create individual moves."
Falcao speaks from experience. In 1982 in Spain, he played in the midfield on the Brazilian World Cup team that was widely acclaimed as the competition's most talented. But it lost in the semifinals to Italy, the eventual champion. "At the time, we were efficient but not effective," Falcao says.
Falcao was born into a poor family in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio, Grande do Sul. During his childhood he played soccer on the street before joining the Internacional club, where his coach nicknamed him "the little maestro."
He became a professional at Internacional in 1972 and led the team to three national championships and three state championships.
In 1980 he moved to Europe, joining A.S. Roma in Italy for $3 million, and in 1981 led the team to its best showing in four decades. His performance during his four-year stay in Rome not only opened the Italian market to Brazilian players -- causing trouble for the national team he now leads -- but also earned him the nickname King of Rome.

HEADLINE: Business and the Law;
Trying to Assess Court Nominee

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder

 BODY:
IF Clarence Thomas is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, he will be the only member of the current Court to have worked in a major company. For two and a half years in the late 1970's, Judge Thomas was an in-house lawyer at the Monsanto Company.
That background is one reason that business groups have high hopes that Judge Thomas, President Bush's nominee to replace Thurgood Marshall, will be a stronger voice for their interests. 
 Mr. Thomas's brief career as a judge provides a scanty track record, and much of the guessing about him is based on his seven years as head of the Equal Opportunity Commission under President Ronald Reagan. During those years, the commission sharply reduced the number of class actions it filed under anti-discrimination laws, focusing instead on individual claims that were far less burdensome to industry.
One hope of the business community is that Judge Thomas, if confirmed, could help put more business cases on the docket. Four of the nine Justices must vote to hear a case before it is added to the court's calendar, and it is widely assumed that business cases were not a high priority of Justice Marshall.
"We have trouble getting some important cases heard," said Stephen Bokat, general counsel for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "This may make a difference."
How Judge Thomas's business background influenced him is unclear, but some lawyers who have appeared before him in the Court of Appeals on business cases in the last two years say he has demonstrated a grasp of the commercial details. "He asked a lot of real-world questions," said Richard Leighton, a Washington lawyer who represented Alpo Pet Foods Inc. in an appeal of complicated litigation with the Ralston Purina Company.
Judge Thomas's opinion in the Alpo case overturned a $10.4 million award against Ralston that had been based on its profits. He laid out an alternative approach to measuring damages that could eventually result in a higher award for Alpo.
The ruling also limited an injunction that had prevented Ralston not just from advertising its disputed claims that its pet food produced stronger bones in dogs but also from presenting papers on the theoretical basis for the claims at scientific conferences. And the opinion set out an extremely tough standard for proving that a company had willfully violated the Lanham Act, the Federal statute governing the advertising in the case.
"It's turned out to be the leading Federal case on false advertising damages and the subject of several Lanham Act seminars," Mr. Leighton said.
The Alpo case suggested that Judge Thomas might be sensitive to inhibitions on academic and commercial speech. So did his support of the opinion in May by Chief Judge Abner Mikva, one of the District of Columbia Circuit's noted liberals, overturning legislation backed by the Bush Administration that would have banned televised broadcasts of indecent material. Siding with broadcasters and civil liberties groups, the court said the Constitution's protection of free speech required that some window of time when few children would be viewing should be available for such broadcasts.
The Alpo case was the first indication that suggests that Judge Thomas may have conservative views about the use of punitive damages in commercial cases. He later sided with Judge James Buckley in a 2-to-1 ruling opposed by Judge Mikva that set aside a $50 million punitive damages award against Korean Air Lines in connection with the downing of a plane in 1983 by the Soviet Union.
As an appeals court judge in Washington, most of the non-criminal cases Judge Thomas has heard have involved litigation over decisions -- or refusals to make decisions -- by Federal agencies. He has a mixed record in cases where business and Government interests have clashed.
His votes suggest, for instance, that publishers and broadcasters stand little chance of winning his support in efforts to get Government agencies to turn over information under the Freedom of Information Act. On the other hand, he strongly rejected the Government's efforts to impose a heavy burden of proof on two oil drilling equipment companies that their merger would not be anti-competitive. In another case, he joined two colleagues in rejecting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision that a contract between two power companies was so unambiguous that the agency did not have to hold a hearing on a dispute between them.
"He was quiet for a long time and then weighed in heavily, quoting from memory a portion of the contract that challenged the agency's attorney," said Bernard Wruble, a Washington lawyer who represented the Cajun Electric Power Cooperative in the case.
In another case that some lawyers say indicated a pro-business stance, Judge Thomas last month upheld the Federal Aviation Administration approval of plans to expand an airport near Toledo, Ohio, which would clear the way for an air freight company to move there from South Bend, Ind. His opinion said the agency had not abused its authority in accepting an environmental impact statement that focused solely on the Toledo area.
The case was not the only one in which Judge Thomas read environmental laws narrowly. In Cross-Sound Ferry Services Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, he said Cross-Sound had no right to get the I.C.C. to review the environmental impact of a new company, Viking Starship, that planned a ferry service across Long Island Sound.

HEADLINE: De Klerk's Victory;
Without Resolving the Issue of Power, Pretoria Regains World Acceptance

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 10

 BODY:
With the lifting of American economic sanctions against South Africa today, President F. W. de Klerk has received the most significant foreign endorsement yet of his contention that the dismantling of apartheid that he began last year will not be reversed.
 By leading South Africa back into international acceptance after years of isolation for its racist policies, Mr. de Klerk is fulfilling his promise to whites that the respectability gained will outweigh their loss of privilege over the black majority. 
 Yet the pressure is being relaxed on Pretoria when black South Africans still have no vote and no power in a Government that remains white-dominated, a contradiction that the African National Congress and other proponents of continued sanctions were quick to point out today.
 
Impact of U.S. Move
 Political and business analysts here say that the impact of Mr. Bush's decision is more likely to be more immediately apparent on the political climate here than on foreign trade and investment, even though expectations that the sanctions would be lifted sent stocks soaring today on the Johannesburg stock exchange.
"It is a re-entry and acceptance back into the international community," said Wayne Mitchell, the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce here. "It's going to build business confidence."
The white euphoria, however, was not shared by the African National Congress and other black organizations, which warned that the lifting of sanctions was premature and could embolden the Government to drag its feet on a transition to majority rule. They pointed out that blacks have no vote yet and have been left impoverished by apartheid.
 
Benefits to Blacks Stressed
 But Mr. de Klerk, in a statement tonight, stressed that blacks would benefit from an expanding economy unfettered by sanctions.
"The removal of these sanctions," Mr. de Klerk said, "will contribute to the revival of our economy to the benefit of all South Africans -- especially those disadvantaged South Africans who have borne the brunt of sanctions, including many of the unemployed."
Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha, who read Mr. de Klerk's statement to a news conference, said the most important thing about Mr. Bush's message was its psychological impact in Africa and worldwide.
"It is his expression of his belief in the irreversibility of the process of change in this country and his belief that the time has come for South Africans to be encouraged to go to the negotiating table and draw up a new constitution," Mr. Botha said.
The lifting of sanctions by Washington is an awkward setback for the African National Congress, which wanted the sanctions maintained. At its national conference last week, Nelson Mandela said the congress needed sanctions as a weapon "until a democratic constitution has been adopted."
The congress, in a statement read by its new secretary general, Cyril Ramaphosa, said Mr. Bush's decision was premature because political violence continues to inhibit free political activity and because many political prisoners remained in jail.
"Progress should be judged not only by fine words but by actual deeds, and such progress cannot be determined by the South African Government nor accepted on its word alone," Mr. Ramaphosa said.
The more radical Pan-Africanist Congress called Mr. Bush's announcement "a sugar-coated poison tablet" and said it would press for other sanctions to continue "until all vestiges of white racist minority rule have been removed and the masses of our people have placed in power a government which truly represents them."
The South African Council of Churches, which is aligned with the African National Congress, also criticized the American action.
"Unfortunately, the struggle is not over yet and we fear that the premature lifting of sanctions will mean that one of the major incentives motivating the South African Government to change, will be lost," said the council's secretary general, Frank Chikane.
But the leader of the more conservative Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, described the American action as the best news in years. Chief Buthelezi has long opposed sanctions.
Since Feb. 2, 1990, President de Klerk has legalized the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations, released Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, lifted the national state-of-emergency regulations, drastically curtailed security legislation, invited black leaders to negotiate the country's future and secured the repeal of major apartheid laws.
The Bush Administration contended that by doing so, Mr. de Klerk fulfilled the conditions for the repeal of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, though he maintained that he was not moving to get sanctions lifted.
Mr. Botha said he hoped other countries now would follow suit and lift their own sanctions.
Earlier this year, the European Community announced plans to lift its bans on imports of iron, steel and gold coins, but this was subsequently blocked by Denmark's refusal to go along with the other 11 member nations.
South Africa's trade with the rest of Africa has already reached $4 billion a year. At its summit conference in Nigeria last month, the Organization of African Unity also said it would review its sanctions policy "should the South African Government adopt measures which lead to positive, profound and irreversible change towards the abolition of apartheid."
Japan, which has an annual trade turnover with South Africa of about $4 billion, also promised to review its sanctions policy after the apartheid legislation was scrapped, but Tokyo was believed to be waiting for Washington to make the first move.

In "Growing Up with Help from Penelope Leach" [June 13], Carol Lawson wrote that Dr. Leach has been criticized by members of the American child-care establishment for saying that "something like full-time mother care for several months is best for a new infant." 
 Actually, the two experts you quoted did not refute this point, but simply stressed that such care is not often possible due to economic and other pressures.
I, however, appreciate Dr. Leach's clear and unapologetic focus on what is best for an infant.
How tragic it would be if we all dismissed her advice on the basis of its "impracticality" rather than its substance!

HEADLINE: Small Towns Grow Lonelier as Bus Stops Stopping

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEDALIA, Mo.

 BODY:
Until the strike came, the silver and blue Greyhound Americruisers rumbled in from St. Louis and Kansas City and helped keep this shrinking city of 19,800 connected to the world outside. About 50 people a month boarded the bus at the two-room brick station that Jim and Rita Fairfax built four years ago.
Today, the bus station is a laundromat. Mary F. Pummill, a widow who is legally blind, once could walk to the station and get a bus any day of the week. Now she has to rely on a twice-a-month shuttle bus primarily for elderly people when she wants to see her doctors in Columbia, about 60 miles away. Charlotte Williams, who retired to Sedalia from Chicago three years ago, said she now gets rides from friends to bus and train stations 30 miles away or more or pays high taxi fares. 
 "If you're here and you don't have somebody to take you somewhere, you're here," said Mrs. Fairfax, whose husband has moved a bail bond business into the building.
Sedalia, home of the Missouri State Fair and reputed birthplace of Scott Joplin's ragtime rhythms, was a stop on a 110-mile route across Missouri that Greyhound abandoned on March 2, 1990, the day its drivers went on strike for higher wages. Overnight five small cities lost all service, probably for good, and the state capital of Jefferson City, which is also on the route, has next to none.
 
Rural America Hardest Hit
 The strike, which immediately wiped out a dozen or so similar routes linking small American cities and towns, continues to this day. Nonunion drivers handle the trips that Greyhound still makes. The bus company estimates that 95 percent of the passengers it served when the strike started still take the bus.
But most of those passengers live on the East and West Coasts. Industry analysts say the company has abandoned about 400 of the 3,800 places that it regularly used to serve. Small independent operators have taken over some routes, but service to others has been lost.
Some bus routes were bound for extinction anyway, and the strike simply hastened the inevitable. "Where it's declined is in rural America," said Robin Diamond, spokeswoman for the American Bus Association, "and the reason is that the population just isn't there to support the bus."
Even those communities that were directly affected by the strike have not been crippled by it. Rather, the Greyhound walkout simply joins the array of other social and economic forces that have turned the downtowns and courthouse squares of these little places into somnolent artifacts. Long gone in Sedalia are the good-paying jobs along the now-desolate railroad sidings here. So are other jobs on increasingly mechanized farms.
Most passengers on the Sedalia route were transients, college students, the poor and elderly, Amish farm families, inmates on leave from prisons or servicemen on leave from Whiteman Air Force Base. They could not drive or did not have cars.
Now they can take taxis or hitch rides to a station in Boonville, 40 miles away, but the bus that stops there can't take them to their friends and relatives who live along the old route through here. An Amtrak train stops here, but it goes to none of the other abandoned towns on the route, and it usually costs more.
Mayor Steven J. Dust of Sedalia has heard little alarm -- perhaps, he speculated, because people who need the bus do not know how to make themselves heard politically. Or perhaps, he said, they had come to accept the writing on the wall, with the erosion of interstate bus service over many years.
Until the early 1980's four buses, two going east along Highway 50 and two west, went through Sedalia. Then the service was halved. And months before 6,300 Amalgamated Transit Union drivers walked out, Missouri granted Greyhound approval to end its service here in late 1989 on the ground that it was a chronic money loser.
 
Number of Routes Halved
 The company will not say how many American communities have been stranded. But as examples of other deserted routes it mentions a 90-mile stretch of Route 40 in Indiana; a 100-mile run in Wisconsin from Ashland to Minocqua; and one in Alabama running 75 miles south on Route 43 from Eutaw, southwest of Tuscaloosa, to Thomasville. Along each line, typically, five or six towns lost the bus.
These recent closings are just the latest by the bus industry that have reduced the number of sites where buses stop from 20,000 two decades ago, to 15,000 in 1983, to around 9,000 now, according to industry estimates.
The old Missouri route started about 75 miles west of St. Louis, along Interstate 70, turning south on Highway 54, with a stop in Fulton, the first of the abandoned cities but still close to the interstate.
The toll of the loss starts to build where the bus turned west at Jefferson City onto Highway 50. There, at the station Greyhound abandoned, an independent company provides two buses a day, one heading north and one south, but nothing goes east and west on the old Greyhound route.
 
Forgotten Villages
 From the capital this time of year, the bus would roll west past prairie hills and farms; past fields now dotted with four-foot-high rolls of freshly harvested hay; past emerald-green, half-grown corn; past motionless ponds and patches of oak, alongside the Union Pacific tracks carrying 50-car freight trains.
It made regular stops in California, Tipton, Sedalia and Knob Noster, site of the Whiteman Air Force Base. It also made flag stops, letting people wave it down, at villages of a few hundred people, like Saint Martins, Centertown, McGirk, Syracuse, Smithton, Dresden and La Monte.
At Tipton, a highway sign announces "a friendly place to live and work" with a population of 2,377. Geneva Fischer, a 66-year-old widow who recently retired after 35 years as office manager of The Tipton Times, the local weekly newspaper, is among Greyhound's stranded.
Mrs. Fischer said she is fearful of driving and does not feel competent to drive anywhere but around Tipton. Without the bus service, she sees her son from Jefferson City when he drives over, but she rarely sees her sister in Sedalia, whom she used to visit every month or so. "Now we use the telephone mostly," she said.
 
Competition From Airlines
 The demise of bus service here and in many rural communities occurred for many reasons. One was the spread of the interstate highway system in the 1950's and 60's, which drew development and businesses from small downtowns to highway interchanges. Another reason was the deregulation of airlines in the 1970's and bus lines in the 1980's. And the formation of Amtrak in 1971 brought a slow resurgence of passenger rail service.
Over some big-city to big-city routes, airlines drove fares even below those of buses. To survive, the bus companies drove down their own fares, leaving them with less of a cushion from high-profit routes in the populous West and East to maintain the more costly service in the thinly populated Middle West.
Except for cars, though, the intercity bus still covers much more ground than the competition. A study two years ago by Robert R. Nathan Associates, an economics consulting firm in Washington, found that compared with 10,000 communities where buses stopped in 1987, the last year studied, scheduled airlines reached 477 and Amtrak 498.
"Roughly a third of Greyhound passengers begin or end a trip in a rural or small town area," said Frederic D. Fravel, a transportation consultant in Bethesda, Md., who did a study of the industry for Greyhound last year. "There is a market out there, and that market hasn't disappeared. If the industry could hold costs down, it could probably make money." Government subsidies approaching the magnitudes given airlines and Amtrak to service rural areas would help, he said.
 
'A Managed Shutdown'
 For Charlotte Williams, Sedalia seemed a desirable retirement spot after a career as an administrator for Swift and Company in Chicago. She determined that from Sedalia, she could take the bus to visit relatives in other parts of Missouri and in Texas.
Living in Chicago, Miss Williams said she never felt a need to drive, so she never learned. She can still get back to Chicago by train, but otherwise she is now largely confined to Sedalia unless she wants to hire a taxi to drive her 30 miles to the nearest bus stop.
Miss Williams blames both the company and the public authorities. Citing Greyhound's slow reduction in service before the abandonment, she said: "I think it was a managed shutdown. And I think the city of Sedalia just sat back on its haunches and let it happen."
But how can a city official persuade a company that it ought to keep picking up four dozen people a month? Inevitably, the demise of Greyhound service invites questions here of the conflicting interests of private gain and public need.
"As a business person, I am absolutely convinced that the economics of bus service to Sedalia, Mo., simply do not work any more," said Mayor Dust, who is also a builder.
"But I think there are people who lost a great deal of mobility," he said. "I think it has left a group of people in our community without any public transportation at all."

HEADLINE: Iraq's Nuclear Menace

 BODY:
Ever so grudgingly, Iraq now admits that it was conducting a secret uranium enrichment program, thus tacitly conceding it was hellbent on making nuclear arms. Worse yet, it's still trying to conceal a starker truth, that it has come closer to making a bomb than the U.S. suspected.
That shocking news, from knowledgeable Iraqi defectors, reveals that Saddam Hussein remains a regional threat despite the crushing defeat that was supposed to have neutralized him. Even a single nuclear bomb in the hands of a ruthless dictator is menace enough. A nuclear production capability, if undetected, could multiply the risk of attacks and of nuclear blackmail. 
 The newly understood danger is rightly prompting the U.S. and its Persian Gulf war allies to reconsider how best to disarm Iraq of its terror weapons once and for all. But the dismaying fact is that no sure-fire method exists. Bombing Iraqi nuclear facilities during the war failed to destroy all the nuclear materials.
Trying to eliminate Saddam Hussein might backfire. If he feels himself a target, the Iraqi strongman will have little incentive to hand over his nuclear materials. The best answer is to gain international support for more vigorous inspection and for keeping the pressure on Iraq.
The latest revelations surprised many intelligence experts. Before the war, Iraq was judged to be 5 to 10 years away from a full-fledged nuclear arsenal and bomb-making capacity. The more imminent threat came from 100 pounds of known weapons-grade nuclear material that was checked periodically by international inspectors; by worst-case assessment, it could have been turned into a bomb in a year or less.
What's new is that Iraqi informants have told U.S. intelligence of a clandestine electromagnetic process Baghdad was using to separate weapons-grade material. The process has already produced about 90 pounds of uranium, some of it highly enriched. That's enough to make a bomb. And it shows that Baghdad is still lying when it claims to have produced only one pound of enriched uranium clandestinely.
The need to keep nuclear weapons out of Iraq's hands grows more urgent. But none of the three main options look very promising. Bombing nuclear sites, while superficially attractive, is no more likely to eliminate Iraq's nuclear capability than it did during the gulf war. Iraq has been squirreling away uranium and other nuclear material, making it difficult to target. And some of Iraq's nuclear facilities are concealed and hardened.
Another, facile option is to overthrow or kill Saddam Hussein. The U.S. has tried decapitation and failed. And even success wouldn't stop his successor from building the bomb.
The least bad choice is more aggressive use of inspections to find and remove nuclear facilities and material. More inspectors might help. So would rewards for informants. And the international coalition can press Iraq to comply by maintaining tight economic sanctions and, if that fails, threatening renewed bombing of military targets.
Saddam Hussein has to know that the world is ready to resume bombing rather than see him get away with bomb-making.

HEADLINE: Help, Someone, Make New York an Affordable Place to Live

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The annual Rent Guidelines Board follies have closed (news item, June 25) without satisfying anyone. Nor could they have, in today's economy in New York City. On one side are the landlords, whose property taxes are undoubtedly going up, and on the other are the renters, many of whom have been in the same six-room apartments since marriage after World War II, through child rearing and now retirement. 
 Whoever is paying less than $1,000 a month for a one-bedroom apartment has obviously had it for more than 10 years. And those paying more are finding themselves in what were originally built as large studio apartments with sleeping alcoves that have been partitioned to make bedrooms with wall-to-wall bed, so landlords could get higher rents.
The board hasn't decided yet whether it should include the thousands of apartments originally built as condominiums in its vacancy figures. All of these buildings have become rental space by default, thanks to the high prices asked for them. As we all know, these were all planned and ground was broken for them when there were many more affluent New Yorkers. The Battery Park City project, South Street Seaport, Worldwide Plaza were all begun and built when "yuppies" flourished, and there was an influx of people into the city.
Now that many have fled New York, we see signs that haven't been seen since the early 1970's: "For Rent" in building windows and rental agents at high-rise apartment buildings. Today landlords, unlike the situation even two years ago, are willing to pay brokers' fees for renting apartments. Warehousing is now a losing proposition.
Greed is obviously built into today's rentals; landlords stuck with "sponsor" apartments are trying to recoup their costs, plus. Even though rents have gone down on "luxury" apartments, they are still expensive, and rent-controlled tenants are still sitting in oversized, low-price apartments. And who can blame them?
Despite the increase granted for the new leases, many landlords will be unable to raise the rents because even 4 percent will turn out to be the breaking point for many tenants. So, we are back to the usual -- high rents and immovable tenants. It would seem the only solution is a commission of impartial people who could come up with a plan to help landlords as well as tenants, and make New York City a desirable and affordable place to live.

GTE in Pact to Build Soviet Phone Service

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The GTE Corporation said yesterday that it had entered into an agreement with American and Soviet interests to build and operate a telephone and facsimile service linking Moscow with North America, Western Europe and Asia.
Details on the value of the venture, to be called Sovintel, were not disclosed. 
 The American portion of Sovintel is a partnership called Sovinet, which consists of the GTE International Communication Services Corporation, a GTE subsidiary, and San Francisco/Moscow Teleport, a private company.
GTE said Northern Telecom Inc. of Canada would provide digital switchboards and other materials for the digital-network service, which will begin commercial operation in November.
Sovintel said it expected its primary users to be executives from the United States, Japan and Europe. Users will have to pay hard currency to use the service, rather than rubles, Sovintel said.
GTE said Sovintel would "help speed the Soviet economic transition by servicing pent-up demand among worldwide corporate representatives in Moscow for instant, high-quality communications."
The venture initially will use microwave and satellite communications to link four hotels in Moscow and the city's Expocenter with public telephone networks in the rest of the world.
The five locations will be equipped with digital switches and microwave links for connection with Sovintel's international gateway, GTE said.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, GTE's shares rose 12.5 cents, closing at $29.75.

HEADLINE: Volcano Is Unforeseen Third Party in Talks on Bases in Philippines

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
An Air Force assessment that the Mount Pinatubo eruptions have probably caused irreparable damage to American installations threatens to make moot a long-running dispute between the United States and the Philippines over extending the leases of two major military bases.
Since World War I, the Subic Bay Naval Station and Clark Air Base have been the hub of American military operations in Asia, and have provided jobs for hundreds of thousands of Filipinos, either directly or in bars and massage parlors around the bases. The bases' demise could put an end to an important vestige of the colonial past. 
 But today, with the end of the cold war, many military analysts think the bases' strategic value has declined, and, according to an Administration official, their repair could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Anti-American protests and a year of difficult negotiations to extend a 1947 base treaty had already put the future of the bases in doubt. With the leases expiring in mid-September, the Administration has offered to pay $360 million in annual compensation for an extension of 10 to 12 years. Manila is seeking $825 million a year for a seven-year extension. A new round of negotiations is scheduled for Manila next week.
Both sides say the bases would be phased out after the next extension. But now that an Air Force survey team has found that Clark Air Base is probably too severely damaged by the volcanic eruptions to be rehabilitated, officials in the Administration and Congress are beginning to reconsider whether the United States needs any extension at all.
 
'Quite Pessimistic'
 The Administration official, who is involved in the negotiations, said the Air Force assessment, which is being prepared in a report that may be released next week, "is quite pessimistic," possibly "devastating." Officials said it was possible that Washington and Manila could come to an agreement on Subic Bay alone, although heavy damages there would complicate negotiations at that base as well.
American geologists are studying the viability of the continued use of the bases in preparation for the next round of negotiations, scheduled for the second half of this month. An American military damage-assessment team completed a separate survey of Clark Air Base last week, and is currently analyzing its findings at Pacific command headquarters in Hawaii.
About 300 Philippine contract workers are making preliminary efforts to clean up Clark, using shovels and earth-moving equipment to clear miles of drainage ditches. But Pentagon officials noted that most of their work was related to packing household goods of the base's 14,000 American evacuees.
"My sense is that there's absolutely no way for Clark to be reopened," said Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado and the head of the House subcommittee on Military Installations, after a tour of the South Pacific region. "Congress is going to have an awful lot of trouble being convinced to spend millions of dollars to clean up a base near a volcano."
 
'Alternate Facilities' Urged
 She said the question of retaining Subic Bay was still open.
"The Congress will be reluctant to spend a few billion dollars to fix up facilities that we will be obligated to leave over the next several years," said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs. "We always could develop alternate facilities."
Several members of Congress said it was too early to assess the damage, but they predicted that the eruption would have a profound affect on the way the United States views the Philippines.
"This will move us away from a discussion of the bases as the sole reason we are involved in the Philippines," said Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arguing that the United States should try to foster democracy and stability.
Clark Air Base, which is 12 miles from Mount Pinatubo, may never be viable again, as some geologists warn that the volcano could remain unstable for years to come. Clark is the primary refueling and service stop for the C-130 and C-5A aircraft that transport supplies to American forces in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, but it is a measure of changing Pentagon thinking that the fighter wing assigned to the base was withdrawn before the volcano even erupted. Pentagon strategists hope that the adjacent Crow Valley training range, the location for most extensive United States air bombing practice runs in Asia, could be retained even if the air base is closed.
The Subic Bay Naval Station, which is 35 miles away from Mount Pinatubo and sustained less damage, provides the Seventh Fleet with an extensive network of petroleum storage sites, supply depots and repair bases. A senior Navy officer described the base as "one-stop shopping."
 
Subic Seen as Mainstay
 American naval strategists say that Subic could remain the mainstay for the Seventh Fleet's repair, training and storage needs but that its services would be less valuable without the coordination from Clark. They also say that the Subic Bay services could be duplicated by the combination of those offered in Singapore, Guam and Japan.
A senior Navy officer involved in developing Asia strategy said that the Pentagon still believed that the Philippines offered the best location in the Pacific for the protection of sea lanes and access to potential flash points, "but few people here think we can't live without them." He added, "A lot depends on how much time it will take to write off the investment we will have to make to get them back up to speed."
For all the advantages it bestowed, the American presence in the Philippines has fostered an ambivalent relationship, with even many of those who benefit resenting the Americans for their sense of dependency on United States dollars and military protection.
Public opinion polls show that 60 percent of Filipinos would like the Government of Corazon C. Aquino to work out an arrangement with Washington to keep the bases. Some Filipinos say they need the American military presence to protect them against the Communist insurgency and possible army coups, and indeed Washington deployed fighter aircraft from the bases to help put down an attempted army revolt in December 1989. But the primary reason for the popularity of bases is economic. Nearly 80,000 Filipino are employed at the installations and hundreds of thousands of others depend on the bases for their livelihoods.
Nevertheless, the guerrillas use the bases as a nationalist issue, and many in the Manila elite, particularly intellectuals, say the Philippines will never emerge fully from its colonial past with tens of thousands of American soldiers and their dependents in the country.
Some members of the Aquino Government favor phasing out the bases as soon as possible, and whatever agreement is reached will probably face heavy opposition in the Philippine Senate, which will have to ratify it.
Rear Adm. Thomas Mercer, the top American military commander in the Philippines, said this week that the bases would be repaired. But State Department and Defense Department officials in Washington dealing with the Philippines disputed his conclusion. They said it was likely that operations at the two bases would be reduced or phased out more rapidly.
The Philippine Government is taking an even tougher public line on the negotiations despite the decreased value of the bases. "In the light of the events, the Philippines may have to upgrade the compensation because we suffered more than the Americans did," said the chief Philippine negotiator, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
"If we are to change the compensation at all, it will be to upgrade it, not reduce it," he said, insisting that scientists had assured him Mount Pinatubo's major eruptions were over.
Administration officials characterized Mr. Manglapus's comments as the posturing of a poker player who has picked up an unwanted card. "If I were the foreign minister of the Philippines," said a senior American Navy official, "I'd say the same thing."

HEADLINE: For Singapore Air, a New Direction

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Making long-range plans and meticulously carrying them out are high among the strengths of Singapore Airlines executives and they have used those attributes often in making the carrier one of the world's most successful.
Now they're at it again, laying the groundwork for what could be their biggest challenge yet: the company's first flights from New York to Singapore, scheduled to begin in 1993. 
 "It's 24 months away, but you have to begin to plan for it now," said T. A. Hwang, senior vice president for American operations. "You cannot run an airline on a day-to-day basis. It takes 20 months to train a pilot and a number of years to train an engineer."
The training looks to be the easy part. More daunting for the airline and Mr. Hwang will be the task of changing some ingrained travel patterns to get travelers to consider going to East Asia by way of Europe.
"It's going to be difficult," conceded Mr. Hwang, who is based in Los Angeles. "Traditionally people have thought that they must go West to go East."
Then, again, the airline has for years persuaded travelers that it makes sense to fly to Singapore first even though their destinations are Hong Kong, Calcutta or Jakarta.
Such moves have long been a necessity for Singapore Airlines. Its home nation, with about three million people, supplies only about 20 percent of its traffic. So the airline has had to be able to draw travelers to many points in East Asia to support its growth and large size.
One way Singapore has done that and kept ahead of its competitors is by improving its highly regarded cabin service and amenities every few years. But Mr. Hwang acknowledges that it has become harder to find ways to distinguish its service from such strong competitors as Japan Airlines, United, Northwest and emerging challengers like All Nippon from Japan.
In fact, after adding amenities like telephones and creating a little more legroom, all the airlines have found it harder to outdo one another within the restricted space of an airplane. Singapore Airlines is now putting in an information system that tells flight attendants whether one of their frequent business travelers wants his Scotch on the rocks or prefers a certain wine.
Singapore Airlines has been profitable every year since it was founded in 1972. That includes its 1990-91 fiscal year, ended March 31, in which the airline earned $507 million. That included a time when even many of the world's stronger airlines had huge losses in the first quarter of this year as the war against Iraq cut travel and drove up fuel costs.
"It's a hard company not to like," said Rose Ann Tortora, an airline analyst for County NatWest. "It has so much money and pays so many of its bills ahead of time."
The airline has become synonymous with high-quality service in repeated surveys of business travelers, something that has helped it weather declines.
 
Preparing the Way
 For the New York service, Singapore is already preparing the ground carefully before making a move.
In the United States, Singapore Airlines now flies out of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Honolulu. When it begins service from New York it will probably be out of Kennedy International Airport. Service is not now planned from any other East Coast cities. The flights will stop in Frankfurt, which already is a European hub for Singapore, but passengers will not have to change planes.
No other airline now offers direct service from New York to East Asia via the Atlantic, although passengers can fly carriers like Lufthansa from New York to Singapore, connecting with Singapore Airlines' European hub. But the fares are much higher than on the Pacific route, making it unlikely that many travelers will choose the European route.
To help overcome the initial reluctance by travelers to travel to Asia via the Atlantic, Singapore will soon file for fares that are much lower than existing ones between the two cities for passengers who stop in a European city. The lower fares could take effect this year if Lufthansa or other connecting airlines agree. The idea is to try to get Asia-bound travelers used to flying in that direction in preparation for Singapore Airlines' 1993 service.
The distance to East Asia via the Atlantic is similar to the Pacific route and even shorter in the case of Singapore. But the business-class and first-class fares between New York and gateways in Europe are very high, sometimes higher than the leg from Europe to Singapore, which is a much greater distance.
 
Air Fares Compared
 A first-class round trip from New York to Singapore via the Atlantic, for example, costs $9,464. That is 67 percent higher than the same trip from New York via the Pacific, which costs $5,772.
The business-class fare via the Atlantic is $5,996 round trip, much higher than the range of $3,842 to $3,864 via the Pacific.
The disparity is not as great in discount fares, which run $1,400 to $1,500 round trip via the Atlantic, compared with $1,390 to $1,640 via the Pacific.
Singapore plans to file fares via the Atlantic that will be at about the same level as on the Pacific route. For the fares to go into effect, however, other carriers that fly the trans-Atlantic leg will have to adopt them. They may be reluctant to do so since it would dilute their own revenue.
Still, Richard Gomez, vice president of the Eastern division and Latin America, whose office is in New York, said that some major carriers would adopt the fares to attract extra traffic to their gateways in Europe at a time of low traffic and heavy discounting.
Direct comparisons of Singapore with other carriers is difficult. The Government of Singapore owns 54 percent of the airline, although there is little interference from the Government in operations. An additional 12 percent is owned by Singapore employees, while the rest is traded publicly.
 
Small Domestic System
 The airline does not have a big domestic route system like United States carriers, where fares are not regulated and competiton is more intense. Fares on international routes are set by the governments involved and governments usually act to protect their own carriers.
Ms. Tortora, the County NatWest analyst, said that other government-owned airlines like Air France had found it difficult to compete.
Change is now measured in small increments and refinements in service that most competitors are quick to match.
For example, seats are being installed in business class with four more inches of pitch. That will allow travelers to push them farther back for a more restful flight during 10 to 12 hours aloft.
The airline is also considering putting in small television sets in the back of seats. So far Mr. Hwang said management was not satisfied with the four-inch screens now available and were waiting for six-inch screens instead.
 
Lower Labor Costs
 Singapore does have a major advantage over competitors like Air France in lower labor costs.
Its flight attendants' salaries begin at $1,200 a month, a high wage in Singapore, where a factory worker averages about $500 a month. The salary is similar to what beginning flight attendants are paid by United States airlines under lower entry-level salaries that unions accepted to help upstart domestic carriers compete at the beginning of deregulation. American salaries rise quickly in subsequent years, however, and at many carriers the workers reach parity with other employees after a few years.
But the Singapore jobs are still in great demand, airline executives say.
"We get a lot of applicants and whittle it down," Mr. Gomez said. One drawback, though for the flight attendants, called "Singapore Girls" in the airline's long-running ads, is that they work under five-year contracts. The contracts can be renewed only three times. They cannot stay more than 15 years unless they are willing to take a job on the ground.
 
Learning Everyone's Name
 The contracts allow the airline to enhance its cabins with service proferred by young and attractive flight attendants who are trained to learn everyone's name on a flight -- even in coach. Singapore has a cabin crew of 19 for each Boeing 747, compared with 15 for carriers in the United States.
Most of the airline's 20,400 employees are also sent for retraining every year to make sure that service levels are kept high. The airline is the largest employer in Singapore.
Mr. Hwang said that the airline's viability and growth depended on Singapore's central location, enabling the carrier to offer convenient flights to most of the large Asian cities.
The airline has also fostered an image of safety by operating the most modern fleet in the world. The average age of its fleet of 44 planes, mostly wide bodied, is four years and seven months.
Airplanes are sold after 10 years and the new planes at the rate of four to five a year are continually being brought into service even when traffic falls off as in the recent Persian Gulf crisis. With a cash reserve of $1.13 billion, the carrier has a huge cushion to ride out downturns while keeping its expansion plans on track.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Marginally As German Rate Talks Near

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell marginally against most currencies yesterday as speculation intensified about German interest rates in advance of today's meeting by officials of Germany's central bank.
Currency traders said the dollar's slight fall was partly the result of profit taking, but also reflected jitters that the German Bundesbank might raise key interest rates after its policy-making council meets. Higher rates in Germany would make the mark worth more against the dollar and other currencies. 
 Mike Faust, a foreign exchange analyst for MMS International Inc., said the speculation was fueled by comments yesterday from Bundesbank officials that key German rates should rise to curb inflation.
"If you were lookng for a rate hike tomorrow, you had to be a little bit encouraged," he said.
The Japanese yen held its own against the dollar in the face of that nation's embarrassing brokerage scandal. Yesterday, Japan's Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, said he would take a pay cut and discipline subordinates for failing to adequately police the stock market.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.06 yen, to a close at 138.66 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 138.50 yen, and in New York, the dollar bought 138.59 yen, slightly less than late Tuesday's 138.76.
The British pound was the only major currency that weakened against the dollar. In London, the British pound held steady at $1.6215. But in New York, sterling closed at $1.6223, slightly less than late Tuesday's $1.6233.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.8130 German marks, down from 1.8175; 1.5710 Swiss francs, down from 1.5759; 6.1520 French francs, down from 6.1660; 1,350 Italian lire, down from 1,352.55, and 1.1481 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14825.

HEADLINE: Airline Traffic Posts 12% Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 10

 BODY:
Dampened by war and recession, international passenger traffic on 200 leading airlines fell an average of 12 percent in the first five months of the year, an industry group said today.
Airlines also lost $2.5 billion from January through March, the group, the International Air Transport Association, said. 
 The Persian Gulf war, which increased fears of terrorism, curtailed international travel early this year.
But the recession in the United States and several other industrial countries continues to cut into business travel, the airline industry's greatest profit source, the group said.
"I cannot yet talk about light at the end of the tunnel following the gulf crisis," said Gunter Eser, the agency's director general.

HEADLINE: India's Chief Urges U.S. Investment

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 10

 BODY:
The newly elected Prime Minister of India urged the United States today to erase "old perceptions" about India, and expressed blunt interest in increasing sharply American economic and political links.
The Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, said in an interview that "the sky's the limit," in terms of potential American investment. Mr. Rao expressed hope that trade with the United States would "improve vastly." 
 And he said that closer United States-India political ties were crucial, especially in the aftermath of the turmoil in the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Soviet grip on Eastern Europe.
"We will do everything to make the relations closer," Mr. Rao said of the United States and India, adding that the "old perceptions" by the United States that India was hostile to Washington and leaned toward the Soviet Union were outdated and irrelevant.
 
Changing Perception of India
 Although relations improved somewhat under former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his successors, Mr. Rao's positive comments about India-America ties were the most explicit so far and reflected India's yearning for a closer alliance with the United States and the rest of the West.
"The perception of India in the United States has been one of a Soviet ally, being closer to the Soviet Union, so close that the United States did not like it," he said. "After some years, this perception has slowly changed, although I cannot say it's changed completely."
"We have tried to convince the United States that India's friendship with one country is never at the expense of another country," Mr. Rao said. "I see relations with the United States as vastly improved now and coming still closer. I see a bright future in these relations. In every way, we would like to improve our relations in several fields of cooperation."
American officials in New Delhi expressed delight at Mr. Rao's comments -- his first to an American reporter since becoming Prime Minister less than three weeks ago.
 
India's Gulf War Stance
 An American Embassy official said tonight, "It sounds very positive and we look forward to working with Mr. Rao in achieving the objectives he outlined."
Ties between the United States and India had been marked by strain and even anger in the 1970's and the early 1980's, partly because India saw the United States as leaning toward Pakistan, partly because India's foreign policy and ideals often supported the Soviet bloc and seemed eagerly critical of the United States, and partly because India was strongly suspicious of American or multilateral business investments, seeing them as essentially rapacious.
Even in the Persian Gulf war, India angered the Bush Administration by refusing to give American military planes permission to refuel at Bombay International Airport.
"That was temporary and I don't think that will have a lasting impact," said Mr. Rao this afternoon.
 
'The New Situation'
 Seated in his spacious office in the red sandstone Parliament building, built in the heyday of the British Empire, Mr. Rao wore a white kurta shirt and trousers, with an elegant embroidered silk shawl over his shoulders. At 71 years old, and in uncertain health because of a heart ailment, the Prime Minister appeared somewhat frail but spoke in a firm voice and responded to questions rapidly.
Mr. Rao seemed especially eager to strike a positive note about India's relations with the United States, virtually acknowledging that ties had been marked by strain and misunderstanding over the years.

HEADLINE: Legislators Try for a Compromise In Connecticut Budget Deadlock

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 10

 BODY:
Lawmakers spent today crunching numbers, hoping to find some new combination that might break the deadlock over the state budget. And with the last few weeks littered with dead tax plans, there were plenty of options to pick over.
One plan that floated through the Capitol was being pitched as a compromise between the last compromise -- which died in the Senate last week -- and the proposal favored by the Democrats in the Senate, the ones who killed that last compromise. 
 The new, improved compromise would contain an income tax, thus mollifying Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who has all but insisted on one. But the income tax would be much smaller, 3 percent to 4 percent, than either the Weicker income tax, which peaked at 6.75 percent, or the last doomed compromise, which carried a flat income tax rate of 4.75 percent.
It would not lower the state's 8 percent sales tax as much as those earlier plans, or eliminate entirely the separate taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains. Those new provisions were aimed at placating factions among the majority Democrats who have complained that overindulgent tax cuts of one kind or another would benefit wealthy families at the expense of middle-income taxpayers who would carry the main burden of a wage tax.
 
To Stimulate the Economy
 Connecticut has no broad-based tax on wages, but its other taxes are among the highest in the nation, especially the 8 percent sales tax, the 13.8 percent corporate profits tax and the interest and dividends tax, which peaks at 14 percent.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican who was elected last November on his newly created Connecticut Party ticket, has identified as a central goal of his administration the lowering of those other taxes in an effort to stimulate the economy; the difference would be made up with the new income tax. In the last six weeks, the Governor has vetoed two legislative budgets that solved the state's revenue shortfall through non-income tax means, primarily an expansion of the sales-tax system.
But hardly anyone expressed much hope of any immediate breakthrough, now 10 days into the new fiscal year without a budget.
On Tuesday, majority leaders in the House tried to push Democrats to consider overriding Governor Weicker's veto of a budget that passed last week, but they couldn't even get support to try a vote on the floor. A planned House session today was canceled because there was nothing concrete to debate.
Lawmakers said an override vote might still be revived, however, if the new compromise fails to win support in the Senate over the next few days.

Trustee Chosen For Monarch

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 11

 BODY:
Harrison J. Goldin, the former New York City Comptroller, has been appointed to serve as bankruptcy trustee for the Monarch Capital Corporation.
Mr. Goldin's appointment on Tuesday came two weeks after Monarch agreed to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. In late May, state insurance regulators seized control of the company's Monarch Life Insurance Company subsidiary. 
 In addition, Judge Herbert P. Wilkin of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has allowed the state to begin seeking offers for the life insurance company.
Monarch Life, which has about 250,000 policies, has continued to make payments on annuities and other insurance products. Monarch Capital once held $6 billion in assets before a declining economy lowered its real estate portfolio.
Mr. Goldin served as Comptroller for 16 years before establishing his own firm, Goldin Associates.

HEADLINE: Utah Driver's Long Fight for Her Name on a License

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
Wendy Jean Alldredge says she knows that life can sometimes be galling. But this took the cake.
After her divorce in 1988, she went to the Utah Driver License Division to change the last name on her driver's license from Jorgensen, her former husband's name, to Alldredge, the name she was born with. 
 She was told she would need her former husband's permission.
"This rubbed me the wrong way," she said, "to say the least."
When license officials told her to call her former husband, she retorted: "What my ex-husband thinks is irrelevant." Instead, she called a lawyer.
She filed suit against the Utah Driver License Division, charging discrimination against divorced women. But a Utah court and a Federal Appeals Court have rejected her claim.
Ms. Alldredge, a 36-year-old unemployed cashier and the mother of three children, said she had never before considered herself a feminist.
 
Sharp Change in Outlook
 "But this whole thing has made me look at things a little differently," she said. "If a poor woman like me has to fight just to get her own name back, I think we're in a sad situation."
Utah, like other states, allows a change of name at the time of divorce. But the Driver License Division says a woman cannot unilaterally change her name after the divorce; it requires an amendment of the divorce decree, which means getting the former husband's consent.
"It's offensive that she should have to ask her ex-husband," said Brian M. Barnard, Ms. Alldredge's lawyer. "It's obviously a sexist practice. It's part of the old, outdated notion that women become property of men upon marriage."
The license division said sexism was not the issue. Rather, they said, they were guarding against fraud.
Ms. Alldredge noted that with copies of her birth certificate and divorce decree, she has been able to change the name on her taxes, Social Security card and bank checks.
She and her lawyers said that the license division allows a woman to take her husband's name after marriage even though the marriage license does not specify a name change.
"But that's different," said Brian Gough, a spokesman for the division. "It's a tradition to take the husband's name in marriage."
Mr. Gough also acknowledged that other states have changed policies to allow name changes, after "the woman's lib thing."
The case has provoked indignation among women's groups. "It's just another example of the patriarchal society of Utah," said Rebecca J. Elliott, the executive director of the National Organization for Women in Utah.
The case hit close to home for Ms. Elliott. Fifteen years ago, she was a divorced woman attending college in Indiana. She had kept her husband's name because she had a child. But as her graduation drew near, the issue troubled her.
"I just didn't want his name on my diploma," she said, adding that she had no legal trouble making the name change.
 
Undeterred by Setbacks
 Ms. Alldredge said recently that she was planning to continue legal action. Her latest setback came a few months ago when a United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, upheld the Utah restriction by a 2-to-1 vote.
"A divorce decree without a specific name-changing provision is not an acceptable name change verification, " the majority opinion said.
In a dissent, Judge Monroe McKay wrote, "I can conceive of no legitimate interest which the State of Utah might have in making it simple for a woman to adopt a husband's name but difficult for her to shed it."
Ms. Alldredge, who married when she was 17 years old, attributed the ruling to "old-fashioned male judges who believe in a double standard."
She said her three children have supported her fight. Indeed, her 17-year-old daughter, Connie, now wants to change her name to Alldredge.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Rise as Rates Dip

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The reappointment of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve helped to start a mild rally in the credit markets yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities rose and interest rates fell a bit.
Also lifting the markets were expectations that an inflation report expected today would show that price pressures were under control during June. 
 Yet another factor, analysts said, was a sharp rally in the dollar, which followed a decision by the German central bank not to raise interest rates.
Most economists are forecasting that today's report on producer prices will show that prices at the wholesale level were flat to down slightly last month, in large part because of a drop in energy prices. Excluding food and energy costs, the index probably rose by only one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent, according to most forecasts.
 
Rally Expected to End
 Based on the forecasts, "a lot of people are scared to be short in front on the numbers," one government securities trader said. But the trader said yesterday's rally was unlikely to continue for long.
"If the P.P.I. number is as expected, the market will resume its downward path," he said. "There is a lot of supply coming, and the danger is that the economic fundamentals could turn bad just as the quarterly refunding auctions get started."
Expectations are that the Treasury will sell $30 billion or more of new notes and bonds at the refunding auctions, which are to take place in early August. Concern about the amount of securities to be sold, and the market's ability to absorb the new paper, has been building for weeks. But some market participants said the worries were overblown.
"The new supply will be healthy, but not insurmountable," said Stephen A. Maher, executive vice president and general manager of the fixed income division at Nikko Securities International.
"I think we'll see a good response to the new issues, especially if bond yields are around 8.5 percent at that time. At those levels, I'm not so sure the Japanese won't be good buyers."
 
Interest in Notes
 Interest in the new seven-year notes, which were sold at an average yield of 8.25 percent on Wednesday, continued strong yesterday.
By late in the day, the new securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.15 percent, down from 8.21 percent late Wednesday.
The Bundesbank decision not to raise short-term rates came as something of a surprise. Some analysts had taken the view that the central bank might raise rates as a way of stemming the rise in the dollar.
A rate increase later on remains a possibility, but not for at least another month because German monetary policy makers go on vacation until mid-August.
"I think the world believes the Germans will revisit the issue of whether they will raise rates when they come back in August," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist and managing director at Midland Montagu Economics.
"But the direction around the world is for lower rates. And the more other countries lower their rates, the less reason Germany will have to raise their own to achieve the same benefits."
The improvement in Treasury prices began shortly after the German decision not to raise rates was announced, and continued through most of the day.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered in late trading yesterday at a price of 96 11/ 32, up 1/2 point, to yield 8.46 percent, down from 8.5 percent late Wednesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 5/32, up 10/32, to yield 8.27 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, up 2/32, to yield 6.87 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.54 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates dipped by a like amount, to a late offered rate of 5.66 percent.
A number of new corporate debt issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including $150 million worth of two-year notes for CIT Group Holdings.
The 7.5 percent notes, which mature July 15, 1993, were priced at $100, or par, 58 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the offering. The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate issues said that prices of most securities rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point in fairly brisk trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted securities improved by 1/8 point to 1/4 point, traders said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board said yesterday that M-1, the narrowest measure of the nation's money supply, rose by $3.5 billion during the week ended July 1, while its broadest measure, M-3, fell by $9.1 billion. M-2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was unchanged.
With the exception of the big decline in M-3, analysts said the money numbers were in line with expectations. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: Bonior of Michigan Is Picked as 3d-Ranking House Democrat

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
House Democrats today elected Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan as whip, marking the fourth major shift in the Democratic Congressional leadership in five years.
After weeks of intense, behind-the-scenes campaigning, Mr. Bonior, a low-keyed insider tactician who served four years as chief deputy whip, defeated Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. The vote, by secret ballot in a closed meeting of the Democratic caucus, was 160 to 109. 
 Mr. Bonior, 46 years old, will succeed Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania after Mr. Gray leaves, probably in September, to head the United Negro College Fund. The whip is the third-ranking leader in the House, and the position has sometimes been a stepping stone to the posts of majority leader and Speaker.
In a preview of his role as a more visible Democratic spokesman, Mr. Bonior attacked the Bush Administration. "There is a tremendous frustration out there in this country," he said. "The frustration of a country in a deep -- and it is deep -- and prolonged recession, faced with an Administration whose only response to this is: It's no big deal." He also assailed the Administration for, in his view, not confronting the issues of health care, unemployment and the proportion of children living in poverty.
The choice today is not seen as having any particularly ideological implications. Both candidates are rather liberal, and the principal issue dividing them was Mr. Bonior's opposition to abortion. The race turned on more personal and political factors, from friendships to regional loyalties.
Mr. Bonior (pronounced BON-yer), a Vietnam veteran who is the son of an automobile worker, built on the 97 votes he received in 1989, when he was defeated by Mr. Gray in a hard-fought race for whip. He began campaigning for the job earlier than Mr. Hoyer, when speculation first arose that Mr. Gray was planning to resign, initially to seek the Pennsylvania Senate seat left vacant by the April death of Senator John Heinz in a plane crash.
At a news conference with other members of the leadership, Mr. Bonior recalled that the "the last couple of years have been difficult years for me." He noted his unexpectedly narrow re-election victory of 53 percent in 1988, as well as his loss to Mr. Gray.
"Out of those experiences," said Mr. Bonior, who is in his eighth term representing Mount Clemens, a Detroit suburb, "I learned something. I went home to my district nearly every weekend. I went to town hall meetings, to barbecues, to rotary clubs -- after 20 years in politics went back to knocking on doors."
Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington commended both candidates. "I think that we are a stronger party and a better focused and organized party and a more confident party because of this leadership contest," Mr. Foley said. "And this is an unusual thing to be able to say, frankly."
Beginning with the retirement of Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill of Massachusetts in 1986, House Democrats have weathered turnovers in leadership. Mr. O'Neill was succeeded by Jim Wright of Texas, who resigned in 1989 after questions about his financial practices, and was succeeded by Mr. Foley. About the same time, Representative Tony Coelho of California resigned as whip rather than face an investigation of his investments. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri was elected to succeed Mr. Foley as majority leader in June 1989, when Mr. Gray was elected whip.
Mr. Gray, the first black to serve in the House leadership, presented his successor with a whip today, telling him, "May you whip all those votes into line and pass all the legislation that's important to the leadership."
Mr. Bonier proved his skill at counting votes. He has predicted for days that he had support from about 160 colleagues. Mr. Hoyer had insisted that the race was neck and neck.
Mr. Hoyer said after the vote that the Democrats "were fond of us both and respected us both." He added, "They felt that Dave Bonior was the better candidate for majority whip."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Gains On Job and German Reports

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar soared against the German mark and other major currencies yesterday in response to a rosy United States report on unemployment claims and to news that Germany would not immediately raise interest rates.
Currency traders said they were relieved by the German decision after days of intense speculation that the Bundesbank might take drastic steps to hold the line on inflation. 
 The dollar initially fell when the Bundesbank's policy-making council said it would move to tighten monetary policy. But the reaction was more than offset by a subsequent announcement that the bank would forgo an immediate rate increase. In New York the dollar jumped more than two pfennigs against the mark, which like other currencies is supported by higher interest rates in its home country.
Further bolstering the dollar was a Government report of a sharp decrease in the number of Americans filing for state unemployment insurance in the last week of June. Claims fell to 388,000 in the week ending June 29 from the previous week's 423,000, the Labor Department reported.
In addition, traders said the dollar was supported by unconfirmed rumors that the United States was considering an air strike against Iraq in retaliation for the recent discovery that Saddam Hussein has far greater nuclear capability than United States officials first thought.
The dollar is considered a safe harbor in times of turmoil.
In London, the pound fell to $1.6065 from $1.6215 late Wednesday. It also fell in New York, where sterling fetched $1.6045, less than late Wednesday's $1.6223.
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.01 yen, to a closing 138.67 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 138.55 yen, and in New York, it closed at 138.65 yen, slightly more than late Wednesday's 138.59 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday, included: 1.8345 German marks, up from 1.8130; 1.5900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5710; 6.2175 French francs, up from 6.1520; 1,363.00 Italian lire, up from 1,350.00, and 1.1483 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1481.

HEADLINE: Weaker Monthly Showing for Many Top Retailers

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Sales of America's biggest retailers turned erratic in June, reducing a euphoria that had been building from a strong showing in May that the recession was ending.
Retailers said yesterday that their total June sales held up, but nine of the 20 biggest reported lower or flat same-store sales from the levels a year earlier. In May, 13 of the 20 said that same-store sales rose. In total sales, for example, Sears, Roebuck & Company and the J. C. Penney Company were up 2.9 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, but they had same-store declines of 3.8 percent and 8.2 percent from the year before. 
 During May, American consumers purchased considerable warm-weather clothing, as well as air-conditioners and fans, because of soaring temperatures in many parts of the country. This big trend removed some business that would have been transacted in June, retailers and analysts said, so that last month, at least in part, suffered from the strong May buying.
 
Recession Not Over Yet
 The slower June, they said, means that a clear end to the recession, at least in retailing, awaits a sustained improvement in spending.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest-volume retailer, continued its big thrust with an overall sales gain of 34 percent in June, to $3.49 billion, and an 8 percent advance in same-store sales. For the five months through June, total sales were up 37 percent, to $16.2 billion, and same-store sales rose 11 percent.
Wal-Mart edged ahead of Sears and K Mart in sales in February and has continued to increase its lead. In June, K Mart Corporation, the second largest in sales, reported a 6.8 percent gain in sales, to $3.28 billion, and a same-store gain of 2.2 percent. Year-to-date sales rose 8.9 percent, to $13.6 billion, with a same-store rise of 4.5 percent.
Sears's Merchandise Group, its stores and catalogue businesses, remained the industry's third-largest retailer, with June sales of $3.16 billion. Its year-to-date business declined 2.1 percent, to $13.28 billion. The cumulative same-store sales were down 2.7 percent from the previous year.
 
Sears Chairman's View
 Edward A. Brennan, Sears's chairman, said: "While double-digit increases continued in computers, women's fashion accessories and footwear, accompanied by strong sales in sportswear for both men and women, these gains were offset by slow sales in appliances and furniture. However, we are beginning to see a slight increase in customer demand for big-ticket durables, which should continue as the economy improves."
K Mart's chairman, Joseph E. Antonini, noted that the unusually warm May weather may have robbed June of some of its potential. "In May, aided by ideal weather conditions in the East and the Midwest, sales were strong, rising 8.5 percent on a comparable-store basis," Mr. Antonini said. "Clearly, this strength in May borrowed from June business."
If the weather element was excluded, he said, K Mart's May-June business was up 4.9 percent in same stores, ahead of the company's comparable first-quarter gain of 4.3 percent.
 
Mixed Results at J. C. Penney
 J. C. Penney's higher June sales totaled $1.21 billion, but the year-to-date sales were down 4.1 percent, to $5.41 billion, with a same-store drop of 5.4 percent.
The Woolworth Corporation's domestic sales rose 2.5 percent in June, to $474 million, although its same-store sales dipped six-tenths of 1 percent. Its cumulative sales rose 2.3 percent, to $3.72 billion, while same-store sales for the year to date were down 1.2 percent.
The big department store chains also had total gains but small improvements in same-store sales for June. The Dayton Hudson Corporation had a 9.3 percent sales gain in June, to $1.38 billion, but a 1.2 rise in same stores. The May Department Stores Company was up 6.1 percent, to $917.6 million, in June but was down nine-tenths of 1 percent in same stores.
One analyst, Kurt Barnard of New York, said the year-to-year comparisons were difficult. "Stores were up against unusually strong sales in June last year and couldn't hope to match them, given the recessionary environment," he explained.
But despite June's erratic trend, the apparel chains performed the best, indicating continuing consumer interest in seasonal clothes.
"I estimate that the apparel retailers had an average overall sales gain of 10 percent," said Cathleen W. Mackey, vice president for equity research at Dillon, Read & Company, New York. "But their same-store gains weren't uniformly good. One problem, I think, is that retailers held back too much on inventory, losing some of their summer business. An exception was the Limited stores division of the Limited, which had good stocks and so enjoyed its best monthly gain in more than a year."
The Limited Inc. had a total June gain of 20 percent, to $537.1 million, and a same-store gain of 8 percent. Its year-to-date sales were up 18 percent, to $2.26 billion, with same-store sales rising 4 percent.
The Gap Inc., also enjoying strong recent growth, had 23 percent higher sales in June, to $205 million, an 8 percent gain in same-store sales, and 24 percent higher cumulative sales, to $693 million, with a same-store rise of 8 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Other Retailers' Sales
 By The Associated Press -- Following is a list of the sales figures reported yesterday by other of the nation's largest retailers:
 Melville Corporation's overall sales were up 19 percent for the five weeks ended July 6 and up 21.1 percent for the year. Same- store sales were unchanged for the five weeks and up seven-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
TJX Companies, up 8.5 percent for the five weeks ended July 6, up 15.8 percent for the year. TJX does not report same-store sales percentages.
United States Shoe Corporation, up 6 percent for the five weeks ended July 6, up 5.9 percent for the year. Same-store sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent for the five weeks and two-tenths of 1 percent for the year.
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., up 29 percent for the five weeks, up 29 percent for the year. Same-store sales rose 7 percent for the five weeks and 10 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall by 35,000 in Week

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 35,000 in the final week in June, the Labor Department said today, pushing the total number to the lowest level since last September.
Economists said the decline, which was sharper than expected, showed that the labor market was improving as the economic recovery began. 
 The Labor Department said first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell to 388,000 for the week ended June 29 from 423,000 a week earlier.
"If this level is sustainable, and I believe there is good reason to think it will be, it obviously suggests the labor market is firming as the recovery gathers momentum," said Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
The last time claims fell below 400,000 was in the week ending Jan. 5, when they dropped to 396,000, Mr. Roach said.
 
Number Getting Benefits Falls
 Economists also pointed to the large decline of 119,000 in the total number of people receiving benefits under state programs. The total fell to 3.4 million for the week ending June 22, the latest period for which data are available.
Christopher Rupkey, a financial economist at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., said that the drop significantly reduced the total number of people receiving benefits from the week ended June 15, which is the week used to calculate the unemployment rate in June. The Labor Department reported last Friday that the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent in June from 6.9 percent in May.
Mr. Roach said the claims data suggested that some companies were probably starting to recall workers. "That will add to income and consumption, the dynamics that add fuel to the recovery," he said.
The Labor Department said the latest decline brought jobless claims to their lowest level since the week ended Sept. 1, 1990, when 386,000 claims were registered.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Woe Takes Toll On the Arts

SERIES: The Budget Fallout; A periodic look at the effects of New York City's financial plan on various agencies and services.

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Increased admissions fees, staff layoffs, reduced hours and canceled days of operation: for New York City's cultural institutions, these are just some of the consequences of last week's severe budget cutting.
Last week, after the city's fiscal maneuvering had finally run its course, $24 million had been cut from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. The figure amounts to 28 percent of the department's $87 million budget for 1991. 
 For most of the city's better- and lesser-known cultural organizations, this means a reduction of one-fourth to one-third of the city's support for their operating expenses. Many staff members fear that even if they evade more severe cuts in the future, the current budget formula may become the status quo in the years to come.
 
Hoping It's Temporary
 The city's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, Mary Schmidt Campbell, said the city is still strongly committed to the arts. "I don't think that something fundamental has changed in our attitude toward cultural groups," she said. "We see our cultural organizations as a centerpiece of the city. We are hoping that this will be a temporary constraint in funding."
But many arts administrators, grappling with grim options for service reductions in 1992, fear that the unprecedented slashing of the arts budget represents a fundamental, and potentially devastating, change in the centurylong relationship of the city to its museums, theaters, botanical gardens, performance groups and other cultural ornaments.
The city has a long tradition of being an active partner in its cultural institutions, spending more on the arts than any other municipalitiy in the nation, city officials said.
Arts administrators say the change not only threatens the long-term survival of these institutions, but also the vitality of the neighborhoods that they have anchored, and the very position New York has as the cultural capital of the nation.
 
The Econimics of Art
 Furthermore, they believe that the future of the city's economy is linked to its cultural resources. "What would New York be without its cultural institutions, and who would ever want to come here without them?" said Harvey Lichtenstein, president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. "It's like Paris without the Louvre, London without Covent Garden."
In the final hours of last week's so-called doomsday-budget compromise, a strong push to restore arts financing was under way. The 28 percent cut in the department's budget was actually 19 percent less than the reduction in the executive budget offered by Mayor David N. Dinkins on May 10. That document had proposed an arts cut of 47 percent.
As grateful as they are for the $11.5 million that was restored, administrators in cultural organizations throughout the city were stunned by the new budget.
"No one is saying we shouldn't have shared in the cuts along with everyone else," said Dr. Alan J. Friedman, director of the New York Hall of Science in Queens. "But cuts of a fourth or a third will cause severe disruption of operations. This level of damage is really questionable."
For the staffs of hundreds of arts institutions and cultural agencies throughout the five boroughs, putting the cuts in effect is now a nightmarish occupation.
The New York Botanical Garden has already lost 35 percent of its security force in this, its centennial year. But the new 1992 budget cut of $1,626,769, or 31.6 percent of its city financing, means a "loss of 45 or 50 positions," said Gregory Long, president of the New York Botanical Garden. Those job losses primarily affect security guards, gardeners and maintenance workers.
The New York Botanical Garden is planning to close down part of its 250 acres -- the equivalent of closing a museum floor or wing -- because "we can't keep the whole property safe with fewer guards," Mr. Long said.
Some of the budget cuts seem aimed at creating even greater deficits. Not only will the New York Hall of Science in Queens lose $377,599 of its $1,407,056 city budget, but it also stands to lose $540,000 from a National Science Foundation Grant because the city has cut the "matching money" that must be put up by grant recipients.
The City Center theater in Manhattan, which has been dark since April and will not open until October, will be operating even less in 1992: fewer than 20 weeks, said Eugene Matta, director of capital planning.
As for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which had 300,000 admissions last year, the 27.8 percent cut of $663,499 in its 1992 city budget means scaling back operations, and mounting "a lot of productions that are smaller in scale," Mr. Lichtenstein said.
The Brooklyn Museum, which sustained a cut of $2,046,134 from its $6.3 million city budget, is considering various reductions in services. The museum may be forced to close for part of the summer and may rotate temporary layoffs among the staff of 240.
A cut of $132,048 in the 1992 operating budget will force the Staten Island Children's Museum to curtail its hours and services. It will also bring about some "heartbreaking" layoffs, said Kate Bennett-Mendez, the executive director. One of the most efficient cleaning people on the staff, Laura DeFranco who has Downs syndrome, had to be let go on Friday, Ms. Bennett-Mendez said, "because she was our most recent hire."
 
Workers 'Losing Heart'
 Beyond the reductions that will be noticeable to the public, Mr. Long said, "We are in danger of losing a core of talented workers and managers at this and other institutions."
"They are losing heart," he said. "They would be a tremendous loss."
Beyond the impact on the institutions, many arts administrators fear the new budget will erode civic stability as well.
"Whole neighborhoods will be totally affected by the decline of our cultural institutions," said Mr. Long of the Botanical Garden. "For example, our gardens are a center of excellence and pride for the neighborhoods around us. Their streets are safer, there is less graffiti. Their businesses, and their property values, have benefited. All of that will be endangered if our property is abandoned and vandalized."
 
Hard-Pressed Foundations
 Some of the arts groups are counting on fund raising to make up the difference. The Brooklyn Academy, for example, Mr. Lichtenstein said, will try to raise $600,000 "from emergency fund raising, just to keep ourselves at the lowest operating level."
But increased corporate and foundation sources of income may not be available. "Arts institutions are turning more and more to the private sector, but donors and foundations are extremely pressed," said Sara L. Engelhardt, president of the Foundation Center in Manhattan, a nonprofit national organization that provides information for grant seekers.
Many corporate foundations have cut back because of the recession, she said, and increasingly, "the arts will compete with human services for money."
Money from the Deparment of Cultural Affairs goes to different budgetary groupings. One, the so-called Cultural Institutions Group, is a roster of 31 cultural institutions in the five boroughs in city-owned buildings or on city-owned land, including organizations like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Bronx Museum. The department also finances more than 450 arts programs around the city, including the Dance Theater of Harlem and the Big Apple Circus.
Partnership Feared Endangered
Some cultural administrators are deeply concerned about the long-range implications of the 1992 budget. "The brilliant concept of public and private partnership that New York pioneered is endangered," said Mr. Long, who is also chairman of the city's Cultural Institutions Group.
He referred to the pact that was struck, he said, in 1877 between New York City and the American Museum of Natural History, in which the city agreed to provide the land, the buildings, the maintenance and the security, while the museum agreed to pay for assembling the collections and scientific staff.
This set the pattern, Mr. Long said, for the development of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1878), the New York Botanical Garden (1891), The New York Zoological Society (1895), the Brooklyn Museum (1897) and the Brooklyn Children's Museum (1899). In this century, the pact governed the creation of dozens of other arts organizations.
"The phrase 'public-private partnership' is a trendy buzzword these days, but here in New York is the best working example of it you can think of," Mr. Long said. "It's worked so well for a century that it's made New York the cultural capital of the world. Yet now that public-private formula is being undermined."
 
The Series So Far
This series on the impact of the New York City budget began on July 4. The first article described how the Police and Fire Department were largely spared extensive cuts. On July 10, an article described how social services would be hard hit. Yesterday, an article described how schools would be severely strained.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Florida Settle Suit on Everglades Water

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., July 11

 BODY:
The Federal Government and the State of Florida reached a tentative agreement today in a bitter lawsuit accusing the state of not enforcing its own environmental laws to safeguard the Everglades.
The agreement comes after two and a half years of intense resistance that cost the state $6 million in legal fees. 
 Under its provisions, Florida's Department of Environmental Regulation and the local water management district assumed responsibility for cleaning up polluted water before it flows into two large sections of the Everglades controlled by the Federal Government, Everglades National Park, at the southern tip of the Florida peninsula, and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, just west of here.
 
Plan for Artificial Marsh
 The water is to be filtered through a huge artificial marsh that the state is supposed to create to the south of Lake Okeechobee, the headwaters of the Everglades. Water tainted with phosphorus and other nutrients from vegetable and sugar cane fields will be purified before it joins the main flow of water that sustains the Everglades.
The agreement, which the state has indicated it will sign, was annnounced at the West Palm Beach County administration building by the United States Attorney General, Dick Thornburgh, and Gov. Lawton Chiles.
It could influence attempts to protect other national parks and areas in other states where pollution from nearby roads, factories or residential developments damages the air, land and water within the parks' boundaries.
A lawyer for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Robert G. Dreher, called the agreement the most serious attempt to deal with this type of pollution in the nation. "We are going to see this used in efforts across the country to control runoff pollution," he said.
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., in a statement from Washington, called the agreement "the beginning of a new era of partnership designed to meet the goal of responsible stewardship of our public lands."
Mr. Thornburgh said the agreement was a significant step in the efforts to save the Everglades. The Federal Government has begun a huge project to repair the Everglades by restoring the natural flow of the Kissimmee River and elevating highways so water can flow freely beneath them.
 
Huge Buffer Zone
 Today's agreement calls for the creation of a marsh or buffer zone of at least 34,700 acres to remove as much as 70 percent of the phosphorus entering the Everglades.
It also binds the state to meeting its own water quality standards by 2002. By that time farmers will have to reduce the amount of phosphorus they discharge by 25 percent. And a long-term monitoring program will ensure that the measures work.
The long stalemate between governments was broken earlier this year when Governor Chiles, who during his election campaign last year promised to settle the suit, admitted that Everglades water was polluted.
"For three years the state has spent milions of dollars and diverted government's financial and human resources debating legal technicalities of this suit," Mr. Chiles said at today's news conference. "Now we can finally devote our full attention to cleaning up the Glades."
Mr. Chiles said he wanted to consult with leaders of agricultural and environmental groups and local governments before the state signed it.
The South Florida Water Management District, which controls the flow and diversion of water through the area, plans to vote on Aug. 6 on whether to accept the agreement. Judge William M. Hoeveler of Federal District Court also must review it.
 
Skepticism Is Voiced
 Farmers and some environmentalists were skeptical about whether the agreement would resolve what they see as a headlong conflict between progress and the environment.
Joe Podgor, a representative of Friends of the Everglades, a group founded by Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the author who sounded some of the earliest warnings over the condition of the Everglades, denounced the agreement for shifting the burden of the cleanup from the big sugar growers to taxpayers.
"It should have been 100 percent farmer money to pay for the damage," Mr. Podgor said.
Representatives of the large sugar and vegetable farmers continued to deny responsibility for the damage.
"There has never been an evidentiary hearing presenting facts that show damage to the Everglades," said Bill Earl, a lawyer for the Florida Sugar Cane League, a growers' association.
According to testimony elicited by United States Attorney in Miami, Dexter W. Lehtinen, who initiated the suit in Federal court in October 1988, the level of phosphorus from argicultural fertilizers is 10 to 20 times higher in areas below Lake Okeechobee than in more remote areas of the Everglades.
The phosphorus accumulates in sediment, increasing the number of algae and depleting oxygen from the marsh. Native sawgrasses die out and are replaced by stands of cattail and other non-native plants, disrupting many animal species.
Mr. Lehtinen, a native of Florida who grew up hunting and fishing in the Everglades and a former state legislator, said that Florida had passed effective environmental laws but that they were not enforced to protect special interest groups, including farmers.
"There is an assumption that economic growth eventually degrades the environment and there is nothing that can be done about it," Mr. Lehtinen said in an interview. "This agreement will demonstrate that that assumption is wrong."

Profits Up At Morgan, Wachovia

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Two of the nation's strongest banks, J. P. Morgan & Company and the Wachovia Corporation, yesterday reported solid second-quarter results, reflecting their avoidance of the risky lending that has hurt many competitors.
Earnings were up 11.6 percent at Morgan and 5.7 percent at Wachovia. 
 The banks are at the head of the class because of a reputation for conservatism and adherence to strict credit quality standards, analysts said.
Morgan, based in New York, and Wachovia, with headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C., are considered conservative lenders, and their strong results come at a time when many banks are suffering because of high-risk loans that have soured.
Morgan's performance was helped in part by gains in its securities trading. The Federal Reserve Board last fall granted Morgan limited powers to underwrite both debt and equity securities because of its strong financial position. Most United States banks are prohibited from doing so by the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act.
Chris Kotowski, bank analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, said Morgan and Wachovia are among the four strongest banks in the nation, along with the Republic New York Bank Corporation and NBD Bancorp of Detroit.
Following are the details of the banks' results:
 
J. P. Morgan
Morgan, the nation's fourth-biggest bank, reported earnings of $231 million for the second quarter, or $1.17 a share, compared with $207 million, or $1.06 a share, for the period last year.
"The quarter's results reflected good performance across all of our business activities, despite a weak economic climate," said Dennis Weatherstone, Morgan's chairman.
The bank benefited from increased revenues from net interest income and service fees, as well as from its securities trading.
Net interest revenue was $354 million, up 20 percent from the comparable quarter last year. The bank saw a 26 percent gain in revenue from miscellaneous trading, including dealings in commodities, securities and "swaps" of futures contracts and complex financial instruments, a growing business on Wall Street.
"They have worked very hard in the last few years to expand their trading base," said Judah S. Kraushaar, bank analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company.
Morgan's total nonaccrual loans, those delinquent in interest payments, declined 28 percent, to $629 million from the year earlier, mainly because the bank charged off as bad debt $322 million of Brazilian and Argentine loans in the second quarter.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Morgan's stock fell 75 cents, to $52.125 a share.
 
Wachovia
Wachovia, the nation's 29th-largest bank, posted earnings of $79.5 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with $75.2 million, or $1.06 a share, a year ago.
Benjamin Bishop, analyst for the Allen C. Ewing Corporation in North Carolina, said the results were "right on target."
The bank's nonperforming assets, including foreclosed real estate holdings and delinquent loans, totaled $161 million as of June 30, less than 1 percent of the bank's loan portfolio and foreclosed property.
Its Tier 1 capital ratio, an important gauge of a bank's ability to absorb sudden operating losses, was a healthy 9.1 percent, more than double the 4 percent minimum.
Wachovia, with $25.6 billion in assets, agreed in late June to acquire the South Carolina National Corporation, with $7.1 billion. The $800 million stock-swap deal would put Wachovia into the top 20 of the nation's bank holding companies.
Wachovia's share price rose 62.5 cents yesterday to close at $58 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: PAN AM IS SELLING OVERSEAS ROUTES AND ITS SHUTTLE

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Pan Am, the nation's pioneer in commercial aviation, all but gave up its long fight for survival yesterday by agreeing to sell the European, Asian and African routes that helped make it famous, as well as its East Coast shuttle.
The buyer is Delta Air Lines, the nation's third-largest carrier behind American and United. If the $260 million deal is completed, Delta will join a handful of other carriers with vast international route networks that are expected to dominate the industry in the next decade. 
 And Delta's acquisition of the shuttle, which connects New York with Boston and Washington, would make the airline a much greater threat to the smaller carriers that now operate in the Northeast market. These carriers include Northwest Airlines, which is in the process of buying the competing Trump Shuttle, and Continental Airlines, which is the biggest carrier in the New York market.
 
Intensified Competition
 Travelers going through New York may therefore see intensified competition that results in improved service. And the replacement of Pan Am by a vigorous carrier like Delta could mean a similar change for service across the Atlantic.
The sale is a blow to the approximately 10,000 Pan Am workers in the New York metropolitan area. Delta said it would offer jobs to about 6,000 of Pan Am's 22,000 workers. But most of these are expected to be workers overseas, at the other end of the international routes.
If Pan American World Airways is forced to shut down this fall, as expected, ticket holders are protected under an earlier agreement between Pan Am and United that provides $100 million for reimbursement for unused tickets. And Delta said it would honor Pan Am tickets on the routes it acquired for travel through Feb. 1, 1992.
 
Frequent-Flier Programs
 While nothing definitive has been worked out on what will happen to Pan Am's frequent-flier program, a Pan Am spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, said he expected Delta to come up with a way in which miles could be redeemed on Delta's system.
Analysts called the $260 million price a great bargain for Delta; the deal includes 45 airplanes, the coveted shuttle routes and an international network of routes that includes cities in Europe, the Soviet Union, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Other bidders could still emerge and top the price negotiated by Delta before the deal goes through.
Pan Am suspended service to South Africa voluntarily in 1985 before the anti-apartheid embargo were imposed on that country. Mr. Kriendler said it was not known what Delta would do about seeking the authority to fly to South Africa.
For Pan Am, whose rise and fall in the past half-century has tracked that of other once-prosperous American industries, the sale means the end is near. If the routes are sold to Delta as negotiated, all that will remain of the carrier will be its Latin American routes and a small system within the United States. Just this week United has been negotiating with Pan Am to buy the Latin American routes; other bidders are also on the scene.
"This is the end game," said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for Paine Webber, of Pan Am's most recent deal. "It has been coming for a decade."
Analysts said that Thomas G. Plaskett, the chairman of the Pan Am Corporation, was trying to carry out an orderly liquidation of the airline, to avoid a hasty fire sale after the carrier runs out of cash later this year.
Unable to compete after the industry was deregulated in 1978, Pan Am has been forced to sell assets including its headquarters building above Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, its Pacific routes and last fall its London routes to raise enough case to keep flying. Pan Am has bought more time for itself through yesterday's agreement by having Delta provide $60 million in cash as soon as the sales agreement is approved by the judge overseeing Pan Am's bankruptcy case, Cornelius Blackshear. The carrier sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in January.
 
 Approvals Are Needed

Pan Am is expected to seek approval for the sale at the United States Bankruptcy Court Southern District of New York in a couple of weeks. The sale also needs the approval of Pan Am creditors and the boards of both airlines. And it needs clearance from the Department of Transportation and the various European governments.
The Europeans are expected to be tough in the negotiations since they will demand new rights for their carriers serving the United States in return for allowing a powerful carrier as Delta into their countries.
Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Salomon Brothers, estimated that the fastest that approval could be granted would be about 45 days. But he said the $60 million might not be enough to keep Pan Am operating that long.
Founded in 1927, Pan Am grew and thrived when the industry was highly regulated; it dominated the market for international travel and seemed to some people to be the quasi-official United States carrier. It inaugurated service across the Pacific, ordered the first Boeing 747 and was widely known for its Clipper service. But it faltered under the pressures of deregulation. And in the last year it has been devastated by the decline in international traffic caused by the Persian Gulf war and the recession. Its operating costs soared as fuel prices doubled.
 
 Strong Are Surviving

The Pan Am-Delta deal would continue the trend of strong carriers buying the valuable rights to routes from weaker carriers like Pan Am and Trans World Airlines.
Of the 45 airplanes in the deal, 21 are modern Airbus A320's, which Delta can use on the European routes.
Mr. Maldutis said Delta would get a bargain on the assets, which analysts had valued at $500 million to $900 million. Donald J. Trump paid $365 million just for the Eastern Airlines shuttle in 1989. The Eastern shuttle's traffic had been cut severely by a strike by Eastern's unions. Mr. Trump has had problems winning back market share from Pan Am.
The Pan Am shuttle, acquired from New York Air in 1986 for $76 million, is healthy.
Delta already has a strong presence at La Guardia with its own modern terminal, which will make it a formidable competitor to the Trump Shuttle. Northwest Airlines has been in negotiations to buy the Trump shuttle but so far has not reached an agreement.
The sales agreement was worked out on Wednesday between Ronald W. Allen, the chairman of Delta, and Mr. Plaskett in Pan Am's board room.

HEADLINE: Court Upholds Welfare Curb When Children Leave Family

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Reversing lower-court decisions in two cases, a state appeals court yesterday upheld New York City's policy of cutting off most welfare payments to parents whose children are in foster care.
City lawyers had argued that a change in policy could lead parents to hand some of their children over to foster care in order to have more welfare money for the rest of their family. 
 In supporting the city's position, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court said it would be wrong for families to receive full monthly welfare payments under the Aid to Dependent Children program and also ask the taxpayers to pay for the foster care of their children.
 
Fiscal Crisis Noted
 The court said its rulings in both cases reflected state law, which permits such cutoffs, and were "bolstered by the recognition of the fact that the state and the city coffers are finite."
"In the perilous economic circumstances now confronting our city and state," the court said, "the governor, the mayor and elected state and local representatives are faced with many valid and oft-times competing demands for services and benefits."
The courts "must be wary of imposing their vision of the fairest allocation of funds," the ruling said.
Lawyers for the families in both cases said they would appeal the ruling. They said about 30,000 families in New York City depended on welfare payments while their children were in and out of foster care.
"Any policy that cuts off such benefits simply is stupid," said Russell Smith, the lawyer for one of the plaintiffs. "It sabotages families that are trying to keep themselves together."
 
Injunction Challenged
 Mr. Smith's client, Grace Campfield, had sued after the city cut off her benefits when she allowed her two children to be placed in foster care because she had emotional and addiction problems. Acting Justice Elliott Wilk in State Supreme Court barred city officials in January from ending the benefits. However, the effect of his injunction was nullified when the city appealed it.
"As a consequence," said Mr. Smith, "she was thrown out out of the welfare hotel where she was living and is now living in the streets."
In his Jan. 10 ruling, Justice Wilk said that "rather than taking all reasonable steps necessary to facilitate the return of children from foster care," the the city's policy "actually impedes reunification."
State law permits parents to receive a housing allowance for six months after their children go into foster care and for two months before their return. The rationale is that foster care is temporary and a housing subsidy helps prevent the breakup of the home.
But the law requires the cutoff of all other welfare benefits on the ground that the parents can take care of themselves.
Assistant City Corporation Counsel Leonard Koerner described the dual welfare and foster-care benefits as "double payment and thus inconsistent with the law."
In its argument to the appeals court, the city said it "envisioned a scenario in which a poor family with several children could either maintain all their children at the poverty level or place one or two in foster care and use the additional welfare funds received in their absence to improve the living standards of the others."
In the other case, the appellate court allowed the city to cut off welfare benefits to a Bronx woman whose two children and four grandchildren were taken from her in 1987. They were placed in foster care after a Family Court judge found that she had badly burned the hands of three children by holding them over a stove flame.

HEADLINE: Neighbor Is Charged in Killing of Woman, 75

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
A neighbor was charged yesterday in the killing of a 75-year-old widow on the Upper East Side, in a case that the police said was not a bias crime but a crime of opportunity.
The neighbor, a 32-year-old unemployed plumber named Charles Ocasio, beat and strangled the woman, Helen Clewell, when she resisted during a robbery attempt that began when he noticed that her door was ajar, Joseph R. Borrelli, the chief of detectives, said last night. 
 Mrs. Clewell was found dead about 11 P.M. Tuesday inside her apartment, 6H, at Rupert Towers at 1763 Second Avenue, between 92d and 93d Streets in Manhattan, the police said.
A note containing references to the Ku Klax Klan was found near her body. Chief Borrelli said that Mr. Ocasio, who lives with his mother in Apartment 6T, left the note behind "to kind of throw us off."
On Wednesday, investigators had classified the killing as a bias crime because of the note, even while suggesting that it might have been planted to divert attention. While the note referred to hatred of blacks, Jews and Hispanic people, Mrs. Clewell was a white Roman Catholic.
"He did not intend to kill the woman," Chief Borrelli said. "He probably intended a quick in-and-out to grab whatever he could in a burglary."
But Mrs. Clewell interrupted him and was "very combative and put up a very fierce struggle."
After knocking Mrs. Clewell unconscious, the police said, they believe Mr. Ocasio strangled her and then repeatedly stabbed her with two knives that were found in the apartment near her body.
Chief Borrelli said detectives believed from the start that they would find their killer somewhere in the building because its tight security would have made it very difficult for a stranger to gain entrance.
Despite initial reports that Mrs. Clewell's purse was missing from the apartment, Chief Borrelli said it had been found there.
"What he did take we don't feel amounted to too much," he said, declining to be more specific or to say what stolen items might have been recovered.
News of the arrest of a fellow tenant caused a commotion last night in the lobby of Mrs. Clewell's building.
"I'm such a nervous wreck," one woman told her neighbors.
"The lady was my friend," the doorman told residents. "She was a simple person. She never mixed with anyone. She had such a quiet voice. Such a soft soul she was."

Two Masks Go Home
 Two of the three American Indian ceremonial masks that were auctioned at Sotheby's in New York on May 21 -- despite protests by two tribes -- were returned last week to their tribal owners. 
 Elizabeth Sackler, president of the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation in New York, said by telephone from Santa Fe, N.M., this week that three members of the Hopi nation, including the chief of the Kachina clan of the First Mesa, seemed very pleased when the masks were returned at a meeting in Santa Fe on July 4. Miss Sackler said the masks were going to Walpi, Ariz., a Hopi pueblo.
Miss Sackler bought the two Hopi masks and a third one that is probably Navajo at Sotheby's sale for a total of $39,050. She said at the time that she intended to return them to their original owners. She has written to members of the Hopi tribe and also to the secretary of the Dineh Spiritual and Cultural Society of the Navajo nation, inviting representatives to examine the mask.
During the meeting, Miss Sackler said, she told the Hopi chief she had received many letters and phones calls since it was reported that she would return the masks. Because the public response was so positive, she said, "I decided to create a foundation that might help in the return of other ritual objects to the American Indian nations to whom they belong."
The foundation, to be called the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation, will be at 463 East 57th Street in Manhattan and will help collectors, foundations, art dealers, museums, individuals and corporations to return ritual objects to American Indian nations or assist in the financing of such efforts. Since it is to be a nonprofit organization, Miss Sackler said, those who participate will be considered donors of these objects, which would make them eligible for a tax deduction.
"The foundation would do all the research and correspondence necessary to insure the return of each object to its rightful owner," Miss Sackler said.
 
An Unearthed Blessing
 An 18th-century Italian painting of Roman ruins that was discovered last year in the attic of a Long Island parish house was sold recently at Christie's in New York for $242,000 -- six times the auction-house estimate. The Episcopal church where it was found was the consigner.
"I don't believe anybody who looked at it at first had any inkling of its value," said the Rev. Dr. Charles G. Newbery, rector of St. John's Lattington Episcopal Church in Locust Valley, in a telephone interview. "We had no idea how long the painting was in the attic or where it came from. Initially we thought it might be sold at our church fair. But the trail finally led to this auction."
The decision about selling the painting was made only five months ago, when two representatives of the church took it to Christie's. "They came to find out what the painting was," said Rachel Kaminsky, who heads Old Master paintings at Christie's in New York. "It was very dirty -- it had not been cleaned probably for 50 years or longer -- and there was some flaking around the edges. I told them immediately, 'This appears to be a work by Panini. In order for Christie's to sell it, we would have to have this attribution confirmed by Fernando Arisi, a Panini expert.' "
The church representatives agreed, and a transparency of the painting, which measures more than 2 feet by 4 feet, was sent to Mr. Arisi in Piacenza, Italy. In his reply in early March, Mr. Arisi confirmed Ms. Kaminsky's view, that it was a mature work, signed "IPP," a monogram of Giovanni Paolo Panini.
Auctioned on May 31 as "A Capriccio of Roman Ruins With Figures," the painting was given what Ms. Kaminsky said was a conservative presale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000 because of the recession and its size. "We were a bit nervous about what might happen in the sale," she said. "We wanted to be as conservative as we possibly could."
"The sale of the painting was quite exciting," Dr. Newbery said. "It represents a very great challenge to us. I have often thought of people who win money in the lottery. Sometimes they decide they can help other people with it. We have a tremendous opportunity to use the money wisely. But I am not the sole person to decide how this should be done."
 
A Gainsborough Record
 Gainsborough's newly discovered chalk drawing of a woman walking in a garden with a small child was sold on Tuesday for $991,760 at Christie's in London. The price, a record for an English drawing sold at auction, was well above the presale estimate of $650,000. The buyer was John Morton-Morris of Hazlitt, Gooden and Fox, London dealers.
 
Bronze From Benin
 At last month's sales of tribal art in London, a 17th- or 18th-century Benin bronze from western Africa, depicting a horse and rider, was sold for $811,475 at Sotheby's . The buyer was identified as a European collector. The price, which fell within the house estimate of $595,000 to $850,000, was the highest paid at these sales.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Industrial Policy The Korean Way

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
TODAY'S formula for economic success stresses free trade, unfettered markets and minimal governments. Yet the true Horatio Alger story of the third world, South Korea, gave government bureaucrats an unfashionably large role in shaping its economy. Does that mean the reformers have it all wrong? Hardly.
True, Seoul pursued industrial policy before anybody in Washington invented the term. "There really was a Government-business partnership in which Government very much had the upper hand," said Stanley Fischer, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Korea's authoritarian Government threw a protectionist blanket over infant industries, regularly butted into financial markets to control the flow of credit, and, time and again, bullied business into doing what it wanted. 
 Indeed, one of President Chung Hee Park's first moves in 1961, when Korea's remarkable transformation was just beginning, was to throw some of the country's corrupt capitalists into jail. Larry E. Westphal, an economist at Princeton, said President Park refused to release the executives until they agreed to invest their ill-gotten gains in Korea's new export drive.
Busybody bureaucrats might have strangled Korea's economy, as they did the once-prosperous Argentinas and Ghanas of the world. Instead, Korea, dismissed as an economic basket case by American benefactors in the 1950's, pulled itself out of poverty faster than almost any country ever has -- faster than the United States, Britain or even Japan. In four decades, South Korea's living standards have risen almost tenfold. With an income similar to that of Ghana and India at the time of the Korean War, Korea has since moved into the company of entry-level industrial countries like Czechoslovakia, Portugal and Greece.
The real lesson, World Bank economists say -- and the reason things turned out differently from the way they did in India or Ghana or Argentina -- is that Korea's meddling was "market friendly," "outward oriented" and less pervasive than appears at first glance. Korea's bureaucrats, said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University, "left a lot to private initiative."
For starters, Korea forced its infant industries to export, thus exposing them to the discipline of market competition. Goodies like cheap credit, tax breaks and outright subsidies were tied to achieving specific targets. Most of the time, when companies failed to thrive even with coddling, they were allowed to fold.
In India, by contrast, the Soviet-style planning bureaucracy created a Kafka-esque system of licensing and import controls that effectively shielded monopolies from domestic as well as foreign rivals. Not surpisingly, India's share of manufacturing in its economy has not grown for more than a decade. Moreover, its inefficient monopolies reaped fat profits at the expense of Indian consumers, who were forced to buy shoddy, high-priced goods. India's big manufacturers enjoyed profit margins of nearly 21 percent in the early 80's, six times the average for Korea's capitalists.
Korea also took a series of steps to guarantee that its actions to protect infant industries did not discourage exports. After the mid-60's, Seoul kept its exchange rate low. Moreover, Korea's exporters generally received exemptions from import tariffs and had access to credit subsidies. In many developing countries, on the other hand, import restrictions drastically distorted the domestic price system in favor of production for the domestic market.
Korea's meddling, pronounced as it was, was light compared with that of many governments. "On a 1 to 10 scale, with the U.S. 1 and Africa 10, Korea is a 3," said Andrei Shleifer, an economist at Harvard. Take the size of government. Government spending as a share of the economy is under 20 percent. Or trade barriers. In Pacific Rim countries, about a fifth of all goods are subject to tariffs or quotas. In India, half to three-fourths of all goods are covered.
Finally, "The Korean Government has always been a Government of do's," Mr. Bhagwati said. "One thing leads to another. The Indian Government, by contrast, has been a Government of 'don't's.' " While Seoul nagged business to meet export targets, New Delhi required some companies to get 200 licenses before they could send a single shipment overseas.
The Indian system "stifled a lot of initiative with enormously detailed controls and restrictions," Mr. Bhagwati said. "We didn't get as much out of our investment as we could have."
Most economists doubt that Korea's industrial policy can easily be duplicated. "Experience indicates that more nations fail than succeed with industrial policies," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist at the World Bank.
But Korea's lessons have not been lost on India, which took some tentative steps to open up its economy in the early 80's. Result: India's economy expanded briskly in the last decade while per capita incomes rose three times as fast -- at 3 percent a year -- as in earlier decades.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
NBC Is Closing News Bureau in New York

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
In a striking effort to cut costs, NBC said yesterday that it was closing its New York bureau, which has a news staff of 11.
That announcement comes a day after NBC said it planned to close its Miami news bureau, which has a total staff of 13. The closings in New York and Miami will reduce the number of NBC news bureaus in the United States to seven. 
 In addition, the Frankfurt news bureau will be closed and the staff of the London bureau has been reduced. NBC has also reduced its employees in Boston and Pittsburgh.
NBC is owned by the General Electric Company, and a number of NBC employees said they felt that G.E. had been particularly aggressive in its cost-cutting efforts.
NBC did not disclose how much it would save by closing the news bureaus.
The mood at the New York bureau was grim yesterday. "The network news bureau is being decimated," one employee said. Another said, "This is the end of an industry." Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
The cutbacks will mainly affect the New York bureau's correspondents and producers. It was unclear how many of them would remain with NBC. The bureau will close at the end of September.
Several NBC news employees said that as the network closed bureaus and laid off people, it was changing from a news-gathering organization to little more than a news-production company that gets its news from outside sources.
"We have to use material from outside vendors and affiliates because we will no longer have the capability of producing our own material," an NBC staff member said.
Some NBC employees also complained that while the cutbacks were taking place, Robert C. Wright, NBC's president and chief executive, and his staff had recently moved into new offices at the network's headquarters in 30 Rockefeller Center. A company spokeswoman, Betty Hudson, said the remodeling of the offices was started two and a half years ago when the network's profit outlook was brighter. But a news executive said NBC had been feeling financial pressures for at least that long.
NBC, like ABC and CBS, has been buffeted for the last year by a weak advertising market. In addition, the increasing number of rivals on cable channels has steadily eroded all three broadcast networks' shares of the television audience.
NBC's latest cutbacks came as CBS and ABC also moved to cut costs. Earlier this week, ABC announced that it would lay off 100 employees.
Michael Gartner, the president of NBC News, was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. An NBC spokeswoman, Peggy Hubble, said that while the cutbacks were tied in part to television's current economic realities, NBC was also taking into account that the networks were working more closely to gather news and that local stations were doing more of the news-gathering work. "We are focusing on analysis and interpretation of news," she said.
Don Brown, executive vice president of NBC News, said it was misleading to talk about "closing" bureaus. He said that some correspondents would remain in place in New York and that in Miami, NBC's local affiliate employed an aggressive journalist who would also be working for the network. "We are doing things now the way we did things in the 1970's when there were few local bureaus," he said.
"NBC Nightly News" is currently No. 3 in the ratings among the three network newscasts. But Mr. Brown said the network was continuing to provide quality news programming. He said NBC was adding news programs, including "Expose," to its lineup.
At NBC's New York bureau, the cutbacks will affect its correspondents and producers because they work exclusively for the network news. The camera crews and other technical people will not be directly affected because they generally work for a variety of different programs, several people at the bureau said.
NBC had said its New York station, WNBC, would absorb the network correspondents and producers, who would then do assignments for both local and network news.
"They told everybody you have jobs, but we don't know where," an NBC News employee said.
But as of yesterday, the network said it was unsure where those people would work.
"People are scared to death," a longtime NBC employee said.
One correspondent said he had been told that he was being dismissed. "They told me that they could not find a place for me in the organization," he said. "I don't have a contract. They are trying to reduce head count, so I am an easy target."
Some of the New York producers and correspondents have contracts, so they will be retained.

An article in Business Day yesterday about NBC cutbacks misidentified the source of the news announcement in some editions. It was NBC itself, not its parent, the General Electric Company.

HEADLINE: Beijing Journal;
The Russians Are Coming and Buying and Selling

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 12

 BODY:
Like a lot of tourists, Dmitri sauntered through a popular street market on a steamy afternoon, bargaining with the merchants over silk shirts and shorts. But unlike most visitors, he will not see the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square or the Forbidden City.
In fact, when Dmitri struck his bargain, it was for a dozen shirts. As he pushed them into a huge, overstuffed nylon sack, he pulled out a handful of cheap watches to sell to the shopkeeper. 
 Dmitri, who would not give his last name, is from Kiev, and he is part of a telling new phenomenon: a wave of Soviet citizens and Eastern Europeans for whom Beijing is just a stop on the capitalist road to riches.
This is a terminus of a route traversed by the trans-Siberian railway and Aeroflot jetliners carrying groups of Soviet people puffing on American cigarettes, carping about conditions back home and sweating their way to wealth.
 
Return With Silk
 The Russians and other Europeans bring cash or the few things obtainable back home: cameras, watches and the like. They return with the fabled products of the East, mostly silk. Given the shortages of such goods in the Soviet Union, it might as well be gold.
As explained by Dmitri, who was on his second trip, it is easy to turn a $1,000 investment into $2,500.
"Since the crisis, it's almost impossible to find anything to wear," said Peter, a Russian student who also would not give his last name. "We come here and buy anything. It doesn't really matter because we can get so much money for it in Moscow."
The bustle is a product of a striking asymmetry that says much about the shifts rending the Communist world -- of a Soviet Union that is loosening political and social controls but whose economy is collapsing, and of a China whose citizens suffer travel and other restrictions but can trade freely in abundant consumer goods.
 
An Open Market Thrives
 The key site for this drama is the open market between the American Embassy and the Jian Guo Hotel near central Beijing, on Xiushui East Street.
First there are the Americans and Europeans in bright T-shirts and sunglasses, who flit breezily from stall to stall, bargaining half-heartedly. For the Russians and the few Eastern Europeans, however, it is all business.
There are husband-and-wife teams, clusters of college-age youths, the odd diplomat and the "professionals," who ply the trade for their livelihoods.
These pros generally work in pairs and carry a weary air that comes from their frequent encounters with the routine and Beijing's beer.
"I know a guy who comes every two weeks with $1,000 in cash, but to do this you have to be part of an organization, if you know what I mean," Peter said.
 
The Tell-Tale Bags
 These refugees from Soviet food lines are recognizable by their large nylon bags, empty if they have just arrived, swelled into massive burdens if they have finished trawling through the 150-yard line of stalls.
And language is no problem. When they stop to negotiate, the peddlers engage in spirited conversations using the new commercial lingua franca: a Japanese pocket calculator.
Each side punches out a bid or offered price, often accompanied by a string of curses in a tongue the other cannot comprehend. They pass this battery-driven communicator back and forth until its luminous figures spell agreement.
"They are nit-pickers," said Zhang Xiao Dong, a merchant who, like his neighbors here, owns his stall. "They never stop pushing, and sometimes they'll come back the next day and try to return something if they found a better price."
Some of the Chinese seem to take pleasure in the humbling of their former big brothers in the Communist world. Three Russians, a woman and two men, tried recently to peddle music boxes, children's watches and cut-glass goblets.
"You must be really poor trying to sell us this junk," one shopkeeper said with a scowl, to a cackle of agreement from several other Chinese observing the action.
An hour later a Chinese merchant put his cupped hands to his eyes whenever Russians passed by -- a sign he was looking for the binoculars some of the visitors bring. On a recent afternoon, a stout Russian with a handlebar mustache sold two gold rings to a shopkeeper, and was given his choice of American dollars or yuan, the Chinese currency.
Peter explained the economics of these trips. First, the traders must obtain passports, a commodity that costs about 10,000 rubles, he said. No visa is required for Soviet citizens visiting China. A round-trip air ticket between Moscow and Beijing costs less than $200.
Many of the Soviet tourists lodge at the Guo Tai Hotel, a short walk from the outdoor market. It is preferred because it has minibus service to and from the airport, breakfast is included in the rate, and the menus are in Russian. It costs $15 a night.
Rail is used by the younger and stronger merchants with time on their hands. The trans-Siberian train leaves Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 8:32 P.M. To watch people bolt for the rail cars once the doors open is to witness the truth in Dmitri's comment: "This is not a joke. Believe me, it is work."
Some of the Russians force their enormous bags through the windows of the waiting room onto the platform. It would be easier to load a camel.
With one hand they wrestle with their massive luggage, while lugging in the other sacks full of beer and watermelons to cool their wilted frames once the train gets under way. To the growing number of Soviet tourists here, that is what China is all about.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Can I.R.S. Rules Ever Be Simple?

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
If the term tax simplification does not yet rival, say, jumbo shrimp or guest host as an easily identified oxymoron, it must be gaining fast.
For one thing, legislation aimed at making things simpler is proliferating. In addition to the consensus simplification bill (HR 2777-S 1394) introduced recently by the chairmen and ranking minority members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, there were already a half-dozen others. 
 Separate measures backed by the Ways and Means chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, deal with pensions (HR 2730), mutual funds (HR 2735) and items the Chicago Democrat deems worthy but that lack full staff agreement (HR 2775). In addition, Representative Rod Chandler has his own pension simplification bill (HR 2641), as do the chief of the Senate Finance panel, Lloyd Bentsen, and a committee member, David Pryor (S 1364). And word has it that Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum will shortly offer a pension bill, too.
It will not be easy to advance a bill, despite the fact that the consensus measure given the best chance of enactment -- the Tax Simplification Act of 1991 -- was intended to be noncontroversial. It was also intended to meet the test, set in the 1990 budget agreement, of not affecting total revenue.
Specialists are now finding some provisions downright contentious, such as how the bill treats a large class of taxpayers: investors in partnerships with at least 250 members, many of whom are suffering big losses from the recession.
One feature of the bill calls for certain limitations on deductions and credits to be applied at the partnership level. This means, among other things, that the partners will no longer get deductions of up to $3,000 a year for capital losses and that any subsequent Internal Revenue Service audit adjustment will affect only current partners rather than those who were part of the group during the year at issue. The partnership would not be allowed to report a capital loss; any tax benefit would have to come as an offset to subsequent gains by the partnership.
"If you've got an economic loss it should belong to you," contends David A. Berenson, national director of tax policy at Ernst & Young, the big accounting firm. "We should not create differing rules for gains, as compared to losses, under the banner of simplification." He added that the proposed change would also reverse longstanding efforts to integrate the tax system more thoroughly.
At the same time, the bill moves in the opposite direction by liberalizing the restrictions governing the 1.2 million closely held and mostly small companies that choose to be taxed under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. "S" corporations would be allowed to have more than one class of stock, thereby making family businesses easier to pass along and allowing them to have subsidiaries.
Since simplification is always at war with equity, as Mr. Rostenkowski tirelessly points out, even a supposedly noncontroversial bill creates winners and losers. The odds against passage become formidable when such a vehicle can be subjected, as in the Senate, to virtually any amendment.
 
 Pension Fund Rule

Senator Bentsen has asked Congressional tax aides to study a possible relaxation of restrictions on pension-fund investments. Mr. Bentsen, pointing to what he called overreaction by regulators to banks' excesses in real estate, said he would like to see pension funds -- the "perfect" vehicle for long-term, often illiquid commitments -- raise their stakes in this area. Dutch funds have long had large real estate portfolios, and British funds have raised theirs substantially over the last 15 years.
Still, Mr. Bentsen said at a conference here this week that he did not intend to try to ease the passive-loss restrictions imposed in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Any changes, which would probably have to be retroactive, would generate new inequities, he said.
 
 Footnotes
 The Internal Revenue Service fails to impose proper penalties for negligence or substantial underpayment in about one-third of cases in which they are warranted, according to a survey by the General Accounting Office. About 85 percent of the errors are in the taxpayer's favor.
A bill introduced by freshman Representative Mike Kopetski, an Oregon Democrat who lost a 1988 run for Congress by 700 votes, would provide a tax credit of up to $100 for campaign contributions to those who challenge incumbents.

HEADLINE: Head of U.N. Mission in Baghdad Asks Council to Relax Sanctions

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 12

 BODY:
The head of the United Nations mission assessing Iraq's humanitarian needs called on the Security Council today to relax sanctions so Iraq can obtain the money to import food, medicine and other essential supplies, saying that otherwise the country is heading for "a major catastrophe."
"Iraqi funds must be used soon," the United Nations envoy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, said. 
 The Security Council's sanctions committee is scheduled to meet in New York again next Monday to consider an Iraqi request to be allowed to sell about $1 billion worth of oil on international markets to finance the purchase of humanitarian goods.
 
Richardson Given Message
 The Iraqi Defense Minister on Thursday gave a message to Elliot L. Richardson, the former Attorney General who is a member of the United Nations mission, saying Iraq wants better relations with Washington and has assured the United States that it also seeks peaceful relations with all Middle East nations including Israel.
The Defense Minister, Hussein Kamel, who is President Saddam Hussein's cousin and son-in-law and is widely considered the second most powerful man in the country, asked Mr. Richardson to convey the message to the American Government.
Mr. Richardson was unwilling to disclose details of the message or to assess its significance.
But those familiar with the conversation say Defense Minister Kamel emphasized that Iraq now wants to see a more stable and peaceful Middle East and favors steps to control the buildup of arms in the region.
At the end of his mission's visit to Iraq today, Prince Sadruddin said he would present a plan in Geneva on Monday under which the United Nations could relax sanctions so Iraq gets cash to pay for essential imports while insuring that the money is correctly spent and the goods are fairly distributed around the country.
"Sanctions were never designed to make people suffer the way they are suffering now," Prince Sadruddin said at a news conference, adding, "We need to design an acceptable formula for easing them."
He said Iraq could get access to foreign exchange if the Security Council allows it to sell limited quantities of oil again or if the United States and other nations release money from the overseas bank accounts they have blocked.
Asked about the Bush Administration's contention that Iraq still has secret caches of gold and foreign currency around the world sufficient to pay for such imports, Mr. Richardson replied that Iraqi officials had assured him that this was untrue.
About $5 billion worth of foreign Iraqi assets are now blocked. While there are several hundred million dollars more in foreign accounts of private Iraqi individuals and companies, the Government argues that it has no control over these.
The message given to Mr. Richardson appears to be the latest of a series of conciliatory gestures Iraq has made as the Security Council approaches a decision on whether to ease sanctions.
After weeks of stalling, Iraq finally acknowledged this week that it had been operating a clandestine uranium enrichment program that might permit it to obtain nuclear explosives in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 
U.S. Charges Deception
 But the Bush Administration has asserted that this new list of Iraq's secret nuclear material is still incomplete.
Today Iraq allowed Prince Sadruddin, whose family is the traditional leader of a Shiite Muslim sect, to visit the 95-year-old Grand Ayatollah Khoi, the most senior Shiite cleric in Iraq, who is living under house arrest in the southern city of Khufa.
The Grand Ayatollah told him that several members of his family and many of his followers either had disappeared or were in prison.
On Thursday, after long negotiations, Iraq also permitted Prince Sadruddin to set up a United Nations humanitarian presence in the southern Iraqi marshes after withdrawing the army from the region. This followed United Nations accusations that Iraqi forces were blockading dissident Shiite refugees in the marshes and shooting them.
Presenting the mission's assessment of Iraqi nutritional difficulties, Sir John Moberly, a former British Ambassador to Baghdad, said low-priced Government rations account for only a third of an average family's needs.
As a result, people are being forced to sell jewelry, furniture and television sets to buy extra rations on the free market, where prices have soared hundreds of percent since the end of the Persian Gulf war. But many are now getting to the end of these resources.
Before the gulf crisis began, Iraq had been spending some $2 billion a year on importing 70 percent of its people's food needs. With Iraq's lack of money for such imports now, Sir John said, the mission had noted "signs of impending famine" around the country.
Similarly, the mission's medical experts pointed out that Iraq had spent some $500 million a year on foreign medical supplies before sanctions were imposed.
But the total volume of medical aid Iraq is now receiving is worth less than a fifth of this amount and mainly concentrated on the needs of children. As a result, there is a steady deterioration in medical conditions throughout the country, with many hospitals shutting down operating rooms, X-ray machines and sophisticated equipment because of a lack of supplies.
 
U.S. RESPONDS COOLLY
 WASHINGTON, July 12 (Special to The New York Times) -- The Bush Administration took a cool view today of a proposal by the head of a United Nations mission for the easing of sanctions against Iraq.
A State Department official pointed out that Baghdad had yet to comply with a request from the sanctions committee for a report detailing Iraq's foreign currency reserves, adding that no action could be taken by the United Nations body on sanctions until that information became available.
On Thursday, the Administration said that since March 22, when sanctions were relaxed to allow shipments of food to Iraq, a total of 1.1 million tons of food had been sent. "That makes one ton for every 18 Iraqis," a State Department spokesman said.
Administration officials said they had not seen the letter given to Mr. Richardson by the Iraqi Defense Minister and would not comment on it until they had reviewed its contents.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollars Sold In 'Ambush' By Group of 7

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The United States and its economic allies yesterday executed an "amubush" in the foreign exchange market, with waves of coordinated selling that knocked the value of the dollar down as much as 2.4 percent. The move also appeared to be a quid pro quo for the German decision on Thursday not to raise interest rates.
The coordinated action seemed to dispel, for now, a belief that the strong dollar was of little or no concern as the United States and its allies prepared for the seven-nation economic summit in London next week. Yesterday's pre-emptive strike showed that the Group of Seven -- which also includes Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- was still paying attention. 
 After the swirl of dollar selling that began in Europe and included several interventions by the Federal Reserve, traders and analysts were seeing all sorts of clues that led to several conclusions:
One, that in exchange for not raising interest rates, the German Bundesbank appeared to get a promise from the Bush Administration and the Fed to resist a further rise in the dollar. Raising interest rates would support the mark by making mark-denominated securities more attractive. So, when the dollar rose Thursday and again this morning in Europe, these central banks and others in Europe repeatedly intervened.
Two, that the Bush Administration, which has been pushing for lower global interest rates to help the American recovery, got some relief when the Germans held off. Britain cut rates yesterday, and France could soon follow suit.
Both conclusions seemed to add to the downward pressure on the dollar, which closed in New York trading at 1.7895 marks, down from 1.8339 Thursday. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell to 136.35 yen, down 1.7 percent, from 138.65 yen.
 
 Aggressive Selling by Fed

The clues that people were pointing to included the apparently aggressive dollar selling by the Federal Reserve. Jack A. Kessler, senior vice president at the Chase Manhattan Bank, said the intervention was forceful because the Fed continued to sell dollars as the currency was falling. Another sign was the unusual confirmation from Bush Administration officials that the Fed had intervened.
And there was the swap at the end of June between the Bundesbank and the Fed of possibly $1 billion in currencies. This operation, market analysts contended, gave both the Fed and the Bundesbank more ammunition for pushing the dollar lower.
"This development is more significant than I thought this morning," said Nicholas P. Sargen, director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers in New York. "The Fed's involvement raises the idea that there was broader Group of Seven coordination."
Added Liliana Nealon, vice president of the Union Bank of Switzerland, "I think they wanted to pre-empt the meeting and show a spirit of cooperation."
But a broader question remains: whether the United States and its allies are really unhappy with the current level of the dollar, which is still up more than 20 percent this year, and want it to fall much lower than where it ended yesterday.
Comments this week from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady indicated that the United Sates was not worried. In an interview Thursday night on the Cable News Network, he said he did not expect his summit colleagues to pressure the United States for a lower dollar. He said the current level of the dollar should not hurt American exports and did not represent a "breakout" from the trading range of the last four or five years.
And while the Bundesbank prefers a stronger mark, its recent actions did not indicate that it was seriously worried as long as the dollar did not move much higher, said Gabriele Lamers, an international economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
Richard Witten, a partner for foreign exchange at Goldman, Sachs & Company in New York, said the ambush would not sap the dollar's strength.
But the intervention could work for a while, he said, and it did announce the return of the Group of Seven. "The dollar was moving too fast," he continued. "If there was not intervention today, the dollar would have been at 1.85, and this kind of negates the idea of the Group of Seven in charge. So they did what any central bank would do. They intervened."

HEADLINE: Pan Am Will Leave Memories, and Job Hunters

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
With the anticipated demise of Pan American World Airways, New Yorkers are witnessing the undoing of not just an important employer, but one whose triumphs and tribulations had in many ways become a part of their lives.
For some, there were memories of large seaplanes bobbing beside what is now the Marine Air Terminal at La Guardia Airport and bitter debates over the desirability of a 59-story building looming over the city's grand Grand Central Terminal. 
 But for others, the effect is far more immediate and wrenching: thousands will likely lose their jobs and face the prospect of searching for new ones in the midst of what is still a raging local recession.
"Right now, I'm living day to day and hoping for the best," said Kenneth Kwan, a 59-year old-customer service agent who has worked for the airline for 26 years. "It's possible that I will lose my job, in which case I don't know what I'll do. I really don't even want to think about it."
Although the profit-starved airline has been shrinking for years, it still employs about 10,000 people in the New York metropolitan region. Delta Air Lines, which on Thursday agreed to buy many of Pan Am's overseas routes and its East Coast shuttle, has indicated that out of Pan Am's total work force of 22,000 it is likely to retain only 6,000 -- and many of those will be people connected to the airline's international routes.
Neither airline has indicated exactly how many Pan Am employees in the New York area will be kept on. But about 5,000 of them work in the airline's large maintenance center at Kennedy International Airport, which Delta is not acquiring. It is unlikely, therefore, that many of those working in that center will be needed, since Delta is expected to maintain its newly acquired planes at its own hub in Atlanta.
Despite the personal hardship they are likely to encounter, many employees yesterday still harbored the feeling that Pan Am was something special. Pointing to his uniform, a pale blue work shirt inscribed with his name and the company logo, one ramp agent who has been with the airline for just a year said: "I'm going to miss the logo. It's like as old as Coca-Cola or something. It makes me sick to lose it."
This is the airline, after all, whose Yankee Clipper set off from Long Island in 1939 on the first commercial trans-Atlantic flight, stirring Americans across the country and lending credence to the notion that America dominated the world in aviation. And it is the one that featuredsported a heliport atop its headquarters building, until a propeller fell off in 1977 and killed a passer-by below.
A professor of economics at New York University, Mitchell Moss, says that while New Yorkers may like to reminisce about Pan Am's historical significance, the airline has been in decline for so many years that this changing of the guard is a welcome development.
"Just because it's been associated with New York doesn't mean it's an asset," he said. "We're trading up: New York is getting a better carrier."
While Delta's expansion in New York may be good news for the region over the long haul, it is the near term that many employees are worried about. They are, after all, entering the job market at a time when the city's unemployment rate is 8.7 percent and when the market for airline workers is shrinking.
In January Eastern Airlines laid off 1,500 of its New York City employees. And many airlines are still suffering from a decline in traffic that resulted from the national recession and fear of traveling during the Persian Gulf war.
In May, the number of workers in New York City's airline industry was 50,700. That is down from 54,500 at year's end and from 54,300 in May of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"I'm nervous and upset," said Kathy Kallman, who has been a flight attendant with Pan Am for 11 years and is based in Miami. "If I lose this job, I'll probably get out of the business. I can't start out at the bottom of the list again, no way, not with two children."
For at least one airline, the prospects for jobs are not bright. "U.S. Air has had a hiring freeze on since the middle of last year," explained Susan Young, a spokeswoman for that airline. And if and when it gets ready to hire again, she added, managers have promised to recall those who were previously laid off.
 
Career Counseling at Airport
 New York State's Department of Labor opened a career center at Kennedy Airport last December and has been counseling workers laid off by Eastern. Philip Stroh, who oversees that office, says that people at the lower end of the pay scale who are willing to be flexible will eventually find work.
Baggage handlers can be redirected to warehouse jobs, reservations agents to the real-estate and financial services industries and airplane cleaners to other cleaning services, he said. But it is bound to take time, and he is worried about the sheer numbers.
Using those techniques, "may be we've put 100 people to work since last December. But that won't tackle the thousands," he said.
After all, the job market is already flooded with the 6,300 workers who were laid off at the end of June by the Dinkins administration because of budget problems. And they came on top of the 117,000 who have lost their jobs over the last two years.
Job opportunities are not expected to materialize until the local economy begins to grow again. And no one knows when that will be. "I don't see anywhere a sign of a turnaround or a resumption of growth," said Regina Armstrong, an economic consultant for the Regional Plan Association.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 21.02 in a Seesaw Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks gave Wall Street investors and traders a case of the heebie-jeebies yesterday, before ending with a strong gain.
Keeping up its erratic pace of the last week, the Dow Jones industrial average bounced around for most of the session before ending at 2,980.77, up 21.02 points for the day and 48.30, or 1.6 percent, for the week. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 also rose 1.6 percent for the week. But the smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite, rose almost 4 percent for the week. High-technology stocks, particularly those in biotechnology, contributed substantially to the over-the-counter market's strength.
Traders seemed at a loss to explain the market's erratic performance. Uncertainty over the sluggish economy, the direction of interest rates and corporate earnings seemed to be the main reasons.
Still, trading activity on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 174.8 million shares, from 157.9 million the day before, while rising stocks exceeded those that declined by 2 to 1. Taking advantage of the market's volatility, program trading was particularly heavy, even though the ultimate impact was small.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors such trading, said that it tracked four buying waves and five selling flurries for an hour and a quarter of activity, but that such trading had dropped the Dow fell less than five points by the end of the day.
Commenting on the frustration of traders watching the market's gyrations, Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson, Lehman Brothers, said: "It was up and down all day long. It puts people off balance. If you're bullish, you think you're all right, and the next hour you wonder what happened to make it go down, and there wasn't any news.
"If you can see through the volatility, forget about the volatility," he said. "You'll see that for the past week the O-T-C's begun to outperform the S.&P. 500."
"It usually means that the market's O.K.," he said, adding that it could "work itself higher and still has a chance to continue the summer rally started two weeks ago."
"It's been a rough start," he continued, "up and down, up and down. The uptrend's there, but the volatility is masking it."
 
A Jump at the Opening

In one short burst, the Dow took off on the opening bell, rising 15 points. By 11:30 the blue chips had sunk 20 from where they were. They recovered most of the slide in the following two hours, held steady for a while and then headed up, only to drop a bit near the close.
In two of the day's strong movers, an Alabama Supreme Court ruling on hazardous waste toppled Waste Management Inc. and its partly owned subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management Inc.
Leading the Big Board active list, Waste Management fell 2, to 35 1/4, on 5.5 million shares. Chemical Waste, No. 2, fell 2 3/4, to 18 1/4, on 3.9 million shares.
In another big move, Triton Energy rose 3, to 23 1/2, on 1.9 million shares. Thomas Driscoll, energy analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the stock would outperform the market. Reuters reported that traders attributed the move to remarks to analysts yesterday by British Petroleum about Colombian oil discoveries. It said Triton held about 20 percent of the properties and that they might yield more than a billion barrels.
British Petroleum rose 2 3/8, to 69 5/8, in brisk trading. Royal Dutch Petroleum rose 2 3/8, to 79 3/8. The Royal Dutch rise may have been related to remarks at the B.P. meeting about a promising Royal Dutch/Shell field in the Gulf of Mexico.
Among the Dow industrials, five stocks accounted for almost 60 percent of the day's upturn -- Coca-Cola, up 1 7/8, to 57 3/4; Merck, up 1 1/2, to 119 7/8; Philip Morris, up 1 1/4, to 67 3/4; I.B.M., up 1 1/8, to 99 3/8, and J. P. Morgan, up 1 1/8, to 53 1/4.
In the tech group, Digital Equipment rose 3 1/8, to 65 7/8. It is joining with a Brazilian partner to make computers in Brazil.
SciMed Life, maker of disposable medical products, rose 3 5/8, to 80. Reuters said Edward Mutsch of Piper Jaffray attributed it partly to short-sellers who had sold borrowed stock in expectation of paying less for it later but were forced to buy it back now because it was going up. He called the stock undervalued.

HEADLINE: Drexel Suit by Southmark

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DALLAS, July 12

 BODY:
 he Southmark Corporation today demanded more than $200 million from Michael R. Milken and other former officials of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., saying their greed forced the company into bankruptcy.
In a lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court in Dallas, Southmark said that Mr. Milken, who is serving a 10-year Federal prison term, and others at Drexel overburdened the real estate development company with debt and then led it into highly speculative investments. That was "solely to satisfy the greed of the Milken group and other defendants," Southmark said in the suit. 
 Southmark recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings and is liquidating its assets to pay creditors what amounts to less than 10 cents on the dollar. It filed for bankruptcy protection in July 1989 after two years of financial difficulties. In the third quarter of 1989, Southmark lost $1.04 billion.
The Texas economy collapsed in the mid-1980's along with energy prices, bursting the oil-producing state's bubble and sending real estate values into a tailspin. Southmark managers, who were just taking over from the former chairman, Gene Phillips, and the former vice chairman, William Friedman, blamed the previous management.
But in the lawsuit, Southmark lays the blame on Drexel officials and particularly on Mr. Milken, who transformed the firm's high-risk, high-yield bond department into a Wall Street powerhouse in the 1980's.
Mr. Milken was sentenced to 10 years in prison last November after pleading guilty to six charges of illegal securities trading in April 1990. He also agreed to pay $200 million in fines and to make $400 million in restitution. Drexel, which pleaded guilty to six felony counts of securities fraud in 1988, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in February 1990.

HEADLINE: June Producer Prices Fell by Unexpected 0.3%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Producer prices fell last month, the Government said today, easing inflation fears but underscoring the shaky nature of the economic recovery.
The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices charged wholesalers for processed and manufactured goods, fell an unexpected three-tenths of a percent. 
 Falling prices are a sign that demand is weak and costs are under control. The broad-based decline was led by cheaper food and energy costs.
In May, producer prices rose by six-tenths of a percent.
 
 Rate of Minus 1.5 Percent

The drop brought the pace of inflation at the producer level so far this year to an annual rate of minus 1.5 percent, compared with an 8.2 percent oil-driven increase during the Persian Gulf crisis in the last half of 1990.
But fears that the economy will falter as it begins to emerge from the recession were fueled by the Commerce Department's report that retail sales fell two-tenths of a percent. May sales also were revised downward to an eight-tenths gain from the previously reported 1 percent increase.
"This pushes the evidence a little bit more toward a weak recovery and the possibility that the Federal Reserve will have to ease credit some more," said Robert McGee, chief economist at the Tokai Bank in New York.
 
Outlook Bullish to Brady

Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was nonetheless bullish about the economic outlook. "The conversations I've had with industrialists in this country indicate that June was a better month than May," he told reporters.
Mr. Brady said the recession had hit bottom and that the economy was on its way up. He also said he was "particularly pleased" with the drop in producer prices, which "seem to indicate that inflation is at a much more controllable rate."
But some analysts fear that the return to modest growth, signaled by an upturn in the housing market and a pickup in factory production, will be short-lived, and that relatively high interest rates will cause a downturn later this year.
 
Leeway Seen for Fed

While this is not the predominant view, economists said the calming of the inflation rate did give the central bank leeway to stimulate growth if the recovery appeared threatened.
The yield on the 30-year bond has climbed in recent months, in part because of fears that the recent Fed easing may reignite inflation. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has cited the high rates as a factor restraining the central bank's monetary policy.
Donald Ratajczak, head of the forecasting unit at Georgia State University, said that, with a couple of more months of good inflation figures, 30-year bond yields should fall. "There is no reason for long bonds to be above 8 percent," he added. The benchmark 30-year bond closed today with a yield of 8.43 percent, down from 8.46 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: A High Court Victory, But an Empty Pocket

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Of all the stories of those who have won victories in the United States Supreme Court, Sheldon B. Toibb's surely ranks among the most bittersweet.
Last month, the Court ruled 8-to-1 that individuals can seek court protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which is normally reserved for faltering businesses. That decision should help some bankrupt individuals keep valuable assets like stock. A Chapter 7 filing, the main option previously for individuals, requires selling or giving up such holdings. 
 "One person said: 'God bless. You've really saved me,' " Mr. Toibb recalled.
 
Victory Seems Hollow

But for Mr. Toibb, a round-faced, high-strung man of 41, the victory seems hollow. The asset he went to the Supreme Court to protect, 400 shares in the Independence Electric Corporation, may be worthless. What remains is largely invective for those who helped drive his case to the nation's highest court: Mr. Toibb's onetime business partners, G. William Miller, the former Treasury Secretary who is chairman of Federated Department Stores, and Sidney J. Brown, a Washington-area developer.
In 1983, the three men, intrigued by Mr. Toibb's vision of cheap power and millions in profits, formed Independence Electric to build hydroelectric plants in the Southeast. But so far the company has not produced the energy to illuminate a single light bulb, leaving instead a legacy of bitterness and at least $249,000 in unpaid bills.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Brown both say that Independence Electric is an episode they are putting behind them. But for Mr. Toibb, unemployed and living with his parents in St. Louis for the last five years, it is one he cannot forget. Some see Independence Electric's story as a tale about the hazards facing the uninitiated whose hopes overreach reality.
"It has been an unpleasant situation in the extreme for all participants and a classic situation where the chemistry of the parties did not gel," said Stuart Eizenstat, the former domestic policy adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a lawyer, whose firm worked for the company.
The three principals were an odd mix. While Mr. Miller moves easily among the world's financial leaders, Mr. Brown has made his fortune in the scrappy world of real estate. Mr. Toibb said he viewed them as "father figures" who would make his dreams come true.
His plan to build hydroelectric plants began in 1980 when he was a lawyer at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The climate for alternative energy seemed bright. Oil prices were high and utilities had to buy power from alternative producers at favorable rates.
Mr. Toibb envisioned building dams in the Southeast and selling the electrical output to utilities in Florida, where energy needs were skyrocketing.
"We'd generate power cheaply," he said, "and it would be cheaper for a utility to buy from us than build a new oil-fired plant."
 
'A Brilliant and Ingenious Plan'

In 1981, he quit his position to develop his plan, showing it in 1983 to Mr. Eizenstat, who had hired Mr. Toibb during the Carter Presidential campaign to lobby Jewish organizations. "It was a brilliant and ingenious plan," said Mr. Eizenstat, who offered to help find investors.
Mr. Miller, who had formed his own merchant bank after resigning his Treasury post, was the first to climb aboard. He contributed $100,000 and served as the company's unsalaried president. Mr. Brown, whose development projects included the Beltway Plaza mall in Greenbelt, Md., invested $1 million. He received a 60 percent interest; Mr. Miller, 16 percent, and Mr. Toibb, 24 percent, and an annual $50,000 consulting fee.
"I look forward to working with you to build a major new enterprise that will serve the energy needs of our country," Mr. Miller wrote to Mr. Toibb in March 1983.
 
 Souring of Relationships

Soon, however, Mr. Toibb said he was being criticized by Mr. Miller for, among other things, suggesting too many studies of dam sites. "He told me I didn't know anything about business and that I ought to go dig ditches," Mr. Toibb said.
He said he was soon asked not to use an office in Mr. Miller's bank in Washington and, in return, fired off one of many long memos, this one accusing Mr. Miller of ignoring the company. "Miller is being selfish and is a quitter," he wrote to Mr. Brown in December 1983.
But Mr. Brown backed Mr. Miller, and his relationship with Mr. Toibb also soured. One problem involved a 1985 plan to raise more money and sweeten the deal by giving free stock to Mr. Miller and Michael H. Cardozo, his business associate and the company's unsalaried treasurer.
 
Threat of Lawsuit

Mr. Toibb opposed the move, arguing that his stake was being cut while Mr. Brown's was not. Mr. Brown said his $1 million investment entitled him to keep his stake and that Mr. Toibb's stubbornness was ruining the company.
"He was constantly haranguing everybody -- why weren't we doing this or doing that," Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Toibb threatened to sue, arguing that his partners were trying to squeeze him out. Buyout proposals also went back and forth.
One outside consultant said he viewed Mr. Toibb as talented but inflexible. "Both Miller and Brown became increasingly disillusioned with Sheldon because he won't compromise," said the consultant, Kenneth McIntyre, a retired engineer who, while working for the Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation of Boston, consulted with Independence Electric.
By 1986, Mr. Toibb's consulting fee had been terminated and Independence Electric was sinking into debt. As oil became cheaper, the prospects for starting up other energy systems faded.
Now, with his business dream apparently over, Mr. Toibb's journey to the Supreme Court soon began. Having long used credit cards to pay for lawyers and living expenses, he returned to St. Louis in September 1986 and filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. He listed debts of more than $181,000 and assets of $1,370, with his Independence Electric stock given no value.
 
 Effort to Get the Stock

Mr. Toibb's partners moved to get the stock, saying they wanted to prevent his creditors from getting it.
In Bankruptcy Court, Independence Electric offered $5,000 and, then, $25,000, a bid accepted in July 1987 by the trustee of Mr. Toibb's case. Then a month later, Independence Electric's hopes flickered back to life. Federal regulators issued it a dam license, which Mr. Toibb believed could be worth more than $20 million in construction costs.
He said his only option to void the trustee's decision was to convert his bankruptcy into a Chapter 11 case, which he did in October 1987. Two months later, the company got three more licenses.
Mr. Brown next offered $50,000 in Bankruptcy Court for Mr. Toibb's holdings, but the bid was not reviewed. In August 1988, Barry S. Schermer, a Federal bankruptcy judge in St. Louis, ruled that Mr. Toibb, as an individual, was ineligible for Chapter 11, thus starting a series of appeals. Mr. Toibb was represented on a pro-bono basis before the Supreme Court in the case, Toibb v. Radloff, No. 90-368, by Timothy B. Dyk and Peter M. Lieb, of the firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue.
The relevance of Mr. Toibb's victory is questionable because the company's dam projects have not gotten off the ground nor have the licenses been sold. If construction on the company's three remaining licenses does not start this year, it may lose the permits. Then, only debts will remain; Stone & Webster, the company's largest creditor, has already written off the $249,000 owed to it.
Mr. Miller resigned in 1989 from Independence Electric, which is still searching for new financing, and offered to turn in his stock.
"There was no money left and no visible form of raising money," he said.
 
 Outlook Is Uncertain

Mr. Toibb's outlook is uncertain. He has failed to interest lawyers in pressing a claim against his partners, and should he fail to demonstrate significant assets when his Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeds, it may well revert back to Chapter 7 where it began.
Meanwhile, he seeks solace pouring through company documents, and he remains convinced that Independence Electric should have made him a multimillionaire. For five years, Mr. Toibb has also been working on a novel, which he describes as a tome about the lack of morality in American business.
"If I could get someone interested in my book," he said, "I'll feel like I've really accomplished something. I'll feel like what happened to me never happened at all."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell 0.2% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Retail sales were surprisingly weak in June, falling two-tenths of a percent and arousing fresh doubts among economists about the durability of the recovery.
The decline was broad-based, with automotive products posting the only gains, according to the Commerce Department's monthly report. Without this sector, where the improved sales pace is thought unlikely to be sustained, retail sales tumbled five-tenths of a percent after rising nearly twice that much in May. 
 Economists had been expecting a gain of around five-tenths of a percent.
 
Lack of Propellant Seen

The retail sales data, combined with another Government report today showing a decline in prices paid to American producers in June, indicated that the economy still lacked the means to propel itself solidly out of recession.
The Producer Price Index, published by the Labor Department, showed that finished goods eased three-tenths of a percent in June, with core prices unchanged when the volatile food and energy sectors were excluded. [Page 37.]
Bond prices rose in response to the figures on retail sales and producer prices, but the early bond market gains were somewhat eroded by a plunge in the dollar and rises in commodity prices. [Page 36.]
 
'Flat and Extended Trough'

"The very weak retail sales numbers suggest that the recovery may sputter and that we may be moving along a flat and extended trough," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in New York. He cited a lack of growth in incomes and employment, high levels of debt and what he called tight fiscal and monetary policies.
Another downbeat assessment came from Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "The economy is not undergoing a sustainable recovery," he said. "Falling consumer spending could create a double-dip recession."
On the other hand, Carl J. Palash, senior economist at the New York consulting firm of McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, called the June sales results "just a temporary setback" that should be weighed against a sharp May increase.
Exceptionally favorable weather in May appears to have accelerated spring purchases, he and others noted, and the June sales level of $151.9 billion remained higher than April's $151 billion. Many of the nation's department stores on Thursday reported generally sluggish sales in June and cited the same weather-related reason.
Sales of durable goods were unchanged in June, with a 1.1 percent gain for automotive dealers offset by declines of 1.6 percent for building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes, and eight-tenths of a percent for furniture and home furnishings.
Among nondurables, which posted a decline of three-tenths of a percent, sales at stores selling apparel and accessories tumbled 1.2 percent while those at eating and drinking establishments fell eight-tenths of a percent. General merchandise stores posted a decline of six-tenths of a percent, while sales were off one-tenth of a percent at both food stores and drug stores.
 
Rise at Service Stations

The only gain among nondurables, six-tenths of a percent, was at gasoline service stations.
The gain in car sales was said to have reflected a reluctance by some consumers to defer purchases any longer, but some analysts also pointed to what might be a statistical inaccuracy. This year the Chrysler Corporation stopped publishing 10-day figures, forcing others to estimate them, said David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities International.
Over all, retail sales last month were 1.1 percent above the June 1990 level, implying about a 4 percent decline in volume. The sales figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences, but not for inflation, which at the consumer level ran at 5 percent over the latest 12 months through May.
Today's report also disclosed a downward revision of May sales so that the advance was eight-tenths of a percent instead of the 1 percent rise that was the Commerce Department's original estimate.
 
Downward Revision for May
 The lackluster spring sales, combined with the low inflation rate -- a skimpy 1.5 percent pace for the first half of 1991 -- indicated to many analysts that an economic rebound could no longer be assumed to be under way. "There's still a legitimate doubt about whether what we're seeing is a definable recovery," said Nomura's Mr. Resler.

Boycott Over Visit Of Mandela Lives On

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 12

 BODY:
It was just over a year ago that a triumphant Nelson Mandela arrived here to a chorus of protests from many of Miami's powerful Cuban-Americans who were angered by the South African nationalist's support of Fidel Castro.
The dispute was played out in public. The City Commission rescinded a proclamation welcoming Mr. Mandela, and Mayor Xavier Suarez and four other mayors from the region openly criticized Mr. Mandela for not denouncing human rights violations in Cuba. 
 Miami's blacks, who make up about 21 percent of the city's 359,000 residents, took that as a snub of royal proportions, an insult added to decades of economic, social and political injury. In response, on July 17, 1990, a small group of the city's black leaders began an economic boycott against the tourism industry, arguably the region's most important business.
Now almost a year old, the boycott continues, and organizers recently declared their intention to turn up the heat a bit by sending out videotaped messages highly critical of Miami to organizations around the country likely to hold conventions or refer people to the area. The videos will urge them to keep their convention and vacation business away.
Giant cruise ships still glide silently through Biscayne Bay and rental cars still seem to take up more than two-thirds of every parking lot, but the boycott has taken its toll. A spokesman for the boycott group, H. T. Smith, a lawyer, estimated that the campaign has cost the area $27 million in convention business. Officials from the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau estimate that of more than $200 million in convention business annually, about 19 conventions or meetings worth about $8 million have been canceled.
Whether the organizers of the boycott or the convention bureau officials are correct, the campaign has clearly hurt Miami, which is already suffering from the national recession, and has kept attention focused on the racial tensions that regularly erupt in violence.
The latest tool to be used by the boycott organizers is a dramatic 16-minute videotape that opens with scenes of Miami police officers swinging clubs at a group of Haitians protesting in front of a Cuban store. Such scenes are interspersed with film from South Africa and with grainy black-and-white shots from the 1960's showing police dogs attacking black protesters.
"The boycott is not just about the Mandela snub," Mr. Smith said. "After it happened we sat around asking 'Are we so disrespected that all our public officials can just snub our hero?' The answer was yes."
City officials so far have refused to apologize, even as they concede that they probably mishandled Mr. Mandela's visit. William O. Cullom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, said that while the boycott has hurt the area's economy, it has also brought attention to the needs of blacks, which businesses are beginning to address through special jobs programs.
"It's time for them to declare some kind of partial victory and come to the table and negotiate," Mr. Cullom said.
Mr. Smith said that the boycott has been more successful than he and other organizers had imagined and that he was unwilling to ease up until the demands for an apology and significant economic opportunity, among several political requirements, are met.
Many people doubt the effectiveness of the strategy because invariably boycotts hurt those it intended to help. Tourism and boycott officials disagree on how many blacks work in the hotels and convention businesses. But blacks, who make up 12 to 25 percent of the 274,000 tourism employees, are a sizable group, even if most work in lower level positions. It is estimated that for each $1 million in lost business, up to 34 jobs are lost.
Still, the ability of blacks to sustain a nonviolent protest for a year is seen as a positive sign.
"The tactic of using an economic boycott is a big step forward compared to throwing rocks," said Msgr. Bryan Walsh, director of Catholic Community Services of the Archdiocese of Miami. Monsignor Walsh, who has worked in Miami for 36 years, said he did not support or oppose the boycott, but he said he believed the motivation behind it was valid and its effect among blacks would be longstanding.
"They do have, for the first time, their fingers on the levers of power," he said "and they're not going to give it up very easily."

HEADLINE: ENVOY'S TESTIMONY ON IRAQ IS ASSAILED

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Leading Senators today accused the former United States Ambassador to Iraq of misleading Congress in March when she testified about a crucial meeting with President Saddam Hussein eight days before his forces invaded Kuwait.
The Senators' remarks came after they reviewed several secret cables, particularly one from the Ambassador, April C. Glaspie, summarizing the meeting. The cables were provided by the State Department to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week. [Excerpts, page 4.] 
 The legislators say that in contrast to the tough approach she described at Capitol hearings, the cables show her taking a more conciliatory tone with Mr. Hussein.
 
Pell Sees 'Inconsistencies'
 In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanded an explanation of what he called "inconsistencies" between Ms. Glaspie's testimony and the cabled summary, which she sent to the State Department on July 25, 1990, the same day as her meeting with the Iraqi President.
 Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, charged in a statement that "April Glaspie deliberately misled the Congress about her role in the Persian Gulf tragedy."
Ms. Glapsie's interpretation of the two-hour meeting, as well as the secret reply to Mr. Hussein by President Bush that followed three days later, provide windows into the Administration's conciliatory policy toward Mr. Hussein in the days before the Aug. 2 invasion, despite the buildup of Iraqi troops on the Kuwaiti border.
The information in the cables, first disclosed today in The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times, is expected to figure in continuing investigations by the intelligence committees of both houses of Congress into whether there was a failure of American intelligence from the months before the invasion through the Persian Gulf war.
Contrary to her testimony that Mr. Hussein had told her he would settle his dispute with Kuwait peacefully, Mr. Hussein made a number of veiled threats during the meeting that he might have to resort to force. But Ms. Glaspie came away convinced that he did not intend to invade Kuwait.
"His emphasis that he wants peaceful settlement is surely sincere," she wrote in her conclusion. "Iraqis are sick of war."
 
Bush Took a Placating Tone
 Another secret cable sent from President Bush to Mr. Hussein in response to Ms. Glaspie's reports took the same conciliatory approach. "We believe that differences are best resolved by peaceful means and not by threats involving military force or conflict," the President wrote in a message that Ms. Glaspie delivered to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
Mr. Bush added, "My Administration continues to desire better relations with Iraq." The cables were made available to The New York Times today.
In her appearances before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Glaspie portrayed herself as a tough-minded Ambassador who repeatedly warned the Iraqi leader against using force to settle his border dispute with Kuwait, whose protection, she added, was in the vital interests of the United States.
By the end of two days of hearings, a number of initially skeptical Senators and Representatives were praising her as an articulate, forceful career Foreign Service officer who should have been allowed to set the public record straight much earlier.
Indeed, her summary of her conversation in one of the cables stated that she had "made clear that we can never excuse settlement of disputes by other than peaceful means." But the cables do not show her having spoken of Kuwait's "vital" relationship with the United States, and most of her remarks appeared to be aimed at mollifying the Iraqi leader.
Ms. Glaspie concluded that Mr. Hussein was "worried" by joint military exercises the United States was conducting with the United Arab Emirates and would "make a major push to cooperate" with the efforts of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to negotiate between Iraq and Kuwait.
Her recommendation was that the Bush Administration curb rather than intensify its criticism of Iraq. "I believe we would now be well-advised to ease off on public criticism of Iraq until we see how the negotiations develop," she wrote.
In his letter on Thursday to Mr. Baker, Mr. Pell said that "no place does she report clearly delivering the kind of warning she described in her testimony to the committee."
"I would ask the department to look into this situation and would also appreciate an explanation as to why no effort was made to correct the public record," he added.
A senior State Department official said that Deputy Secretary Lawrence S. Eagleburger sent a letter to Mr. Pell late today requesting that he and Ms. Glaspie be allowed to appear before the Foreign Relations Committee at the "earliest possible opportunity" to correct any misunderstandings that may have arisen from her previous testimony.
Mr. Eagleburger said that with Secretary Baker leaving Sunday for a 10-day trip with President Bush to the London economic summit meeting, he would be representing the department as the senior official.
Ms. Glaspie herself could not be reached for public comment on the Senators' remarks. Although she no longer is Ambassador to Iraq, she is still technically assigned to the State Department's Iraq desk and will assume a post as ambassador-in-residence at the University of California at San Diego in the fall.
Asked about State Department involvement in Ms. Glaspie's testimony, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman, said that "a standard testimony preparation" by officials in the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs had been held. "It consisted of going over questions she might be asked," Miss Tutwiler said.
Although Ms. Glaspie told the Foreign Relations Commitee that an Iraqi version of her conversation with Mr. Hussein was "fabrication" and "disinformation," with few exceptions her cables largely parallel the Arabic transcript made available to reporters by the Iraqi Foreign Ministry in September, after the invasion of Kuwait.
One outright contradiction between Ms. Glaspie's testimony and her cables come in her characterization of an inteview that Mr. Hussein gave last year to Diane Sawyer, a correspondent for ABC News. In the Iraqi version, Ms. Glaspie is quoted as telling Mr. Hussein that "what happened in that program was cheap and unjust."
But Ms. Glaspie assured lawmakers that the Iraqis had changed her words. "I said to him I thought the editing of transcripts -- not transcripts, of videotapes -- was cheap and unjust, such as had occurred in the case of Diane Sawyer's interview," she told the Senate committee on March 20. A day later, she praised Ms. Sawyer and acknowledged that her embassy had helped the reporter obtain the interview. "She did American journalism proud," Ms. Glaspie said of Ms. Sawyer.
Nonetheless, in her primary cable to Washington, Ms. Glaspie asserts that she said she "had seen the Diane Sawyer show and thought it was cheap and unfair."
The Senate Foreign Relations Commitee is expected to raise the issue of American policy toward Iraq in general, and Ms. Glaspie's testimony in particular, during the still-unscheduled confirmation hearings of Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, as Ambassador to Germany.
Mr. Kimmitt, who has been instrumental in crafting the department's policy toward Iraq, did not consult with Ms. Glaspie before her testimony to Congress but reviewed a draft of a brief opening statement that she subsequently did not deliver, a senior Administration official said.
The official added that Mr. Kimmitt and Mr. Baker had told Ms. Glaspie after her Congressional testimony that she had done well under difficult circumstances.

HEADLINE: 7 Powers In Search Of Policy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 12

 BODY:
When the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations meet next week in London, they will tug in sharply different directions over how much aid to give the Soviet Union. These differences could make the London economic summit conference one of the liveliest in years.
Group of Seven officials say the aid most likely to be approved will be technical assistance to move to a market economy as well as granting Moscow associate membership in the International Monetary Fund. 
 But the issue of whether to give much more substantial aid is by no means decided. The scene is set for the seven to debate whether to grant the Soviet Union help on a large scale to assist its troubled transition from Communism toward a market economy. Each country's enthusiasm for financial aid to Moscow seems related to its proximity to the Soviet Union and its likelihood of being affected by emigration flows.
 
Kohl Is the Biggest Booster
 The biggest champion of an ambitious aid package is the German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, who argues that immediate assistance is needed to buttress Mr. Gorbachev and Soviet reforms. Many German officials fear that the aid that Mr. Gorbachev is likely to take home from London will be so modest that it can be construed as a slap in the face.
Italy and France basically support Bonn's position of giving more help now, but they want a few more strings attached.
On the other side are officials from the United States, Britain, Canada and Japan, who argue that granting large-scale aid will be a waste because the Soviet economy is in such a shambles that the money cannot yet be put to good use.
"Pouring water into a bottomless barrel is useless," Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, said.
 
National Interests
 Each country has its own specific reasons for its position.
Chancellor Kohl has developed a close friendship with Mr. Gorbachev, and, foreign policy analysts say, he still feels somewhat indebted to the Soviet President for having given the green light for German reunification. What is more, Germany is likely to be hit first and perhaps hardest by any flood of refugees that might result from a Soviet economic collapse.
"It would be foolish for the Western countries to sit back and calmly watch what happens in the Soviet Union, and it would be most foolish for anyone to speculate about a collapse there," said Chancellor Kohl, after meeting with Mr. Gorbachev a week ago in Kiev. "I believe we must help the reforms, not the Germans alone, but all the Western countries. The Soviet Union must provide the essential preconditions, but then we cannot sit on the sidelines."
Some Germans officials say the conditions for reform are already in place. "There is no point for Mr. Gorbachev just turning up for the group photo," said Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's Economics Minister.
 
Getting Down to Business
 The Germans and the Italians have been far more active than other Group of Seven countries in pursuing commercial opportunities in the Soviet Union. German and Italian companies may thus stand to gain more if the Soviet economy receives official help -- and turns around. Conversely, a Soviet economic collapse would likely hurt Germany and Italy more than the other Group of Seven nations.
In Germany there are also fears that if Washington blocks large-scale joint Western aid for philosophical reasons or because of its own deficit problems, the Germans will be called on to pitch in a disproportionate amount.
The Bush Administration is demanding far more reforms from the Soviet Union before it would begin seriously considering large-scale aid. Indeed, some Administration officials, deeply skepticism about Soviet ways, contend that aid might retard the reform process by helping the country hang on to an archaic economic dilapidated system.
"I'd love to see this reform move far enough forward and be for real enough that we could then all pitch in and be of as much assistance as possible in terms of the economic recovery," President Bush said.
 
Japan Wants Islands Back
 As has been the case for months, Japan remains adamantly opposed to granting large-scale aid until Moscow agrees to give back four northern islands that Soviet forces captured toward the end of World War II. Mr. Kaifu, like Amerian officials, says he wants more reforms on the table before putting more money on the table.
The Japanese Prime Minister said an important aspect of reform would be to point the Soviet economy toward civilian production and away from the military. This dovetails with Japan's concerns about Soviet troop levels in northern Asia.
The Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni de Michelis, says aid should be forthcoming, but only on the condition that there first be a new union treaty between the Kremlin and the nine republics that want to remain in the Soviet Union. "Without such a treaty, nothing would be possible because we wouldn't have an interlocutor," he said, perhaps mindful of the fractiousness and disarray in Italy's neighbor, Yugoslavia.
Many French officials say that giving substantial aid to the Soviets now would largely be a waste. But President Francois Mitterrand is loath to give a cold shoulder to two leaders with whom he has sought to develop special relationships: Mr. Kohl and Mr. Gorbachev.

HEADLINE: Despite Praising Farrakhan in 1983, Thomas Denies Anti-Semitism

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Clarence Thomas, expressed admiration for the Rev. Louis Farrakhan in speeches eight years ago. But Judge Thomas said today that he never shared any of the clergyman's anti-Semitic views.
The content of the speeches was disclosed today by The Dallas Times Herald. After leaders of Jewish organizations and civil rights advocates expressed concern about Mr. Thomas's remarks, he issued a statement saying he was not an anti-Semite. 
 Mr. Farrakhan, the Black Muslim leader, became notorious in 1984 when he spoke of Judaism as "a dirty religion" and described Hitler as "wickedly great." Leaders of Jewish organizations said Mr. Farrahkan had been making anti-Semitic statements at least since 1972.
In two speeches prepared for his use in 1983, Mr. Thomas, then chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, described Mr. Farrakhan as "a man I have admired for more than a decade." The speeches were for a meeting of the Capital Press Club here on Sept. 19, 1983, and for a meeting of the national Association of Black M.B.A.'s in Atlanta on Oct. 6, 1983.
Mr. Thomas quoted Mr. Farrakhan on the need for self-help among blacks, without mentioning any of the minister's views of Judaism.
 
Texts From E.E.O.C.
 Copies of the speeches were made available by the commission. James C. Lafferty, a spokesman for the commission, said he had no way to determine whether the speeches were delivered as written by Judge Thomas, who now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
In his statement today, Judge Thomas said: "I cannot leave standing any suggestion that I am anti-Semitic. I am, and have always been, unalterably and adamantly opposed to anti-Semitism and bigotry of any kind, including by Louis Farrakhan."
Judge Thomas added: "I repudiate the anti-Semitism of Louis Farrakhan or anyone else. While I support the concept of economic self-help, I have never supported or tolerated bigotry of any kind."
 
For Some, Statement Falls Short
 Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said Judge Thomas's repudiation of anti-Semitism "was welcome, but unfortunately did not go far enough."
"It is not possible to separate Farrakhan's message from Farrakhan the messenger," Mr. Foxman said. "We hope that Judge Thomas, who has always eschewed bigotry, will publicly acknowledge the danger in attempting to distinguish elements of a bigot's program which might be considered positive from an overt message of vicious racism and anti-Semitism."
Mr. Foxman continued: "As far back as 1972, Farrakhan made public statements reflecting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish control of newspapers, radio and television. In the 1970's, he frequently published anti-Semitic articles suggesting that Jews, Israel and Zionism were trying to control the world. Starting in 1984, his anti-Semitic statements became much more frequent and more blatant."
Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish Congress, said Judge Thomas's statement repudiating anti-Semitism failed to dispose of the matter. Before confirming his nomination, the Senate needs to find out why Mr. Thomas expressed admiration for Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Siegman said, and whether he knew of the minister's anti-Semitism.
 
Exhortation From Farrakhan
 Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization in Los Angeles, said, "We accept Judge Thomas at his word, that he has never been anti-Semitic and repudiates Louis Farrakhan."
The two speeches, according copies of the texts, included general discussions of the commission and personal observations by Judge Thomas, who said he had lived through "the most brutal experience of discrimination" as a young black in Georgia in the 1950's.
He concluded the speeches by quoting this exhortation from Mr. Farrakhan: "We the poor, we the oppressed, we the blacks, we the Hispanics, we the disinherited, we the rejected and most despised, we will overcome and then together we will be able to say in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King: Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we have united and made freedom a reality at last."

HEADLINE: Black 'Conservatives' United Only by Frustration

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 12

 BODY:
President Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court has focused attention on a small group of critics of the traditional civil rights agenda who are identified as black conservatives.
But rather than a cohesive movement, those who, like Judge Thomas, are called black conservatives are a diverse group. Some are conservative, some not. They are defined by the one thing they all have in common -- a frustration with the idea that black people have one agenda defined by civil rights leaders. 
 Just as black people do not speak with one voice, those who part company with the traditional black leadership of groups like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference do not want to be stereotyped either, they say.
"There's an expectation you're going to hear something from blacks, and when you don't hear it, you get defined as a conservative," said Glenn Loury, an economist at Harvard University. Professor Loury is black and embraces the conservative label, but at the same time he says the grouping of black conservatives is often misleading.
Thus, for example, the writer Shelby Steele, who was hailed by admirers and blasted by critics last year as an outspoken voice of black conservatism, grimaces when asked if he considers himself a conservative.
"Oh, no," said Mr. Steele, an English professor at San Jose State University in California who is a critic of affirmative action and much of the civil rights agenda. Nonetheless, he is a supporter of many social programs for the poor and has voted for Jesse Jackson in California's Democratic primaries. "It's the bane of my life. If you don't identify with the civil rights orthodoxy, by definition, you're a conservative, even though we're pretty much across the board."
Many of those identified as black conservatives credit the civil rights movement for overcoming legal segregation. But most say it has since made black people overly dependent on government programs; that it has developed strategies that help the black middle class more than the black poor, and that it has blamed too many problems of black people on racism instead of stressing individual responsibility in areas like teen-age pregnancy. The dissenters' biggest influence may be in broadening the debate on civil rights rather than in winning over vast numbers of blacks to their cause.
By any estimation, blacks who embrace the conservative label are a sliver of the black population with minimal political power. More than a decade after black conservatives first gained attention as an unexpected Republican group, there is one black Republican in Congress, Representative Gary Franks of Connecticut. Only 3 of 436 black state legislators are Republicans.
 
Gravitating Toward Power?

To many liberal blacks and civil rights figures, the lack of support for conservative candidates reflects the degree to which blacks accurately see conservatives as traditional enemies of civil rights, and the degree to which black conservatives are sometimes viewed as little more than turncoats, gravitating toward white power and money in a conservative era.
"These guys run the gamut from political opportunists to out-and-out hustlers," said Derrick Bell, a liberal black professor at the Harvard University Law School.
But polls consistently show that on numerous social issues like crime, abortion and prayer in schools, blacks hold largely conservative views. Many of those who dissent from the civil rights agenda say the nomination of Judge Thomas is helping to show that the black population is not monolithic.
"If nothing else, the nomination of Clarence Thomas will break the stereotype that if you're black and you're smart and you're prominent, you must be a liberal Democrat," said Stephen Carter, a law professor at Yale University whose criticisms of affirmative action have led him to be identified as a black conservative, a label he shuns. "Mind you, I have nothing against liberal Democrats. I have something against stereotypes."
 
From Many Strands

There are numerous strands tied together under the broad grouping of black conservatives, including the self-help doctrine of Booker T. Washington, the economic nationalism of Malcolm X, the deeply religious traditions of many blacks, and criticisms of affirmative action and other programs that purportedly favor minorities.
Many of the black scholars who first gained attention in the early days of the Reagan Administration for their conservative views, like the economists Walter Williams of George Mason University, Thomas Sowell of Stanford and to a lesser degree Professor Loury of Harvard, fit in comfortably with the conservatism of the Reagan era. They generally believe in free-market approaches rather than government programs; oppose preferential programs for minorities, and say that antipoverty programs have done more to harm blacks than to help them.
But others come from different directions. Robert Woodson, a low-income housing specialist whose National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington has pioneered many of the strategies favored by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, preaches a blend of populism aimed at poor people taking control of the institutions that control their lives.
Mr. Steele and Mr. Carter of Yale, whose "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby" will be published this fall by Basic Books, are critics of preferential programs they say subtly demean even those who benefit from them. But like Mr. Steele, Mr. Carter, a former clerk for retiring Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, does not consider himself a conservative.
 
At Odds With Orthodoxy
 Similarly, when Elizabeth Wright of Manhattan began publishing a quarterly newsletter called "Issues and Views" in 1985, she did not think of herself as a conservative but rather as someone at odds with the civil rights orthodoxy, which included policies like busing with which she disagreed.
Her main theme, echoing the views of Malcolm X, is that blacks made a tragic wrong turn in the 1960's, toward integration and away from economic strategies intended to build up their own communities.
"The civil rights crew diverted us, because it was the easier way out for their clique," she said. "It's easier to beat on the door of the white man to let you into I.B.M. than to go into business with your brother or cousin and open up a little grocery store or hat shop that builds up the black community. That's a long, arduous task, and it doesn't give the prestige so many middle-class blacks crave."
In many ways, Judge Thomas fits the common description of black conservatives, combining conservative instincts on social issues and a philosphical orientation toward individual cases rather than group rights. But his prominence arose more from his position as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission than from any contributions he made to conservative thought.
But Judge Thomas, who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, also represents some of the complexities of those grouped as black conservatives, as evidenced in his fondness for quoting Malcolm X and occasionally chastising white conservatives for their views on race.
Similarly, a report in the Dallas Times Herald that Judge Thomas in 1983 twice inserted laudatory references to Louis H. Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam, in the text of his speeches reflects the degree to which the views of black conservatives and black nationalists sometimes overlap.
"Black conservatives are the real nationalists," said Ms. Wright.
Some blacks with conservative views shun the label, not because it does not fit, but because it raises the hackles of many blacks who automatically think of conservatives as enemies of civil rights.
Thus, when Emanuel McLittle of Lansing, Mich., last year started New Destiny magazine, since renamed Destiny magazine, full of conservative opinion and criticism of the civil rights agenda, he adopted the slogan "The Other Side of the Issues" rather than using the word "conservative."
"The word 'conservative' is like a detonator," said Mr. McLittle, a 42-year-old psychologist. "It's something black people automatically respond against."
Mr. McLittle, whose fledgling publication is available only in Los Angeles, Detroit and a few smaller cities, reflects some of the degree to which those labeled black conservatives are willing to tackle subjects once considered taboo. For example, he contends that the rage of black Americans is less a function of the ravages of racism and more a result of their own upbringing and psychological development.
Even the most committed black conservatives, like Mr. Woodson and Mr. Williams, make few claims for the political potential of black conservatives. Mr. Carter ironically quotes Judge Thomas in citing a core problem conservatives face in wooing blacks.
"In one of his Heritage Foundation lectures, he said that the conservative movement will not gain the adherence of larger numbers of black Americans until conservatives become as comfortable standing with black people when they are right as standing against black people when they are wrong," Mr. Carter said.
 
Changing the Debate

On the other hand, conservatives and other critics of traditional civil rights thinking said black conservatives have already had an enormous effect by changing the terms of the debate.
"There are several ways you can influence power," said Mr. Woodson. "One is electoral politics, but ideas have power too."
Mr. Williams said that open discussion of illegitimate births and black-on-black crime, discussion once dismissed as racist, is now fair game, and that broad questions are being raised about the success of government programs for the poor largely because of the critiques of conservative blacks.
"My colleague and friend Tom Sowell says that after we're dead and gone in 2030 or 2040, black people may be the most conservative people on the face of this country because they will have suffered the most from the liberal ideas," said Mr. Williams.
But 40 or 50 years is a long time to wait for vindication. For the short term, blacks outside the civil rights mainstream may have to be content with the role of producing a broader debate among black people.
"People want to see blacks as retrievers: see a bird fall and automatically go get it," said Stanley Crouch, whose essays in his book "Notes of a Hanging Judge" (Oxford University Press) are often harshly critical of the civil rights establishment, but who shuns the conservative label.
He recalled the movie "Breaking Away," in which a white bicycling enthusiast from Indiana becomes obsessed with Italian culture.
"No one said this is an example of a self-hating Midwestern white guy," Mr. Crouch said. "But if that guy's black, people would say, "He's crazy; he hates himself so much, he thinks he's Italian.' The varieties of human choice and thought are not very willingly accepted when the subject is Afro-Americans."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Is Preparing to Seize Mutual Benefit, a Large Insurer

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Seeking to prevent the largest life-insurance failure to date, New Jersey officials said yesterday that they were preparing to seize control of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company of Newark. Mutual Benefit, the nation's 18th-largest life insurer, with $13.5 billion in assets, has been reporting deepening financial woes as a result of its heavy investment in troubled real estate.
Senior New Jersey officials said they expected the company to make a formal request for state intervention early next week. But the officials added that the financial troubles of Mutual Benefit, which traces its roots to 1845 and has 400,000 policyholders around the country, had become so dire in recent days that state action was likely with or without a company request. 
 "Things are not improving," a senior official in the administration of Gov. Jim Florio said in an interview yesterday. "Now it has become a matter of protecting the policyholders."
For consumers, a decision by Mutual Benefit to seek temporary refuge would be both good and bad news. It is good in the sense that Mutual Benefit will be stabilized, and the company should then be able to forge ahead with a plan to work through its real estate problems. In the interim, however, policyholders will be seriously inconvenienced.
For example, in addition to a moratorium on the cashing in of individual life insurance policies, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, Samuel F. Fortunato, is expected to issue an order blocking corporate customers from withdrawing any money they invested with Mutual Benefit. And while life insurance death benefits are likely to be paid in full, retirees with annuities could receive smaller monthly checks for a while.
 
Meeting Set for Monday

At Mutual Benefit's headquarters, a spokeswoman said she would have no comment. But a top company executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mutual Benefit's directors would meet early Monday to vote on a resolution that would voluntarily place the insurer in the custodianship of Mr. Fortunato. Mr. Fortunato, in turn, is expected to issue an immediate order blocking life insurance policyholders from cashing in their policies or borrowing against them.
The goal, the Mutual Benefit executive said, is to stanch the flow of cash out of the insurer that has been weakening the company day by day as news of its problems has spread.
When The Record, a newspaper in Hackensack, N.J., published an article yesterday laying out the state's plans, it generated a torrent of calls to Mutual Benefit's headquarters from nervous policyholders demanding their money back. Some Mutual Benefit policyholders even lined up in the company's Newark lobby demanding refunds.
"The preferred thing to do is to nip this in the bud because otherwise certain policyholders will be preferred over others," the Mutual Benefit executive said, referring to how money has been flowing out of Mutual Benefit. "The core businesses of Mutual Benefit are in good shape."
Also of concern to the public is the risk of loss of policyholder money. To date, losses on Mutual Benefit's $5 billion portfolio of real estate loans have whittled its capital -- its cushion against losses -- to less than $500 million. If the value of the company's properties decline an additional 10 percent, the capital would be eliminated. Any future losses would then leave a shortfall that would have to be made up to keep policyholders whole. Unlike most other states, New Jersey has no industry-sponsored guarantee fund that could protect policyholders.
 
 Seeking Wealthy Investor

But Mutual Benefit executives say that bridge may not even have to be crossed. Not only have they been repossessing troubled properties and aggressively trying to find tenants for them, they have also been actively looking for a wealthy partner who would infuse fresh capital into Mutual Benefit. Given that the company's core businesses -- group life insurance and so-called corporate-owned life insurance -- is solidly profitable, the executives hope the money can be raised.
"The real estate problem is not going to take this company over the edge," said Stephen J. Carlotti, Mutual Benefit's chief operating officer, in an interview earlier this week. "This is a situation that can be managed."
But even if Mutual Benefit can be stabilized and rehabilitated, the decision to seek state protection will only deepen the worries of consumers. They were already made anxious after the collapse earlier this year of two large life insurers, the Executive Life Insurance Company and the First Capital Life Insurance Company, both of Los Angeles.
And the announcements by other insurers of sharply lower profits resulting from losses from various categories of investments have only added to the concerns. The lower profits have been reported by big companies like the Travelers Corporation, the Aetna Life and Casualty Company and the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States.
"There is a fear out there about the security of insurance policies, of pensions and of annuities," said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, who has held hearings on insurer solvency. "Every time you have a situation like this, in which certain workers might not get their annuities or beneficiaries might not be able to get their death benefits, it strikes fear in the hearts of people."
Unlike Executive Life and First Capital, whose large holdings of high-risk "junk bonds" led to their collapse in the spring, Mutual Benefit holds relatively few junk bonds. Rather, Mutual Benefit's problems relate almost entirely to commercial real estate -- in particular to the roughly $5 billion it lent in the 1980's to developers of office buildings, shopping centers, hotels and apartment complexes. While a few of these properties are in the recession-plagued Northeast, Mutual Benefit issued the bulk of its mortgage loans to developers in the Southwest, the Midwest, and the Middle Atlantic States.
 
 Sought Geographical Diversity

Mutual Benefit's hope was that such geographic diversification would shield the company from large losses, and there is little doubt that Mutual Benefit would be in even worse financial shape if all of its mortgages were on properties in, say, the New York area. But because Mutual Benefit had one of the industry's highest percentages of real estate loans -- about 35 percent of assets, compared with 25 percent for its peers -- the company was hit hard when commercial property values slid nationwide. As of Dec. 31, $407 million, or just under 10 percent of its loans in dollar terms, had been foreclosed upon or were in the process of being foreclosed. By March 31, an additional $100 million in loans was placed in the foreclosure category.
For months, Mutual Benefit executives led by Mr. Carlotti, the chief operating officer, and by Donald F. Haller, the chief financial officer, insisted that Mutual Benefit was doing the intelligent thing by aggressively bringing foreclosure proceedings beginning early last year against delinquent developers.

HEADLINE: Westinghouse Net Off 49.6%; Further Weakness Is Seen

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, July 12

 BODY:
The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said today that its earnings tumbled 49.6 percent in the latest quarter and that they would stay weak throughout the year, as its recession-hit businesses lagged the nation's economic recovery.
The second-quarter net income of $127 million, a drop from $252 million a year ago, was not unexpected, the company's chairman, Paul Lego, said. 
 But Westinghouse's warning that earnings for the second half of 1991 would be down 25 percent or more from a year ago sent its share price down $1 today, to $25.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
On a per-share basis, Westinghouse earnings dropped to 41 cents, from 86 cents a year ago. Revenues were $3.174 billion, a notch below the $3.175 billion of a year earlier.
Mr. Lego expressed disappointment about the company's performance.
"Our expectations of an early and strong economic recovery have not materialized," he said in a statement. "That, coupled with the fact that many of our businesses customarily lag the economy, will adversely impact our second half."
Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, is involved in a wide variety of businesses, including nuclear power equipment, electronic systems and air traffic control systems.
It owns a number of television and radio stations in its broadcast unit. It also owns a financial services unit, the Westinghouse Credit Corporation, whose earnings dropped 47.3 percent in the second quarter, to $19.5 million from $37 million in 1990.
Operating profits at the financial services unit were off sharply because of underperforming assets and fewer equity profits, the company said. Nor were analysts more upbeat about the unit's future.
"We still have some fairly serious concerns about the financial subsidiary," said Kent Newcomb of A. G. Edwards. Of Westinghouse's per-share earnings in 1991, he added, "They're implying that they're not going to do much better than $2.15, which is well below most estimates."

HEADLINE: U.S. Messages on July 1990 Meeting of Hussein and American Ambassador

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Critics of United States policy toward Iraq in the period before the invasion of Kuwait last August have accused the Bush Administration of failing to give Baghdad adequate warning of the consequences of military action against Kuwait.
At the center of the dispute is a July 25, 1990, meeting between April C. Glaspie, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, and President Saddam Hussein. In September, Iraq released what it described as a transcript of the meeting, but the Administration said the Iraqi document was incomplete and misleading, and in March Ms. Glaspie said it was largely fabricated. 
 Here are excerpts from a July 25 cablegram from Ms. Glaspie to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, describing her meeting earlier that day with President Hussein, and from a July 28 cablegram from Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to Ms. Glaspie. The cablegrams were obtained by The New York Times today.
 
GLASPIE MESSAGE
 
SUMMARY
Saddam told the Ambassador July 25 that Mubarak [President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt] has arranged for Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations to meet in Riyadh, and then on July 28, 29 or 30, the Kuwaiti Crown Prince will come to Baghdad for serious negotiations. "Nothing will happen" before then, Saddam had promised Mubarak.
Saddam wished to convey an important message to President Bush: Iraq wants friendship, but does the U.S.G. [United States Government]? Iraq suffered 100,000's of casualties and is now so poor that war orphan pensions will soon be cut, yet rich Kuwait will not even accept OPEC discipline. Iraq is sick of war, but Kuwait has ignored diplomacy. U.S. maneuvers with the U.A.E. [United Arab Emirates] will encourage the U.A.E. and Kuwait to ignore conventional diplomacy. If Iraq is publicly humiliated by the U.S.G., it will have no choice but to "respond," however illogical and self-destructive that would prove.
 
EXCERPTS
Ambassador was summoned by President Saddam Hussein at noon July 25. Also present were Fonmin Aziz, the President's office director, two note takers and the Iraqi interpreter.
Saddam, whose manner was cordial, reasonable and even warm throughout the ensuing two hours, said he wished the Ambassador to convey a message to President Bush.
. . .
Picking his words with care, Saddam said that there are "some circles" in the U.S.G., including in C.I.A. and the State Department, but emphatically excluding the President and Secretary Baker, who are not friendly toward Iraq-U.S. relations. He then listed what he seemed to regard as facts to support this conclusion: "Some circles are gathering information on who might be Saddam Hussein's successor"; they kept up contacts in the gulf warning against Iraq; they worked to insure no help would go to Iraq (read Exim and C.C.C. [Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corporation]).
Iraq, the President stressed, is in serious financial difficulties, with $40 billion debts. Iraq, whose victory in the war against Iran made an historic difference to the Arab world and the West, needs a Marshall plan. But "you want the oil price down," Saddam charged.
Resuming his list of grievances which he believed were all inspired by "some circles" in the U.S.G., he recalled the "U.S.I.A. campaign" against himself, and the general media assault on Iraq and its President.
Despite all these blows, Saddam said, and although "we were somewhat annoyed," we still hoped that we could develop a good relationship. But those who force oil prices down are engaging in economic warfare and Iraq cannot accept such a trespass on its dignity and prosperity.
The spearheads (for the U.S.G.) have been Kuwait and the U.A.E., Saddam said. Saddam said carefully that just as Iraq will not threaten others, it will accept no threat against itself.
. . .
Saddam said he fully believes the U.S.G. wants peace, and that is good. But do not, he asked, use methods which you say you do not like, methods like arm-twisting.
Iraq will have to respond if the U.S. uses these methods. Iraq knows the U.S.G. can send planes and rockets and hurt Iraq deeply. Saddam asks that the U.S.G. not force Iraq to the point of humiliation at which logic must be disregarded.
. . .
The Ambassador thanked Saddam for the opportunity to discuss directly with him some of his and our concerns. President Bush, too, wants friendship, as he had written at the Eid and on the occasion of Iraq's national day. Saddam interrupted to say he had been touched by those messages.
. . .
Ambassador said there were many issues he had raised she would like to comment on, but she wished to use her limited time with the President to stress first President Bush's desire for friendship and, second, his strong desire, shared we assume by Iraq, for peace and stability in the Mideast. Is it not reasonable for us to be concerned when the President and Foreign Minister both say publicly that Kuwaiti actions are the equivalent of military aggression, and then we learn that many units of the Republican Guard have been sent to the border? Is it not reasonable for us to ask, in the spirit of friendship, not confrontation, the simple question: What are your intentions?
Saddam said that was indeed a reasonable question. He acknowledged that we should be concerned for regional peace, in fact it is our duty as a superpower. "But how can we make them (Kuwait and U.A.E.) understand how deeply we are suffering." The financial situation is such that the pensions for widows and orphans will have to be cut. At this point, the interpreter and one of the note takers broke down and wept.
After a pause for recuperation, Saddam said, in effect, believe me, I have tried everything. We sent envoys, wrote messages, asked Fahd [King Fahd of Saudi Arabia] to arrange Quadripartite Summit (Iraq, S.A.G.[Saudi Arabian Government], U.A.E., Kuwait). Fahd suggested oil ministers instead, and we agreed to the Jidda agreement although it was well below our hopes. Then, Saddam continued, two days later the Kuwaiti Oil Minister announced he would want to annul that agreement within two months. . . .
At this point, Saddam left the room to take an urgent call from Mubarak. After his return, the Ambassador asked if he could tell her if there has any progress in finding a peaceful way to defuse the dispute. . . . Saddam said that he had just learned from Mubarak the Kuwaitis have agreed to negotiate. The Kuwaiti Crown Prince/Prime Minister would meet in Riyadh with Saddam's No. 2, Izzat Ibrahim, and then the Kuwaiti would come to Baghdad on Saturday, Sunday or, at the latest, Monday, July 30.
"I told Mubarak," Saddam said, that "nothing will happen until the meeting." And nothing will happen during or after the meeting if the Kuwaitis will at last "give us some hope."
The Ambassador said she was delighted to hear this good news.
 
EAGLEBURGER MESSAGE
Please deliver the following as an oral response from President Bush to Saddam Hussein's message.
I was pleased to learn of the agreement between Iraq and Kuwait to begin negotiations in Jidda to find a peaceful solution to the current tensions between you. The United States and Iraq both have a strong interest in preserving the peace and stability of the Middle East. For this reason we believe that differences are best resolved by peaceful means and not by threats involving military force or conflict.
. . .
As you know, we will have fundamental concerns about certain Iraqi policies and activities. And we will continue to raise these concerns with you, in a spirit of friendship and candor, as we have in the past. . . .

Superconductors Made In Bulk Quantities

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A former researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, a Federal laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., has patented a new method for making high-temperature superconductors in bulk quantities. The new method is intended to overcome practical problems associated with superconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity with almost no resistance.
New classes of ceramic-like materials discovered several years ago become superconducting at temperatures around 190 degrees below zero centigrade, warmer than previous types of superconducting metals. Researchers are trying to raise temperatures even further to make them economically practical. 
 The new patent covers a method of making a particular class of superconductors known as 1-2-4 materials, which are less brittle than others but are difficult to produce in sufficient purity without making them in extremely thin sheets. The new patent allows these materials to be made in bulk form.
The inventor is also seeking patents that would apply the same method to other kinds of semiconductors.
Previously, superconductors were made by combining yttrium, copper and barium with oxygen in an extremely hot furnace. Unless the materials were produced in extremely thin sheets, however, some of them formed oxides with no superconducting ability.
The key to the new method is using oxygen pumped in through the furnace at extremely high pressure, which apparently forces the components to form an oxide containing all three elements.
Donald Morris, a visiting scientist at Lawrence Berkeley, received patent 5,024,992.

HEADLINE: The Year the Shooting Eased Up

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Last year, for the first time, Americans took fewer snapshots than in the year before.
 According to the new edition of the Wolfman Report, an annual survey of the photography industry, photographers took 15.72 billion pictures last year, down from 16.12 billion in 1989. The survey, published yesterday by Popular Photography magazine, also said new camera sales dropped to 18.7 million units, from 20 million in 1989. 
Part of the decline in still photography and camera sales may reflect the growing popularity of video cameras. Sales of camcorders rose 29 percent, to almost three million units last year, and more than 7 out of 10 American homes have videocassette recorders capable of playing home videos. But camcorder sales have been surging for five years, and surveys by the Eastman Kodak Company suggest that within 18 months of buying a camcorder, its customers resume taking almost as many still photos as they did previously.
 
Effect of the Recession
 War jitters after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August and the economic recession were probably the real cause of the decline, industry executives and analysts said. They noted that those events sharply reduced vacation travel.
 "Photography is now so big that it can't avoid being affected by the general economy," said Harold Martin, who has edited the Wolfman Report since its creator, Augustus Wolfman, died in 1974.
 Mr. Martin and many industry analysts expect the general photography market to grow again as the economy improves, although at a modest rate. Sales are still rising for the small 35-millimeter "point and shoot" cameras that focus automatically. Features like built-in zoom lenses, improved flashes and other devices that help amateurs compose better pictures are being added to many cameras.
 But experts say the big question mark is how long before there are any really innovative new products to stimulate sales in the amateur photographers' market.
 Few analysts seem to believe that recenty announced inventions like systems for storing photos on compact disks for display on television will have wide enough appeal to raise sales significantly, at least not for a long time to come.
 "You would have to have a lot of software available to allow people to manipulate and transmit the pictures," said Curt Rohrman, a photography analyst for First Boston. "Just being able to look at them on the television isn't that big a deal."
 But one analyst, Peter Enderlin, said Kodak was working on a new camera and film that might bring sales back to double-digit growth in the middle part of the decade.
 Basing his analysis on Kodak patents and other research, he said he expected the Rochester-based company to market a 35-millimeter camera with a film cartridge that could be dropped into place as simply as a battery slides into a flashlight. The film would also be able to store digital information that would help it adjust to the camera and shooting conditions and make it easier to process.
 Projecting that Kodak would start selling the camera in 1992 or 1993, Mr. Enderlin recently began recommending that investors start buying Kodak stock. He said the new products might raise the popularity of photography with the growing population of elderly citizens, who presumably do not like fumbling with today's film and cameras.
 More convenient photoprocessing is also expected to help. The trend to microlabs -- highly compact, automated film developing centers -- is rapidly expanding the number of retail outlets that can make money by developing film for consumers. The next step may be film equivalent of automated bank tellers, where film is deposited in a machine and later picked up.
 
Photofinishing Costs Unchanged
 Last year, Americans spent $4.57 billion on consumer photofinishing, the same amount as the year before, according to the Wolfman figures. Because of higher prices, the photography equipment business actually grew slightly in value last year, up 2.3 percent, to $21.15 billion. But instant photography, the market segment dominated by the Polaroid Corporation, continued its decline in popularity. The number of new instant cameras sold fell by 20 percent, to 1.4 million, and the number pictures taken fell by 3 million, to 937 million.
 The annual Wolfman industry survey, begun 39 years ago, delves into photography the way Guinness looks at world records. It has the usual microscopic details prized by companies in the business: photo equipment sales at military bases ($126 million); industrial use of X-ray film (86 million sheets); number of rolls of film used by the average skin diver (29.6), and so on.
 For the industry, perhaps the most heartening trend was in the balance-of-trade figures. Imports dropped 1.7 percent, to $5.79 billion, the first decline since 1982, while exports rose 14.9 percent, to $3.62 billion. A number of foreign markets grew robustly. In Germany, for instance, the number of cameras sold rose 15 percent, to 4.1 million, while the number of packs of film sold jumped nearly 16 percent, to 132 million.

Debt-Ridden Resort Closes On St. Croix

 BODY:
Faced with severe losses in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo and the recession, the Carambola Beach Resort, the largest hotel in St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, has closed and gone into receivership.
The closing of the 158-room resort, which opened four years and a half years ago, reduces the number of hotel rooms available in St. Croix to fewer than 1,000. Before the island was devastated by the hurricane in September 1989, there were nearly 1,800 tourist rooms. After the hurricane it took 14 months to repair the upscale, 28-acre resort, which reopened in November 1990. But the 1990-91 tourist season in St. Croix, as in much of the Caribbean, was hurt by the recession and the Persian Gulf war. 
 Carambola was built by the Florida developer George Jacobus's Davis Beach Company on 4,000 acres purchased from the Rockefeller family in the mid-1980's. Its first manager was Rockresorts, which later turned over management to Greenbrier Resort Management. Greenbrier allowed its contract with Davis Beach to run out, forcing the resort to close June 14. Excluded from the receivership was the 18-hole Carambola golf course, which is still operating.

HEADLINE: Fixed-Rate Loans Gain In Popularity

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
AFTER a decade that unleashed adjustable-rate loans, negative amortization loans, low-documentation loans and dozens of exotic new mortgages on the home-buying public, borrowers have returned en masse to conventional, fixed-rate financing, but with a new twist.
Lenders say the most popular loan now is the traditional standard: the fixed- rate 30-year mortgage. But they also report heightened demand for fixed rate loans with shorter terms -- most commonly 15 or 20 years -- and say a growing number of people who already have mortgages are paying more each month so the loans will be retired early. 
 The shift, coming at a time of slow sales and weak prices across most of the country, appears to reflect a broad change in attitudes toward home ownership and mortgage finance. Where the buyers of the 80's tended to focus on how much they might profit when they sold, today's buyers wonder how much equity -- the paid-up investment in their homes -- they will build by staying put.
"We are seeing a much more conservative borrower psyche," said Larry Dale, vice president and chief of marketing for the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of mortgages from thrifts, banks and mortgage brokers. "It fits with demographic trends."
Analysts say one reason for the new conservatism is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. With a population bulge of people now in their 40's, more people are planning their finances around retirement, and want to be sure their mortgages will be retired by the time they are.
But the recession and the real estate slump are affecting the attitudes of all borrowers, regardless of age.
"The 90's appear to be the stay-put decade," said Joseph Hu, chief of mortgage research for Nomura Securities International, a Wall Street subsidiary of Nomura Securities Company, a Japanese brokerage. Family mobility has been reduced by a slowdown in job transfers and new hiring, he said, and the sluggish housing market has cut down the number of people moving up from one house to another, even within the same communities. One longstanding rule of thumb among mortgage lenders has been that Americans stay in their homes for an average of seven years. Although there is no precise measure for the last decade, "whatever the average is for the 90's, it will be longer," Mr. Hu said.
Thus, as they hunker down for a longer stay, more people are structuring their financial plans around payment schedules on mortgage loans, and calculating how long it will take to gain a large equity stake, or even a little one.
"WE think it is essential to build some equity," said Joann Mardesich, a medical office manager in Inglewood, Calif., who, with her husband, a physician, last month purchased a two-bedroom co-op on Manhattan's Upper West Side. They selected a fixed-rate 15-year loan.
Mrs. Mardesich said the co-op will be used initially by their son, Kevin, a student at New York University. But since all three of the couple's children are living in the New York area, she said she and her husband eventually plan to spend several months a year in Manhattan, and have no plans to sell the co-op before the 15-year term of amortization.
After calculating how slowly they would build equity with a 30-year mortgage, Mrs. Mardesich said, the 15-year loan "seemed like a much better investment."
Although most home buyers are at least vaguely aware of the huge amount of interest they must pay on mortgage loans, the numbers can still come as a shock. In the case of a $100,000, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage loan, with 10 percent interest, a borrower's total payments would be $315,926, including $215,926 in interest.
In the first 10 years of the loan, the borrower would obtain only $9,162 in equity. But during the last 10 years, making the same monthly payment of $877.57, the borrower would gain $66,407 in equity.
"We are getting a lot more requests for amortization schedules, and a lot more questions from people wanting to know what they have to do to pay off their mortgages by a particular year," said Gregory Samp, president of Sibley Mortgage Corporation, based in Rochester, a mortgage lender in most of New York State and Ohio.
"Equity has become the name of the game," said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J., publisher of nationwide information on mortgages. "Borrowers have gotten tired of gimmicks."
To be sure, not all of the new forms of mortgages that were introduced in the 80's have been relegated to the scrap heap. And lenders continue to concoct new products for those whose desire simply to afford a home far outweighs their longer-term concerns about building an equity investment.
"There is still a group of borrowers out there excited about getting into a house, and affordability is the number one priority," said Walter Bucbynski, senior vice president of Margaretten and Company, a Perth Amboy, N.J., mortgage banking concern that makes home loans in 17 states.
One form of mortgage introduced over the last two years by Margaretten and most other lenders is the "two-step" loan, a modification of the adjustable-rate loans that swiftly came to dominate the market during the early 80's, but have since fallen into disfavor.
The two-steps are normally offered with five- or seven-year initial terms, when the interest rate is fixed at 0.75 percent or a full percentage point lower than what is charged on 30-year, fixed-rate loans. But after the initial five- or seven-year term ends, the interest rate reverts to a different fixed rate that remains unchanged for the life of the mortgage, and is slightly higher than the prevailing rate on 30-year, fixed-rate loans.
Lenders say the two-step loans are popular among first-time buyers and young families, most of whom plan to move on to another residence before the end of the initial five- or seven-year term.
For borrowers and lenders alike, the two-steps may be proving a safer, more predictable alternative to the type of adjustable rate loans that were popular in the last decade. In 1984 and 1985 the adjustables -- with rates adjusted every six months, every year or every three years -- accounted for over half of the loans extended, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board.
But later in the decade, fierce competition prompted lenders to offer artificially low introductory "teaser" rates on the adjustables. Many also employed lax standards in which applicants could be approved even though their incomes were sufficient to cover only the low first-year level of payments. The result was losses for lenders and a financial squeeze for many home buyers.
In May, the most recent month for which data are available, the Federal Housing Finance Board reported that adjustables -- including the new two-steps -- accounted for 21 percent of all mortgages. Others in the industry, including Fannie Mae and HSH, said most of the applications for adjustable-rate loans were now for the two-step variety.
With fixed-rate mortgages now commanding 79 percent of the market, experts say borrowers are basing decisions on the term of the loan and its payment schedule. The standard 30-year fixed rate loan remains by far the most popular for the simple reason that monthly payments on shorter-term loans can be hundreds of dollars more.
But lenders charge slightly lower interest on fixed rate loans with shorter terms. That means that those who expect to stay in their homes for more than a decade, or who simply want to be sure they are gaining some significant equity during the first few years of their loan, will come out ahead if they take a 15-year or 20-year fixed rate loan.
At Fannie Mae, Mr. Dale said that 15-year fixed rate loans now account for 20 percent of the mortgages now being purchased from thrifts, mortgage bankers and commercial banks, compared to 12 percent a year ago.
Twenty-year fixed rate loans, which have been introduced only this year by most lenders, are far less popular but operate on the same principal as 15-year loans -- they have lower interest rates and are paid off more quickly than 30-year loans, but have high monthly payments.
The differing costs are illustrated by the Federal Housing Finance Board, which provided figures for typical fixed rate mortgages now being offered. Home buyers taking a 30-year loan would be charged 9.5 percent interest and pay $840.85 a month; those with a 20-year loan would pay 9.4 percent and $925.61 a month; and those with a 15-year loan would pay 9.3 percent, and $1,032.19 a month.
The difference between the monthly payments on a 15-year and a 30-year loan -- $191.34 -- is "a fairly nasty spread," said Joseph McKenzie, an economist for the Federal agency. He added that it is probably discouraging most first-time buyers or middle-income families from taking the shorter term loans, particularly those who are determined to buy as much home as they can afford.
One option being offered by a growing number of lenders across the nation is the so-called biweekly mortgage, in which payments are due every two weeks instead of every month. These mortgages have been available for years in some industrial communities of New England and the Middle West, where payments are automatically taken from workers' paychecks.
Lenders say biweekly mortgages are becoming more widespread because they provide a speedier system of paying off a fixed rate mortgage.
By making 26 payments a year, each calcuated at half a full month's payment, at the end of the year the biweekly mortgage holder has paid for 13 full months.
Mr. Dale of Fannie Mae said that 20-year biweekly mortgages were the equivalent of monthly-payment loans with terms of between 22 and 23 years.
For most homeowners who already have fixed-rate 30-year loans and want to increase their equity, perhaps the simplest option is to determine when they want to have their home paid off and then begin a paying additional amounts each month or year to conform to the new schedule. They will continue to pay the original interest rate, which is probably slightly higher than that on a 15- or 20-year loan, but prepaying provides the option of shortening the term of the loan without refinancing.
Mr. Havemann of HSH said this option should be considered by people whose incomes are insufficient for them to qualify for 15-year or 20-year mortgages on the homes they want, but who do qualify for 30-year financing.
"The thing to do is buy the best you can qualify for," he said. "Then you prepay -- you buy the loan down. It comes to the same thing as a 15- or 20-year mortgage."

Reallocation of Shares
 
Question: I own two co-op apartments that have been combined. The certificate of occupancy has been changed and it is now legally considered one unit. But I am still paying two maintenance fees. Am I entitled to a reduction in my maintenance now that I have one apartment instead of two? . . . Janet Reyes, Manhattan
 
Answer: Probably not. But you might check the bylaws to find out how share allocation and maintenance is determined.
In most co-ops, it is determined by a formula that considers size, location in the building and such amenities as balconies and terraces. Even if your work to join the two units has been considerable, most of those variables probably have not changed.
According to Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, it is not likely that the board of your co-op would be able to justify a reduction in your maintenance.
"There is no easy way around the issue of share allocation and absolute equity when it comes to maintenance distribution," said Mrs. Rothman. "When changes are made, shares just don't dissapear into outer space.
If a board reduced the maintenance in one apartment it would have to have increases somewhere else to compensate for the lost income."
 
 
 
'For Sale' Signs

 
Question: Is it true that in New York City only realty companies and real estate brokers, not homeowners, can post a "For Sale" sign on the front lawn of a house? . . . Ike Friesem, Fresh Meadows, Queens
 
Answer: No. City regulations pertaining to "For Sale" signs in residential areas do not prohibit homeowners from putting out signs themselves. However, there are other regulations regarding such signs. The code permits small signs as long as they are for "the direction or convenience of the public." The sign must refer to the property where it appears and it cannot be more than five square feet (2 1/2 by 2 feet, for example).
 
 
 
Rent Regulation Rules

 
Question: I would like some printed information on New York City's rent control and rent stabilization. Where would I go? . . . Robert Hotman, New Hyde Park, N.Y.
 
Answer: To the offices of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency that has jurisdiction over rent regulation. The main New York office is at Gertz Plaza at 92-31 Union Hall Boulevard in Jamaica, Queens. You can get a copy of the 1990 Guide to Rent Regulations. Although complete, the language is technical and not easy to read without a familiarity with legal language.
More readable, however, are Fact Sheets that the Department of Housing and Community Renewal publishes. There are 24 bulletins providing information on on matters ranging from rent overcharge complaints to the legal procedure for evictions.
The agency is now preparing a new brochure called "Twenty Questions: Answers to Tenants' Most Frequently Asked Questions on Rights and Protections," which it expects to start distributing after Labor Day.
"The new booklet has been designed to be the most up-to-date, acessable and user friendly package of information so far," said Alan Hammerman, a spokesman for the agency. "It will be available both in English and Spanish versions."
There are no charges for any of these materials and they are available in the rent administration offices in each borough as well as at the main office.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Nonprofit Offices;
New York Proposes a Center for the Tax-Exempts

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A DECADE ago, with all the businesses whose headquarters it claimed, New York City also called itself home to the American Cancer Society, Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, United Presbyterian Church and Young Men's Christian Association -- among other leading nonprofit groups.
Today, you would have to go to Atlanta to find the Cancer Society, Baltimore to find the N.A.A.C.P., Louisville to find the Presbyterians and Chicago to find the Y.M.C.A. 
 And it seemed until recently that the Girl Scouts might move from 830 Third Avenue to Atlanta, Baltimore, Cleveland or St. Louis.
Last month, the Girl Scouts announced they would stay in New York -- for the time being. But even as Mayor David N. Dinkins and other officials celebrated the decision by that organization to keep 400 employees in Manhattan, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants was announcing that it would move 600 of its 750 employees from Rockefeller Center to the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City.
"In 1980, about 4,000 national associations were headquartered here," said Joel A. Dolci, president and chief executive officer of the New York Society of Association Executives. "In the last decade, we've lost 2,000. That's an average of about 200 a year. Although we don't have specific figures, it had a tremendous negative effect on the economy of the City of New York."
Hoping to stem the exodus, the Dinkins administration is shopping for what it calls an Association Center -- a "financially stable" commercial building, preferably south of Fulton Street, with at least 500,000 square feet of space, 400,000 of which must be available within a year, for use as headquarters or back offices by national nonprofit charitable organizations and trade associations.
"I've always felt very strongly that not-for-profits are a business," said Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "People take the words 'not-for-profit' too literally. When it comes to the revenues generated for the city, they're a very important force."
"We're very excited with the city's giant step forward to try to do something to salvage the association community," Mr. Dolci said. However, he also sounded a note of caution: "We don't have much time. At least 30 organizations that we're aware of are considering moving out of New York City in the next 36 months."
In requesting proposals, the city's Economic Development Corporation said it "intends to structure a transaction which would reduce or eliminate real-estate taxes, as well as sales taxes on construction materials for planned improvements in the portion of the building occupied by" nonprofit groups.
 At its core, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said, the proposal is meant to address the fact that when nonprofit organizations rent their space, they have to pay the real-estate taxes passed on by their landlords. Certain kinds of organizations would be exempt from taxes, however, if they owned their space.
One way the city has proposed structuring the center, therefore, is as an office condominium, in which space would be sold -- rather than rented -- to tax-exempt organization. Landlords have another 10 days to respond to city officials. Forty owners attended a recent meeting to learn how to tailor proposals to the needs of nonprofit tenants.
This is not the first time that an Association Center has been proposed. Nine years ago, an effort was begun to build a 1 million-square-foot center, financed by the New York State Dormitory Authority. Prospective occupants, according to Mr. Dolci, included the American Hotel and Motel Association, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and National Association of Accountants.
"These people were pledged to purchase in a condominium relationship and live together," Mr. Dolci said. "At that time, the authority ran into a little difficulty," he added. It had invested 60 percent of its portfolio with the Lombard-Wall financial concern, which declared bankruptcy in August 1982. "So it put a halt to this project and we, in turn, tried to get the city interested," he said. "But we were not successful."
AT least eight potential occupants for the center in 1982 have left or are leaving New York City. In the case of the certified public accountants' group, executive headquarters will stay at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, between 47th and 48th Streets, although a great majority of employees will be shifted across the Hudson River next year.
"The city does a great job when there is a potential loss of 5,000 workers," Deputy Mayor Hernandez-Pinero said. "I'm not sure we've responded as well when there was a potential loss of 500 workers. We need to be incredibly aggressive, regardless of the number of jobs at risk."
One of the first tests of this new approach came with the Girls Scouts.
The Girl Scout headquarters, a 13-story glass box at Third Avenue and 51st Street, was begun in 1956, to designs by William T. Meyer and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, and dedicated in 1958, with Gov. W. Averell Harriman in attendance. The Girl Scouts organization owns the structure and occupies almost all of it, about 120,000 square feet.
As the building's age would suggest, it is due for a renovation. And the magnitude of that work would thoroughly disrupt operations within. "That is why we were into this decision," said Mary Rose Main, national executive director of the Girl Scouts. "It's not that we didn't like our location." In May 1990, a site-selection task group was formed to study alternatives to 830 Third Avenue.
Manhattan was one of five contenders for the headquarters site. "We are a national organization," Ms. Main said, "so we don't feel that geographic location is a binding force. Truly, we could be located in any city."
The site-selection committee established several criteria. "Very high on the list was the importance of a diverse work force," Ms. Main said, "so we would be located where we could have all racial and ethic groups represented. And it had to be a place that would give the organization high image and visibility. And we have a lot of traveling staff, so there had to be air accessibility."
Two major strikes against New York, predictably enough, were costs and crime. "When you think about bringing in staff from across the country," Ms. Main said, "it's harder to do in New York. It's the perception of fear and the concern about the financial condition of the city."
In the city's favor was incumbency. "Disruption was a major factor" in tipping the balance to New York, Ms. Main said. "It is most important for our attention, time and resources to be placed on our mission and organization, rather than sites, facilities, bricks and so forth."
Ultimately, the organization decided to remain in New York. "It will be an issue that we review periodically," Ms. Main said, "but at this time we think it's important to be be here and to continue the development of Girl Scouting at a fast pace."
The Third Avenue building is to be sold and the Girl Scouts will look for 120,000 square feet elsewhere. "We are keeping our options very much open." Ms. Main said, "and have not made a decision whether to buy, lease or lease to buy, although we have owned in the past. We've made a decision to remain in Manhattan and most probably in the midtown area. That can be defined broadly, sometimes." Even if the proposed Association Center is developed, it would not happen quickly enough or offer enough space to serve the Girl Scouts' needs, she said.
"The city worked to be supportive in every way," Ms. Main said, "to be sure that we knew about low-cost financing that would be available through Industrial Development Agency. And they are trying to be helpful in being sure that we know about sites and buildings."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: Ridgefield

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
RIDGEFIELD won't let go of its Yankee roots.
"On the surface it hasn't changed at all, " said Sue W. Manning, the First Selectman and a 21-year resident. "Houses and shops are pretty much the same. Maybe they're painted a different color, rebricked or have an added tree." 
 But the 35-square-mile Connecticut town, which lies in the Housatonic Valley in Fairfield County, also is "a sophisticated, up-to-date place with a small-town atmosphere," Mrs. Manning said.
To Anne Margolis, a local sculptor, "it's like a college town without a campus." Main Street, she said, "is two blocks of enormous houses and genteel, discreet commercial space."
Lining Main Street are huge sugar maples that property owners tap for syrup every spring. Set back from the thoroughfare, with its lawns and white gazebo, is the five-acre Ballard Park.
Just down the street a woman in a colonial costume gives tours of the Keeler Tavern, built as a home in 1730. It became a tavern in 1772 and during the Revolutionary War was a popular meeting place for patriots -- and thus a prime target for the British. A British cannonball is embedded in a cornerpost.
In 1907, the architect Cass Gilbert bought the inn and turned it into a summer house. The Keeler Tavern Preservation Society purchased it in 1966.
At times, the charm of the colonial past clashes with modern traffic. On weekdays, said Mrs. Manning, 16,000 cars traverse Main Street [Route 35], which converges with Route 33 at the Cass Gilbert Fountain, dating from World War I. The fountain has been heavily damaged by collisions and restored twice, most recently two years ago.
A BLOCK north of the tavern is the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, every bit as colonial in style -- it was a grocery for a century, and then a bank -- but now featuring the Gorilla Girls, a feminist multimedia art group from New York, as part of The Art of Advocacy exhibit.
Among the town's residents are Maurice Sendak, author and illustrator of children's books, and the actor Robert Vaughn. And Eugene O'Neill wrote "Desire Under the Elms" while living there.
North of Main Street, at North Salem Road and New Street, is Settlers' Rock, , where five scouts from Norwalk and Milford camped in 1708 when they came to survey the land. Later that year, the first settlers bought 20,000 acres from Catoonah, the leader of the Ramapoo Indians.The town was incorporated in 1709.
The oldest surviving house, completed in 1714 and now privately owned, belonged to the town's first minister, the Rev. Thomas Hawley.
After the Revolution, the town, already known for its inns, built its economy on farming, mills, quarries and a tannery. Later, hatting shops and shirt factories were established. The town also produced butter, beef and pork and became a leading carriage maker.
In the years following the Civil War, Ridgefield became a country retreat for wealthy New Yorkers. High Ridge became known as Publishers Row. Among the resident bookmen were E.P. Dutton and Charles Henry Holt. At the end of the 19th century Italian and Irish immigrants settled in the area to work on public projects and private estates.
The town's greatest growth occurred from 1955 to 1965, when the population expanded nearly fivefold to 23,000. Easy access to Interstates 84 and 684 and to Route 7 drew many newcomers in the 70's following the shift of corporate headquarters to the suburbs.
"We thought it was a nice town to raise a family in, and I don't think we've been disappointed," said Gwendolyn Tierney, one of the 300 members of the Newcomers Club. She and her husband, John, bought a four-bedroom colonial on two-and-a-half acres "in the upper $300,000's" when they moved from Pennsylvania two and a half years ago.
 "I think in general we're slightly less expensive than Wilton, more than Danbury, and comparable to Fairfield," said Chip Neumann, president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors and partner in the family's Harry H. Neumann Associates realty agency.
Many starter homes are converted cottages. A 1,400-square-foot cottage on Rainbow Lake, for example, typically sells for around $200,000. A farmhouse and a barn with 10 stalls and an indoor riding ring on 40 acres in the rural Ridgebury section has a pricetag of $2.9 million.
Ridgefield has five condominiums, the largest with 150 units, and all are within walking distance of Main Street. The units range in price from $100,000 to about $450,000. House rentals start at $1,400 for a three-bedroom split-level, and go to $2,500 for a four-bedroom, 2,500-square-foot neo-colonial.
Apartments, some above storefronts on Main Street, rent from $800 a month for a one-bedroom to $1,200 for a two-bedroom.
Among the town's elegant restaurants are the Elms and Stonehenge, both also offering rooms, and the Inn at Ridgefield.
There are 60 civic and cultural organizations in the town, among them the Guild of Artists, the Workshop for Performing Arts, the Ridgefield Symphony Orchestra and a civic ballet.
Today, some 30 companies, mostly light industrial concerns, operate in Ridgefield. The largest is Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, which has its headquarters in a converted high school. It plans to move to the Shadow Lake area of town by fall.
There is more than 600,000 square feet of retail space in town, most of it in nine shopping centers. One of them, Copps Hill Common, features the Ridgefield Antiques Center representing 30 dealers.
FINANCIAL problems led to the closing of the local movie theater and the Y.M.C.A. last year. Many residents now drive about 10 minutes to the single-screen Cinema theater in Wilton, or for a workout in that town's Y. Five minutes away in Danbury are eight movie screens and the Danbury Fair Mall for serious shopping.
Ridgefield's indoor ice-skating rink is open from November to March.
A total of 3,300 students attend six schools in the Ridgefield system, where sixth-graders sample three languages -- German, Spanish and French -- for a year and then select one for the next two years. Eighth-graders scored in the top 1 percent in Connecticut Mastery Tests in reading and math last year.
Ridgefield High School, which offers 13 advanced placement courses for college credit, graduated 261 students this year; 91 percent plan to attend college. It has 49 intramural teams and 30 extra-curricular programs. The school is one of 24 nationwide public schools participating in Boston's "A Better Chance" program, which provides educational opportunities for minority students in the top 10 percent of their hometown class.
In the last school year, six young women from urban areas in the Northeast participated in the program. They lived together in a Ridgefield house owned by the program, with a resident director and tutor. The program began five years ago.
The Farmingville, Ridgebury, Veterans Park and Scotland elementary schools cover grades k to 5, the East Ridge Middle School grades 6 to 8. One specialty of the elementary schools is the Art Leap program, which introduces pupils to painting and drawing in the third grade.
The Ridgefield Library, built in 1901, has tripled its space with the help of a $1-million gift from an anonymous local benefactor. It has 70,000 volumes and attracts some 730 visitors daily.
The town owns 2,114 acres of open space offering parks, lakes, an 18-hole golf course, Little League fields and horseback, hiking and nature trails. The nine-acre Martin Park has a spring-fed pond and beach and 30-acre Richardson Park borders Lake Mamanasco, which has a boat launch. In addition, there is Pierrepont State Park with 304 acres.

"Woman," he reportedly shouted, "if I had seen you, I would have shot you dead." One of two 18th century Olmsted houses still standing on Olmstead Lane may be Mary's.

HEADLINE: Court Committee Backs Videotaping

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
A STATE Supreme Court committee charged with finding the best way to preserve court proceedings added a new twist to the debate between official court reporters and audio-tape transcribers, the two groups that now dominate the field, by recommending a third technology -- videotaping -- as the most accurate, cost-effective option.
The committee, which was appointed in March by Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz, issued its report last month after hearing testimony from judges, lawyers, tape transcribers and court reporters on the advantages and disadvantages of stenographers versus electronic recording. 
 The committee's report, which is subject to public comment for a period of 90 days, after which time it will be acted upon by Chief Justice Wilentz, was accompanied by a minority opinion that criticized the majority's findings.
Critics of electronic recording say the recommendation endorses what is essentially an unproven technology that will embody all the disadvantages of audio recording while adding a few of its own.
 
Recommendation Fulfilled Mandate
 The committee chairman, Judge Herman D. Michels, presiding judge of the Appellate Division of State Superior Court, said the recommendation fulfilled his group's mandate to find the most accurate and economical method of preserving courtroom proceedings.
"We were asked to look at all of the technology, not just stenographic recording," Judge Michels said. "The consensus was that our recommendation provides a workable solution for the future of the courts."
Judge Michels said the majority of the committee believed that electronically recording court proceedings was more economical than using official court reporters. The average cost of an audio-recording system, he said, is about $2,000, while the cost of equipping a courtroom with a video system is about $60,000.
And though electronic recording systems require a human operator to run them, he said, electronic recording systems are still less expensive than live court reporters.
"Videotaping is expensive, but when the expense is amortized over the life of the equipment, it's still cheaper than the official court reporter," he said.
 Notwithstanding those arguments, Judge Michels said, the committee has recommended that the current practice of audio-recording proceedings in municipal courts be continued. In addition, the committee recommended that court reporters continue to be used in most jury trials and in complex, multiparty cases.
That, however, raises questions in some critics' minds.
"Now what does that say about videotape and audio tape?" said Daniel J. Carone, president of the Certified Shorthand Reporters Association of New Jersey in Springfield. "It says that they don't work," he said. "They still want to rely on the court reporter for the complex cases."
Mr. Carone said that while court reporters welcomed new technology -- including advances in their own field that allow for instantaneous computer-generated transcripts of proceedings -- videotaping was an unproven technology in the courtroom. In addition, he said, the problems encountered with audio tape, including equipment failures and indistinct passages, will occur with video and perhaps be exacerbated because of the more complex technology involved. As a result, he said, the committee's recommendation is at best premature.
"I don't think they did their homework on this one," Mr. Carone said.
 Gloria Irwin, who is president of the Transcribers Association of New Jersey in Audubon and a member of the Supreme Court committee, said she agreed with the committee's recommendation but believed that audio recording should be used in addition to videotaping.
"For transcriptions, the four-track method is still the best way of getting everything," she said, referring to the current practice of using four microphones in the courtroom to help identify specific voices.
In any event, Ms. Irwin said, transcribers would still be needed to provide "hard copy" transcripts of proceedings even if only video were used. As a result, she said, transcribers' business is not likely to be adversely affected.
The ranks of court reporters could dwindle, however, if the new technology proves effective. There are currently 199 official court reporters working in the state court system.
But Judge Michels said the committee's report specifically recommended that court reporters be replaced through attrition rather than termination.
"Even if our recommendation is fully implemented," he said, "no reporter is going to lose his or her job."

HEADLINE: After 2 Years, A Compromise Sets Up Rise In Sales Tax

BYLINE: By JAMES FERON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THEY had met many times before, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, a Republican, and his Democratic political rival, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, in a futile effort to find a compromise over an increased sales tax that Mr. O'Rourke considered essential to Westchester's fiscal health but that Mr. Brodsky insisted was unnecessary.
This time, in the Skyway Steak House outside Albany, there was a third participant: Assemblyman Gregory P. Young, a Democrat. He was carrying the outline of a compromise in the two-year struggle over the unusual sales tax proposal, which would provide new revenues not only for the county government but also for towns and villages, most school districts and two small cities that do not impose their own sales taxes. 
 "We talked frankly for a couple of hours," Mr. Brodsky recalled, praising Mr. Young as the "engine" that made the meeting work. Mr. O'Rourke also praised the Mount Vernon legislator. "Greg was extremely helpful," he said. "He got Brodsky and myself together in a little hideaway restaurant and we battled it out, ending with a compromise."
The result is that Westchester has received authority from the State Legislature to raise the county sales tax by 1 percentage point, instead of by the 1.5 percentage points that it requested. It must adhere to a cap on spending for items not required by the state, with spending on those items rising by no more than the increase in personal income.
The plan would raise the sales tax to 6.75 percent from 5.75 in Westchester's towns and villages and in the Cities of Rye and Peekskill on Oct. 15. Mount Vernon and Yonkers, which have an 8.25 percent sales tax rate, and New Rochelle and White Plains, where the rate is 7.25, are exempt from the increase.
The tax will raise an extra $67 million a year -- the figure would have been $100 million under the proposed 1.5-point increase -- of which $22 million will go to the county, $33 million to the affected towns, villages and two small cities, and $12 million to their school districts.
 
Review by Board
 Mr. O'Rourke fought hard for the additional revenues, saying they would help offset the impact of cutbacks in state assistance. Mr. Brodsky had argued that the county should be cutting spending rather than looking for additional income through a regressive tax.
Members of the Board of Legislators, who must approve the legislation for it to take effect, began informal discussions last week on how the money is to be spent, and when. Some support the creation of a special fund for the extra sales tax revenue, so its use can be identified, rather than simply placing the money in the general fund.
The Democratic minority leader in the county legislature, Sandra R. Galef, said: "We hope to establish a special fund for the money, to be used in the 1992 budget to lower the property tax. We're not in favor of using it this year because what will happen is the county will restore all the programs they've taken out, and that's not the way to downsize government."
But she said passing a resolution to that effect would not work "because the County Executive doesn't have to follow resolutions."
"We're looking to pass some kind of act" that has the force of law, Ms. Galef said. She said she did not know "what the level of support is, but they need nine votes" from the Board's 17 members. She said there were "only seven Republicans" of the 10 on the board "supporting" the tax increase plan.
The Board Chairman, John E. Hand, a Republican, said he was inclined to avoid establishing a special fund for the new sales tax. "Some legislators say they want to control how the money is spent. Are they going to make the local municipalities do the same thing?"
Timothy S. Carey, a Republican whose district includes Peekskill and the Town of Cortlandt, said he saw the agreement reached by Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Brodsky and Mr. Young as "no victory at all, because the north county has lost out to the south county."
 
Constitutional Issue
 "The sales tax is not going to be raised in Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and White Plains, but it will be raised basically in the north," he said. If the new revenues are used to reduce the property tax established by the county to balance its budget, he said, "We will have a situation where taxes being raised in northern municipalities are being used, in part, to stabilize property taxes in the south."
Mr. Carey said also suggested that the plan might be unconstitutional. "What we're now going to be having is a county sales tax being raised at different rates in different communities," he said. "Shoppers in areas that do not have their own sales tax will be paying more county sales tax than the people who buy in the cities, where the overall tax rate is higher but the county sales tax share will be lower."
Mr. Carey did like one aspect of the new sales tax. "As the economy heats up, it generates more money; so it has a built-in escalator," he said.
Does that mean county voters can sit back and watch tax revenues rise? "It depends on what the state does," Mr. Carey said. "State-mandated costs now represent 67 percent of our budget; if Albany keeps pushing mandates on us, county taxes will continue to go up, no matter how much the new sales tax brings in."
 
'A Competitive Edge'
 Legislator Daniel P. Thomas, a Yonkers Republican, said merchants in Yonkers might gain "something of a competitive edge, although not as much as they would have if the extra half percent of sales tax had not been removed" in the compromise negotiations.
Legislator Audrey G. Hochberg, Democrat of Scarsdale, said that she was in favor of the new sales tax but that it should be "put in a special reserve which would be controlled by the Board of Legislators."
Another Democrat, Martin L. Rogowsky of Harrison, said he was opposed to the increased tax plan, especially the linked cap on non-mandated costs. "It means the state is telling us we can't spend more than X dollars on parks or bicycle Sundays," he said. "But what about mandated expenses? Why don't they cap those?"
Legislator Katherine S. Carsky, a Yonkers Republican who heads the board's budget committee, said the full 1.5 percentage points "would have been better, but it's going to relieve the property taxpayer in any case, and that will be a big help."
Mr. Brodsky said it was important to note that the spending cap did not apply specifically to each non-mandated cost, but only to the general category of non-mandated costs. "It doesn't mean that every line in the budget gets the same treatment," he said.
 
Budgeting Flexibility
 The cap also will be determined "by the rate of personal income, or how it moves from a base year." The cap moves with the ability of the community to pay for it, he said. "In a recession, personal income is flat, so if personal income rose by only 2 percent, spending on non-mandated items would go up by only 2 percent."
It would not mean, for example, that the county's share of support for the Hudson River Museum or the Council for the Arts would be limited to 2 percent in each case, he said. The county could maintain its subsidy of one cultural organization at the previous level while using that organization's "share" to increase the other institution's support by more than 2 percent.
Mr. Brodsky said he remained opposed to the new sales tax, even with the linked spending cap and a sunset clause that limits its existence to three years. He voted against it on the Assembly floor.
He also brushed aside any suggestion that he had compromised, saying the measure reached the floor after the County Executive "modified his proposal."
 
Here's Another Version
 The County Executive, not surprisingly, had another version of the events leading up to the Skyway meeting. "I went to Mel Miller and explained that we needed it," Mr. O'Rourke said. Mr. Miller, the Speaker of the Assembly, is a powerful "gatekeeper" for legislation reaching the floor.
"He explained the facts of life to me, saying he had a problem in the Westchester delegation," Mr. O'Rourke said, a reference to the continuing opposition to the sales tax proposal by Mr. Brodsky, who represents Greenburgh, and by Ronald C. Tocci, a New Rochelle Democrat.
"He called them together," Mr. O'Rourke said, "and I think he beat them up a little. What came out of that meeting was a directive to Brodsky to come to some compromise. So I agreed to the 1 percent, the spending cap and the sunset clause, and Brodsky agreed to get out of the way.
"Miller would not have done it without Brodsky going along. It was not a denial of his position; I told him from the beginning that he could vote against it, but let us have it. And that in fact is what happened."
 
And a Rebuttal
 Not quite, Mr. Brodsky said.
"Mel Miller always took the position that the delegations themselves had to solve these things," he said. "But this year, at the last minute, he was confronted with requests for state tax increases from Nassau and Suffolk. He knew he couldn't do some and not the others, and he also knew he did not have the time to negotiate a better plan for us.
"So he said to all three, 'Work out what you can; it's likely they'll all go in one bill.'
"He called O'Rourke and said 'It's time to talk,' " Mr. Brodsky concluded. "Then he went to Greg Young, who has been the leading supporter of the tax, and encouraged him to get us together."

HEADLINE: New Yorkers, etc.

BYLINE: By Enid Nemy

 BODY:
Some everyday occurrences cause acute discomfort and embarrassment to many people. Making a fuss over money, particularly comparatively small amounts of money, is generally one of them.
It's always been acceptable to query the accuracy of even a small amount on a bill sent by mail. Not so acceptable was holding up a supermarket line over a small overcharge. This doesn't mean it wasn't done -- many people quite justly insisted on it -- but there was usually both resentment and disdain from a great proportion of the line. 
 But quibbling over supermarket pennies, no matter how justified, was never the most irritating experience in money matters. Even in palmier days when there were fewer worries about money and jobs, right up there in the forefront of irritations, admitted or not, was the business of splitting restaurant checks.
The unspoken resentment about equal sharing of restaurant bills naturally occurred only when one party's order amounted to a good deal more than the other's. It was almost never mentioned, but the person who handed over half the amount of the bill fumed inwardly. He or she was well aware that a club soda didn't approach the price of three glasses of wine. And the $7 dessert that the other party enjoyed still cost the sharer $3.50.
Life being what it is, it was almost always the bigger drinker and more extravagant diner who, at the end of the meal, said airlily, "Why don't we just split this?" Few had the courage to say, "No, you had two drinks and I had one, and you had soup and dessert, and I didn't."
There were, too, more diners than one would imagine who remembered the price of what they ordered and, at the end of the meal, handed over a bill or bills with "This should cover mine." The amount barely covered the food and drink, never mind tax and tip, but it was a rare soul who said anything. It was just easier to go along.
All these things still happen, and many men and women are still going along. But there has been a small breakthrough. If any good is coming out of the current economic clime, a willingness to speak out about money is somewhere on the list.
Recently, two young couples went out for coffee. One person ordered cake as well. When the bill arrived, the husband of the cake-eater said, "It's $14 and the tip makes it $16, so that's $8 each."
"I think ours is less," said one of the non-cake-eaters. "We just had coffee." After what was described as a "surprised look," the other man said: "Oh, sure, that's right. The coffees were $2 each, so with tax and tip that's about $5.25."
"I'd never have done this in the past," said the young man who had questioned the bill. "I might have been irritated, but I wouldn't have said anything. But my wife just lost her job, and I don't know what's going to happen to mine, and I just figured the time had come to say what I should have said years ago."
It's considerably more difficult to speak out when six people or three couples have dinner and the orders vary considerably. No one wants to go back to the old cartoon of "You had the soup and I had the salad and Jack had the pate and . . ." And no one really wants to take out a calculator.
The solution is a variation of splitting the bill: using two credit cards. In this case, the waiter is told in advance that each couple wishes to be billed separately and writes the orders so that the bills are made out appropriately. If it's a matter of salad and coffee, some restaurants might register displeasure, but if the bill is somewhat heftier, there is rarely a complaint.
When individuals dine together, with wildly varying orders and price differences, the same procedure is sometimes followed if each bill comes to a considerable sum. But one woman recently tried her own version of "remember what you ordered." She had dinner with four friends, two of whom drink considerably more than the others and one who usually orders steak, lobster or other expensive items. The woman's own financial situation has remained stable, she said, but she is now more conscious of how she spends money.
Before they ordered, she made an announcement: "Look, I know that everyone is more aware of money these days, whether we need to be or not. I think it would be fairer, instead of splitting the bill among us, if you each mentally add up the price of what you're ordering and give it to me with what you think is right for tax and tip. I'll pay the bill."
There were murmurs of assent and dissent. In the end the easy way -- "Oh, let's just divide it" -- triumphed. But, she said, "I gave them something to think about."

HEADLINE: Challenged and Chastened, Citibank Pursues the Customer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citibank once advertised itself to New York consumers as the bank that never sleeps. But it is discovering that rivals have also been staying up late.
While Citibank remains the largest consumer bank in the New York area, its lead has narrowed. Chemical Bank, long the area leader in serving small- and medium-sized businesses, says it is now the primary bank for about 10 percent of the households in the New York area, up from 7 percent five years ago. Manufacturers Hanover has expanded by acquiring 24 branches, with $2.8 billion of deposits, from the failed Goldome Savings Bank. And Chase Manhattan, whose name is highly regarded by wealthy consumers, has launched a series of new products, most recently a package of special services for checking and savings account customers over the age of 50. 
Indeed, from 1989 to the end of March 1990, consumer deposits at Citibank rose only 1.3 percent, as a total of all savings accounts, certificates of deposit of less than $100,000, and money market accounts. That compares with increases of 12.7 percent at Chemical, 20.2 percent at Chase and 11.6 percent at Manufacturers Hanover.
But Citibank is now waging a campaign to invigorate its New York branch system, a push that is a reminder of the increasing importance of the consumer business at a time when banks are suffering heavy losses on commercial real estate loans and weak loan demand from corporations. Apart from the profits to be made from low-cost deposits and high-interest loans to consumers, the large New York banks view stronger consumer deposits as a way to reduce their borrowings of "hot money" in the wholesale markets.
As Citicorp accumulated losses in 1990 of $299 million from real estate and other corporate lending in the United States, Europe and Japan, officials began pushing harder to increase deposits from the consumer business, which provided profits worldwide of $979 million, more than two-thirds of which analysts estimate came from credit cards and the New York branch network.
CITIBANK plans to capitalize on its winning credit card business and its 1,200 automated teller machines to cultivate new business rather than to imitate the offers for high-interest rate deposits or low-interest loans dangled by banks in the crowded New York market.
Citibank's existing stable of customers could represent a promising pool. Allen R. DeCotiis, president of PSI, a Tampa, Fla., research and consulting firm, said that "surveys show that Citibank customers, bar none, are the most loyal and appreciative of their bank." But he added that having well-satisfied customers does not mean Citibank will have an easy time expanding: "The competition is tougher and consumers have become more sophisticated."
Success, if it comes, is not expected to change wildly the balance in the New York metropolitan market, where 4.7 million households hold nearly 30 million accounts. Unlike in consumer electronics, where a hot, new product can propel a company, success in banking is measured by gains of a few percentage points in market share. "It's an inch a day business, with no home runs," said John S. Reed, Citibank's chairman.
Growth of a consumer banking business comes in two ways: by selling new products to existing customers or by attracting new customers. Pamela Flaherty, head of the New York branch system, said that Citibank is still convinced that "expanding our share of the consumer's wallet is the most profitable way to grow." That was the focus of Citibank's marketing in 1990. "But in 1991 and 1992," she said, "we plan to pay more attention to the acquisition of new customers."
Citibank, however, does not expect miracles from the new campaign. Loren Smith, director of marketing for Citibank's New York branch system, says a gain of up to 200,000 customers, each worth more than $100 of profit a year, would be a welcome addition to its existing 1.5 million customers. That would be fewer than the 300,000 customers Citibank attracted when it pioneered the automated teller machines in the late 1970's, or the 300,000 added in the early 80's with the introduction of a combined statement for all accounts.
THE bank hopes to win new customers by making banking more convenient. It is joining the Cirrus network of banks, which has 60,000 teller machines in 20 countries, and this month expanded its 24-hour bank-by-phone service. In addition to simple inquiries about, say, account balances, customers can now make transfers between accounts.
One example of the bank's program to improve branch design is the new megabranch in Grand Central Terminal. The branch, which is open while it is being renovated, is modeled on a major branch at a train station in Chicago. With long hours, from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M., 20 automated tellers, an investment center for securities sales and purchases and a staff trained in all the bank's products, the Grand Central branch, Citibank hopes to attract customers from the suburban towns served by the commuter railroads. Since Citibank entered Chicago seven years ago, its branches have been so successful that it is now neck-and-neck with First National Bank of Chicago as the leading consumer bank.
Another component of Citibank's plan is to use direct-mail marketing and some old-fashioned handshaking at branches to find credit card customers who would be willing to move their checking and savings accounts to Citibank. Mr. Smith noted that about 900,000 of Citibank's roughly 1.5 million credit card customers in the New York area do not have another account with Citibank. And Citibank has found that some 227,000 of them are tantalizingly close to the bank -- living within five miles of a branch. Every month, Mr. Smith added, 80,000 of them go to a branch to pay their card bills.
While some consultants say the likelihood of selling other banking products to credit card customers is slim, Citibank believes it is worthwhile. Among New York consumers who call Citibank their primary bank, those who started with a checking account have at the end of one year an average of about 4.8 accounts with the bank, while those who started with a credit card have about four. Most banks average slightly more than two accounts per customer.
Citibank's automated teller machines remain a key part of its marketing strategy. Rather than using machines to save teller costs, the objective is to use them "to empower customers -- to give them control over their money," Mr. Smith said. Today, Citibank officials say, the machines are so popular that 350,000 of its 1.5 million customers in New York rarely visit human tellers.
And after spending years and millions of dollars on development, Citibank says the machines have new potential. For example, transactions involving Landmark mutual funds, which the bank sells through 160 securities specialists, could eventually be handled by the machines.
For now, the bank is experimenting with displaying on the machines' screen a list of a customer's recently cleared checks -- a feature already available at some other banks. Another idea is to use the machine to solicit business from customers of other banks who use Citi's machines.
Other bankers scoff at the versatility of Citibank's machines, but Mr. Smith says Citibank's customers use the machines more frequently than those of other banks. And he says the machines' ability to handle exotic transactions, like transfers between credit card, loan and deposit accounts, though used infrequently, is a selling point -- "like a smoke detector that only gets used once a year, but provides peace of mind."
While Citibank is more advanced than some in using technology to extract sales information from customer transactions, Mr. DeCotiis, the analyst, said far more progress is needed. "Until you quit using the branch workers as beasts of burden and provide them with the technology and information to use their brain and anticipate the needs of customers," he said, individual banks will continue to be viewed as undistinguishable.
Finally, Citibank's new emphasis on automated tellers and telephone banking will not come at the expense of branch expansion. Mr. Smith says the bank's branch network is still weaker than he would like in the New York, Connecticut and New Jersey counties surrounding New York City: "Our expansion into those areas is a question of when, not whether."

Opportunity in Bundesbank Inaction

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The Bundesbank surprised some financial market participants on Thursday by deciding not to raise Germany's interest rates. But, more important, by sitting on the sidelines it offered Britain and France an opportunity to lower interest rates.
The British took advantage quickly. The Conservative Government of John Major reduced its base lending rate on Friday by a half a percentage point, to 11 percent. 
 The French are also expected to cut rates. But analysts said the Government would probably make just a marginal move, only a quarter of a percentage point. "It will not be great, and if it happens, it will have to be quick," said Dominic Freud, a vice president at the Paribas Corporation in New York.
There was little response in the financial markets to the rate cut in London, however, because the decrease had been expected. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index ended down 13.1 on Friday, at 2,497.4. In France, with the market still waiting for some action, the CAC-40 was unchanged at 1,754.29.
The Bundesbank's inaction offers different opportunities for the British and the French for several reasons. In the British case, there is more pressure to cut interest rates now because Mr. Major faces an election within 10 months and the economy is still in a recession.
In addition, official short-term interest rates in Britain, at 11 percent, are still much higher than in France, where they are at 9 percent. The French economy, though stalled, has not suffered as much as Britain. And the British pound is much stronger within the European Monetary System than the franc, giving the British more scope to cut interest rate without undermining the currency.
Analysts are divided on the outlook for German interest rates from here. A majority seems to be leaning to the view that the Bundesbank will still push rates higher in the next several months. If the German rates move higher, there is less chance for lower rates elsewhere, despite the slowing economies. Most analysts who are optimistic about stock markets in Europe are counting on a decline in interest rates to propel markets, especially those in France, Italy and Spain.
But some people think the signal that the Bundesbank sent on Thursday was that rates will not move higher if the dollar does not continue to climb sharply against the mark. The coordinated selling of the dollar by central banks on Friday, which knocked the dollar down 2.4 percent, increased the likelihood the Bundesbank would not act.
Some analysts even suggested that a deal had been made for the Germans to refrain from pushing rates higher in exchange for strong American support in intervening in the foreign exchange market. After the Bundesbank's inaction on Thursday, the dollar shot up to 1.8340 marks from 1.8080. On Friday, after the heavy selling, the dollar ended at 1.7995
"This seems to be a sensible trade-off," said Gabriele Lamers, an international economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. "Yes, I see this as being a deal."
John Lipsky, director of international bond research for Salomon Brothers in London, thinks that the Bundesbank has chosen to raise interest rates in a more indirect way. Rather than simply increasing its official short-term Lombard and discount rates on Thursday, he said, the central bank decided to hold down the growth rate of the money supply enough so that the demand for capital forces up market interest rates. Then, when these short-term rates have risen, the Bundesbank can change its official rates, saying that it has just followed the direction of the market.
This strategy sends a more passive signal to the market, Mr. Lipsky said. But it also allows the Bundesbank to appear that it is sympathetic to the United States' call for lower interest rates around the world on the eve of the annual economic summit meeting in London. But Mr. Lipsky said this approach could also risk higher inflation by being less aggressive.
Another interpretation is that the central bank decided to give Helmut Schlesinger, who will be the new president of the Bundesbank, the chance to raise interest rates when he takes over after the Bundesbank returns from its summer recess. Karl Otto Pohl, the current president, presided over his last meeting on Thursday.
This is, indeed, a tactical consideration. It gives the new boss, who is known to be a hard-liner on inflation, a chance to show how tough he is as he begins his leadership of the Bundesbank.
Nigel Rendell, an international economist at James Capel Inc. in London, is one who thinks the Bundesbank will not raise interest rates. He argues that the German economy is slowing down and that the impact of the weaker mark on inflation in Germany, as reflected in import prices, has not been severe.
But Mr. Lipsky and others argue that the inflationary pressures in Germany are mounting, with inflation expected to move past 4 percent in July. And the Bundesbank needs to send a message that it does not like inflation so that this higher level will not get fed into wage increases for next year.

HEADLINE: A Quirky Loner Goes Mainstream

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: CUPPERINO, Calif.

 BODY:
When Apple Computer Inc. announced its all but unthinkable partnership with the International Business Machines Corporation earlier this month, some Apple employees coverd up the rainbow-colored apple in front of their building with a new logo - also an apple, but one done in the characteristic blue stripes of i.B.M. It might have been meant as a protest or merely as a joke. But it was certainly symbolic - Apple is changing its stripes.
 The agreement is only one piece, albeit the biggest, of a huge transformation that the personal computer pioneer is undertaking. Long content with being the BMW of the computer industry, suppying finely crafted machines to a relatively small number of fanatic customers, Apple now wants to become a Ford or Toyota, to move into the mainstream. 
 "The company has decided that it wants to be a major player in the computer industry in the 1990's instead of a niche player," said James R. Groff, managing director of Apple's enterprise systems division, in one of a series of interviews in which Apple executives laid out the reasons behind the seeming madness of consorting with a company that has long been considered Apple's polar opposite.
In search of new muscle and respect, Apple seems to be blasting off in contradictory directions, but the aims are clear: increase market share and survive in an industry going through the early stages of what is expected to be a massive consolidation.
On the one hand, Apple is trying to broaden its mass appeal with lower-priced computers and even pocket-sized devices that will be something of a cross between a computer and a Japanese electronic gadget. Rather than sitting on a desk top, the Apple computer of the future might fit in a pocket, transmit and receive messages by radio waves and respond to spoken commands.
At the same time -- and here is where the I.B.M. deal comes in -- Apple is trying to turn itself into a maker of more powerful computers that can fit together in complex networks capable of handling the computing tasks of corporate America. Instead of being a loner, Apple now wants to join the pack in the automated offices of the future.
 
Dedication to Software
 Apple is also determined to exploit its expertise in software and gain the higher profit margins and higher stock market valuation that come from being perceived as a software company.
Its strength is in the operating system software that makes the Macintosh easy to use, and in a joint venture with I.B.M., Apple plans to compete with Microsoft in selling such operating system software. Apple also hopes to build its Claris subsidiary, which sells word processors, spreadsheets and other applications programs, into a major vendor of software for other computers as well as Apple's.
But Apple will continue to sell hardware, though it might have more products made for it by other companies. In particular, the tiny portable devices are likely to be made by Japanese companies, with Apple contributing software and design.
The transformation will be painful. Already, Apple's profits have dipped because it lowered prices on its computers faster than it lowered its costs. This week, it is expected to report a drop in earnings for the June quarter, the third quarter in its fiscal year, even before a $100 million or so charge for layoffs and restructuring.
Nor is Apple assured of success. The agreement with I.B.M. and the plans for consumer electronics are only statements of intention. It still remains to be seen what products will emerge. And some say Apple, which has basically concentrated on only one product line at a time, is shooting off in too many different directions.
The first branch of the new effort requires a corporate culture like that of a Sony, a company able to quickly innovate, to miniaturize, to sell through mass marketers. The other requires a corporate culture like an I.B.M., with constant handholding of large customers. It is not clear that both those cultures can exist in the same company, especially one that now has neither.
And in trying to become either a Sony or an I.B.M., let alone both, Apple risks losing its own soul -- the quirky individuality that has made it innovative and has attracted some of Silicon Valley's brightest engineers.
Indeed, the I.B.M. announcement came on the heels of another development that has disillusioned many of Apple's workers -- the layoff of 900 people as Apple executives quickly, and some employees say heartlessly, reacted to shrinking profit margins that shouldn't have surprised them.
Apple has been known as a place at which employees were treated well, even pampered, with high salaries and California-like perks (bottled water in the lounges, for example). Now, the marching order is efficiency, and the perks are disappearing. "All the reasons to stay here have been going away," said one software engineer. "It's becoming just like any other company."
 
The Triumvirate
 The transition will also be a big test for John Sculley, Apple's chief executive, whose seven-year tenure has consisted, in one sense, of milking revenues from the Macintosh, a legacy of Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs, who left the company in 1985.
With the I.B.M. agreement, the curtain has lifted a bit on what is likely to come after Macintosh: machines that could leave a Sculley stamp on the company. Mr. Sculley, who calls himself the company's chief technical officer, is devoting his efforts to advanced product development, leaving day-to-day management to two lieutenants -- Michael H. Spindler, chief operating officer, and Joseph A. Graziano, chief financial officer.
So far, the ruling triumvirate has gotten mixed reviews. Some see a new sense of pragmatism, a willingness to join others rather than rely just on themselves.
"What Sculley and Spindler are trying to do is purge the prima donna attitude at Apple," said Reese Jones, president of Farallon Computing Inc., a maker of computer networking products.
Ed Colligan, general manager of Macintosh products for Radius Inc., a San Jose company that makes video products for computers, added: "I think Apple has turned into a much more aggressive company. To a certain extent, it rested on its laurels for a little too long."
But others say Apple still seems to be thrashing about, lurching from shakeup to shakeup and from strategy to strategy.
"They are still really zigging and zagging," said Esther Dyson, publisher of Release 1.0, an industry newsletter. "Things don't look very smooth."
Mr. Sculley has also attracted most of the heat for the recent layoffs, in part because he himself made $16 million from salary and exercising stock options last year. The troops gripe that someone raking in that much should have at least been able to see the need for expense reductions early enough to avoid sharp layoffs.
Mr. Sculley himself, recuperating from the I.B.M. negotiations, was on vacation last week and not available for interviews. But Mr. Graziano, the chief financial officer, said the company could not have reasonably predicted the quick drop in profit margins, which were partly necessitated by the recession.
As for zig-zagging, he said, "I think this was clearly true. I don't think that's true anymore."
Formulation of the new plan began about 18 months ago when "management came to the realization that the proposition that was driving the company was no longer valid," Mr. Graziano said. That proposition had been to sell nonstandard personal computers that commanded premium prices because they were easy to use, despite being somewhat slow.
But Apple's ability to charge high prices began to erode as other companies began to mimic the Macintosh screen display. Desktop computers known as work stations, from Sun Microsystems and others, offered greater speed through use of a technology called reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. And corporate computer buyers were beginning to demand that vendors adhere to standards so that desktops could be hooked together in networks to take on tasks once handled by larger computers.
Apple decided it needed to gain market share by lowering prices, to move to RISC and to conform to standards.
 
An Unfolding Strategy
 The first part of the strategy was unfolded last October, when Apple introduced three lower-priced machines, led by the $1,000 Macintosh Classic. Unit sales jumped 85 percent in the March quarter, compared to a year earlier. But profits dropped because of the lower gross margins on each machine and because sales of Apple's more expensive machines lagged.
Apple is expected to address some of those problems with a burst of new products. A sophisticated printer for desktop publishing is expected in August. In the fall, there will be a Classic using the advanced Motorola 68030 microprocessor instead of the simpler 68000 chip now used. There will also be two machines using Motorola's most advanced, 68040, chip, one of which can be used as a server, a data repository shared by several smaller machines. And there will be three notebook computers -- a hot area in which Apple has so far missed out -- including one made for it by Sony.
But many analysts think these machines will be among the last of the traditional Macintoshes built on Motorola 68000 series microprocessors. After that, Apple will move to RISC chips designed by I.B.M. and eventually toward new operating systems that Apple and I.B.M. together will try to make into a standard. The letter of intent signed with I.B.M. lays out, in essence, a three-pronged path for Apple.
One surprise is that Apple's first RISC computer will be the Macintosh itself, with the Macintosh operating system altered to run on the I.B.M.-designed RISC microprocessor. The idea is that existing Macintosh software will be able to run on the new machines with few or no changes.
With new horsepower from the RISC processor, "I'm absolutely confident on another five years of the Mac," said Roger J. Heinen, vice president and general manager of Macintosh software architecture. System 7, the current version of the Macintosh operating system, will continue to be improved, he said.
Apple will also introduce a line of desktop work stations and servers that run a version of the Unix operating system now used by I.B.M. But they will be fitted with the Macintosh screen display. Both I.B.M. and Apple will sell such machines, which will be able to run programs written for both the Macintosh and the I.B.M. RS/6000 workstation line.
Finally, Apple will move beyond the Macintosh completely with a new operating system, known by the code name Pink, which it is to co-develop with I.B.M. Pink is extremely ambitious. It is to be able to run on a variety of microprocessors and on computers large and small. Also, it is to be able to run programs written for other operating systems, such as the Macintosh and I.B.M.'s OS/2.
But Pink is not expected out for at least three years. Some skeptics say the only reason Apple is sharing Pink with I.B.M. is that it wants to spread its financial risks because the project has bogged down. Working with I.B.M., however, which has a poor track record in operating system software, could slow Apple further.
Even if no products were to come out of the I.B.M. relationship, Apple executives are hoping the endorsement of I.B.M. will help it sell to large corporations by convincing data processing managers that the Macintosh is not a toy, a perception that irks Apple executives no end.
"You can have the greatest products in the world and against that mythology you're not going to be successful," said Mr. Groff.
The outline of Apple's plans for consumer electronics is somewhat less clear, even to Apple itself.
One area of interest is interactive video, sometimes called multimedia. Apple had been exploring, but has now put on hold, a home entertainment system that would combine the innards of a Macintosh with a CD-ROM player, which could play video and sound and would have brought Apple into competition with the likes of Nintendo and Philips.
 
Working on Gadgets
 Apple is also working on a variety of pocket-sized devices to allow computing "anywhere, anytime." It has shown to developers a prototype of a computer that is operated by a stylus instead of a keyboard. Also in the works is a product known as the Mac Companion, a personal information keeper somewhat similar to the Sharp Wizard.
Apple, which spends about $600 million a year on research and development, has a wealth of technology in its laboratories. It is working aggressively on systems that can understand speech and on computers that can communicate by radio. What is unclear is whether Apple, which has been slow in bringing products to market, can get these technologies out faster, or offer better features, than many other companies also working on such devices.
Keeping its innovative edge while also blending in better with others is a tall order. But at stake is Apple's future as an independent company in a consolidating industry. It is in no danger today, but if it doesn't succeed in its transition, Apple could find by the end of the decade that its rainbow-colored logo really will be changed into blue stripes.
 
 
 
TWO WHO ARE FORMING THE STRATEGIES
 Apple's new strategies bear the imprint of two men who now share leadership of the company with John Sculley, the chief executive. They are Michael H. Spindler, chief operating officer, and Joseph A. Graziano, chief financial officer.
Mr. Spindler was named to his current post in January 1990, after having built Apple's European operations into a success. He runs day-to-day operations while Mr. Sculley spends time in Japan and in Apple's laboratories searching for the breakthroughs that will sustain Apple after the Macintosh.
A native of West Germany who joined Apple in 1980 after stints at the Intel Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation, Mr. Spindler, 48 years old, is a roll-up-the-sleeves manager who has worked fast to reorganize Apple and bring in new managers but has left the limelight to Mr. Sculley.
Respected but not loved at Apple, he is not possessed of the old-style Messianic Apple zeal and has pushed the company to collaborate with others and cut expenses. Mr. Spindler, currently on a six-week sabbatical, is expected to be the next chief executive, though it is not clear when that will be. Mr. Sculley, who is 52, is believed to want to stay a few more years.
Mr. Graziano, 47, left Apple in 1985, some say as a result of disagreements with other executives, and eventually became chief financial officer at rival Sun Microsystems. But in 1989, after regimes had changed at Apple, he was recruited back with a multimillion-dollar package more befitting for a baseball player than a corporate type. Distressed at what he saw as lethargy at Apple, Mr. Graziano has become an activist, urging Apple to try to realize more value from its software.
Executives say the top three men have a harmonious relationship, a sharp departure for a company known for widely publicized battles between Mr. Sculley and Apple's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, and more recently for the disharmony between two Sculley lieutenants who resigned last year -- Jean-Louis Gassee, the flamboyant product development chief, and Allan Loren, the gruff marketing and sales chief.
"A lot of the politics that used to be here have sort of been dispensed with," said Mr. Graziano.
Executives say that the new leadership structure has also led to more direction coming from the top, instead of from middle managers and technical people, as had been the case in the past. The alliance with I.B.M. was championed by Mr. Sculley and Mr. Spindler over the objections of many technical people. The recent layoffs were also ordered from the top.
To some, this is worrisome, a sign that a schism has developed between the chiefs and the rank and file. But an employee survey last year found that one of the great demoralizing factors at Apple was a lack of direction from above. And some executives, long fed up with Mr. Sculley's namby-pamby manner, welcome the stronger leadership.

The Dismantling of Pan Am 

For Pan American Airways, the nation's first international carrier, the sale last week of its routes to Europe, Africa and Asia to Delta Air Lines amounts to an orderly liquidation. "This is the end game," said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for Paine Webber. Unable to cope with deregulation, Pan Am filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 earlier this year but has been selling assets for a decade in a desperate effort to keep flying. If the deal is approved by the bankruptcy courts, Delta will have a bargain. For $260 million it will get the routes, Pan Am's Washington-New York shuttle and 45 planes, 21 of which are nearly new Airbus A-320's. And if everything goes smoothly, the deal is expected to be approved in 45 days. Pan Am will then get $60 million in cash from Delta. But analysts doubt $60 million is enough to keep the airline flying even through December. Delta has agreed to honor Pan Am's tickets through February 1992.
 
A Speculator Off the Hook
 
For John A. Mulheren Jr., the Wall Street speculator, last week brought a dramatic reversal of fortune. A Federal appeals court threw out Mr. Mulheren's conviction for conspiring to manipulate stocks with Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted stock swindler. Until the reversal, Mr. Mulheren was headed for 366 days in jail and had been fined $1.6 million. But the court said the Government's case was tainted by a major flaw: It had not presented any conclusive evidence that a crime had occurred. Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin, one of the three judges who heard the case, wrote that "we are convinced that no rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crimes charged here beyond a reasonable doubt." The ruling was the third reversal by the appeals court of cases that were based at least in part on information supplied by Mr. Boesky when he agreed to become a Government witness in 1986. Critics of the Government, like Ira Lee Sorkin, former head of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, contend that the reversals show prosecutors pursued these cases with more zeal than care.
 
Borland Barbarians
 
"We're true barbarians," said Philippe Kahn, the colorful chairman of Borland International Inc., the nation's No. 3 software publisher. What Mr. Kahn was referring to was Borland's decision to buy the Ashton-Tate Corporation last week for $439 million in stock and its willingness to take on all comers in the marketplace -- even the leading Microsoft Corporation. The acquisition will make Borland stronger, analysts say. It gets control of Ashton-Tate's best-selling database program, called dBase, which competes directly against Borland's Paradox program. According to Mr. Kahn, the match-up means the two companies will finally release versions of their software that can talk to each other. When that happens Borland can look to big sales of new releases of both products.
 
A Cleaner Fuel
 
Last week Arco announced it had developed a new gasoline blend that cuts some pollutants by as much as a third. The new gas, called EC-X, pollutes about as much as the methanol blend favored by the nation's farmers -- 85 percent corn-based methanol and 15 percent gasoline. But Arco's announcement comes with a catch. The new fuel, the company contends, is cheaper than the methanol blend but 15 to 20 percent more expensive to produce than conventional unleaded gas. As a result, Arco said it won't produce EC-X unless the Government tells it to. With 180 million vehicles on the road, cutting emissions by a third would certainly contribute to cleaner air. It would be especially helpful in Los Angeles, where Arco is based. "The whole process of looking at gasoline has undergone a renaissance," said Michael J. Bradley, an air pollution expert in Boston.
 
TRW and Big Brother
 
Ever wonder if all that information about you stored in the nation's databases is accurate? Six states are alleging in a lawsuit that not only is it sometimes inaccurate, but that the database run by TRW Inc., a credit bureau, is not just a database. "TRW is masquerading as a mere library of credit histories when in fact it is secretly rating the creditworthiness of consumers," said Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York. The states -- New York, California, Idaho, Michigan, Alabama and Texas -- are also alleging that TRW is selling confidential credit information on the 170 million names in its files, but not to you. The suit says TRW conceals its credit-rating information from individuals.
 
Mixed News
 
At first glance the news from CBS Inc. looked grim. Profits fell 63 percent in the second quarter because of the advertising slump, the network said. Earnings per share, however, were down only 38 percent because of a stock repurchase plan. And ratings for the network were up in the latest period. For the market, that was the important news. CBS stock climbed $1.25 and closed the week at $171.50.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Japanese-Style Justice
 
In Japan, justice is blind -- and easy. Nomura Securities admitted it provided $100 million in financing to help Susumu Ishii, a Japanese crime figure, manipulate stocks. Nomura also admitted to giving back $120 million that its biggest customers lost in the market. Yamaichi Securities, Nikko Securities and Daiwa Securities admitted similar wrongdoing. Penalties were announced last week. Four days of restricted business activity for the firms, said the Finance Ministry. The Ministry fined the companies a total of $116,000. (Nomura had $1.74 billion in pre-tax profits last year.) But perhaps the strangest element in last week's announcement was that the Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, is also fining himself. He is taking a 10 percent pay cut from July to September for failing to anticipate the scandals.
 
Illegal or Just Efficient

Are Japanese auto makers dumping mini-vans on the American market? Last week the United States International Trade Commission said there was sufficient evidence to begin an investigation. The charges were made initially by Detroit's Big Three, which said Toyota, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Nissan gained market share by selling mini-vans manufactured in Japan at up to 31 percent less than they should. The Japanese deny the charges. They are just more efficient producers, they explained. Though Chrysler remains the top seller, the Japanese share of the market has climbed to 12 percent this year, from 4 percent in 1988. If Dumping is proved, Japan's auto makers could be fined and their imports restricted.
 
Germany's Tough Stance
 
The Bush Administration has been pressuring Germany and Japan to lower their interest rates. Japan caved in and lowered its rates. But last week Germany's Bundesbank, ever defiant, said it would stand pat. The bank's council, led for the last time by Karl Otto Pohl, who is retiring as president, will keep its discount rate at 6.5 percent. That action, along with big dollar sales, pushed the dollar down to 1.78 marks from 1.8 marks earlier in the week.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Why Keep Greenspan Waiting?
 
When President Bush announced he would nominate Alan Greenspan to another four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, it was not unexpected. Most economists give Mr. Greenspan high marks, though they dicker over whether he could have prevented the recession. But with Mr. Greenspan's term ending Aug. 11, why did the Administration wait so long to make its move? Even though interest rates have been coming down since December, "the Administration wanted to exert pressure on Greenspan because it wants lower short-term rates," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities in Manhattan. Last week, Mr. Greenspan said the recession was over.
 
Free Airwaves
 
With cellular telephones, police radio and foul-mouthed D.J.'s, the nation's airwaves are crowded. So last week the House of Representatives voted unanimously to transfer at no cost large portions of the frequency spectrum from the Government to commercial users. The Bush Administration said it will veto the measure; it wants to sell the frequencies, not hand them out. According to the Commerce Department the frequencies the Government now controls may be worth $200 billion. House leaders think they can override a veto.
 
The Inflation Fighter
 
Mr. Greenspan has vowed to fight inflation. He cares even more about keeping prices stable than he does about growth, some economists say. But last week, there was evidence Mr. Greenspan may be winning the fight. The Producer Price Index, which charts inflation trends at the wholesale level, showed a decrease of 0.3 percent in June, according to the Labor Department. That is the third decline in three months and suggests that inflation, though not dead, may be on its knees.
 
A Flaccid Recovery
 
This recovery is no Arnold Schwarzenegger. Retail sales fell 0.2 percent in June, the third loss this year, according to the Commerce Department. "Growth will be positive," said Samuel D. Kahan, of Fuji Securities in Chicago, "but it won't be gangbusters."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Half Smiles on Flat Panels

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Last week's ruling by the Commerce Department on the dumping of flat-panel computer displays by Japanese manufacturers had something to please and disappoint nearly every interested party. James M. Hurd was no exception.
Mr. Hurd, the 42-year-old president and chief executive of Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., spearheaded the formation of the Advanced Display Manufacturers of America, a group of seven small manufacturers of flat panels that brought the dumping case. The panels are key components of laptop and notebook computers. The American group charged that Japanese manufacturers were selling the panels here at unfairly low prices. 
 The Commerce Department found that the Japanese were indeed dumping so-called active matrix displays, which are not widely used now but are expected to be in the future, and proposed a stiff 62.67 percent duty. But it spared passive matrix displays, the most common type for laptop computers today.
"We couldn't be more pleased" with the decision on active matrix displays, Mr. Hurd said, adding that Planar will now consider manufacturing those screens.
But levying the duty on only one type of display "goes against logic, common sense and reality, which makes you suspect there's been a degree of political influence on the process," he said.
Opposing Mr. Hurd and his group were American computer manufacturers, some of whom are his customers, and the Japanese screen manufacturers, some of whom are his suppliers. "It's an unfortunate situation because I'm certainly not making any friends in some of these larger companies," he said. Nevertheless, he added, "even the Japanese recognize that dumping is not a good way to develop their economic base."

HEADLINE: Midlantic's 'Credit Czar'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Hurt by heavy losses on delinquent loans, bankers are taking a hard look at the nuts and bolts of their lending business -- how to avoid making loans that turn bad, and how to spot problems quickly.
At the Midlantic Corporation, an Edison, N.J., banking company that lost $195 million last year, mostly from bad commercial real estate loans, the introspection led to the hiring of Alfred J. Schiavetti Jr. to fill the newly created job of chief credit officer. Mr. Schiavetti, 52, had been at Chemical Bank for 29 years, most recently as a managing director in the company's Realty Group. 
 Beginning this month, Mr. Schiavetti takes on the role of Midlantic "credit czar," a senior banker with enough experience to remember the tougher lending standards that in many cases were abandoned during the 1980's. It is a job that many banks are creating these days at the suggestion of Federal regulators.
"In an ideal world, a good banker strikes the right balance between making new loans that a bank needs to grow and making sure that the loans are high quality," Mr. Schiavetti said.
But in the real world, where many companies like Midlantic grew rapidly during the last decade by acquiring other banks, there is a need for someone to set and enforce lending standards, he added. "The lending officers need a system of checks and balances," he said, and guidance about when standards should be adjusted as the economy changes.
G. Charles Roy Jr., a managing director at D. E. Foster & Partners, an executive search firm, said that "in the past, credit officers may not have had as much clout within a bank as they should have, but now experienced people with good reputations can name their own price."
Other large banks that recently created positions for top credit officers include the Fleet Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., which hired Peter C. Fitts from Citibank, and the Shawmut National Corporation of Hartford, which hired a senior Federal bank examiner, Richard M. Kovarik.

HEADLINE: Moving the Pampers Faster Cuts Everyone's Costs

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
For decades, the Procter & Gamble Company was known as a tough bargainer -- occasionally even a bully -- in dealing with the stores that carry its products. But these days, the company is cited by marketing experts as a leading example of how packaged-goods and food manufacturers form partnerships with major retailers to slash costs in the pipeline that connects manufacturers to consumers.
The partnerships aim to cut inventories for both parties, smooth out production schedules and quickly identify service and quality problems. They are looking for the same kinds of benefits that automakers and other industrial companies have been reaping in recent years from "just-in-time" delivery arrangements with suppliers. 
 To achieve such gains, some consumer-goods companies and their retail customers have abandoned the traditional practice of meeting only through low-level sales representatives and buyers whose worlds revolve around this week's price margins and the size of the next order.
Today, companies like P.& G. and K Mart assign teams to deal with each other -- teams that mix data processing experts, who automate and harmonize order and record-keeping systems, with sales and purchasing representatives.
The companies' logistics managers share information that helps P.& G. avoid sudden spikes and dips in orders for, say, Pampers, and coordinate delivery schedules with K Mart's warehouses. Marketing and finance managers share both up-to-the-minute sales data on the latest promotions and long-range plans for coordinating P.& G.'s new product introductions with K Mart promotional campaigns.
"When we started looking at this, we saw a potential savings of $1 billion annually in the United States for P.& G. and just as much, if not more, for our customers," said Lawrence D. Milligan, the company's senior vice president in charge of sales. "But the elephants have to dance together to get there."
Consultants say that more often than not it is the product makers rather than the retailers who are reluctant to join in.
"Many consumer packaged-goods companies don't think of retailers as their customers," said Frederick Schneider, director for the food and consumer packaging consulting business of Andersen Consulting in Chicago. "They see them as impediments in getting to their customers."
And even companies that say they are committed to partnering sometimes find that it fails to live up to their expectations. It may require more executive attention than companies are willing to give. Or it may call for expensive investments in new computers and other data handling systems. Or fundamental conflicts may crop up over prices or the timing of new-product introductions.
Frequently, manufacturers and retailers compromise. They identify and discard areas where cooperation is feasible but not potentially profitable enough to justify the organizational changes or marketing risks they would require.
Even so, retailers and manufacturers alike say that the benefits are real and that the conflicts are easier to minimize when each side knows more about the other's operations and goals.
"This can only be described as a retailing revolution," said James Reider, a consumer products specialist with the consulting firm of Arthur D. Little Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.
The extent of the change shows up in P.& G.'s recruiting literature for new sales managers. The company woos college graduates with promises that they will be urged to "understand all facets of your customer's business, from the board room to the checkout lane."
Noting that sales managers are now teamed with other experts, P.& G. goes on to say that the recruit's success in handling such famous products as Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, Folgers coffee and Cover Girl cosmetics will be measured on their ability to obtain profits "for both the company and the customer."
Among the manufacturers, consultants say, the Kraft General Foods subsidiary of Philip Morris Inc. matches P.& G. in its commitment to the team strategy and outstrips it in working with store managers on local marketing programs.
Quaker Oats, Helene Curtis, General Mills, Frito-Lay (a subsidiary of Pepsico), Nabisco (a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco), Johnson & Johnson and Pepperidge Farms (a subsidiary of Campbell's) are all cited by consultants and retailers as active proponents of extensive partnering, although not all of them rely on multifunctional teams to the extent of P.& G. and Kraft.
Kraft set up almost 400 sales teams, starting in the upper Midwest in 1988, to pursue its goal of "micro-merchandising" -- that is, helping retailers sell more of everything, especially Kraft products, by using the growing mountains of data on consumer preferences to develop a detailed picture of each store's clientele, which products are selling best and which displays and promotions are apt to be most effective at that site.
Sometimes, Kraft sales teams even recommend that some of the company's own products be replaced with those of a competitor or with different categories of products.
One reason for the drive, according to Michael Blyth, the Kraft executive overseeing that company's partnering program, is the increasing challenge manufacturers face in reaching consumers directly. Trends such as the declining viewership of network television make it harder to develop brand loyalty and sales through national advertising.
Equally important, Mr. Blyth said, is that society has fragmented from the nuclear family of "Leave It to Beaver" into a number of distinctive consumer groups with different buying patterns and susceptability to brand names, discounts and other promotions. Electronic scanning systems give retailers the data they need to profit from such segmentation, but few are capable of fully exploiting that information without the cooperation and help of the big manufacturers.
The changing consumer market has been just one of the trends encouraging partnering. Globalization, for example, caused multinationals to question their traditional approaches. P.& G. executives were easily convinced that big improvements in efficiency were both possible and necessary after seeing that retailers in Japan frequently moved inventory through their stores 10 times as rapidly as their American counterparts.
Also, the emphasis on quality in manufacturing that spread through industry in the 1980's led to a thorough reconsideration of what goes into high-quality customer and supplier relationships in sales and purchasing departments. Total quality concepts dictate a focus not just on today's price margins, but on cash flow throughout a production system. Thus, P.& G. switched from seeking the lowest shipping price from among 250 trucking companies to ongoing relationships with 15 major ones, many of whom were made part of teams serving the most important customers.
Most of the projects seem mundane on their own. For example, P.& G. marketing experts found that K Mart was intent on building an image of environmental responsiveness. So they interested K Mart marketing managers in new refillable packaging for Downy fabric softeners. Those managers helped persuade K Mart purchasing managers to put aside their natural reluctance to place large orders for new products.
The resulting promotion sold a lot of Downy and met K Mart's strategic needs, according to Michael Ryan, director of P.& G.'s efforts to develop the K Mart partnership.
The combinations of improved information exchange and logistical adjustments has led to a wide variety of improvement in service to Wal-Mart. One example: the retailer's inventories of Tide have been cut to two days from 30.
In another case, Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. of East Bridgewater, Mass., worked with P.& G. to standardize the language and structure of electronic order processing systems. At first, P.& G. was able to electronically process only 10 percent of Shaw's computerized orders, according to David Jenkins, the supermarket chain's chief executive. Now, that figure is more than 90 percent, removing one of the many causes of delay and uncertainty that force retailers and suppliers to keep large inventories on hand. In addition, more error-free orders cleared the way for more electronic invoicing, leading to prompter payments and fewer disagreements about whether orders had been filled.
The cumulative effect of such partnering can be impressive. Ralph W. Drayer, P.& G.'s top logistics executive, figures the company is now capturing about half the annual $1 billion benefit it foresaw from partnering.
P.& G. said that cooperation has allowed it to automate replenishment of supplies for 12 retailers. In one case, the automation reduced the inventory of P.& G. products by 80 percent. For such retailers, each order is sold out so rapidly that they have re-ordered and are piling up cash from those re-orders by the time the 10-day period for paying P.& G. is up. That cash cushion allows them to operate without borrowing a dime to finance inventories of P.& G. products.
Now, P.& G. is aiming for further gains by paring back promotion practices like manufacturer's discounts, which consumers see in the form of, say, "30 cents off" labels.
The retailer gets all, or most, of the discount and the plans become costly to manufacturers when retailers suddenly -- whether planning to divert supplies to regions where the discount isn't being offered or because they want to build up low-cost inventory -- order unexpectedly large amounts.
Such forward buying and diversion creates production spikes at P.& G.'s factories, often followed by periods of lower than normal demand. At the same time, according to P.& G., retailers often fail to take full account of the warehousing and accounting expenses involved, leading them to underestimate the disruptive impact of such deals on cash flow.
"Historically, it was a question of how do I transfer as much of my cost as possible to the retailers and they were asking the same about us," explained Thomas Muccio, the P.& G. vice president who oversees the company's relations with Wal-Mart. "No one understood how much their moves were costing others."
 
 
 
PARTNERING THAT TOUCHED A NERVE

Perhaps the best-known example of partnering is P.& G.'s relationship with Wal-Mart, the rapidly growing discount chain that last year passed Sears, Roebuck to become the nation's largest retailer.
The partnership with its biggest customer, P.& G.'s first in the United States, began in 1988. Wal-Mart demonstrated its interest by sending a group of executives to a P.& G. quality seminar in Cincinnati. P.& G. then highlighted its commitment by moving a squad of executives to Fayetteville, Ark., a short drive from Wal-Mart's Bentonville headquarters.
One unexpected side effect was suspicion. Other major customers worried that Wal-Mart was getting special deals or other forms of favored treatment. Some smaller retailers complained that P.& G. was slow to respond to their requests for partnering.
Now, senior P.& G. managers are quick to note that the company has more than 120 teams assigned to different domestic customers. They also point out that other customers now are tied even closer to P.& G. in some respects -- with cash register scanners linked directly to P.& G., for example, so that P.& G. can automatically replenish stock as it is sold.
 When they discuss Wal-Mart, P.& G. executives stress that Sam Walton, the retailer's visionary chief executive, has pursued similar relationships with all of Wal-Mart's major suppliers. "We didn't go to Wal-mart," said Ralph W. Drayer, general product supply manager in P.& G.'s customer services group. "They came to us and said there's a better way to do things."
In fact, P.& G. executives say, special offices to serve other major customers would have been opened if other customers had been based so far from P.& G.
"Partnership is the commonly used word but it's bad," said Lawrence D. Milligan, P.& G.'s senior sales executive and chief worrier about how partnerings are perceived. "It implies preferred relationships, which are illegal under the antitrust laws."

HEADLINE: All About/Candy Makers;
America's Chocoholics: A Built-In Market for Confectioners

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Even Willy Wonka, the mythical chocolate maker in the Roald Dahl novel, would be impressed by the size of the American candy industry. It is an $8.7 billion business that is highly concentrated. Two giants -- the Hershey Foods Corporation, in Hershey, Pa., and the privately held M&M/Mars of Hackettstown, N.J. -- together have nearly 70 percent of the market.
The candy business is virtually immune to the ups and downs of the business cycle. And this year, when the price of the average candy bar sold in a vending machine went from 55 cents to 60 cents -- the first increase since 1986 -- sales remained steady. 
 "Candy is about as recession-proof as a business gets," said Kurt A. Feuerman, a confectionery analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. "You might forget a car purchase, or you may not buy that T-bone steak, but you won't defer your chocolate bar," he said.
Americans certainly are not deferring their candy purchases. According to the National Confectioners Association in McLean, Va., Americans consumed 20.7 pounds each of all kinds of candy in 1990. Chocolate is their favorite, by far. Last year, Americans ate 2.6 billion pounds of it -- about 11 pounds per person.
"What is very interesting about this industry is that it has been growing, even though there is a perception that because everyone is health conscious, it would decline," said Nomi Ghez, a confectionery analyst at Goldman Sachs, New York. "The market is growing at a rate of 2.5 percent, which is faster than population growth," she said.

 
 
The Kings of Candy
Mars and Hershey Fight It Out
 For decades Mars and Hershey have been slugging it out at the top. Both companies had about the same share of the candy market until 1988, when Hershey bought the American operations of Britain's Cadbury Schweppes for about $300 million.
As a result of the acquisition, Hershey pulled slightly ahead of Mars. Hershey now has about 36 percent of the market versus Mars's 35 percent. Last year Hershey had $2.7 billion in sales. It is projecting an increase to $2.9 billion this year -- further evidence that candy is a recession-proof business. And profits are also up. Last year profits were $195 million. And this year they are expected to increase to $220 million.
Mars, which is the nation's No. 2 candy maker, is privately held and does not disclose its sales figures.
The third-largest candy maker is Nestle, with 10 percent of the market. Nestle, which is the American unit of the Swiss chocolate and dairy-food company, has $7 billion in American sales but does not break out its candy sales separately.
Candy bars -- a broad category that includes almost all individually packaged confections -- are by far the best-selling type of candy.
According to Jerry Prescott, president of Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Distributor Concepts, a consultant to candy distributors, the bar segment of the market accounts for about 40 percent of retail sales. Loosely packed bags of candy are next with about 35 percent of the market. Mints and hard roll candies -- another separate segment -- make up about 8 percent of the market. Bulk candies, which include candy sold by the scoop, account for 5 percent of sales. Local retail brands and seasonal candies make up the remaining 10 to 12 percent of sales.
In the bar category, the Snickers bar, an M&M/Mars product, is the biggest seller. It is followed by Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, made by Hershey. Then comes M&M's Peanut Chocolate Candy and Kit Kat bars, made by Hershey. Trailing this group are the Butterfinger and Baby Ruth bars, both made by Nestle.
Snickers has been No. 1 since the beginning of time, according to analysts, or at least since the the early 70's. "The world could come to an end, and those leading candy bars will still hold their positions," said Mr. Feuerman.
The chances of a new candy bar beating the No. 1 Snickers -- or even Baby Ruth -- is about as far-fetched as an amateur knocking out Mike Tyson. Even so, companies continually bring out new products hoping to win market share.
One new entry, coming this summer, is from Dove Bar International, an ice cream maker that is a unit of M&M/Mars. Dove Bar is test-marketing a new premium candy bar that features the thick, dark chocolate the company uses on its ice cream bars.
The new candy is being test marketed in New England and Chicago and -- if successful -- will be sold nationally shortly after. But even with M&M/Mars behind it, the new candy is expected to become a niche player at best.
Still, in an $8.7 billion market, not all niches are small. "If you look at the size of the market, the 10 percent made up of small and medium-sized companies is still pretty good," said Patricia Magee, publisher of Candy Industry, a trade journal.
For example, she said: "Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. does wonderfully. They outdo their sales each quarter." Last year Tootsie Roll had revenues of $179.3 million.

 
 
The Older Market
Grown-Ups Like Toffee and Nuts
 Candy makers know that they have the kids, the most voracious consumers of candy in the country. But to grow further, they are aiming most of the new products at older, more affluent consumers.
"The bar category has had to adjust to a new population profile," said Richard T. O'Connell, president of the National Confectioners Association and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, also in McLean, Va. "We've gone to variety in the size of bars, and companies will have to compete on that level," he said.
According to Mr. O'Connell, bite-sized candies, once languishing, are on the comeback trail. The reason is that smaller portions appeal to dieters and to parents who think their children should eat fewer sweets. Into this growing segment, Mars recently introduced bags of bite-sized Milky Way bars.
Candy with nuts has increased greatly in popularity over the last three years. "Nuts in chocolate, toffee and peanut butter are very big because there is a perceived wholesomeness there," said Joan Steuer, president of Chocolate Marketing Inc., a Los Angeles-based firm specializing in product development. "There is the idea that there is more protein and nutrition."

 
 
The Sticky Health Issue
Persuading Parents Sweets Won't Hurt
 Health is an issue that has continually vexed the candy makers. The industry contends that its negative image is unjustified. "We now know that chocolate does not cause acne or hyperactivity," said Mr. O'Connell. The Chocolate Manufacturers Association cites a number of studies from various sources to support its claim that candy is not damaging to health. But Mr. O'Connell admits getting this message across has been difficult.
In New York, industry lobbyists are now supporting legislation that will overturn a 1987 law that prohibits selling candy to children in public schools before lunch.
The measure, described by its sponsors as "the promotion of healthy, nutritious dairy products," is presently on the summer legislative calendar, where it may likely sit until recess.
Activists like Victoria Leonard, the director of the children's nutrition program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in Washington, oppose the bill. "Every bar a child eats in school will replace a healthy meal they could have had in the lunch room," she said. The center is also keeping an eye on the health claims made by the industry.
Tough new rules set earlier this month by the Food and Drug Administration governing the labeling of juice have also caused concern among some candy makers. But even if candy makers have to own up to their sugar content on their wrappers, it is not likely that the overall growth rate of the industry will be hurt.
"Candy does well because people see it as an affordable indulgence," said Ms. Steuer of Chocolate Marketing. "It's the ultimate feel-good food."
 
 
MAKING A LOW-FAT CHOCOLATE
 Americans, whose passion for fatty foods is sadly incongruent with their battle with cellulite, are beginning to embrace fat substitutes as the solution to their dieting dilemmas. But will they tolerate them in candy?
The Proctor & Gamble Company recently asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve a low-calorie fat substitute called caprenin, which has characteristics of cocoa butter and could be used in confectionery products.
But not all analysts are as enthusiastic about the new ingredient as Procter & Gamble is. "This is not something that confectioners will jump on right away," said Patricia Magee, publisher of Candy Industry, a trade journal. "There is an emphasis on low fat, but these days people feel healthy and reward themselves with chocolate. They will never move away from traditional products."
Joan Steuer, president of Chocolate Marketing Inc., a consulting firm in Los Angeles, also warned that caprenin will have to taste great. "Based on random conversations with consumers as well as retailers, I found there is very little demand for a lower-fat chocolate," she said.
But if it can pass the taste test, caprenin may help the candy makers. "Fake fat has been driving big growth in other categories, yet not really in confections," said Kurt Feuerman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. "But if they build a better widget, it could drive growth."
M&M/Mars and Hershey, the industry leaders, have yet to comment about the ingredient publicly. But Mr. Feuerman said, "If it is a tradition that is for real, Mars and Hershey will be there."

The Stylishness of Latin America

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
Latin America is in; Europe is out. That is the message sent by single-country closed-end funds in the first half of 1991.
The biggest winner in this volatile category was the Brazil Fund, whose share price more than doubled even as the premium to its underlying assets shrank. The Latin America Fund was up 69.8 percent, and the Emerging Mexico Fund rose 62.6 percent. 
 The funds with the largest drops, and widening discounts to underlying assets, were European. But the European results defied predictions last year by many market observers who had expected a rise because of the Soviet Union's economic restructuring, the reunification of Germany and the dismantling of trade barriers by the end of 1992. Investors, it seems, saw it otherwise.
Indeed, prices have fallen so far that "it's time to be accumulating shares in European funds," said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based investment adviser.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
An Appetite for Banking Stocks

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Out of crisis comes opportunity, the proverb says. In the United States, savings and loan associations are enmeshed in a crisis; the banking and insurance industries are struggling. In Japan, Britain and Switzerland, banks have also been battered.
Hoping to prosper from all this is the Global Value Fund, a new mutual fund sponsored by Venture Advisers in Santa Fe, N.M., which invests mainly in banks, savings and loans, insurers and financial services companies worldwide. 
 Because of the bad news in the banking industry lately, the fund "is a tough sell," said John Rekenthaler, senior analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. "But over the long term, there's a chance to make some pretty good money in this."
The $3 million Global Value Fund was set up in May, but its manager, Shelby M. C. Davis, is hardly a neophyte. Mr. Davis, 54 years old, has managed the $400 million New York Venture Fund since its inception in 1969. New York Venture placed 15th among the 3,000-plus funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J., for the decade that ended on June 30. Its annualized return was 16.9 percent, Lipper says.
 The new fund grew out of Mr. Davis's interest in financial services stocks, which play a prominent role in New York Venture -- now, about 25 to 30 percent of its portfolio.
At the end of 1990, financial services stocks dropped precipitously. That led Mr. Davis to think that the strong companies in the industry would ultimately "be able to enlarge their market share by acquiring weaker players or because some competitors would go out of business," he said.
Meanwhile, financial services stocks are selling at bargain prices, he says. Many stocks trade at price-earnings ratios that are about one-third less than the market average; others sell below book value. The battered stocks include some very strong companies tarred with the same brush as weaker concerns. He thinks that a number of them will enjoy a doubling of earnings, a 50 percent expansion of price-earnings ratios and a tripling in stock prices by the end of the decade.
At least through the mid-90's, Mr. Davis expects a benign period for interest rates like the 1960's, when 30-year Treasury-bond were steady at 6 to 8 percent. It was the double-digit interest rates of the 1970's and the sharp spikes and drops in rates since then that compounded the industry's troubles, he said.
After a consolidation of the financial services industry in the middle of the decade, Mr. Davis expects steady growth. Surviving companies will post annual earnings gains in the 10 to 15 percent range, he said, and if all falls into place, "financial services stocks will regain the respect they had in the 1960's."
 The restructuring of financial services in the United States is beginning to pay off -- the group jumped 29 percent in the first half, placing first among the 19 stock-fund categories tracked by Lipper. But the road to health will probably be bumpy. As a result, investors should expect to hold their shares for the long term, at least 10 years, Mr. Davis says, and take advantage of short-term setbacks in the industry to add to their holdings.
 Right now, the fund has 60 percent of its stock portfolio in banks and savings and loans and the balance in insurance companies. Mr. Davis says brokerage stocks soared too high in the new issues boom in the first quarter, and he is waiting for prices to drop. About 90 percent of the stock portfolio is in domestic issues because "there's such a candy store of value in the U.S.," he said.
Because the fund is so young and money is still flowing in, a large chunk is in cash. But Mr. Davis says he is buying stocks every day, at what he considers fire-sale prices.
Among the top-tier banks and savings and loans, he says, the "cream has already risen to the top," but he expects strong long-term growth from some of his favorites: Banc One in Columbus, Ohio; Republic New York; State Street Boston; Wachovia in North Carolina, and Golden West Financial in Oakland.
Among bank stocks that "are potentially exciting, but riskier," he especially likes Bank of Boston. The bank is ahead of schedule for working out bad loans, and Mr. Davis sees the Northeast as a "chief crisis opportunity, like Texas five years ago." Another favorite: United New Mexico Financial, the largest banking company in that state.
Among the top-tier insurers, Mr. Davis favors American International Group, a global insurance company with a large chunk of earnings from overseas, and Chubb, a specialty insurer based in Warren, N.J., that insures half of the chief executives of the Fortune 500 companies, Mr. Davis said.
As for companies with middling ratings, he likes two regional auto insurance companies in California. Mercury General, based in Los Angeles, and 20th Century Industries in Woodland Hills are both "good, low-cost operators in a tough regulatory state," he said.
In the bottom tier, Mr. Davis cites Broad Inc. in Los Angeles, which is acquiring companies with "junk bond" components. Another favorite: MBIA Inc. of Armonk, N.Y., an insurer of municipal bonds.

HEADLINE: Flying Eye Hospital Uses Tact to Reach Cuba

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
Stepping briskly from his sleek white DC-8 aircraft, Oliver Foot, director of Project Orbis, the flying eye hospital, immediately sought to put a receiving line of Cuban doctors and Government officials at ease.
Bringing relieved smiles to the faces of his hosts, Mr. Foot told them, "We are coming to Cuba to share knowledge and to learn from each other so that what we learn can be disseminated around the world." 
 Although in their travels Orbis doctors often emphasize that they learn even as they teach, for an increasingly isolated Cuba the remarks were seen as a vital statement of mutual respect without which the rare humanitarian mission would have risked a sputtering start.
Cuba's universal health care system, whose quality in many ways rivals that of more highly industrialized countries, remains one of the proudest hallmarks of a Communist system that is locked in an economic decline.
For Orbis, negotiating such Cuban sensitivities was merely one of a host of challenges in a three-week mission beginning in mid-June that broke modest new ground in bilateral ties while serving as a reminder of the frosty diplomatic and political void that has kept Cuba at least at arm's length from the United States.
"We were in China just after Tiananmen Square, and the Soviet Union well before glasnost, but this was arguably the hardest trip of all for us to pull off," said Mr. Foot, who has helped organize visits to some 60 countries since joining the eye foundation in 1982.
Because of the United States' 30-year economic embargo of Cuba, and an equally long tradition of mutual ideological hostility, exchanges between the two countries have long been largely limited to family visits and occasional study trips by academics.Because it is a nonprofit medical charity that is broadly international in its membership and fund raising, Orbis had hoped it would have little trouble breeching the gulf between the two countries.
But as the tentatively scheduled date for the visit approached, frosty Cuban-American realities quickly began to encroach on the foundation's plans. Although Cuban eye specialists had long agreed on the desirability of a visit by the flying hospital, a Government invitation failed to materialize, perhaps another reflection of Havana's reluctance to be seen as wanting in health.
To expedite things, Mr. Foot enlisted the help of the former Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who personally reached President Fidel Castro to promote the visit.
With the Cuban invitation in hand, Mr. Foot said he called the State Department a month before the departure date to make a routine inquiry into travel security in Cuba and was told "security is fine, but Treasury regulations won't allow you to go."
 
Positive Aspects Highlighted

The next month was spent wrangling with the Treasury Department, which, citing the potential monetary value of medical techniques, declined to give it a special exemption from the ban on economic exchanges with Havana.
Finally, with quiet support from the State Department and a pledge to spend only monies raised by the foundation's offices in London and Hong Kong, the trip was approved.
Once on the ground, Orbis doctors, perhaps sensing the delicacy of the situation, repeatedly highlighted the positive aspects of Cuban care, even as they privately noted some of its deficiencies.
"The cases presented to me would have been difficult ones in any clinic in the world," said Dr. Forrest Ellis, a pediatric ophthalmologist from the University of Indiana, after surgically correcting an eye muscle in a 6-year-old girl that his Cuban counterparts thought was congenitally absent.
Cuban health-care professionals, who worked side by side with their American counterparts, seemed delighted by the exchange.
"Who cares who is the most sophisticated or the most advanced," said Anna Remon, a 40-year-old ophthalmological nurse who assisted in Dr. Ellis's operation. "Our cooperation seems to have helped this little girl, and that is what matters."

HEADLINE: Name That Tune

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Dancing to the Wrong Tune in Europe" (Forum, June 23), Milton Ezrati takes a shortsighted negative stance on monetary union. Germany has adopted a tight-monetary/loose-fiscal balance to address domestic needs. Does Mr. Ezrati suggest a recipe of spiraling inflation and currency depreciation for Germany, a loose-monetary and loose-fiscal policy? 
 The gloom-and-doom attitude for Europe is not justified. European countries are not being "killed" by Germany's tight monetary policy. They are not aggressively expanding their fiscal policies; nor are they willing to accept currency devaluation. They are committed to maintaining stability. The Bundesbank is cognizant of the European situation and may be willing to target slightly higher inflation to prevent future rate hikes. Eventually, rates will unwind, along with the economic cycle.
European Monetary System countries are adjusting to future competition by increasing productivity and decreasing inflation. Monetary union will also reduce currency transaction costs for intra-European trade. Europe is already dancing to the right tune.

HEADLINE: Investments and Nuclear Trusts

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"First-Generation Nuclear Retirement" (Forum, June 2) misstates the real issue regarding attempts to liberalize the investment restriction on funds set aside to cover future costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants. Vermont Yankee's request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permission to invest in common stocks suggests good business sense, not a departure from "pension grade" investments. 
 There are good reasons to be conservative with decommissioning funds collected from ratepayers. Future costs are difficult to project and whatever is collected today should be prudently invested. But restrictions on investments made by nuclear decommissioning trusts are extremely cautious regarding credit quality. Most of the $3 billion of assets in such funds are invested in conservative investments like United States Treasury securities.
To provide diversification and protection against inflation, it makes sense to allow part of these funds to invest in common stocks and other investments. There are no simplistic answers to complex investment challenges and no substitutes for experience and expertise in portfolio management. Especially with decommissioning funds that must be adequate some 20 to 30 years in the future, we can ill afford investment advice from amateurs.

HEADLINE: The Magnanimous 7?

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 13

 BODY:
In some ways, the gathering of the leaders of the seven iggest industrial democracies starting here Monday shows how little the nations' leaders accomplished in Houston one year ago, when they last met to deal with some of the world's most acute economic problems.
 Now, as then, the seven are divided about whether they should give large amounts of aid to help the Soviet Union replace Communism with a market economy, with Germany, Italy, and France in favor, and Japan, the United States, Britain and Canada saying the Soviets have not yet shown they really mean to make the shift. 
 Now, as then, the Soviet Government and the legislature are debating sweeping reform plans to replace the crumbling edifice of state planning before the political forces of separatism throw the country into chaos.
And despite their pledge last year to get the latest round of negotiations on a global trade and tariff agreement completed by 1990, the talks failed in Brussels last December. The issue then was disagreements between the United States and the European Community, the eighth participant in these "economic summits," over agricultural subsidies, which are still unresolved.
But in other ways, the world has changed in important senses since last July. Most important, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has managed, after two years of knocking at the door, to get an invitation to come tell the seven in person next Wednesday just what kind of economic change he does have in mind.
 
Mood in Soviet Union
 And though a 23-page letter he has sent to the summit participants is short on specifics, the political mood and balance of forces inside the Soviet Union now are very different from what they were only six months ago.
Last fall, ambitious plans to bring a market economy to the Soviet Union within 500 days, only one of several such schemes, were defeated by the forces of Communist conservatism. On the ascendant until early this year, they have since been weakened by Boris N. Yeltsin's popular election as President of the Russian federated republic, on a platform of privatization and private ownership.
Mr. Yeltsin is among the leaders of 9 of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics who have agreed to the outlines of a new, looser treaty of federation that could make Mr. Gorbachev's plans for change more convincing to Western leaders, if the message he presents to them is that this time, it is for real.
But the war against Iraq, which invaded Kuwait soon after the Houston summit distracted the world's attention from the Soviet Union and the trade negotiations, has also changed the political climate since last July, demonstrating both the possibilities and the limitations of cooperation in the post-cold-war era.
This year's "economic summit" is the 17th in a line of gatherings originally intended to be fireside chats where the leaders who run the world could shoo the bureaucrats out of the way and get down to the nitty-gritty.
 
Swarms of Officials
 Instead, the meetings have swollen to behemoth size, with swarms of major and minor officials, fleets of helicopters darkening the skies, and motorcades tying the host city in knots for days, a process that began today with the arrival of the Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, and his party from a meeting with President Bush in Kennebunkport, Me. Mr. Bush is scheduled to arrive Sunday evening.
Their British host, Prime Minister John Major, wants the summit meeting this year to strengthen the new international order that followed the end of the cold war and allowed the United States and the Soviet Union to join United Nations-backed sanctions against Iraq.
But on the issue of aid to the Soviet economy, the expense of the gulf war, the persistent recession in most of the summit nations, and the high costs of unification in Germany all make it unlikely that Mr. Gorbachev will come out of this meeting with much cash no matter what he tells the others.
Mr. Gorbachev apparently did not ask for cash in his letter. A senior Western official said he invited private Western investment to help convert Soviet military plants to civilian purposes -- $10 to $20 billion worth, British officials say -- but apparently leaves it unclear whether these companies would become privately owned.
He also appealed to the West to supply commodities and consumer goods, possibly as grants, to prevent runaway inflation when the Soviets decontrol prices next year, another official said.
Though the letter itself has not been published, it did not materially change the prospects for an uneasy consensus at the summit that, though the industrial democracies want to encourage the Soviet moves, they do not believe they justify large amounts of aid now.
 
'150 Tons of Gold'
 "They may also ask to reschedule their foreign debt," estimated at $65 billion to $70 billion, a Japanese official said. "But what about their 150 tons of gold? This is not a country where people are starving to death."
This is also the United States view now, as it was a year ago in Houston. Until the Soviet Union begins the process of privatization, the United States and its allies are saying, large sums of money would go down the drain. What the summit meeting will most likely do, officials involved in the preparations say, is simply pick up cautiously where last year's meeting left off.
Last July, the participants asked the International Monetary Fund and other international financial organizations for recommendations. In December, these institutions recommended intermediate membership for the Soviet Union, to enable it to benefit from technical advice and expertise.
Some form of special association with the I.M.F. is likely to be offered by the seven when Mr. Gorbachev meets them Wednesday afternoon. In the long run, officials here say, a successful outcome of the international trade negotiations would do more to help the Soviet Union, along with everybody else.
Mr. Major said, a couple of days ago: "The impact if the Uruguay Round failed would be very serious, in the implication that it would lead people toward all sorts of artificial trade barriers, protectionism, and a trade war. We need a specific commitment of the heads of government, if necessary, to make sure that there is a sufficient degree of political clout to make sure that the Uruguay Round does proceed."
With the United States and Europe still bickering over agricultural subsidies, and European countries still arguing about whose farmers would be worst affected if the European Community's expensive price subsidies are removed, the outlook for that seems almost as cloudy as the prospects of quick Soviet economic reform.

Almost three years after President Bush declared a war on drugs, the blossoming of the Cali cartel in Colombia is only one development that challenges Administration claims that major progress is being made.
Government studies indicate that casual use of cocaine and marijuana is declining, particularly among the affluent, the middle class and students. But critics in Congress say the Administration's statistics are not persuasive, and officials concede that progress is far slower among the homeless, blacks and other minorities. Skeptics point to a rise in drug-related crime and in the number of deaths linked to use of heroin or cocaine. 
 "I think we are winning a lot of individual battles," said Bob Martinez, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "But there are a number of areas of great concern."
 
More Heroin Arriving
 Some Administration officials say they are bracing for a new wave of heroin addiction, with heroin possibly replacing crack as the drug of choice in urban ghettoes by the end of the decade. The United States Customs Service said it seized nearly 1,500 pounds of heroin last year, more than double the amount for 1986, suggesting an improvement in enforcement but also a larger volume of traffic.
Cocaine and marijuana producers are facing stiffer opposition from a number of Latin American governments, but opium and heroin manufacturers in much of Asia meet with little official interference. While cocaine trafficking through the Caribbean and Miami has been reduced somewhat by by tighter American enforcement, the Latin American traffickers have adjusted by moving more cocaine through Panama and Central America.
Melvyn Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, told a Congressional panel on Wednesday that there "are real signs of progress" in the anti-drug effort pursued in conjunction with Andean nations, the primary source of cocaine consumed by Americans. But he warned that the Peruvian program was "hampered by a collapsed economy, anarchy, wanton terrorism and widespread corruption."
In Bolivia, he said, "Government corruption continues to compromise counternarcotics operations," impeding economic programs designed to steer peasants away from growing coca leaf and find new sources of income for them.
 
Like 'Squeezing a Balloon'
 Efforts to reduce drug cultivation and trafficking are like "squeezing a balloon," Mr. Martinez said. While Colombia is making strides in shutting down sites for cocaine production, for example, "laboratories are springing up in Bolivia and Brazil," he said.
Mr. Martinez had praise for Mexico's efforts to limit the flow of drugs through its territory, but said that traffickers are now refueling in Guatemala and Belize instead.
Since President Bush announced his national strategy for drug control in January 1990, federal spending to combat trafficking and abuse has jumped from $6.3 billion in 1989 to $9.5 billion in 1990 to an estimated $10.4 billion in the current fiscal year. "I am more and more convinced that we will win this war," he declared recently.
Mr. Martinez said the Administration's efforts were beginning to make a dent in the problem. He pointed to a recent report indicating that Americans spent about $40.4 billion on drugs last year, down from $49.8 billion in 1989. The number of Americans who use illegal drugs has also dropped, to 12.9 million last year from 23 million in 1985.
 
Critics Distrust the Figures
 Congressional critics say that such figures are highly unreliable.
"I don't know of any successes," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, the chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse. "They say there are less high school seniors on drugs, but in my community if you have made it to be high school senior, you are already a success. It's the dropouts we have to be concerned about."
He said the Administration had failed to come up with effective programs to teach children about drugs, or new treatment techniques that could be suggested to state governments.

Early Line on Bottom Line
In the first test of the relative strength of New York's four prospective Democratic candidates for the United States Senate, the least-known, Representative Robert J. Mrazek of Suffolk County, has emerged as a viable fund-raiser, the prerequisite for any high-level candidacy. 
 Mr. Mrazek raised almost as much as Robert Abrams, the veteran State Attorney General, and has considerably more cash on hand than does Mr. Abrams, traditionally a big campaign spender. Two other well-known Democrats, New York City's Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Queens Representative and vice presidential candidate, are also seeking to challenge the Republican incumbent, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, next year. Both trailed in the dollar derby.
The candidates' finance reports for the six months ending on June 30 are due in two weeks, but their vital statistics were disclosed by the candidates and their handlers.
Mr. Abrams has raised at least $700,000 for his Senate campaign and $250,000 to pay off loans left from his campaign for attorney general last year. But his direct-mail fund-raising has been expensive, so he has about $400,000 in his treasury. Mr. Abrams also has the advantage of five previous statewide campaigns and a high-visibility office. He has been generating favorable news releases on his official activities, including campaigns against industrial polluters and insurance companies that failed to issue rebates to motorists who install safety features like air bags.
Mr. Mrazek said he had about $800,000 on hand after raising $700,000 and transferring $350,000 from a House campaign account. He has spent about $230,000. He has used a professional fund-raiser and a cadre of heavy-hitter constituent fund-raisers from his wealthy district on the North Shore of Long Island.
Ms. Holtzman has raised close to $550,000 and has spent about $100,000, but this money has been raised under very liberal state contribution limits. The Comptroller, the only candidate of the four not to have formally announced, is just getting around to setting up a campaign committee under Federal election law, which imposes stricter limits on contributions.
Ms. Ferraro has raised about $500,000, largely through a costly telephone fund-raising program that has eaten up all but about $100,000 of the money raised.
 
Off the Pace

The incumbent, Senator D'Amato, has been one of the Senate's champion fund-raisers, passing the basket continuously throughout his six-year term. He has about $3 million in his campaign kitty, but that is considerably less than the nearly $5 million he had at this point in the campaign six years ago. Then, his treasury helped to scare off Mr. Abrams, Ms. Holtzman and Ms. Ferraro as challengers.
The recession, which has made fund-raising difficult for most candidates, and an investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee have taken their toll on Mr. D'Amato's fund-raising. The committee is investigating whether the Senator improperly helped contributors win Federal contracts.
 
 Big Spenders Welcome

A year from yesterday, the Democratic National Convention will arrive in New York City, bringing a boom in hotel guests, delegates, gawkers and hawkers.
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, awash in red ink, layoffs and other fiscal horrors, took advantage of the one-year-to-go point to announce at a news conference that he was increasing his estimate of "economic activity" from the convention to $300 million from $100 million. He said that the larger figure came from a new city study of the convention and its economic ramifications.
But all that spending and the jobs that will be created will produce a far more modest return in direct tax revenues to the city: an estimated $27 million, city officials said. Even if accurate, that is just $6 million more than the city plans to lay out for police protection, insurance and preparing and renting Madison Square Garden for the big event.
But the Mayor brushed off that fiscal reality. "That's not an expenditure, mind you, but an investment -- an investment, in fact, that has great returns," he said.
 
 Timing Is the Key

One of the better patronage plums in Queens is about to become available. After 20 years, Surrogate Louis D. Laurino is retiring, effective Aug. 3. The date is significant because it is too late for a primary, so the Democratic candidate chosen by Representative Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader, will not have a primary challenge and presumably only token Republican opposition in the general election.
The leading contenders, Mr. Manton said, are Justices Joseph G. Golia and Robert L. Nahman of State Supreme Court, Rocco M. Longo, counsel to the Queens public administrator, and Michael Feigenbaum, a former counsel. "I always lean to a sitting judge," Mr. Manton said. He did not specify which one.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo could appoint an interim surrogate, but will apparently pass because so little time is left before the election and because the State Senate, which would have to confirm an interim appointee, is out of session -- at long last.
The surrogate, who makes $95,000 a year, presides over the probating of wills and estates and often appoints lawyers to represent parties in such cases.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Deficit Up, But in '91 The Furor Has Passed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
This time last year the budget was front- page news. President Bush and Congress were deadlocked in negotiations that had been going on for months. When Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, submitted his annual midyear fiscal review, the deficit projected for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 seemed shockingly large -- $231 billion.
Drastic consequences would occur if a way could not be found to reduce that deficit, Mr. Darman asserted. Under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law, many air traffic control installations would be closed. Meat inspection would be ended for five months. Vaccinations for a million children would be canceled. 
 That was last year. On Monday, Mr. Darman is to release this year's midyear review. It will show a deficit of perhaps $315 billion or $320 billion for the next fiscal year, nearly $100 billion above the figure last July, $35 billion or $40 billion above what was forecast as recently as February and far and away the biggest deficit ever. But nobody seems to care.
The Bush Administration portrays the new deficit figure as a statistical anomaly. The economists and political scientists who filled the nation's op-ed pages last year with doomsday columns about dangers of the deficit have turned their attention elsewhere. And the Democrats in Congress have had not only their hands but also their tongues tied by the five-year budget deal they struck with Mr. Bush last fall.
The Administration's stance is understandable on both substantive and political grounds. The high deficit next year will be due in part to one-time-only costs: the savings and loan bailout, bank failures and leftover expenses from the war against Iraq. "These are transitory events," said an Administration economist. "So long as the economy does passably well and the budget agreement is not broken, you should see a double-digit deficit heading toward balance by the middle of the decade."
As for politics, the President must be delighted that the deficit and his broken promise not to raise taxes are out of the news.
The scholars' lack of attention to the deficit this year is also readily explained. Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard, said he believed just as strongly as he did last year, when he was writing regularly about the subject, that the deficit was "ruining the country." But he said he felt like someone who had tried unsuccessfully to persuade an alcoholic friend to stop drinking. "You've done absolutely everything you can do, and now it's not at all clear it will do any good to continue harping."
But what about the Democrats? In a year, the 1992 election campaign will be in full swing. The country has been in a recession, and the recovery looks tepid indeed. States and cities from Maine to California are staggering from cutbacks in Federal aid. Now, the President's budget director puts forth the biggest deficit in history. How can the Democrats be silent?
"It's the peril of being the Congressional party," said a Democratic political strategist.
What he meant was that when the economy was sour in 1980, Ronald Reagan could run against Jimmy Carter by promising, without showing how the numbers added up, to cut taxes, raise military spending and balance the budget all at the same time.
The Democrats do not have the same freedom. They signed the deal that put off further debate on the budget until after the 1992 election. They agreed that all new spending would be balanced by cuts elsewhere. They forfeited their right to criticize a President with a stratospheric popularity rating on the one issue on which he seems vulnerable.
Even more, they cannot promote their best issues. When Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia talks about helping children or when Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts advocates universal medical insurance, they must document how they would pay the costs.
Last year's budget agreement may have been responsible policy for the Democrats. But politically, it has proved disastrous. "No doubt about it," said a Democratic senator. "We laid down some of the biggest weapons in our arsenal."

HEADLINE: A Nomination Sets Off Battle On C.I.A. Role

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Beyond the charges and denials involving the Iran-contra affair, the struggle over Robert M. Gates's nomination as Director of Central Intelligence is a battle over the course of the nation's 50-year-old espionage establishment.
Broadly, the conflict pits two contrasting views of American intelligence. Supporters of Mr. Gates would shift the historic focus of American intelligence away from the Soviet Union, secret wars and back-alley covert operations to the sophisticated analysis of regional and global political and economic trends. On the other side are veteran spies, in the mold of John le Carre's fictional George Smiley, whose views were forged in the cold war and the shadowy world of espionage. 
 The conflict matches the Central Intelligence Agency against an array of military espionage agencies that have designs on the C.I.A.'s historic turf. The infighting comes as the military and civilian agencies are competing for scarce Federal money and Congress is studying an overhaul of the Government's espionage empire.
 
Simmering Since 1989
 And the conflict pits those who want to lift up the veil of secrecy that has shielded intelligence agencies from the rest of Government against those who fear that such a move would destroy the secrecy that they say makes espionage possible.
The struggle has simmered largely under classified wraps since the disintegration of the Soviet empire began in 1989. Now it is surfacing in the debate over Mr. Gates, a man whose strong views and canny bureaucratic skills inspire unusual ardor from backers and enemies alike.
The Iran-contra scandal, not his views, is the most urgent threat to Mr. Gates's ambition to head the C.I.A. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which this week put off hearings on his nomination, is unlikely to elevate Mr. Gates to the top C.I.A. post until it is certain that his knowledge of Oliver L. North's secret shipments of arms to Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels was slight and his actions proper, as he has contended they were.
But the debate over Mr. Gates's role in the Iran-contra affair mirrors the larger debate over the direction in which he will take the C.I.A.: toward its swashbuckling tradition of third world coups, assassination plots and spying on domestic protesters, or along a new course that would make it less a collector of secrets and more the world's most eminent and reliable source of information.
Many of Mr. Gates's sharpest critics are former members of the C.I.A.'s operations directorate, the invisible league of spies and guerrilla warriors who comprise the business end of American espionage. Four of the agency's previous directors -- Allen W. Dulles, Richard M. Helms, William E. Colby and William J. Casey -- came from that tradition.
Mr. Gates, 47 years old, is a career intelligence analyst, wholly outside the trenchcoat-and-dagger culture that has dominated the agency since its founding in 1947. While that is not the only difference between Mr. Gates and his critics in the intelligence empire, it may be the most significant.
"I think the nomination of Mr Gates is a major development in the history of intelligence," said Mr. Colby, an old operations master who nevertheless says he supports Mr. Gates. "Finally, finally, we're achieving the basic concept of central intelligence, that it's the analyst who's at the center of things. I think his nomination is a recognition that we have arrived at an appreciation of that fact."
Some members of the agency's clandestine service take a different view. To them, Mr. Gates is a tepid bureaucrat with a distaste for the dangers of spying who would remove the last vestiges of Mr. Casey's high-risk era and return the C.I.A. to the more cautious days of President Carter's intelligence director, Adm. Stansfield Turner. The two directors are widely regarded as antitheses. Mr. Gates was a top aide to both men in the 1970's and 1980's.
"He's an honest-to-God pol," one recently retired senior operations official said of Mr. Gates. "To work for Turner and then turn around and work for Casey! What does he stand for?"
 
Feet in Both Camps
 In fact, Mr. Gates seems to have feet firmly in both camps. A Sovietologist by training and profession, he expresses in speeches and papers the kind of dark suspicions and aggressive defiance of Moscow that the late Mr. Casey would have embraced. As a deputy to Mr. Casey in the 1980's and William H. Webster in 1987 and 1988, former intelligence officials say, he took an active interest in the C.I.A.'s covert operations in Angola and Afghanistan.
His conservative views have clashed with those of other senior members of Mr. Bush's administration, including Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who once killed a tough speech on the Soviet Union that Mr. Gates had been scheduled to deliver.
Even admirers acknowledge, however, that Mr. Gates, like Admiral Turner, is wary of the sometimes-risky style of the C.I.A.'s clandestine operators.
As the deputy director for intelligence from 1982 to 1986, a job in which he managed the C.I.A.'s thousands of intelligence analysts, Mr. Gates lobbied long and successfully to move some of his most promising analysts into undercover posts overseas, so they could learn the spying business firsthand. Several analysts were made the chiefs of important C.I.A. stations, positions that traditionally have gone to the best or most favored members of the agency's operations directorate.
"That goes a long way toward explaining why so many of the old boys are bad-mouthing Bob Gates on the Hill," said another former C.I.A. official. "They don't like Gates because he brought some new ways of doing business between the D.D.I. and the D.D.O.," the acronyms for the intelligence and operations directorates.
"They've been doing things the same way for the last 20 years, and they don't want to change," the former official added. "There's a trepidation that if Gates goes out there, he'll shake things up."
"He's not a D.D.O.'er," said Bobby Ray Inman, a former deputy to Mr. Casey who is perhaps Mr. Gates's strongest supporter. "There was a view among them that he was too forthcoming with the oversight committees when he was Casey's deputy -- that he told them more than they needed to know."
 
Are New Skills Needed?
 Others disagree with Mr. Inman. Some on the Senate Intelligence Committee have accused Mr. Gates of not being forthcoming enough when he first testified to them about the Iran-contra affair in 1986 and early 1987. And some contend that Mr. Gates secretly harbors the same dislike of Congressional oversight of the C.I.A. that was the hallmark of his former boss, Mr. Casey.
Other supporters argue that Soviet-oriented operations officials could dominate the C.I.A. in the days when Moscow was America's only rival but that the agency needs different skills more suited to Mr. Gates's background in the next century.
Mr. Webster, the current Director, has been nudging the C.I.A. along this path for some time. Under his tenure, the clandestine service has sought to build a credible network of undercover agents in the Middle East, the focus of many of Washington's national-security concerns, and has dispatched some of its most promising officers to work directly with analysts in special centers devoted to terrorism, counterespionage and drugs.
Perhaps more important, the agency is moving to acquire more powerful computers that can absorb the growing cascade of print and broadcast news in the old communist bloc countries and in the developing world and put it in a form that analysts can use.
That reflects a growing view that traditional state secrets, while still an important part of the spying business in crises, are no more important than a broad knowledge of the world that can enable Washington policy makers to spot and respond to emerging political and economic trends.

HEADLINE: NBC News 'Professionals' Fight to Decline Honor

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Writing the words that Tom Brokaw reads to nearly 15 million Americans weeknights on the NBC Nightly News might sound like a terrific job. But Jack Freeman, who writes those words, has a different view. He calls it routine, formulaic, highly supervised and unimaginative.
Mr. Freeman is not your average office griper. Along with some colleagues, he has taken his complaints to Federal court. 
 In a labor dispute as meaningful for its paradoxes and subtleties as for its financial stakes, Mr. Freeman and about a dozen other news writers and producers are contesting how the National Broadcasting Company calculates their overtime pay.
At the heart of the dispute is whether news writers and producers are professionals. Federal labor laws and regulations exclude from overtime payments certain types of workers, including so-called "learned" professionals like doctors and lawyers, "artistic" professionals like cartoonists and advertising writers, and administrators.
 
Other TV and Newspaper Suits
 The issue has come up at a number of news organizations in recent years. Similar lawsuits have been brought by some reporters, producers and news writers at a television station in Dallas, KDFW-TV, and by a reporter at The Washington Post. They, too, contend that they are not professionals and so must be paid overtime; their employers maintain that they are professionals and are therefore exempt.
A Federal district court and an appeals court have ruled in favor of the employees in Dallas. The Washington case has not come to trial.
A decision is expected soon in the NBC case, which has ambled through the courts for six years.
To win it, the writers and producers have to convince a Federal magistrate that their jobs are fundamentally mundane and uncreative. NBC has to demonstrate that their work is original and imaginative, and that they frequently exercise discretion and independence.
NBC contends that creativity is the hallmark of the work performed by its news writers and producers and that they constantly make vital judgments and decisions on their own.
 
'It's Not Brain Surgery'
 "The management of NBC News just had a lot of trouble accepting the notion that the people they are hiring for these important jobs are not professionals," said Jay E. Gerber, a lawyer representing the network.
Mr. Freeman said there was no doubt that his work required skill and experience, but that under the law the fact that he made news judgments did not make him a professional.
"We're proud of the work we do," he said. "We think it's very important work and we think we do it very well. But it's not brain surgery and it's not painting 'Mona Lisas.' We are just not creative artists. We are journalists."
Until late last year, when the system was changed, news writers and producers at NBC were paid the same base salary, with varying fees added for different categories of writers and producers. Overtime was paid only on the base salary, not on the fees.
 
160 Workers Originally Sued
 The base pay, before the changes, was $895 a week, and fees ranged up to about $260 a week, Mr. Freeman said. A producer making the maximum fee would have received almost $10 more an hour on overtime if the fees were included in the computation.
In a suit filed in 1985, about 160 news writers and producers for the network and for television and radio stations owned by NBC in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles sought to have the fees included. In a settlement, NBC agreed to make some small changes, and the union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which had brought the suit for the workers, agreed to drop it.
But about 30 producers and writers decided that they did not want to settle and continued the case on their own. Of this group, about a dozen remain.
Mr. Freeman was joined in the first case to go to trial by two others: Bernard S. Brown, a producer for NBC News, and Robert L. Garner, a news producer for WNBC-TV in New York.
The suit was begun in a very different economic climate. In the last two years, both newspapers and network news divisions have been cutting costs in response to declining revenues. In the last week alone, NBC's owner, the General Electric Company, announced that it was closing its network news bureaus in New York and Miami. NBC, like other networks, had previously closed or scaled back other bureaus.
In the prolonged dispute between NBC and the writers and producers who chose not to settle, neither side has indicated any change of heart.
NBC contends that Mr. Freeman and his colleagues are professionals and administrators and so do not qualify automatically for any overtime. They received overtime computed on their base salaries as a result of collective bargaining, the network said.
NBC argues that the employees bring exceptional skills to the reporting of news. They have broad latitude in their work, it says, and they have the obligation to be accurate and to use their imaginations to create compelling stories for television news programs.
 
'Judgment and Discretion'
 "They regularly exercise judgment and discretion in determining what is newsworthy and how to present such stories through a blend of words, pictures, sound and graphics," Mr. Gerber, the network's lawyer, said in a brief written after the trial, which was held during February and March of 1990.
He continued, "It is preposterous even to suggest that the work of these plaintiffs for NBC -- one of the world's largest and most prestigious news organizations, 'the pinnacle of broadcast news,' where employees such as plaintiffs are expected to be 'the very best' -- involves ministerial, mundane and routine tasks."
In another brief submitted two months ago, he noted that the writers and producers were so talented that they represented themselves in the prolonged litigation, writing complex legal briefs and cross-examining witnesses.
 
Not a Question of Intelligence
 Mr. Freeman said that he was flattered but that the praise was irrelevant. He said the legal question was not whether he and his colleagues were intelligent or skilled. Under Federal rules, he said, he is a professional only if his work primarily requires creativity and an administrator only if he is granted broad discretion.
Mr. Freeman's case rests strongly on the Labor Department's written interpretations of its own rules. These say that only newspaper writing that is predominantly original and creative represents professional work and is exempt from overtime. As examples of exempt newspaper writers, the interpretations cite editorial writers, columnists and other "top-flight" writers of analytical and interpretive articles.
Mr. Gerber noted that the interpretations are not legally binding. He also said they were written in 1949 and do not reflect the evolving sophistication of journalism in general and television news in particular.
Mr. Freeman said that his work allows for occasional creativity but that creativity is not its prime characteristic.
 
Processors, Not Creators
 "Is it more important that I be creative or clear?" Mr. Freeman asked. "Is it more important that I be creative or accurate?"
"We don't make up the news," he added. "We don't create it. We process it." Most of that processing, he asserted, is done under the strict supervision of senior managers at NBC News.
The network disagreed. News writers and producers may be supervised, but the process is collegial, with considerable give and take, senior NBC producers said in court.
Mr. Gerber, who frequently twitted the news employees in his legal briefs for what he described as their self-deprecating testimony, contended that the work of television journalists, and virtually all contemporary journalists, requires analytic abilities, creative writing and broad discretion and judgment.
"Does it involve so little discretion, judgment and originality that it would be deemed to be a mechanical, routine process?" he asked. "I cannot believe that anyone would seriously say that. There is clearly an amount of selectivity, discretion and judgment that is involved that journalists must make all the time."

HEADLINE: Fire at Hispanic Family's Home Is Seen as Bias Crime

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins visited the home of a Hispanic family in Ozone Park, Queens, late yesterday afternoon, 38 hours after two fire bombs were hurled onto the porch of their frame house in what the police are investigating as a bias-related crime.
The family, including several children, was forced to flee by flames that destroyed parts of the front wall and the roof. Awakened by a daughter who had been sleeping in the living room downstairs, they escaped out a back door and ran across the street. No one was injured. 
 "The kids were hysterical," Lucy Jimenez, the mother of four children and foster mother of three others, said yesterday.
"My 4-year-old, he won't let me go out the door unless he's behind," said Mrs. Jimenez, who is 44. "He's terrified. He doesn't even like the sound of the fire siren."
 
Ethnic Slurs in Letter

The police said they considered the fire a bias crime because of a hand-scrawled letter delivered by mail to the two-story home on Sutter Avenue on May 28. A police spokesman, Sgt. Norris Hollomon, said the family immediately turned the letter, which included ethnic slurs, over to detectives from the 106th Precinct. "They deemed it bias then," he said.
Mr. Dinkins, who arrived at 5:15 P.M., spent about 10 minutes with the Jimenez family.
"I just wanted to come to demonstrate that we care," the Mayor said outside the house.
"Most people in our city are kind and good people and would disassociate themselves from this kind of behavior, this kind of act," he said.
The arrival of the Mayor and his entourage brought residents out of their homes, a few of whom booed as he stepped from his car. One neighbor, who declined to be identified, said she had lived in Ozone Park for 63 years. "They're making out like this is racial, like this is another Howard Beach," she said. "There's never been any problem like that in the time I've been here."
Mrs. Jimenez's 18-year-old daughter, Christina, said that neighbors have offered support. "Everybody was telling us not to move, not to worry," she said. "It makes me feel happy, because at least there are people who care."
 
 'You People Ruin It'

Earlier yesterday, Mrs. Jimenez read a copy of the letter, spelling out the misspelled words.
"It's very badly misspelled," she said, "but it says: 'The people around here really don't want any rickons or spics. Here we have a nice class of Italians and Irish. When spics move in you people ruin it, O.K. You people don't belong around hear. Do us a good deed, move back where you belong. You might have to move soon anyway. You dirty people have your own area. Yous work on your cars in the street like people in the getto do.' "
The letter was not signed.
Sergeant Hollomon said the fire-bombing occurred about 2:30 A.M. Friday. "Two Molotov cocktails were thrown," he said. "One entered through the window of the porch area, and the fire damaged that area and moved upwards." The other broke on the porch.
 
Family Was Sleeping

Mrs. Jimenez and her husband, Angel, 31, an unemployed construction worker, have lived at the house with their children since January 1990. They had experienced "no trouble at all" until the letter arrived, Mrs. Jimenez said.
"We were all sleeping," she said of the attack on Friday. "My 27-year-old daughter, Brenda, was sleeping in the living room. She heard something hit the front where the window is.
"She ran upstairs to wake us up and we came down and took the kids outside on the other side of the street," Mrs. Jimenez said. "The wall was in flames, below the window and above."
Christina Jimenez said: "All I want is just peace, the peace that we always had. There are kids here. We don't bother nobody."
Mrs. Jimenez, asked how she felt about the Mayor's visit, said, "I'm very honored, but I wish it would have been on a different occasion, for my kids to be proud of.
"Jaime and Brian play baseball for the Bushwick Little League," she added. "They wish that it was when they won the all-star game, not for somebody burning our home."

HEADLINE: Poll Finds G.O.P Growth Erodes Dominant Role of the Democrats

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
After a decade of party growth, Republicans have drawn almost even with the Democrats nationally, and ahead, though barely, in the allegiance of whites and adults under the age of 40.
The dominance in party identification that Democrats established in the aftermath of the Great Depression has evaporated. Polls by The New York Times and CBS News over the first half of this year show that 34 percent of the 14,695 people interviewed now call themselves Democrats and 31 percent call themselves Republicans. The margin of sampling error in the combined polls was plus or minus 1 percentage point.
 
Republicans Viewed Favorably
 President Bush's continuing popularity gives these trends a major lift, but the party's strength runs beyond him personally, though it does not appear to have reached the point of threatening the Democrats' sway over Congress, where the House has gone Republican just once in four decades. 
 The latest Times/CBS News Poll, conducted June 3 through 6, shows that more Americans have a favorable view of the Republican Party than of the Democratic Party. The Republicans are also preferred on a wide range of matters, from insuring prosperity, a Democratic asset until the 1980's, to a what is perceived as a history of offering "better candidates" for President.
As Lorraine Ingram of Minneapolis, a 35-year-old poll respondent, said in a follow-up interview, she abandoned the Democratic allegiance of her parents as she grew older and "Republican values became more and more important." These values, she said, include "the family, free enterprise, independence from government intervention."
The survey's news was not altogether bleak for the Democrats, whose 1992 national convention will begin in New York a year from today. The telephone poll of 1,424 adults showed the Democratic Party substantially ahead on issues connected to its image as the party that cares more about human needs, from education to health care. This poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
A resounding 53 to 24 percent said the Democrats were the party "more concerned with the needs and problems of people like yourself."
The Democrats also retain an image as the party that looks after people of all income levels, while the Republicans are still seen as the party of the rich. That image is not always helpful to Democrats.
Faye Boom, 49 years old, a clerk in the Milwaukee County Courthouse who was not in the poll sample but was interviewed later, said: "The social programs that the Democrats are likely to enact are going to cost me tax money, and they probably aren't going to be directed at me. I vote for what I think is the best for most people."
Democrats often stated their allegiance with some reservations. "I am pleased with my party, but, even so, I'd like to see even more performance," said George Prappas, a 34-year-old Detroit teacher. But as with many of his fellow partisans, disdain for Republicans helped explain his allegiance. "The Republicans sacrifice education whenever they are trying to fix the economy," he said.
 
Older Groups Also Shifting
 Mr. Prappas was not typical of his generation. Younger Americans were once overwhelmingly Democratic in party allegiance, splitting 37 to 20 for the Democrats in 1980 polling, with the rest uncommitted. But by 1985, The Times/CBS News Polls showed Republicans with a 32 to 28 percent edge among this group. In the 11 polls by The Times and CBS News this year, the Republicans' lead had grown to 35 to 28 percent among 18-to 29-year-old voters.
And as those voters who came of political age in the early years of the Reagan Administration have aged, older age groups are also growing less Democratic. In the 11 polls this year, Republicans held a narrow but statistically significant lead among 18-to-39-year-olds, with a 33 to 31 percent margin over the Democrats.
By two other measures, the Republicans have done even better than to draw within 3 percentage points in partisanship, among all adults. When respondents in this year's 11 polls who said they had no party allegiance were asked if they leaned toward one, the Republicans narrowed the gap to a single percentage point, 43 percent to 44.
And in the June poll, when people were asked their opinions of the parties, 62 percent said their view of the Republicans was favorable. Only 52 percent said that of the Democrats.
In the latest poll, respondents were asked which party cared more about the needs and problems of women, of men, of blacks and of whites. Forty-six percent said Democrats were more concerned about women, while 19 percent said Republicans were; 37 percent said Republicans were more concerned about men, while 24 percent said Democrats were. These images go beyond party lines. Republicans were about evenly split on which party cared more about women; Democrats divided almost equally on which cared about men.
The differences were even more dramatic on the issue of race. Fifty-six percent of all those polled and 46 percent of the Republicans said the Democrats cared more about blacks, while 15 percent of the those polled said Republicans did.
Forty-five percent of the public said Republicans cared more about whites, while 19 percent said the Democrats did. White Democarts sided with their party, with 39 percent saying Democrats cared more about whites and 32 percent saying Republicans did.
 
Polling Amid Rights Debate
 This poll was conducted just as the debate over the civil rights bill reached its peak in the House and angry accusations about quotas and racial politics were being traded. But the answers to the questions about race and sex were similar to past findings and apparently not influenced by the news.
Those impressions of party preferences, especially the impressions based on race, often translated into strong political attitudes. One Republican poll respondent, Patricia Clark of Parsippany, N.J., said, "The Democrats' major weakness is that they're too concerned with quotas and blacks and getting them into jobs."
Even though she saw Democrats as more concerned with women and Republcans with men, Ms. Clark was more influenced by her view that Democrats cared about blacks and Republicans about whites. "Republicans look after my interests best," the 21-year-old college student said, because they are "not just interested in minorities but the majority."
Differences between the political attitudes of men and women widened sharply during the Ronald Reagan years, although both sexes became more Republican in that period.
Among men, a 39 to 23 percent Democratic edge in 1980 fluctuated in the following years and has now become a 33 percent to 31 percent Republican advantage.
 
Women With More Allegiance
 Women's party allegiances did not change as erratically. From a 43 to 23 percent Democratic edge in 1980, there has been a more gradual shift to a 38 to 29 percent Democratic margin in 1991.
The Democratic lead anmong whites dropped from 36 to 24 percent in 1980 to 33 to 30 percent in 1984. Republicans took a two point-lead in 1985, dropped to a tie in 1986 and a one-point deficit in 1987 and have led ever since. In the 1991 polls, their margin was 34 percent to 30 percent.
These allegiances are not always strong or enthusiastic. A black Democratic poll respondent from Newark, Gloria Hackman, said, "They're doing terrible jobs, Democrats and Republicans."
A white Republican respondent from Langhorne, Pa., Joseph Carp, said: "Neither party looks after my interests. They just don't get anything accomplished. They spend too much time with their high salaries."
The June poll found both parties rated almost equally when the public was asked which was "more likely to waste your tax money." Thirty-three percent picked the Republicans and 30 percent the Democrats. Another measure of the decline of the Republican image of fiscal soundness was that Republicans held only a 36 to 28 percent lead over Democarts when people were asked which party was more likely to reduce the Federal deficit.
But an area of traditional Democratic strength had also weakened. Democrats held only a 37 to 32 percent lead when people were asked which party could do best in dealing with unemployment, perhaps a reflection of how little the party has said or done in Congress since the recession began. In the recession of the early 1980's, when Democrats assailed the Republicans relentlessly, they regularly held 20 point leads on that question during 1982.
 
Republicans and Prosperity
 Republicans were favored as the party more likely to see that the country remains prosperous, by a 44 to 29 percent margin.
They were also seen as the party which "has usually had better candidates for President" by a 57 to 26 percent margin over the Democrats. Democrats had a 41 to 28 percent edge when the respondents were asked about candidates for local offices, and five and three point leads, respectively, when the question dealt with candiates for governor and Congress.
When respondents were asked, "If George Bush runs for re-election in 1992, do you think you will probably vote for George Bush or probably vote for the Democratic candidate," the breakdown was like this: 45 percent said they would vote for Mr. Bush, 22 percent for the Democrat and 24 said they could not say until the Democrats chose a candidae.
The Democrats' uncertainty tinged with pessimism ranged from the comments of Jane Wood of Bluefield, W.Va., who complained that her party leaders "just sit back," to James Gleason, a funeral director in Schenectady, N.Y., who said foreign policy appeared to be a natural Republican strength and added, "I think George Bush will win that election and have no idea who the Democrats would even run as their candidate."
 
 
 
HOW JUNE POLL WAS TAKEN
 The New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 3 to 6 with 1,424 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened so that calls would be placed to residences only. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age, and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
The potential sampling error for smaller subgroups is larger. For example, for either Republicans or Democrats or independents it is plus or minus five percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Politics, The Knicks And N.Y.C.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
"I think New York's the greatest place to play in the world. You play before the most knowledgeable fans in the country, you play in the media capital of the country so that your success is amplified. You also play in the most critical place in the country, that means you can't pull anything over people's eyes. They respect effort, humility, winning -- and style. They love style." -- Senator Bill Bradley
 In October 1967, an unassuming, self-assured forward from Princeton reported for his first season with the New York Knicks, who were coming off a dismal fourth-place finish. 
 Bill Bradley was the Knicks' first pick in 1965, but he delayed his pro career for two years to take a Rhodes scholarship at Oxford and play professionally in Europe.
 Bradley had general political aspirations at the time, but nothing hard and fast. "It was not something that I personally was planning or aspiring to," Bradley recalled recently. "I always said I wanted to go into the State Department. It evolved over time."
 Twenty four years later, the Knicks have drafted another aspiring politician, Greg Anthony, a point guard from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. As a player he is a hard-nosed defender, as a person he is gaining the reputation, at 22, as a polished statesman.
 Although the two men are removed by age and background -- Anthony was reared in the inner city of North Las Vegas, Bradley comes from the middle class in Crystal City, Mo. -- they have similarities that the Knicks hope will translate into success for a listless franchise.
 New York was an overwhelmingly Democratic city when Bradley arrived. The city's first-term Mayor, John V. Lindsay, was a Republican, as Bradley had been until his senior year in college, when he switched affiliations.
 Like Anthony, who served as a congressional aide during college, Bradley worked as a summer intern on Capitol Hill.
 Two decades later, Anthony as that rare-breed black Republican, begins his career in a city that is 83 percent Democratic.
 Where Bradley sketched a political career as he went along, Anthony has already made the rounds. He was a guest at the Mayor's birthday party earlier this week and spoke with youngsters at two locations in Harlem. On Friday, he announced plans for establishing a foundation to aid youth development and promised that at least some economically disadvantaged children would see the Knicks play this season.
 As Bradley discovered years ago, political plans are enhanced when you win. When Bradley arrived, the Knicks had not finished higher than fourth place in 11 of the previous 12 seasons. He was a starter on two Knick teams that won world championships (1970 and 1973). Bradley retired after the 1976-77 season. A year later, he was elected to the Senate.
 Anthony joins a team that has not advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs since 1974. The franchise is under new management, and the team has a new coach. In the backcourt, the best guard is too old and the younger one is not quite good enough. The best player isn't sure that he wants to play for the Knicks anymore and the community is wondering if the Knicks will ever be great again.
 This is the environment that Anthony wanted to begin his professional and political career. High stakes, high payoff.
 "The team is located in the largest city in the country," he said. "That allows me to magnify my successes -- if I succeed -- on a broader scale and help more people," he said.
 Anthony wants to develop programs to help children make the most out of their lives and help the elderly complete their lives with dignity. But what sounds great in July often crumbles in January with the onslaught of losing streaks or a string of poor performances.
 "The problem for an athlete, especially in New York, if you succeed is that you're well known and therefore when you fail everybody knows you failed," Bradley said. "The challenge is to find places where you can fail in private so you can grow as a person."
 The Knicks needed a soul and they hired Pat Riley as coach. If Ewing stays put, they will have the dominating, hard-driving superstar.
 What the Knicks desperately need now is an infusion of enthusiasm and they hope that's where Anthony fits in. They need a player who will soothe bruised egos, patch differences, forge alliances and make individuals share the vision of a common goal.
 The Knicks' young Republican will have to be a masterly politician to negotiate his way through this season.

New Leader Sets Sights On Restructured CART

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

 BODY:
Picture the National Basketball Association with no salary cap or any other cost controls, and with its showpiece event -- the championship final -- being run by an entirely different league.
That is the kind of sports organization that A. William Stokkan took over a little more than a year ago when he became chairman and chief EXecutive officer of Championship Auto Racing Teams, the governing body for Indy-car racing. 
Discussing his first year at the helm last week on the eve of today's Marlboro Grand Prix at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, N.J., he sounded like a marketing expert worthy of N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern, a man he openly admires. Stokkan (pronounce stoke-KAN) referred to race promoters as his "distributors," and promised to tear off the "CART" label this fall and sew on a new one.
 
Two Major Challenges
 "To the uninitiated, it sounds like we are either doing Go-Kart or shopping-cart races," Stokkan said of the 16-race CART series.
But the challenges that face him as he comes out of his honeymoon period into a time when he will have to justify CART's choice can't be solved with minor alterations. In short, he must deal with two issues that threaten the long-term health of Indy-car racing.
The first is the rapidly rising costs of running a competitive Indy-car team, costs that are outrunning the willingness of corporate sponsors to pay. "In the eighties," Stokkan said last week, "aggregate spending in advertising and promotion increased on an annual basis anywhere from 8 to 8 1/2 percent. The cost of our sport increased over 20 percent each year."
The second is agreeing with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway management on a stable set of rules for the latter part of the 1990's that will encourage close racing and limit costs.
Although the Indianapolis 500 literally defines the sport of Indy-car racing, for the last 13 years it has been run by a sanctioning body other than CART, the United States Auto Club.
 
The Marketing Angle
 CART accounts for 70 percent of the Indy-car prize money, attendance and television viewership annually, Stokkan said, with Indy accounting for the rest. But qualitatively, he said, "the Indy 500 is probably 70 percent and the series is 30 percent."
"If you have two elements of a sport where there is that kind of an imbalance between the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of it, you know up front you have a problem," Stokkan said.
If anyone has the business skills and wit to solve the problem, it is Stokkan, who was president of Playboy Enterprises' merchandising group before coming to CART. Stokkan, 40 years old, was born in Norway, and earned an undergraduate marketing degree at Pace University and a graduate degree at the University of Chicago. One of his favorite jokes, told in an erudite, accented English, is that he joined Playboy, an enterprise built on precious little clothing, and turned it into a successful clothing seller.
 
Calm or Another Storm?
 Stokkan said that the first person he met with after CART signed him to a three-year contract was Tony George, the 31-year-old president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. One of the main issues they discussed, Stokkan said, was "just how we should parallel market our sport and the Super Bowl of our sport."
This dichotomy exists because of a car-owners' revolt in 1978. They believed that USAC, then the existing sanctioning group, was letting the sport stagnate.
The owners broke away and formed CART. But the Indy management, which has always counted loyalty as one of its virtues (sometimes to an extreme), stuck with USAC. Now, the Indy 500 is the only Indy-car race run by USAC, which follows the Speedway's philosophies.
Just when the CART-Speedway relationship seemed to be approaching a calm, George announced after this year's race that the track was thinking about switching to the same engines used in Formula One cars. Three former winners -- Al Unser Sr., Johnny Rutherford and Tom Sneva -- couldn't find competitive cars for Indy, and George was upset that the CART owners couldn't make room for them.
 
A Matter of Money
 "He has a problem with the CART structure," said Stokkan, who can sympathize.
"Our board meetings are sometimes what I call an exercise in ego pinball," Stokkan said, referring to the CART board of directors, which comprises 20 car owners.
But he shares the car owners' fears that switching engines will sharply increase costs. It is estimated that a Formula One engine converted to Indy-car use will cost two to three times what the current Indy-car engines cost.
"I spent $4.2 million in 1987," said Vince Granatelli, one of the more competitive car owners. "This year, I'm scheduled to spend $6.9 million." Over that same period, Granatelli said, his team has grown from 19 employees to 37, "and we're about eight people short."
And during that same span, the cost of a chassis (the entire car minus the engine) went from $160,000 to $320,000. Some of that increase was caused by inflation in England, where the Lola chassis is built, and an unfavorable exchange rate, but it still must be paid.
Mark Coughlin, manager of sports marketing for Valvoline, a leading auto racing sponsor, said that some sponsors were being priced out. "There's a lot of players for $2 million, but when you get up to $5 million, that shuts a lot of people out," Coughlin said.
Stokkan said that the first part of CART's plan to control costs was to keep the rules as stable as possible, eliminating the expense of buying redesigned cars. He wouldn't mention any other potential controls because, he said, they are still being discussed by the board.
But Andrew Broadley, a customer engineer and liaison with Lola cars, said that stabilized rules could only slow cost increases, not eliminate them.
"We're in this business to win races, so we do wind-tunnel testing and other research," Broadley said. "It costs money, and we put that into our prices."
 
MEARS ASSURED OF POLE POSITION
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., July 13 (Special to The New York Times) -- A wet track surface for today's qualifying sessions assured Rick Mears of starting on the pole for the Marlboro Grand Prix Indy-car race here on Sunday.
Mears had the fastest qualifying speed, 115.991 miles per hour, in qualifying on Friday. The rain that fell today on the 1.217-mile temporary race circuit around Byrne Arena here made it impossible for any drivers to improve upon their speeds from Friday.
Starting alongside Mears on the front row will be his Penske Racing teammate, Emerson Fittipaldi, with a speed of 115.413. The washed-out qualifying session sat well with Fittipaldi for another reason: He was taking his 10-year-old daughter to a 2 P.M. performance of "The Phantom of the Opera," and qualifying was to end at 1 P.M.

Trade Embargoes: Do They Work?

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A lot of attention was given to economic sanctions here last week -- the lifting by President Bush of sanctions against South Africa, a vote in Congress to impose high tariffs against China and the nagging question of whether anything short of violence can bring Saddam Hussein to heel. But for all of that, the lessons America can draw from its experience with sanctions remain unclear.
Sanctions have been used by the United States 77 times since World War II but they have been applied unevenly, administered chaotically and lifted haphazardly. Their goals and duration have varied widely. 
 Carla A. Hills, the United States Trade Representative, argues that sanctions should be tailored to each country, with different goals set in each case, and she says this approach has been a consistent theme in the Bush Administration. She also argues that two traditional criteria for the likely effectiveness of sanctions against a country -- that its economy depends on international trade and that all other nations take part -- remain important.
But she rejects the contention of some academics that sanctions only really work in achieving limited goals against governments that depend on fairly broad public support, rather than on an individual or close-knit oligarchy that can insulate itself from deprivation.
Some analysts, however, say such a conclusion is only bolstered by Washington's experiences with South Africa and Iraq. "Where the United States has imposed sanctions against somewhat open countries, of which they are not very many cases, they have generally been successful," said Gary C. Hufbauer, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. But autocrats seldom bend under pressure from sanctions, and in such cases the sanctions either succeed or fail spectacularly, he said.
South Africa's whites have governed as a generally open society that was vulnerable to sanctions, Mr. Hufbauer said, while Mr. Hussein has shown himself to be a particularly ruthless dictator who has withstood pressure -- at least so far.
Indeed, by other criteria South Africa appears to have been a poor candidate for sanctions. A developed economy and an abundance of natural resources make it quite self-sufficient. And penalties on South Africa were never applied universally; the European Community has been a sometimes reluctant participant and goods have been shipped through South Africa's neighbors.
 
Just One Factor
 Yet liberals and conservatives now agree that sanctions must have contributed to the release from imprisonment of Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, and to the gradual dismantling of South Africa's racial segregation laws under President F. W. de Klerk.
Sanctions, however, were hardly the only factor at play, and conservatives minimize their contribution. "I can't say that sanctions had no effect," President Bush said. "But I think far more important than sanctions was the fact that you had a forward-looking man of Mr. de Klerk's stature."
Perhaps more basic, the sanctions also coincided with a sustained campaign of opposition to apartheid by the black majority; in addition, the widespread discrediting of Communism seem to have tempered the fears of South Africa's whites that a black-led government would inevitably nationalize their assets.
Still, the American penalties cost the South African economy 1 to 3 percentage points of growth a year, said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who drafted much of the legislation. There is little doubt that this, along with South Africa's exclusion from most international sports competitions, played a role in creating interest in change among white voters.
By contrast, the sanctions against Iraq had nearly unanimous international support and were leveled against a country that has imported three-quarters of its food and all the spare parts for its sophisticated equipment. But Mr. Hussein has so far defied the sanctions and appears able, at least for now, to insulate himself and his narrowly based regime from these problems. "He's still in his bunker with chandeliers and 11 rooms," Mrs. Hills said.
The sanctions case that could prove the most difficult for the Bush Administration over the coming weeks is that involving China. On the day Mr. Bush lifted sanctions against South Africa, the House voted for high tariffs on imports from Beijing, in an effort to change human rights and trade policies there.
Recent results suggest that such a measure is unlikely to change Chinese policies, however. The United States is the only country still trying to punish Beijing for the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989, and China is still led by a small oligarchy resistant to pressure for change.
"It's like saying one bank won't lend you money, in a town that has 108 banks," Mrs. Hills said.

The Budget Balances, But Now Reality

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
EXCEPT for some figurative fireworks, the eve of a new fiscal year usually is not celebrated with the gusto that marks the beginning of the Julian calendar in January -- particularly when an agreement to raise taxes and reduce municipal services heralds a summer of discontent. But New York City officials were euphoric two weeks ago for having agreed at all. So when Philip R. Michael, the budget director, was asked how many dollars officials planned to spend in fiscal 1992, he replied glibly: "Twenty-nine billion, give or take a billion."
Mr. Michael was just joking. Mayor David N. Dinkins was not amused. The Mayor's pained expression suggested the frustration of an official who prides himself on speaking precisely, but whose administration, in conjunction with the City Council, produced a budget that raises questions for this year and may compound the taxpayers' liabilities later on. It was a spending plan that only a juggler could love because, like the budget director's glib reply, it appeared to defy gravity. 
 "The Mayor, to his credit, did manage to put this bridge over the River Kwai together with the City Council," said Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation "While this rickety structure holds up, something more solid has to be built for the long haul."
Two weeks into the fiscal year, the city's $28.5 billion budget is still dependent on plenty of variables. While the politically sensitive State Financial Control Board, which reviews city finances, may wink at those uncertainties next month, many monitors in and out of government suggest that the balance between projected revenue and expenditures is largely illusory. They express deep skepticism that the budget will remain balanced all year without major revisions. Moreover, they are even more wary that, while the budget includes fewer gimmicks than most governments use, some current savings will cost more later, spending will continue to outpace revenues in a sluggish economy and deeper deficits will develop.
"I had one formulation that got up to more than $5 billion by 1996," said Elinor B. Bachrach, the Deputy State Comptroller for New York City. Her assessment of the budget: "I don't think anyone would claim it represents structural balance. It represents hanging on by the skin of your teeth."
The problem, she said, is not with the city's revenue projections, which may even prove conservative and are cushioned by a $150 million reserve. Rather, Ms. Bachrach said, "we see more than $150 million worth of problems on the spending side" -- about $100 million more, including higher overtime costs and interest payments, and perhaps as much as another $200 million if the city turns out to have shortchanged the Board of Education under a state formula that protects school systems from jarring budget cuts.
 
Iffy Assumptions
 In subsequent years, the city's financial plan may be even more precarious because it relies on iffy fiscal and political assumptions. The plan does not provide for pay increases for city employees, she said, and relies on hefty property tax increases, which the Council seems unlikely to pass and which edge closer to the constitutional tax limit, which is based on changing real-estate values.
 City officials point out that deficits are typically projected in the last years of the city's four-year plans, but have been bridged. This year's budget pressures may be ameliorated if the Dinkins Administration realizes its hopes to strike an agreement on concessions from organized labor and to persuade the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was created in 1975 to borrow on the city's behalf, to refinance $1 billion in bonds. But neither negotiation has progressed much. And, with thousands of workers already gone from the payroll and thus from union rolls, the pressure on labor leaders from remaining members to accept cuts that would restore jobs may not be as great. But Mr. Rohatyn has said his agency's cooperation is contingent on labor's participation in a comprehensive restructuring -- a word that has become to New York City government in the 1990's what infrastructure was to the 1980's.
"If people seriously expect M.A.C. to come forward to give the city long-term relief," he said, "it is quite out of the question for us to do it from a fiduciary, legal or moral point of view until there is a viable four-year plan on the table." Or even a viable one-year plan. Mr. Rohatyn, who this year is facing stiff competition for his customary role of Cassandra, described the current budget as "probably technically balanced" but "extremely fragile." The underlying question, he said, is, "Can it be maintained under normal economic conditions? And the answer is probably no."
The most likely tool for rebuilding the rickety budget bridge Mr. Rohatyn described may be the joint commission that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is forging with the Dinkins administration. "People will be unforgiving if nothing comes out of it because there's so much at stake," Mr. Rohatyn said. In the near term, what's at stake is whether the city can fend off the Financial Control Board, which could resume control if a gaping deficit emerges or the city can no longer borrow money. In the longer term, the stakes may be the very economic viability of a city that continues to spend more than it collects when a number of economists -- among them Herbert Beinstock of Queens College, former regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- predict that the city will not begin to reap the benefits of any recovery from the recession for a few years.
But as they bob toward solutions, public officials are swept backward by several undertows: the reluctance to be viewed as undermining the Mayor; the mindset, as Mr. Rohatyn called it, "that we are victims of a Greek tragedy -- that there are powers beyond our control that are creating this"; and a potential for complacency as each crisis is averted and the sense of urgency evaporates.
The city's financial plan was revised last week to reflect the budget as adopted. It will face its first credibility tests next month, when the city plans to sell securities and when Allen J. Proctor reports to the Financial Control Board he directs.
"You can tell Allen Proctor he can go on vacation," Mr. Michael, the budget director, exulted two weeks ago after reaching agreement with the Council. Instead, two days later the Control Board imposed stricter oversight. Mr. Proctor says he probably won't go on vacation until the end of August. Even then, he said, "if you mean 'when do we relax our effort?' -- we never do."

At the Summit, A Chance to Set the Stage For Growth

BYLINE: By LEONARD SILK

 BODY:
WHEN President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union arrives this week in London to ask leaders at the economic summit conference for help with his sinking economy, his presence will stand as a dramatic symbol of the West's victory in the cold war. But even without Mr. Gorbachev, this year's assembly of the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies would be of unusual significance.
With nationalism and economic regionalism on the rise and the world economy practically at a standstill, the Western powers can lead the way toward closer integration and more stable and vigorous growth, helping to create conditions for an enduring peace. Or they can let the world economy stagnate and fracture into competing trade blocs, setting the stage for future national and regional conflicts. 
 The risks of global economic stagnation are anything but theoretical. The United Nations has just released its World Economic Survey for 1991, showing that global economic growth slowed to 1 percent last year and is falling to zero this year. Since world population is growing by 1.8 percent a year, living standards are deteriorating for most of the world's 5.3 billion people, of whom more than 4 billion live in the poor countries of the third world and 405 million live in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Recession or a declining rate of economic growth in the rich industrial nations has aggravated the problems of the poor countries and of the Communist or formerly Communist countries seeking to become market democracies. The economic disaster in the East has exceeded the gloomiest expectations of Western economists. Last year, the Eastern European economies contracted by 11 percent. Unless growth accelerates in the industrial world, the plight of the third world and the ex-Communist countries will worsen.
At the London summit, one of the biggest challenges for the United States will be to persuade the central banks of the Western world to stimulate economic growth and push down interest rates by injecting more money into the international system. Faster growth in the West would provide the additional capital needed to check the deterioration of living standards in the third world and hasten the transition of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to market economies. Each 1 percent increase in the rate of Western economic growth, the United Nations estimates, would add $150 billion a year to the world supply of capital.
Because the international money supply has not been growing fast enough, world commodity prices have been falling and are now back to their 1987 lows. And with the demand for money outstripping the supply, interest rates remain too high. If monetary growth continues at so slow a pace, commodity prices will stay weak, aggravating the problems of the third world and Eastern Europe -- and of American and other Western farmers.
But the United States will have to convince other countries at the summit that in the soggy state of the world economy, monetary growth can be increased without creating inflation, as unemployed labor and other idle resources are brought back into production.
In press briefings before the summit, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said the "shared objectives" of all seven summit countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- are "a sustained recovery and price stability." President Bush's announcement last week of the reappointment of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board seemed designed to reassure the countries meeting in London, and financial markets throughout the world, that the Administration, while seeking faster growth, would not dump a demonstrated foe of inflation.
There are signs that the Administration is making progress in its effort to stress the importance of taking some risks for the sake of more rapid expansion. Earlier this month, the Bank of Japan voted to cut its discount rate by half a point, to 5.5 percent.
The United States will also find the summit an important forum for its continuing campaign to open world markets to freer trade in agriculture, manufactured goods, intellectual property, and financial and other services.
There is a serious risk today of a reversal in the trend toward freer world trade. The trade talks known as the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs almost came to grief with the breakdown in negotiations last December over the European Community's unwillingness to slash its subsidies to agriculture. Last week the executive commission of the European Community approved a farm proposal that could restart the trade talks. The proposal, which still must be acted on by the 12 member nations -- and which could be blocked by any one of them -- would cut production and subsidies to farmers. It represents, the commission said, "the most fundamental reshaping of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy" since it was created 30 years ago.
But the problems are not over. Peter B. Kenen, a Princeton University economist, said he worries that the Uruguay talks "will die with a whimper and no one will care very much, because everyone is trying to build regional arrangements to shelter their favorite markets."
Though the leading champion of an open world economy, the United States itself is pursuing its regional interests by building a free-trade zone with Canada and Mexico -- and may extend it further into Latin America.
Regional arrangements -- like the American free-trade zone, the European Community's "single market" of 1992 or Japan's closer ties with Asian countries -- can further the growth of world trade, provided they do not raise barriers around themselves.
At the same time, rules for the regulation of international finance must be strengthened. The global mess created by the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (a k a "the Bank of Crooks and Criminals International"), whose assets were seized by seven countries that charged the institution with fraud, reveals the need for better regulation in a shrinking, increasingly borderless world.
Indeed, another term for integration is "borderless." Private business is adapting to the global economy far more readily than governments because businesses seek profits anywhere in the world and politicians seek votes from national or local constituencies.
In hard times, popular and even business support for an open world economy frays. The public and private financial authorities who constitute the so-called Group of 30 described the situation last week in a pre-summit statement.
"Nationalism is on the rise," the group warned. "Europe and North America have renewed hostility toward Japan over its one-sided trade and investment flows. In Japan, a nascent nationalism is finding voice in a way that was unthinkable even a year or two ago. Several of the G-7 have residual resentments about the way the gulf war was waged and paid for."
And many Americans, especially in the Administration, have mirror-image resentments over the damp and grudging support they got from most of their allies in the war. The strain to the Western alliance is reflected in heightened trade and economic tensions.
Nationalist sentiments were held in check for four decades by the common perceived threat of Soviet aggression, but now that Communism is a spent force, Western cohesion -- Western is really a misnomer, since the West stretches to the Far East -- has been weakened.
At the same time, the ex-Communist countries' dash for freedom and independence came at a heavy economic cost. As East Germany united with West Germany, the Soviets slashed their purchases from their former vassals in the East, and Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, East Germany and the others slashed their trade with one another. The loss of markets caused a loss of jobs and a further contraction of markets. Lacking goods of a quality and price that they could sell in the West, Eastern Europe saw production and employment take a nosedive.
The new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, said Secretary Baker, stand "at what is really a critical juncture in their development of free market economies." The seven summit countries, he said, "will want to encourage them to promote competitive industries and businesses that can create jobs," and that of course will require increasing domestic and foreign investment. But, he added, "investors and businessmen are going to hold back if businesses don't have opportunities to sell their goods, and that in turn translates into a need to stress the opening of our markets to the exports from those countries."
The main reason the London summit is so critical is that it can strengthen economic cohesion and start the long task of laying the foundations for a more peaceful and prosperous 21st century -- after what has doubtless been the ugliest and most violent century in human history, an era that gave birth to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction. These could make the next century uglier still, unless the economic conditions of peace are firmly established.
Thus, the economic summit is closely linked to the arms negotiations with the Soviets that now appear to be very near a successful conclusion. Mr. Gorbachev's presence in London may help wind up a major arms agreement, which is of vital importance both politically and economically to the Soviet Union and the United States. This could be the sweetest fruit of summitry. It would rescue the "peace dividend" and provide the budgetary relief, savings and capital needed to establish the basis for stronger and more stable economic growth.

B.C.C.I.'s Fall Shows Gaps In Policing Global Fraud

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
THE fall of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has left a trail of scandal, billions of dollars in losses, tarnished reputations and unanswered questions. The shadowy banking empire exploited holes in the net of global banking supervision for years. Yet for banking regulators, there has been one measure of comfort: unlike notorious international banking failures in the past, the collapse of B.C.C.I. did not prompt a scare in the world's financial markets or banking system.
The coordinated swoop on July 5 by Britain and other countries to seize the bank's assets was a byproduct of reforms in international banking supervision in the wake of two previous major bank scandals, the 1974 failure of Germany's Bankhaus I.D. Herstatt and the 1982 collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano. The worldwide seizure was timed just before the financial markets opened that morning. "It relied on a very high degree of cooperaton by the central banks," said E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which orchestrates global banking regulation. 
 The joint action calmed the markets rather than stirring panic. "It reassured people that there was some international watchdog out there," observed Lawrence Kudlow, Bear Stearns's chief economist.
But the watchdogs moved slowly. It took them years to detect what they say is massive fraud. British officials say the hidden losses and phony loans dated back to before 1985 and surfaced only after the alarm was raised by some disgruntled B.C.C.I. employees and the bank's auditors.
B.C.C.I.'s founder, Agha Hasan Abedi of Pakistan, organized the bank's operations to avoid detection, putting key offices in the tax and regulatory havens of Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Then he worked with a coterie of front men to conceal B.C.C.I.'s hidden control of businesses, including the big bank holding company in Washington, First American Bankshares, whose chairman is the prominent lawyer and Democratic figure Clark Clifford. Mr. Clifford maintains that both he and the Federal Reserve were deceived about B.C.C.I.'s clandestine control of First American. As the bank expanded, Mr. Abedi tried to burnish its image by forging ties with prominent Westerners, donating generously to Jimmy Carter's charities and hiring a former British prime minister, James Callaghan, as a consultant.
 
Tracking Far-Flung Banks
 After the Herstatt and Banco Ambrosiano scandals, the member nations of the Basel committee agreed to try to track the finances of far-flung international banks. The regulators in "home" countries, typically the ones where banks were headquartered, would supervise a bank's activities worldwide and regulators in countries with branches of the bank would share information with the home-country regulator.
Luxembourg had the main responsibility as B.C.C.I.'s watchdog. After the small parent holding company received its banking license there in 1972, the bank gradually expanded to operate in more than 60 countries and amass a reported $20 billion in assets. But the tiny grand duchy, with 365,000 residents, whose main industry is providing an agreeable home for 180 banks, is known as a half-hearted regulator.
The weakness of this arrangement was evident early on. In 1976, for example, John G. Heimann, then New York State's Superintendent of Banks, oversaw the sale of a small local bank, Chelsea National. The proposed buyer was a young Pakistani whose annual income was $34,000. His banker was B.C.C.I., and when Mr. Heimann's staff sought more information, "it was clear this was a bank without a primary regulator," said Mr. Heimann. State officials told the Pakistani applicant that he had not given satisfactory answers; Chelsea National found another buyer.
The B.C.C.I. scandal, banking experts say, should prompt a closer look at what "home country" supervisors are responsible for tracking.
Estimates of the losses at B.C.C.I. start at $4 billion. Major Western banks appear to have had few deposits, partly because they regarded the bank as a pariah after it pled guilty last year in Florida to laundering drug money.
The bank's 120,000 depositors in Britain, including many small businesses of Asian and African immigrants, will probably absorb big losses. The Bank of England is trying to persuade Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi and B.C.C.I.'s largest shareholder, to inject $500 million or more to compensate them.
But the more pressing concern could be the money that third-world governments and central banks may have lost, and the political fallout from that. The bank assiduously courted third-world leaders. For example, it is accused of helping former President Alan Garcia of Peru hide funds in offshore accounts. He gave them substantial deposits from Peru's central bank. Private investigators working for Peru said that after Mr. Garcia was ousted in 1990, the funds were withdrawn. It remains unclear how many other countries were lucky enough to pull their money out in time.

10 Die a Day, Or Disappear, And Peru Goes Numb

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
FOR Peruvians, killings by guerrillas, the police and the military have become so common that any such death gets little reaction. It is the kind of news that papers often relegate to the inside pages, and that television news broadcasts have come to limit to one minute of air time.
Peru is a nation numbed by statistics. 
 Last year almost 3,400 Peruvians died in political violence, nearly 10 a day, and the number is expected to increase this year. June was the bloodiest month in Peru's 11-year history of internal violence; an average of 18 people a day died. And for the fifth year in a row, Peru, a nation of 22 million people, is likely to lead the world in the number of reported "disappearances" at the hands of Government authorities. Last year 302 people were reported missing after being forcibly detained.
"Life really isn't worth much any more in Peru," said Carlos Tapia, a former member of Congress and a leftist political analyst. "For you in the United States to have this kind of violence would mean more than 50,000 killed a year by police, the army and terrorists."
But last month, the country was shaken from its stupor with the murders of a 27-year-old medical student and two teenagers, whose capture by the Lima police was recorded by a television reporter. The deaths may have done more to focus the country's attention on abuse of human rights than years of talk.
The medical student, Freddy Rodriguez, was on his way to study with his girlfriend in the outskirts of Lima on June 22, when he happened to pass as the police raided a safehouse of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path, the country's most feared guerrilla group.
In a sweep of the area, Mr. Rodriguez and the two teenagers, Emilio Gomez, 14 years old, and his 17-year-old brother, Rafael, were stopped, bound and stuffed into the back of police cars. As the reporter's videotape shows, the arresting police officers kicked one of the victims and held rifle muzzles to their heads. Within hours the bodies of all three showed up at the morgue, all with bullet holes in them. Mr. Rodriguez, who had been heard to offer the police his medical student identification, received five bullet wounds to the head.
The outcry was so strong that President Alberto F. Fujimori ordered an investigation. Within days, several policemen were named as responsible and higher officials were also said to be under investigation.
The quick response also appears to be a byproduct of Peru's concern over its human rights report card, which is now being scrutinized, along with Peru's commitment against drug trafficking, as President Bush prepares to make a recommendation to Congress on $60 million in aid to the South American country.
No military official has ever been prosecuted for rights abuses here, although a few police officers have.
 
Distinguishing the Enemy
 "The military in particular has operated with tremendous impunity," said an official of a rights group who asked that he not be named. He noted that in the last three years an estimated 2.5 million people in Lima, or a third of the population, had been stopped and searched by the police or the military, and 9,000 had been detained.
Carlos Rodriguez, the father of Freddy Rodriguez, said, "There is no difference between the police and the Shining Path, when both are the ones who kill us."
In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Fujimori admitted that he was dissatisfied with Peru's rights record but said the blame is often misplaced. "There are denunciations over a number of disappeared persons and some indeed can be attributed to the forces of order," Mr. Fujimori said. "But you have to say that a good number of the disappeared persons should probably be attributed to terrorist groups."
Rights advocates said that one year after taking office Mr. Fujimori is hamstrung in addressing abuses because he does not appear to have control of all his police and armed forces. Such control is a condition of United States aid to Peru under the International Narcotics Control Act.
Without a rein on the police and the army, there are, in effect, two Perus. In Lima and other major cities, the elected officials govern and the judicial process is observed. But in the mountains and jungles, where more than 50 percent of the country lives, it is a different story. There, because of guerrilla activities, the population is under a state of emergency, and the law is effectively set and enforced by military commanders whose idea of justice may be shaped more often by fear than protocol.
"It's very hard to change things in the emergency zones," said Mr. Tapia. "When you ask commanders in these areas why they can't stop the disappearances, when they're really honest, they say: 'Look, my guys are being shot at every day. They make $30 a month. If they capture a terrorist and put him through the judicial process, he'll be out in days just to shoot at us again. We're in a war.' "
Those who would have Peru certified as eligible for the United States aid say that withholding the funds would only weaken Mr. Fujimori's hand against the guerrillas. In a nation where half of the people are so poor that they can't afford to eat regularly, withholding the aid could only exacerbate the economic straits.
That in turn could alienate even further a populace that already has a hard time distinguishing between the hard arm of the law and that of the Shining Path. And that is just the scenario the guerrillas want.

India Peers at Its Future With a Sense of Gloom

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
THE monsoon rains have failed to arrive on time in northern India, a bleak sign for the nation's food crop and an ominous portent for the new Government. With temperatures hovering around 110 degrees, electricity and water supplies in the capital disappeared for hours in recent days. As India's 10th Parliament opened last week, the newly elected lawmakers hugged each other, exchanged greetings and placed garlands of flowers around their leaders' shoulders. But the mood was decidedly sour.
"All of us have proved unequal to the challenges that are before the nation," grumbled Chandra Shekhar, the former Prime Minister. "If the leadership fails at this hour, I think we are entering into an era of total uncertainty. I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but the situation will be beyond redemption if this time we should fail." 
 Facing the most severe economic crisis in its 44-year history, the three-week-old minority Government of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and the politically divided Parliament have begun what, for many Indians, is a highly unusual exercise of self-criticism and self-doubt. For a nation that spent years lecturing the industrialized West, and especially the United States, about its flaws, the dispirited mood has been marked by an examination of India's past and present and the realization, for many Indians, that they don't especially like what they see.
Perhaps the most surprising acknowledgement is that one of the central architects of modern India, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his Congress Party disciples may have been flat wrong in their economic agenda: that the nation's Fabian socialist pursual of self-sufficiency and disdain for consumer goods was ruinous, that the notion of central planning borrowed from the Soviet Union was calamitous, that the use of deepening state controls on industries and trade was a blunder. A visit to the fringes of New Delhi -- to a village with its fetid open sewers, its blizzard of flies, its malnourished children and adults, its squalid mud huts -- shows vividly the failure of many of the policies that have shaped India since independence from Britain in 1947.
"Of course we're witnessing the repudiation of Nehruvian doctrine without anyone saying so," said Ashis Nandy, a political scientist at the Center for the Study of Developing Societies. "The idea that the state could play the primary role in rejuvenating India's economy is not even given lip service any more."
The impoverished villages that Nehru and his Congress Party heirs sought -- and failed -- to uplift are as grimly commonplace now as they were a decade ago. Well over a quarter of the nation's 850 million people earn no more than about $25 a month.
What is significant, however, is that at least one television set has now entered even many of the most primitive villages. The pictures of refrigerators and toilets, running water, clean clothes and other facets of middle-class life raise expectations, and India has witnessed an unprecedented level of restlessness and rage among the poor. In such backward states as Bihar -- where the literacy rate is officially 38 percent, but is probably far lower in reality -- gangs of the poor and so-called untouchables are increasingly murdering and hacking landlords and upper-caste Indians, out of sheer rage at their plight.
 
'There's So Much Hate'
 At the same time, the Government must also cope with rising Hindu-Muslim tensions and worsening insurgencies rooted in ethnic and religious quarrels in such states as Kashmir, the Punjab and Assam. In the capital, police and security forces are everywhere.
"There's so much hate in the land," said Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of modern India's spiritual founder, Mohandas K. Gandhi. "We have failed to deal with the anger and hates and hurts in people's minds. Why? I would say that above all it is a lack of a great common vision for the future. We have become an inward-looking, backward-looking, quarreling people."
Although Prime Minister Rao, who is 71 years old and frail, has moved to restore economic stability, he has yet to confront the other difficult issues that could stir political problems. The Congress Party, though stronger than any other party, is still 15 seats short of a majority in Parliament, and will have to depend on the support of other parties to pass legislation and remain in power. India has endured four governments in two years, and the opposition is in no mood for another election now; certainly it is in no mood to take over a nation on the edge of bankruptcy. Mr. Rao has pledged to open India to foreign competition, liberalize trade, scale down subsidies and overhaul the bureaucracy.
Publicly, the new Prime Minister speaks fondly of "Nehruvian principles," and of India's role as a leader of the nonaligned movement. But even some of Mr. Rao's closest aides admit that no one is quite sure any more what the nonaligned movement is, given the new cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States and the hunger for arms, even nuclear weapons, in third-world countries. The fact that few third-world leaders showed up for the funeral of Rajiv Gandhi rankles among Indians, who now also are more willing to admit that their efforts to preach on foreign policy issues probably do not deserve much attention in the United States and the Soviet Union.
"Just by giving a verdict on every problem, you do not get importance," the former Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar, a socialist politician, said on Indian television the other night. "If you are not able to solve your own problems in this country you cannot play an eminent role in world politics. Nothing can be more hypocritical than this."

South Africa Faces Lingering Wounds To Its Economy

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
WHEN the United States Congress enacted a tough package of sanctions against South Africa in 1986, President P. W. Botha responded with defiance.
"South Africans will not allow themselves to be humiliated in order to prevent sanctions," Mr. Botha said. "We do not desire and we do not seek it, but if we are forced to go it alone, so be it." 
 Last week, President Bush removed the sanctions embodied in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act and South Africans paused to consider the cost of Mr. Botha's boast. About $10 billion in badly needed capital has hemorrhaged out of South Africa since the mid-1980's. American assets in South Africa dwindled from $2.6 billion to $1.5 billion, according to the American Chamber of Commerce, which estimates that an additional $2 billion was lost annually in bilateral trade and investment. And 197 American companies disinvested, leaving 129 companies still in place.
But President Bush's decision to lift the sanctions seemed unlikely to have as much immediate impact. In the years before and since the American sanctions law was adopted, other obstacles have also grown up, and they will continue to inhibit any revival of trade and investment. For example, many American states and cities have adopted sanctions at the local level, and many companies that disinvested are wary of returning. And continuing violence and uncertainty about the economic direction of a post-apartheid South Africa also undermine investor confidence.
If sanctions worked in the sense that they inflicted pain on South Africa's business and political establishment, they also had lasting effects on black South Africans -- and not just in rising unemployment. "I believe sanctions have contributed to economic decline," said the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, who heads the Methodist Church in southern Africa. "Poor socio-political and economic conditions have in turn contributed to the violence that has raped our land and debilitated our people."
The president of the South African Chamber of Mines, Naas Steenkamp, warned that "South Africa's problems have not ended with the repeal of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act." One barrier involves contracting laws adopted by 26 states, 20 counties and 78 cities in the United States, according to the American Chamber of Commerce here. The laws punish companies that deal with South Africa, even indirectly, by barring them from local contracts. The African National Congress, which criticized the lifting of sanctions as premature, urged American supporters to continue using them to keep pressure on Pretoria.
President Bush expressed the hope that the states and cities would follow his example, but The Citizen, a pro-Government newspaper in South Africa, was pessimistic. "The sanctions lobby is still very much alive and will listen more to Mr. Nelson Mandela than to Mr. Bush," it said.
Chris Stals, the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, said the lifting of American sanctions would not immediately bring money back into South Africa because the country still did not qualify for loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Gramm Amendment passed by Congress in 1983 obliges the United States to block any South African request for financing from the I.M.F., and the Evans Amendment enacted in 1978 similarly denies import-export credits.
In addition, Wayne Mitchell, the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa, said the American companies that had disinvested were particularly cautious about returning "because they've been here and had their fingers burned." And some American companies have shifted to more potentially lucrative markets in Eastern Europe or Asia.
South African business executives seem likely to move faster than Americans to explore trade opportunities. But they may find it hard to climb back into the American market, whose consumers have grown accustomed to boycotting South African products. In the years since sanctions were imposed, other countries have filled American import quotas that were taken away from South Africa. For example, South Africa's sugar quota was given to the Philippines. And South African Airways may have difficulty reclaiming the landing rights it lost in 1986, if only because of congestion at American airports.
In South Africa, some militant black organizations and labor unions have threatened strikes and demonstrations against Western companies that try to return.
"American companies that fall in line with sanctions-busting must expect to be subjected to the wrath of the black working class," said Strini Moodley, the spokesman for the Azanian Peoples Organization, a black consciousness movement.
Foreign investors are also reluctant to return to South Africa while politically motivated violence is destabilizing its black townships. And they are confused by the African National Congress's mixed signals on foreign investment, nationalization and the redistribution of wealth.
"You need stability and you need predictability, and without stability and predictability, companies are not going to put their money back in," said Cedric Suzman, the South African-born vice president of the Southern Center for International Studies in Atlanta.
Still, the gesture of appreciation that President Bush extended to President de Klerk last week, along with the readmittance of the country to Olympic competition by the International Olympic Committee the day before, gave a psychological boost to South Africa. "It's just the sort of thing that we need to kick us out ofthis recession," said Philip Timperley, a Johannesburg businessman. "There can't be too many South Africans who are unhappy with the events of the past couple of days."

HEADLINE: Donors Look for Benefit From Charities

 BODY:
In "United Way Warns Agencies of Drop in Allocations" [June 16], the president of the Westchester/Putnam branch of the organization says, "Something interesting is happening out there." Certainly is.
 Contrary to the sense of the article, 1990 was the best year in United Way's history. Nationally, it topped $3 billion for the first time. Locally, it raised over $15 million or 0.8 percent more than in 1989. 
 That the recession, changes in corporate attitudes and sacrifices by staffs at local nonprofits have become standard components of United Way's explanation of what is happening -- rather than basic changes in donors' attitudes -- comes from an apparent belief among the agency's executives that the more you lament, the more attention you get.
 On the contrary, lamentations mostly bring forth counterlamentations from givers worried about changing economic tides, population shifts and so forth. Furthermore, those people capable of making major contributions (and probably most of the people who make smaller gifts) seek solutions to social problems as a result of their giving, not complaints. Above all, they don't want to hear the same arguments for making pledges that have been used for generations.
 When United Way came into existence, it appears to have had two major objectives. First, to make certain that those who received the largesse not only showed up on time for work on Monday mornings but stayed out of trouble with the law. And second, to ban from their offices hordes of solicitors seeking donations. In the big houses on the high hills, they didn't much care which folk dances the rest of the population enjoyed. Nor did they particularly worry about what lower orders thought, unless they thought about socialism.
 But by 1991, as studies at Yale and elsewhere during the 1980's amply demonstrate, things are different. Government now takes the major responsibility for financing solutions to social problems. And lower echelons in corporations don't demonstrate great enthusiasm for giving to make managers and vice presidents look good to presidents or chairmen of the board. Similarly, workers hardly become ecstatic about making foremen look good to managers and vice presidents. Put another way, unless prospective donors see how they can benefit (not only spiritually, but practically), their enthusiasm becomes muted. It is for this reason that black groups have successfully contested United Way's exclusive right to raise funds during designated periods in several cities.
No, the main issue isn't United Way's tight-money situation. The main issue is how we will deal with perceptions of voluntary giving at a time when we can barely pay our taxes.

'Pounding' Mr. Bush

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
On the day he lifted sanctions against South Africa, George Bush complained that he was taking a "pounding" from black leaders who did not think he cared about blacks or civil rights. It might well be replied: Why should they?
Mr. Bush not only seemed wounded by the obtuse world he sees out there; he indulged himself in Bushspeak -- a language, or something -- a local alderman might not dignify with use. 
 "Hey, listen, we got a good record on civil rights," said this graduate of Andover, Yale and affluence. "We got a good civil rights bill."
Hey, listen, we also got a President that don't talk as good as Lincoln. Or Eisenhower neither.
Mr. Bush acted on South Africa over the protests of Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress, the South African Council of Churches, the Congressional Black Caucus and the N.A.A.C.P. on grounds that progress already made toward ending apartheid was "irreversible." He was convinced, he said, that ending sanctions also would "encourage further change."
Those may prove to be defensible reasons; certainly it remains to be seen whether lifting sanctions will further the release of the 850 political prisoners Amnesty International believes still are behind bars in South Africa. But defensible or not, Mr. Bush's decision is one more in a series not likely to endear him to most black Americans and many whites.
You don't have to start as far back as Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey; he cited Congressman George Bush's opposition to a civil rights bill in 1964. Begin, instead, with the famous Willie Horton ad that helped elect Mr. Bush in 1988.
He protested that the ad wasn't racist but only asked if voters believed "in a furlough program that releases people from jail so they can go out and rape, pillage and plunder again." But it was a black who was depicted in "rape, pillage and plunder." Mr. Bush, moreover, repeated the ad's false message. Most prison furlough programs have been successful in helping inmates return to straight life; and no inmate ever has been released on purpose to "go out and rape" etc. all over again.
Then there's the civil rights bill Mr. Bush vetoed last year and opposes in this year's version. If Congress really wants a civil rights bill, he insisted, "pass mine, pass mine now." By the same logic, if the President really wants such a bill, he could "accept theirs, accept theirs now."
But Senator John Danforth, a Republican, could not negotiate a compromise rights bill with the Bush White House. He now says the real difference in the two measures is that the Bush version would allow employers to erect job qualifications having no relevance to job requirements. Mr. Bush says the Democrats are pushing a "quota bill," and no doubt will try to make quotas the burning issue in 1992 that Willie Horton was in 1988.
The President supports a policy upheld by the Supreme Court that prevents poor women from receiving information about abortion in federally funded clinics. He says he could agree to an "acceptable" compromise, but must maintain his "fundamental position" -- which makes compromise hard to imagine.
Now Mr. Bush has nominated Clarence Thomas to succeed Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court, though Judge Thomas is suspect among many blacks for his opposition to affirmative action. The Congressional Black Caucus opposes him and the N.A.A.C.P. has not yet decided whether to back him. Mr. Bush defends his choice as "the best" -- not the best black but "the best" -- but the President can hardly be surprised if those who revered Justice Marshall's achievements don't regard Judge Thomas as highly.
More important, most American blacks are still on the economic fringe, including many who have dead-end jobs. Black unemployment runs about twice as high as that of whites. For black youths, joblessness and hopelessness are astronomical.
George Bush's "fundamental position" against abortion, even advice about abortion, hits hardest against such desperate groups. He has made little effort to attack or alleviate poverty and unemployment, preferring instead to keep pounding away for a capital-gains tax break for the rich. Denouncing quotas and deploring critics are no substitute for economic policies that might create enough jobs to go around, and hope for all.
So to repeat: Why should they think he cares?

HEADLINE: The Paradoxes of Help

BYLINE: By By Vaclav Havel; Vaclav Havel is President of Czechoslovakia.

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
When I addressed the joint session of Congress in February 1990, I made the following remark: "I often hear the question, How can the United States of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been: you can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy." As a rule, I do not quote myself, but recently people have asked me, often in anticipation of the forthcoming summit meeting of the Group of Seven and of the meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev there, whether I still stood by what I said then, and what I really meant.
To account for my affirmative answer to the former question I have to answer the latter first. Too many people took for granted that I meant economic help, which I did not -- that is, not only, not even mainly. I meant that it was in the interests of my country, of Europe and of the whole world to help make the Soviet Union a more free, more democratic and more stable place, with the emphasis on democracy. 
 The experience of the postwar period has shown us that no amount of economic assistance will make a totalitarian country more prosperous unless it is also made more democratic.
In the beginning of 1990, the Soviet Union was still largely undecided about where it was going, and any economic assistance would most likely have gone down the bottomless drain of bureaucracy, incompetence and corruption. This situation has changed. The democratic forces are trying to organize themselves and to make a radical break with the past. The former Foreign Minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, and his colleagues from the democratic camp are the foremost representative of this trend. Progress has also been made in talks about the new union treaty. Although its final shape is still unclear, one thing seems certain: the republics and the political and economic reform they advocate will play an ever more important role. The Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, will hardly have to leave the offices of Western governments through the back door again. And, finally, it seems Mikhail Gorbachev himself is now more committed to reform than ever before.
There should be, however, explicit guarantees that the Soviet Union will not revert to its totalitarian, imperial past, and will not threaten other countries in the future. The situation may present an opportunity for democracy and peace in the world for decades to come. It also presents a risk should the antidemocratic forces in the Soviet Union prevail again and use whatever outside assistance might come to bolster their obsolete regime.

 An evaluation of both the opportunity and the risk shows several things about the nature of assistance to the Soviet Union that could be forthcoming: it should be assistance to the people and politicians with a democratic mandate rather than to the bureaucrats. It should be conditional on the Soviet Union clearly showing its willingness not to project its force outside its territory and to let all its neighbors choose their own way, including those republics of the present Soviet Union with aspirations to determine their own destiny independently -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in particular. It should be assistance to the individual republics, with ever-increasing rights, rather than to the center of the union. And it should be a thousand points of small assistance targeted to specific areas of a newly created market economy rather than one big bulk assistance designed to support the original pillars of the crumbling edifice. The decision in each case should depend on the economic merits of a project rather than on the arbitrary will of central planners.
In this connection, we come across another paradox. How can one reconcile the obvious need for stability in Europe and the Soviet Union with the equally obvious longing of a number of peoples there for emancipation from the central power? How can one reconcile the stated principle of territorial integrity of states with the equally stated principle of self-determination of nations? When assistance is discussed, should it be applied in support of the former or the latter principle?
There is no easy solution to this except perhaps more democracy. The trend in democratic countries seems to be toward both integration and differentiation, toward both increasing the identity of the regions and diminishing the importance of the frontiers. When this principle is applied to the vast territory of the Soviet Union, it would seem to speak in favor of assisting the most promising areas, the islands of positive deviation which could later spread over the whole area, regardless of its future internal structure.
The question, of course, is what those new islands are and what would be the most adequate form of help to each of them. The lack of experience with the transformation of ossified totalitarian regimes into functioning market economies with democratic governments, as well as the size of the country and of the population, make the task almost impossible to solve. Yet some precedents are already there.
They are the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have already embarked irreversibly on the road to pluralist democracy and a market economy. For 40 years, they shared the same totalitarian system imposed on them by the Soviet Union. After overthrowing the system in peaceful popular revolutions, they have to cope with the same problems of transformation, privatization and democratization.
Of these countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland seem to have made the most progress so far. With moderate economic assistance from the West, they have introduced changes. Most Western analysts now recognize that these three countries have every chance of succeeding. If and when they do, their success will also be an example, model and measuring rod for other countries of the region, including the Soviet Union and the peoples of Yugoslavia, which is undergoing a painful transition toward its new shape.
The economic reform in Czechoslovakia started in earnest on Jan. 1 of this year, 12 months after the victory of democratic forces, with a strong mandate of free elections. On that date, most price controls were lifted and the currency made convertible, thus opening up the country to market forces. Several weeks later, the first of tens of thousands of small enterprises, services and shops started to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Big industries are being made ready for privatization as well. Legislation has been passed to open up the country to foreign investors and to protect their investments.
Six months later, the first results are encouraging. After an initial and expected sharp rise in prices, the month-to-month inflation rate is now less than 2 percent and showing signs of decreasing even further. The currency is stable after the initial devaluation. Even before privatization proper has started, new joint ventures and stock companies have secured new commercial foreign investments exceeding $5 billion .
In spite of the Government's strict monetary policies, which include tight wage controls, the Government enjoys massive public support. There has been no large-scale social unrest or industrial action. The tripartite talks between the Government, entrepreneurs and unions have so far managed to settle amicably all potential sources of conflict. The majority of the population is strongly committed to the transformation.
The process is now entering its structural and adaptive phase. Some industries will have to close, others will have to undergo a costly recapitalization. The unemployment rate, now around 3 percent of the labor force, will rise. It will be in this crucial phase that we shall not be able to do without assistance from the most developed countries.
One form of assistance would seem to be particularly helpful. It would be the opening of trade between the West and Czechoslovakia (Hungary and Poland) to compensate for the collapse of our traditional markets in the Soviet Union and other countries of the late Comecon.
To protect at least in part the still fragile economy and to balance the so far one-sided orientation of Czechoslovakian trade, the opening would have to be asymmetrical, thus favoring Czechoslovakian exports to the West, including the "sensitive items" such as textiles, steel and agricultural products. Because of the relatively low competitive value of our goods and limited production capacities, the volume of the exports could never seriously threaten the domestic markets or the balance of trade of Western countries.
It is part of our strategy to integrate Czechoslovakia into the family of European nations. By the end of the century, we hope to become full members of the European Community. The association agreement being negotiated between our country and the E.C. should envisage our full membership and pave the way for it. It should also reflect the initial asymmetry in our trade exchange and thus open the European markets to our products.
We would welcome a more flexible approach by the E.C., giving us access to their markets now, for we will be facing the biggest problems in the transformation process in the very near future. The competitive atmosphere of the European market will help increase the quality of our goods. The agreement will also open the way for a broad political dialogue and close cooperation with the E.C. countries. Our friends in Hungary and Poland are following the same strategy. We feel we will have a better chance to attain this goal by cooperation with the two countries rather than by competition.
Because of our long association with the Soviet market and because of the similar character of the transformation process, the changes in the Soviet Union present both an opportunity and a problem to our economies. The Soviet Union is interested in buying our goods but does not have the money to pay for it. The resulting drop in trade between the two countries threatens the fragile balance of our economy and leads to a further increase of the Soviet debt to Czechoslovakia, estimated at $4 billion. Hungary and Poland are experiencing similar difficulties.

 It would help the Soviet Union and it would help us if a part of the possible Western credits to the Soviet Union were set aside to finance Soviet payments for our exports to their country. This is basically the idea Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, Jiri Dienstbier, introduced at Harvard last year. Polish and Hungarian foreign policy experts and economists have voiced their own versions of the same idea. Some of the leading Western European banks are also studying the possibility of similar operations. The same principle could be applied to the food aid that the Soviet Union may need. It could help solve the problem of our agricultural surpluses without disturbing the balance of the already saturated agricultural markets in the West.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe should never again be limited in their sovereignty, which includes their right to make their own security arrangements. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany and Poland is of primary importance, and there is no need for it to be delayed or slowed down. A negotiated and peaceful departure of the troops is a prerequisite for a full renewal of the sovereignty of the two countries.
Unfortunately, remnants of the old imperial thinking still linger in the Soviet Union as evidenced by disagreements over security clauses in talks about new bilateral treaties between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, and by the so-called Falin doctrine, which bears a sad resemblance to the infamous Brezhnev doctrine [Soviet intervention to prevent a retreat from Communism]. This is all the more anachronistic, for Mikhail Gorbachev himself takes a more enlightened view of the new treaties in holding that they should be based on the principles of the Paris Charter for the New Europe.
We never accepted the efforts of some Soviet politicians to equate the Warsaw Pact with NATO. For us, NATO constitutes the main pillar of European security, supplemented by other institutions, such as the West European Union and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
An American presence on the Continent has been the backbone of the defense of freedom and democracy for 40 years, and is, in my view, still needed here. It presents no threat to the Soviets but rather a guarantee of peace and stability for the whole of Europe, and the Soviets should accept it as such.
I cannot conclude but with yet another paradox. In our painful transition toward a state of affairs that most people in the West consider quite natural, Western countries can indeed help us most of all by helping the Soviet Union on its way to democracy. At the same time, in the more difficult transformation of the Soviet Union, Western countries can conceivably help it most by helping Czechoslovakia and other countries in Central Europe -- to show that it can be done and that it is well worth the effort. The countries of Central Europe can become a center of stability and a source for the diffusion of democratic values and benefits to the whole post-Communist region.

How to Make a Meadow
 
 Many plants depend on insects to spread the pollen needed for fertilization. When we see a meadow thick with wildflowers, we're actually looking at a landscape made possible and farmed by a variety of flying insects. Friedrich G. Barth explains in "Insects and Flowers: The Biology of a Partnership" (Princeton University, paper).  
 The greater the number of plants existing side by side and even blooming at the same time, all of which depend on cross-pollination, the stronger is the selection pressure on each to be unique, to look different from the competitors and have an unmistakable scent. Insects -- at first attracted by the abundant pollen offerings -- were involved in this process from the very beginning of flower evolution. . . . The diversity of the devices employed by the flowers reflects the diversity of ways to be more attractive, so that the insects will help them reproduce under the pressure of competition. Conversely, the plants also help to shape the insects, which are exposed to equally strong pressure of competition. The insect with the best chance of harvesting the food is the one with mouthparts best suited to exploit a certain flower economically, and with the most suitable sensory abilities and behavior. . . . In this sense the plants and their pollinators are environment and reflection of one another.
 
In Search of the Vanishing World

 
 Robert Eisner suggests some reasons for the strong resurgence of interest in travel writing, and identifies the special challenge facing travel writers in an increasingly open and familiar world, in "Travelers to an Antique Land: The History and Literature of Travel to Greece" (University of Michigan).
As tourism cloys, a taste for travel and for travel literature is growing anew. In the past, curiosity about the unknown and a lack of opportunity to travel themselves enticed readers to travel literature. Today it may be a dissatisfaction with their own prepaid low swoops into the alien that drives them to seek something deeper through the literature. Conversely, the travel writer's task has become harder -- to find the choice and the special out there amidst the creeping quotidian and the shrinking alien, and to keep on finding it for two or three hundred pages.
 
The Voice of the Defiant

 
 Reflecting on her father, a transplanted Yankee who embraced the qualities he identified as uniquely Southern, Shirley Abbott discerned in his behavior a key feature of the Southern character and described it in "Womenfolks: Growing Up Down South" (Ticknor & Fields, paper).
Whatever the nature of the Southern identity, my father isolated one element of it and made himself Southern by absorbing it. He never voiced it, but something like this went through his head: "I'm not like you, and though you may send an army against me, I won't give up, and I won't change my ways either, and the reason I won't is that I'm better than you." This, of course, is the voice of the whipped and defiant, the underground. Blacks have said the same of themselves against whites. It is no accident that the idea of passive resistance occurred to Martin Luther King Jr. when and where it did, though he attributed the notion to Gandhi. Men of all races, indeed, have used the tactic against all manner of terrifying antagonists -- the church, the law, the military. And women have used it against men. If Southern history has no other meaning, this is the one worth preserving: that there is something better than success, than being top dog, than having the habit of command.
 
Literature's Green, Eternal Fields

 
 In this excerpt from his diary the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) argues that only literature bestows a kind of immortality on the fragile beauties of life. This is from "The Book of Disquiet" (Pantheon).
Literature -- art wed to thought, attained without the stain of reality -- seems to me to be the goal toward which every human effort ought to strive, if that effort were really human and not an animal superfluity. I think that to say a thing is to retain its virtue and throw out its terror. Fields are greener in the saying than they are in their own verdure. Flowers, if they are described with phrases that could define them in the air of imagination, will have colors of a permanence that cellular life does not permit. To move is to live, to speak is to survive. There is nothing real in life that is not real because someone described it well.
 
Time Like an Arrow

 
 Michael O'Malley reminds us of some of the many symbols by which we have sought to understand and explain the passage of time in this excerpt from "Keeping Watch: A History of American Time" (Penguin, paper).
Western European cultures have traditionally understood time both as a circle -- a series of repeated natural events like sunrise and sunset or the passing seasons -- and as an arrow, shot by God at the dawn of time and stopping only God knows where. Linear and cyclical time have always co-existed, and still co-exist, in our thinking, just as any given society may contain different and even contradictory ideas about time. We depict time, for example, as both a dial, with its endlessly repeated sequence of twelve hours, and as years, totaling an ever higher number toward an uncertain future. Linear time may mean technological and industrial "progress" into that future; it may also recall the inevitability of death and decay. Cyclical time often accompanies the idea of balance in nature, but it just as often recalls the repetitive, clocklike movements of machinery. Our time, in a sense, is like a hoop rolling down a road. In different phases of history and culture we emphasize different aspects of time's duality.

Contract Collusion? Some Think So

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH

 BODY:
Though neither side is willing to make a definitive statement on the matter, National Football League teams and the representatives of players who are negotiating contracts with the various clubs suspect one another of collusion.
 When the Players Association functioned as a union, it could pool salary information and then share it with players and their agents. The N.F.L. Management Council functioned in the same capacity for the league's teams. Now that the Players Association has declared that it is no longer a union, it is not supposed to be a clearinghouse for salary information. It denies that it is. The management council also denies that it is supplying salary information to teams. 
But both player agents and N.F.L. team executives admit that contract talks are not being conducted in a vacuum. They also say they don't know where the leaks are coming from.
 "I'll have agents come in and they'll start telling me what this player was offered by this team or what that player got from that team," said Mike Brown, Cincinnati's assistant general manager. "I don't know where they got the information. I don't accept it, because there isn't any way to verify it."
 Last year, Brown added "nondisclosure clauses" to all player contracts, which penalized the player 10 percent of the total value of the contract if the salary figures were ever made public. Although salaries of Bengals players were published, Brown never invoked the clause, saying the salary information he saw was not accurate.
 When asked if he thought the agents were sharing information, Brown indicated that he did.
 Leigh Steinberg, the West Coast mega-agent who represents three first-round picks this year, said he doesn't share salary information.
 "Do lawyers talk with each other? Yes," he said. "Do I have the slightest idea of what is going on with the signing of players in proximity to Dan McGwire? I do not. Do I know what's going on with the players below Eric Turner? I do not."
 Meanwhile, The Associated Press reported last week that the N.F.L. plans to subpoena 10 agents in connection with a suit the league has filed against the Players Association charging it with collusion in fixing salaries. Maybe the truth will eventually surface.
 
Rembert's Troubled Patterns
 Reggie Rembert, the second-round Jets pick in 1990 who was then sent to Cincinnati in a trade for linebacker Joe Kelly, is walking a very thin line with the Bengals these days because of a number of off-field incidents.
 Rembert, a 6-foot-4-inch, 200-pound receiver, spent all of last season with the Bengals on injured reserve. He was recovering from a pulled hamstring, but more than that, he was trying to learn Coach Sam Wyche's complex offense. Now, he will need a strong showing in training camp to make Cincinnati management forget about his transgressions.
 Last winter, Rembert was charged with public intoxication after police in Covington, Ky., found him asleep behind the wheel of his car. He pleaded guilty and was fined $67.
 At the time, Rembert was supposed to be getting off-season tutoring on the offense from several of the Bengals' assistant coaches. But he missed several sessions without offering any excuses for his absences.
 Then, on May 22, Rembert was charged in Covington with driving under the influence of alcohol, operating a vehicle without a license and reckless driving. The case is set for a jury trial in on July 31.
Shortly after that incident, he got into a fight with a flower vendor in the parking lot of a nightclub in Covington. He was charged with assault, and a trial is scheduled for Aug. 1.
 In June, Rembert spent two weeks at an alcohol-rehabilitation clinic in Minneapolis after Brown strongly recommended he do so. Rembert has also enrolled in an outpatient alcohol- treatment center at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati.
 The Bengals like Rembert's size and speed, and would like to pencil him in as the No. 3 receiver behind Eddie Brown and Tim McGee. But without any tangible returns on the field, his antics could place him in the unemployment line.
 
They're Out of This World
 As of last Friday, 80 World League of American Football players had signed free-agent contracts with N.F.L. teams. The Montreal Machine, which finished 4-6, saw 11 of its players signed, the most of any World League team. The New York/New Jersey Knights had five players signed to contracts.
 
Bigger Expectations for Jets
 The Jets open training camp on Tuesday at Hofstra University with rookies and veterans reporting together. Expectations are even higher this season now that Coach Bruce Coslet has been on the job for a year. Last year, the Jets finished 6-10, despite having an offense that committed only 24 turnovers. Only three other teams in the league finished with fewer turnovers than the Jets.

Digital Diplomat

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Just a trade show or two ago, executives in the electronics industry were steadfastly adhering to their blood oath not to pay royalties to the music industry. But in a remarkable sea change last week, the industry agreed to compensate rock stars, songwriters and music publishers for profits lost to home recordings made using the latest digital technology.
 The recession and the need to spark life into the consumer electronics business are getting some of the credit for the landmark agreement. So is John V. Roach, the 52-year-old chairman and chief executive of the Fort Worth-based Tandy Corporation. 
No one had a larger role to play in getting the process under way than John Roach," said Jason Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of America.
Mr. Roach's interest goes beyond aspirations to become the Henry Kissinger of the audio industry. Tandy, as part of an attempt to improve sales at its Radio Shack stores, is planning to introduce a sophisticated digital compact cassette player (DCC) next year, using technology licensed from Philips N.V. Mr. Roach plans on "using DCC as a springboard for making Tandy a presence in the United States audio business," said Paul Gluckman, managing editor of Audio Week, a newsletter.
 To do that, Mr. Roach needs Michael Jackson and other stars on digital cassette, and without the royalty agreement, the music industry was refusing to let their recordings be played at the digital party.
 "Tandy wants to market DCC next year without the encumbrance of a political hassle," said Mr. Gluckman.
 Mr. Roach is also clearing the way for Tandy's long-promised recordable compact disk, which has been delayed for several years because of technical problems.
 Said Mr. Berman, of the Recording Industry Association, "He introduced a businessman's perspective."

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING ON: Cape Cod

BYLINE: By SETH S. KING; SETH S. KING, a former national correspondent for The New York Times, lives on Cape Cod.

 BODY:
On Labor Day many Cape Codders celebrate "Over the Bridge Day," gathering on Route 6 overpasses to hang out signs bidding good-natured farewells to summer visitors. Sometimes these aren't so gentle; one favorite declares "Goodbye and Close the Gate Behind You." But you may not see that one this year. Instead, travelers to the Cape will find that people serving them or selling them something will be wearing buttons handed out by the Chamber of Commerce proclaiming "We're Glad You're Here!"
After one of the worst economic winters in recent memory, when unemployment reached 17 percent, members of the Cape's commercial community depend more than ever on tourists to keep them afloat until next summer. 
 Consequently, there is now more of everything on the Cape -- more theater, music (especially jazz; the Cape Cod Jazz Society, [508] 394-5277, has current listings), art shows, whale-watching and sightseeing cruises, and more houses for sale. And with some of the Cape's best weather coming in September, more places are staying open longer into the autumn.
 
Beaches
 Cape Cod boasts of having the most miles of clean, sandy public beaches in the Northeast. There are 77 beaches in all, and they begin at the Cape Cod Canal and end 70 miles later at Race Point, near Provincetown. The waters of Cape Cod Bay, along the north side, are quieter and shallower, making them more suitable for small children. Those on Nantucket Sound, the south side, are generally deeper and have more surf. The big waves, to the delight of the surfers, break on Nauset Beach in Orleans -- a favorite of the younger crowd -- and all along the National Seashore. Virtually all of the Cape's north and south coastlines are open to the public and most do not charge those who walk in, though there is usually a parking fee.
Fifteen of the Cape's towns maintain beaches, providing lifeguards and cleanup crews and -- at some -- concession stands and changing rooms. They also maintain parking lots at which they charge daily parking fees of $8 or $10. Besides Nauset, other outstanding town beaches are Mayflower on the north side in Dennis and Sea Gull beach on the south side in West Yarmouth.
Along the eastern arm of the Cape, which the locals call the Backside, there are more than 40 miles of unspoiled National Seashore, from Orleans to Race Point. The National Park Service operates two visitor centers -- one at Salt Pond in Eastham, the other at Race Point -- which provide maps showing all parking areas. They are open 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily. There is a daily parking fee of $5 a car, $2 a person if walking in. A season's parking pass costs $10 a car.
 
Sights
 The Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, (508) 349-2615, off Route 6 in South Wellfleet, is open daily from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M. Operated by the Massachusetts Audubon Society, the 1,000-acre area has well-marked, easily walked trails along Wellfleet Bay. Among other programs, sanctuary biologists conduct walks daily through August at 9 A.M. and 2 P.M. Admission to the sanctuary is $3 (free for society members); the walks are free, though there are charges for some other programs.
When it rains, visitors interested in the outdoors can turn to the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History, (508) 896-3867, on Route 6A in Brewster. It is open Monday to Saturday from 9:30 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. and Sunday from 12:30 to 4:30 P.M.; closed Monday after Oct. 12. The museum has an extensive collection of Cape wildlife and exhibits explaining the geology, flora and fauna of the area. Admission is $2.50.
On display at the Provincetown Museum, (508) 487-1310, at the base of the Pilgrim Monument, is "The Treasures of the Pirate Ship Whydah," artifacts from the ship of the infamous pirate Samuel (Black Sam) Bellamy sunk off the shoals of Wellfleet in 1717 and identified in 1984. Included are the ship's bell, cannon and other arms. The museum and the exhibit are open daily; through September hours are 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., and closing time is 4 or 5 P.M. the rest of the year. Admission to the monument, the museum, and the Whydah exhibit is $5; $3 provides entry to the museum and monument but not the exhibit.
 
Events and Arts
 The 126th annual Barnstable County Fair, (508) 563-3200, takes place July 22 to 28 at the County Fair Grounds, about two and a half miles west of the Mashpee rotary in East Falmouth. This is an old-fashioned country fair with music and entertainment (including Chubby Checker and Helen Reddy) in the natural amphitheater, judging of farm products and animals, horse and pet shows, and a midway. Admission is $5.
Cape Playhouse, (508) 385-3911, on Route 6A in Dennis, marks its 65th season with performances in July and August, including "Where's Charley?" starring Jamie Torcellini, and "Man of La Mancha," with John Raitt. Performances are Monday to Saturday at 8:30 P.M., with matinees Wednesday and Thursday at 2:30. Tickets are $10 to $25.
The Monomoy Theater, (508) 945-1589, on Route 28 in Chatham, presents a season of repertory through Aug. 24 by the Ohio University Players, including "An Enemy of the People," "Tartuffe," "The Bad Seed," "The Philadelphia Story" and "Twelfth Night."

Mashpee Commons Performing Arts Festival, (508) 477-5400, takes place July 28 to Aug. 10, at a shopping center designed to look like a New England village, just off the Mashpee rotary on Route 28. Music, ballet and drama are presented every evening, usually at 7. There will be children's programs on some afternoons. All entertainment is free.
"Magic by the Sea" is a new family-oriented magic show performed every Monday and Wednesday to Aug. 23 and 24 at 8 P.M. in the Barnstable Comedy Club Theatre, Village Hall, on Route 6A in Barnstable Village. Tickets are $5.

Performances, through Aug. 22, are at 8 P.M. All tickets are $6.
 
Where to Stay
 One of the nicest bed and breakfasts on the Cape is Ashley Manor, (508) 362-8044, on Route 6A just east of the village of Barnstable, on two acres with a tennis court. The house, originally built in 1699, has six guest rooms, all with private baths, fireplaces and decorated with antiques, at $100 to $165 a night a room, including full breakfast. Also on two acres, the Wedgewood Inn, (508) 362-5157, on Route 6A in Yarmouth Port, is a Greek revival house built in 1812. It has six rooms, all with private bath at $105 to $145 a night for the room, including full breakfast and tea.
There are associations that have extensive listings, such as Bed & Breakfast Cape Cod, Post Office Box 341, West Hyannis Port, Mass. 02672, (508) 775-2772, which lists more than 85 homes and small inns with rates from $50 to $185. Orleans Bed & Breakfast Association, Post Office Box 1312, Orleans, Mass. 02653, (800) 541-6226, has more than 75 listings on the lower Cape from Harwich and Chatham to Truro, with the average double at $65.
Chatham Bars Inn, (800) 527-4884, is a landmark on the shore of Pleasant Bay in Chatham, with sprawling Cape-style main inn and surrounding cottages. A double in the main inn starts at $220 including breakfast and dinner, and $140 without meals. Cottages start at $395 for a one-bedroom with breakfast and dinner and at $315 without meals.

Budget choice: Governor Prence Motor Inn, Route 6A in Orleans. (508) 255-1216, is on a five-acre site and has a swimming pool. It is a five-minute drive to Nauset Beach. A double room is $80; $52 after Sept. 3.
 
Where to Eat
 The Cranberry Moose, (508) 362-3501, in Yarmouth Port on Route 6A, is one of the Cape's more interesting restaurants, serving food with a Mediterranean accent. The short menu changes periodically, but usually includes house specials such as rack of lamb with pistachio crust and black currant sauce, $24.75, or Mediterranean seafood stew for two, $38. Dinner for two with appetizer, entree and wine is about $96. Reservations are essential in summer.
Scargo Cafe, (508) 385-8200, across from the Cape Playhouse on Route 6A in Dennis, serves seafood, chicken, veal and pasta dishes. Scrod bonne femme, baked in a creamy white sauce, at $11.95 is a longtime favorite. Dinner for two with appetizer, entree and modest wine, is about $55.
The Roadhouse Cafe, (508) 775-2386, in Hyannis on South Street east of the West Main Street rotary, is a casual Italian place. Favorites include chicken homard (stuffed with lobster), $18.95, and calamari marinara with linguini, $13.95. Reservations suggested. Dinner for two, with appetizer and wine, is about $60.
Marshside, (508) 385-4010, on Bridge Street near the junction of Routes 134 and 6A in East Dennis, is a comfortable place that serves hearty breakfasts for $3 to $5. Lunch features fish and chips and lobster-salad rolls; dinner includes scrod Mornay, $10.95, and chicken piccata, $11.50.
Jack's Out Back, (508) 362-6690, in Yarmouth, is a favorite of Cape artists and actors. It is down a small road off Route 6A (Main Street), marked by a sign saying 161 Antiques. Customers get their own beverages and bus their dishes. Belgian waffles at $3.10 are a breakfast specialty. Top lunch price is $4.50 for the chicken plate. By August, Jack expects to begin serving dinners for the first time, for $4.95 to $9.95. No alcoholic beverages. Credit cards are not accepted.

TRUMPED!
The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump --
His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall.
By John R. O'Donnell with James Rutherford.
Illustrated. 348 pp. New York:
Simon & Schuster. $21.95.  
 You probably know more about Donald Trump than you consider strictly necessary. You probably know that he bought a lot of so-called trophy properties, like the Plaza Hotel in New York City and a yacht that once belonged to the Sultan of Brunei; that he constructed giant luxury apartment buildings; that he scarfed down the Eastern Shuttle, renamed it the Trump Shuttle and made the steward esses wear pearls.
You probably know that business magazines slobbered over him, putting him on their lists of the richest people. And you probably remember his best-selling book, "The Art of the Deal."
You also probably know that his empire was built on money borrowed from banks and bondholders. And you probably know that eventually his properties did not generate sufficient cash to cover operating expenses and pay interest on his debts, so the banks are now pretty much running his business and have put him on an allowance.
You also know that he hung around, or hangs around, with a young woman named, improbably, Marla Maples. And you probably know that when his wife, Ivana, decided to get a divorce, the cupboard was almost bare.
But if you want to know more, pick up "Trumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump -- His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall."
John O'Donnell worked for Mr. Trump for three years, the last as president and chief operating officer of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. When Mr. O'Donnell was passed over for a key position, he went to work for the competition, Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel, as executive vice president and chief operating officer. He also wrote this tell-all book, with the help of James Rutherford, a freelance New Jersey writer.
Among the tidbits Mr. O'Donnell offers is that Mr. Trump's two casinos, the Plaza and the Castle, each ordered 4,000 copies of "The Art of the Deal." When selling them in the lobbies wasn't sufficient to work down the inventory, the hotels gave them away to guests.
You will read that Mr. Trump does not smoke or drink alcohol but eats a lot of chocolate and popcorn; that he has a terrible fear of baldness and of disease (he hates shaking hands and washes directly afterward).
Mr. Trump never spent any of his money (or the banks' money) on petty extravagances such as tipping the help. But he spent more than $1 million to alter every sign, logo, decal and fixture in order to change the name Trump's Castle to Trump Castle.
Mr. O'Donnell tells how crude Mr. Trump is. He once said to him about Ms. Maples: "God, I wish you could see her body! . . . If you could take one look at it, just one look, you wouldn't believe it. It's unbelievable. Better than a ten." (According to Mr. O'Donnell, he also used four-letter words all the time.) Mr. Trump also said that the publicity from his liaison with Ms. Maples and his divorce would be good for business.
Indeed, according to the author, Mr. Trump was not above exploiting the publicity surrounding the 1989 helicopter crash that killed three of his top executives. Although there was never any possibility that he would have been aboard the helicopter, for weeks after the tragedy Mr. Trump went around implying that he had had a brush with death.
Not bad as far as dish. But Mr. O'Donnell impugns Mr. Trump's business acumen as well. Take, for example, his purchase of the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Anybody with expertise in construction, the author contends, would have understood that during the years the Taj Mahal stood unfinished, the salt air and cold weather had deteriorated its structure, requiring millions of dollars in rehabilitation.
Nor did Mr. Trump understand that operating the Taj Mahal would be self-defeating because, as his third casino in Atlantic City, it would attract a large number of preferred customers from the other two.
Mr. O'Donnell outlines a bunch of bad deals that Mr. Trump insisted on. And he tells how, when they went sour, Mr. Trump always blamed somebody else -- often his dead executives.
Mr. O'Donnell also implies that Mr. Trump is a racist and a touch anti-Semitic. Speaking about a black accountant at Trump Plaza, Mr. Trump, according to the author, opined that "laziness is a trait in blacks" and said to Mr. O'Donnell: "I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and at Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day." It isn't any wonder that, according to Mr. O'Donnell, when Mr. Trump heard that he was writing this book he tried to intimidate him into abandoning the project.
Okay. What you know about Donald Trump won't enable you to survive alone in the wilderness. But if you always suspected that beneath his crude, callow, shallow exterior lay a crude, callow, shallow interior, read "Trumped!" It will give you the pleasure of knowing that you were right.

HEADLINE: Public Libraries in State Face Abridged Budgets

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
LIBRARY officials across the state are cutting their book purchases, pruning periodical lists and reducing hours, as they struggle to cope with smaller budgets.
In Bridgeport 30 of 67 library workers have been laid off, and the main public library will be open only 20 hours a week this summer. Three of the city's branches will operate only one day a week, and the fourth, North Branch, will be open two, said the city librarian, Louise Mackay Minervino.
Similar problems afflict all the larger cities, and suburban libraries are cutting back, too. In Monroe, for instance, the library director, Lynn M. Rosato, said she was forced to end evening hours. 
 "I don't think we've ever had to make cuts in the schedule," Ms. Rosato said. "It's been increases only for many years."
 
Voluntary Furloughs
 The cutbacks are nearly universal, said the president of the Connecticut Library Association, Marcia M. Trotta.
"I don't think you'll find a library that hasn't had to cut back in some respect," she said. "New Haven has a brand new library in a building that cost millions of dollars to renovate, and they can only keep it open 28 hours a week."
At the Meriden Public Library, where Ms. Trotta works, each library employee has agreed to take a one-week furlough this year, to save three positions. At other libraries, she said, people are being laid off.
That means that fewer staff members will be available to help people learn computer programs that might find them jobs or to help with research for home-based businesses.
"One of the problems is libraries are not looked at as essential services," Ms. Trotta said. "But as a cog in the economic wheel we are critical, and the long-range effects are going to be devastating."
The library director in Brookfield, Robert R. Gallucci, said: "In most towns the governing boards look at the library as a frill. It isn't a life-saving thing like police and fire. It isn't a state-mandated thing like the schools. So it kind of gets lost in the shuffle."
 
Library Use Keeps Growing
 Mr. Gallucci quickly added that his library got a 4.5 percent budget increase this year, thanks to townspeople and officials who rallied to its support. Every selectman, and most of the Finance Board members, hold library cards, he noted. But even in Brookfield, the budget increase was insufficient to give library employees any pay increase, Mr. Gallucci said.
Assessing how badly libraries will fare this summer is difficult, because many towns are still without budgets, and all are still waiting to hear how much they will get in state aid.
The use of public libraries has been growing at a far faster pace than the population, according to the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. In the last 40 years, while the nation's population has grown by about 70 percent, the use of libraries has grown more than 160 percent.
Still, the library has been one of the first places that towns have sought to cut, as budgets have grown out of control.
Even the legislature's library, considered the state's library of record, has suffered in the last couple of years. If the State Library, across the street from the Capitol, were a bridge, it would be in danger of collapse, said the state librarian, Richard G. Akeroyd Jr.
The State Library, which shares a building with the State Supreme Court, is Connecticut's principal law library. But this year it has dropped its subscriptions to all foreign law journals, as it struggles to accommodate a 35 percent cut in its materials budget.
 
Deteriorating Infrastructure
 The library is cutting back on the number of state newspapers it receives daily, and it is reducing purchases for its two satellite operations, in Willimantic and Middletown, Mr. Akeroyd said.
"Local libraries are cutting back, expecting to rely on our collections," he said. "But we've had to cut back as well, so there won't be as much for them to draw on."
"This is a government infrastructure that's been allowed to deteriorate much faster than our roads," Mr. Akeroyd said. "We still have rotary dial phones. The President has proposed spending $92 million to link libraries in a computerized research and education network, and we aren't equipped to take advantage of it."
Not all the efficiencies have been damaging, librarians said. At the University of Connecticut Library in Storrs, the director, Norman D. Stevens, said he was forced to cut $200,000 in journal subscriptions.
"We had not carefully reviewed our subscription list in a number of years," Mr. Stevens said. "And we're not necessarily distressed at all the journals we had to sacrifice."
 
Information Gap
 But most librarians said that economic restraints are hurting their operations. The cutbacks could not come at a worse time, said the Windham Library's director, Ted Perch, because the public library is always used heavily in a recession.
"When people are unemployed, they come around more often," Mr. Perch said. "Or instead of going out to eat, they may check out a book. But now we have fewer people to deal with greater demand."
Ms. Trotta said: "We're developing a gap between people who can afford access to information and those who can't, creating a whole new class of people who are information poor. If you have the money to buy Prodigy at home, or to have an encyclopedia data base, there's no problem. But if you can't, the library has traditionally been the place to get it.
"I'm not worried about the person who wants to read the latest best-selling novel. I'm worried about the person who really needs information, for whatever reason."
At many libraries budget cuts will mean some reorganizations. In Bristol, where $63,000 was cut from the $943,279 library budget this year, acquisitions, capitol projects and office expenses are down, and the staff will drop to 21 full-time and 10 part-time employees, from 22 full-time and 13 part-time workers, said the librarian, Francine A. Petosa. The art and music collection, which had a separate staff last year, will become part of the rest of the collection, she said.
"Many of the art and music books are very expensive," Ms. Petosa said, "and this new system should give us a little more control over them."
 
Books Lost Forever
 Mr. Akeroyd said, however, that not all the new efficiencies will be beneficial in the long run, particularly the cutbacks in book purchases. The state library lost $500,000 from its acquisition budget this year.
"Because of the tax law changes a few years ago, publishers can no longer depreciate their back stock, so books go out of print very quickly," Mr. Akeroyd said. "That means, even if I got the $500,000 now, a lot of the books we've decided not to order we couldn't even get, which would leave gaps in our collection.
"It's a fact of life -- you keep information current, or you lose it."
And at many of the libraries, the cutbacks are having immediate impacts, particularly on the number of hours they are open.
 "I don't even know that we're going to be able to keep the main branch open 20 hours," said Ms. Minervino in Bridgeport. "I show the staff the schedule I've worked out, and everyone says, 'I hope no one gets sick, because this schedule will fall apart.' "
She said she is particularly concerned because libraries should be a haven for city youth in the summer. Children who live near the Newfield Branch, for instance, are exposed to endless violence on the streets, she said, but the branch will offer them a safe place only eight hours a week.
"It seems like everything is eroding, and we can't do anything to stop it," Ms. Minervino said. "Maybe I'd feel differently if we were doing a poor job of it. But that isn't the case. People in Bridgeport love the public library and use the public library, but that's just not enough."

HEADLINE: Labor's Last Heavy Hitter

BYLINE: By James Edward Miller; James Edward Miller is the author of "The Baseball Business: Pursuing Pennants and Profits in Baltimore."

 BODY:

A WHOLE DIFFERENT BALL GAME
The Sport and Business of Baseball.
By Marvin Miller.
Illustrated. 430 pp. New York:
Birch Lane Press/Carol Publishing. $21.95.  
 In his 1983 book, "American Baseball: From Postwar Expansion to the Electronic Age," the historian David Q. Voigt called Marvin Miller "the liberator." Taking charge of a ramshackle players' association, Mr. Miller turned it into America's most successful union of the post-World War II era. From 1966 to the early 1980's, while trade unionism was everywhere in retreat, Mr. Miller and his players were rewriting the rules of labor-management relations to their advantage, winning enormous salaries and, as Mr. Miller repeatedly reminds us in "A Whole Different Ball Game," catapulting the sport to new heights of fan interest and profitability.
Mr. Miller, the domineering union chief, was also that baseball rarity, a hardheaded statesman. As he explains, he started from the assumption that big profits were in everyone's interest. As he told Walter O'Malley, the owner of the Dodgers, only money-making teams were in a position to enrich the players.
The owners never understood Mr. Miller, who came to baseball after 16 years with the steelworkers union. Offended by his insistence on substituting labor law for paternalism as the basis of player-management relations, they rejected his offer of a cooperative relationship and spent the next 17 years battling the union at every turn. The owners resisted collective bargaining strenuously and rejected any modification of the reserve clause, which contractually bound a player to a team for life. In the end, they lost both the reserve system and their advantage at the bargaining table.
Moreover, the years of intensely personal fighting created the extreme adversarial relationship between the union and the owners that is central to the game in the 1990's. The owners have had capable negotiators at the bargaining table, but they have lacked a flexible strategy that would permit cooperation with the union in mutual self-enrichment. The latest example of their shortsightedness was the 1990 lockout, when the owners again -- and just as futilely -- unilaterally attempted to impose a salary cap on on the players.
Mr. Miller, in his rambling memoir, discusses the creation and triumph of unionism in baseball, analyzes baseball economics and details the psychic wounds that he says management inflicted on him. His discussions of tactics, his explanation of labor law, his recounting of his initial involvement with the players and his examination of labor-management negotiations are interesting and rewarding. He is particularly informative on the critical talks in 1976 that defined the free agent system under which (with slight modifications) major league baseball continues to operate. His comments on player agents are sensible. The final chapters contain some insightful commentary on the evolution of labor-management relations after Mr. Miller's retirement.
When Mr. Miller describes his personal ordeals, his book becomes a bitterly unrestrained attack on his opponents that frequently diminishes its author. His bitterness over the owners' intransigence and dehumanizing tactics is understandable. His attempt at revenge amounts to a self-inflicted wound. The book is filled with cheap shots at the owners and their chief representatives, the commissioners of baseball.
A. Bartlett Giamatti is singled out for particularly savage treatment. Mr. Miller approvingly quotes his wife's appraisal of the baseball commissioner, written shortly after Giamatti's death in 1989: "angry, cold, severe, flag-waving, pennant-waving . . . a smooth talking casuist, a union-busting conservative." The author then takes his own potshots at Giamatti's "pretentious, overripe prose." In an unnecessary display of spite, he also brings up the drinking problems of Horace Stoneham, the former owner of the San Francisco Giants, who died last year. Walter O'Malley, George Steinbrenner and Charles Finley fare only slightly better. Mr. Miller paints all three in strongly negative terms but admits to grudging admiration for the latter two. As he dryly notes, the union couldn't have done it without Mr. Steinbrenner, the free-spending Yankees boss whose player acquisitions fueled nearly two decades of salary inflation and may have hastened his exile from the game.
Mr. Miller's long-standing antagonist, the former commissioner Bowie Kuhn, receives the roughest comments. The apparent source of Mr. Miller's grievance is "Hardball," Mr. Kuhn's 1987 memoir. "I never wished Bowie harm," Mr. Miller says piously, as he ceaselessly lowers the boom on his hapless adversary: "Bowie was a bad loser." The "perception of reality was never his strong suit." He "had nothing to offer . . . except . . . cliches and bromides." "His approach could best be described as a will to fail." Nor can he resist gloating over Mr. Kuhn's postbaseball financial problems.
Mr. Miller charges his immediate successor as head of the Players' Association, Ken Moffett, with a 10-month reign of financial mismanagement, indifference, arrogance, featherbedding, being the owners' stooge and -- above all -- failing to consult his predecessor. Any ballplayer who crossed Mr. Miller -- the number includes Reggie Jackson, Bob Boone and Catfish Hunter -- is duly pilloried. (Commenting on contract arbitrations concerning Carlton Fisk and Fred Lynn, Mr. Miller writes, "Neither player was perceptive enough to understand what had happened.") Not even his faithful legal assistants, Dick Moss and Donald Fehr, are exempt from a trip to the woodshed. The reader repeatedly wants to cry out, "Lighten up, Marvin!"
Mr. Miller's intolerance of differing opinions was rooted in exaggerated fears about the players' loyalty toward the union. Any show of player disagreement during negotiations led the owners to dig in their heels, he argues. In fact the union has always showed impressive solidarity, enjoying 25 years of unbroken success despite occasional well-publicized differences in its ranks. Mr. Miller has consistently underestimated the players' ability to understand their best interests.
Concern with the union's image apparently explains the book's major lacuna: Mr. Miller avoids a serious discussion of drug use among the players. The problem emerged in the 1970's, was a major factor in Mr. Moffett's ouster as union chief and plagued baseball throughout the 1980's. Except for passing shots at Peter Ueberroth's handling of the issue when he was commissioner, Mr. Miller remains silent on this embarrassment.
Marvin Miller the writer needed the same sort of help Marvin Miller the union leader gave to the players. This book screams out for professional editorial work that would have reduced its length, given it focus, eliminated a number of small errors and toned down its harshness. The book is poorly organized. Events described in detail in one chapter reappear a chapter or so later. The last two chapters, which contain some of Mr. Miller's most interesting reflections, seem slapped on to the rest of the book.
While this type of writing is too often the norm in sports books, Marvin Miller deserves better. No one did more for the dignity and economic well-being of the players than the hard-driving former chief economist of the United Steelworkers. These memoirs vent his frustrations but undercut his achievements. Eventually a competent biographer will give Mr. Miller his due.

HEADLINE: Questions Arise On Shore Trail Plan

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

 BODY:
A PLAN by the National Park Service to promote the Jersey Shore nationally as one major tour destination, like a national park, is being questioned by environmentalists and others for its potential to create more traffic congestion and harm the state's beaches and ocean water quality.
The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail, as the plan is known, will feature five thematic tour routes from Sandy Hook, its northern anchor, to the Delaware Bay shore in Cumberland and Salem Counties, its southern anchor. The themes, which are still being discussed, will include the state's maritime history and will encompass more than 372 cultural, historic and environmental attractions and individual buildings, according to spokesmen for the Park Service. 
 But those concerned about the coastal trail said in recent interviews that although it would be an invaluable marketing tool, the plan so far had not addressed the potential impact of motor vehicles and more people on the Shore's air quality, sewage treatment plants, the ocean and the state's park system.
"If we were going to use the beauty of the Shore to attract tourists from all over the country, like a Yellowstone Park, it will be an injustice to them that we do not have a healthy and stable marine environment for them to enjoy," said Dr. Dennis Sternberg, co-founder of Save Our Shores, an environmental group based in Ocean Township.
Except for parts of the sparsely populated bay shore, Dr. Sternberg and other critics said, the Shore is already heavily strained from the last four decades of imprudent development and lax state regulation.
"I did not think that you could get any more people down to the Shore than we have now," said Cindy Zipf, the director of Clean Water Action, a 100,000-member environmental coalition based in Sandy Hook.
Ms. Zipf was one of several spokesmen for environmental groups, including the New Jersey Audubon Society, who said they had not been invited to testify at public hearings held by the Park Service last year and this year to plan the trail.
Janet Wolfe, the Park Service's project director for the coastal trail, said there was "no question that we will have to comply with the national Environmental Protection Act and develop environmental impact statements for each of the five individual theme routes that will make up the trail." She said public hearings would be held on the routes before the first route is scheduled to open in September 1992.
The objections to the trail plan come at a time when the Shore economy struggles to recover from several years of declining tourism revenue -- a result, in part, of widespread reports of ocean pollution and beach closings beginning in 1987. Last month, the Legislature took up consideration of a proposal for further restriction of development in the state's coastal zone.
Moreover, Gov. Jim Florio has made protection of the state's coastal waters one of his administration's top priorities.
 
Sponsored by Bradley
 The trail concept was sponsored in the form of a law by Senator Bill Bradley and authorized by Congress in October 1988. Senator Bradley defended the trail, saying that its very intention was to preserve the Shore's cultural, historic and environmental features while "tying them all together so that they can be interpreted and enjoyed as a whole."
This, he said, "will be done without any environmental degradation." He said it was hoped that the additional tourists would visit from March to May and from September to November, not during the crowded summers.
The New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail will take in a region generally east of the Garden State Parkway in Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May Counties. This would be linked with the state's Delaware Bay shore, south of Routes 47 and 49 in Cumberland and Salem Counties, to form a contiguous coastal tour route from Sandy Hook to Deepwater.
Among the trail's attractions are parts of the Pinelands National Reserve, the 350-year-old Cumberland County community of Bridgeton, the historic districts of Cape May and Ocean Grove and dozens of parks and historic structures.
The attractions also include rivers like the Maurice, which is the natural east-west boundary of Cumberland and Salem Counties and is awaiting designation as a national wild and scenic river by the Department of the Interior. Other points along the Park Service's tour routes are the Atlantic City Convention Hall and, to the south in Margate, Lucy the Margate Elephant, a huge 110-year-old elephantine landmark at the beach that was originally built to attract tourists.
 
A Special Designation
 Although it will not be a national park, Mrs. Wolfe said, the coastal trail has received a special designation by the Park Service and will appear on the service's nationally distributed lists and brochures of places to visit.
Eugene Dilbeck, the director of the State Division of Travel and Tourism, said the lists and brochures were often used by tour travelers who visit designated Park Service destinations and who can afford such vacations.
Mrs. Wolfe said the coastal trail would be listed as a major attraction in all Park Service literature. Tourists, she said, will be guided to the trail's different routes and attractions by a system of visitor centers, special road signs and maps and brochures.
Edie Sheam-Hammond, a spokeswoman for the Park Service's regional office in Boston, said there were about 1,000 local recreational trails recognized by the Park Service, including the Freedom Trail in Boston and the St. Lawrence Seaway Trail. But she said the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail was the only one in the nation created by legislation and "the only one that is a designated unit of the National Park Service."
As described by Mrs. Wolfe and others, each of the five routes along the trail will run the full distance of the trail and carry a theme, like maritime history or natural history -- for instance, birding. Some attractions are as large as the Pinelands National Reserve and the Cape May Historic District, others as small as individual buildings and parks of local historic importance.
The anticipated environmental impact statements for the five routes, Mrs. Wolfe said, will be done in stages as each trail is developed and put into place between September of next year and 1993. She said annual development costs of $400,000 would come from the Federal Government.
 
New Kind of Tourist Sought
 Mr. Dilbeck, the state tourism director, said of the trail: "This certainly will help the division in our marketing and promotional efforts. It will enable us to use the National Park Service promotion of the trail to attract a whole new category of tourists who normally do not visit New Jersey -- the tour traveler."
Nevertheless, Dr. Sternberg said the Park Service might be creating "a coastal park of questionable safety." This is so, he said, because of New Jersey's history of problems with things like beach closings, the longstanding state advisory against eating certain amounts of bluefish, striped bass and blue crabs caught in the ocean waters north of Island Beach State Park, and the state's failure to so far control the "vast amounts of storm-water runoff and sewage effluent that empty into our coastal waters."
Specifically, Dr. Sternberg said the State Department of Environmental Protection had failed to enforce the 1988 Sewage Infrastructure Improvement Act. It was to have provided $33.5 million for coastal municipalities to identify and map all outfall lines to bays and the ocean, with an eye toward eventually reducing the bacteria and chemicals that find their way into the Atlantic.
Barry Chalofsky, an official of the department's Division of Water Resources, said that only 10 percent of the $33.5 million had been spent so far and that the division had missed the state law's Feb. 3, 1990, deadline for producing a final map that would identify the coast's pollution problem spots.
"There have been a lot of problems with the administration of this law," Mr. Chalofsky said.
 
Other Plans Preferred
 Kenneth J. Smith of Manahawkin, a lobbyist for engineering and other coastal development interests in the state, qualified his approval of the coastal trail.
"If I had my druthers," he said, "I would rather see a statewide beach management plan and a statewide storm-water mitigation plan before I see the coastal trail."
The coast, Mr. Smith said, has an immediate need for $300 million to $400 million worth of construction to put up sea walls and other beach protection projects, "to assure that these new visitors will have a beach to go to in the future."
Gregory A. Marshall, the director of the State Division of Parks and Forestry, said greater funds than the division now had in its budget would be needed if the park system became even more crowded because of the coastal trail.
"As it is, you cannot rent a cabin for the spring or summer in any state park in New Jersey after February," Mr. Marshall said. Parks like Island Beach State Park, he said, are filled and must close their gates to the public before noon on summer weekends.
 
Debate Over a Loophole
 State environmental officials say that since 1980, there has been a periodic debate over closing a loophole in the state's coastal management regulations. The loophole, they say, exempts developers who build 24 or fewer residential units at a time from obtaining building permits that are predicated on proof of environmental compliance.
That debate was renewed last month when a contingent of Ocean County Republicans vowed to defeat a bipartisan measure seeking to close the loophole.
John R. Weingart, director of the state's Division of Coastal Resources, which administers the regulations, said further limitations might be needed if a large plan, like the coastal trail, sought to attract many more people to the Shore and encouraged development.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Optimistic Fed View Is Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Now that Alan Greenspan has been named to another term as the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, he is expected to accentuate the positive this week when he delivers his semiannual testimony to Congress on monetary policy and the economy.
Analysts said that when he addresses the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow, Mr. Greenspan will probably reiterate recent comments that in the Fed's view, the economy has begun to crawl out of the recession. He is also expected to have good things to say about inflationary pressures, which continue to moderate. 
 The tone may be more upbeat, but Mr. Greenspan, an economist long before he became a central banker, will almost certainly admit that the recovery he sees is very fragile.
"I would not go out and open a bottle of Dom Perignon just yet," said Joseph Wahed, chief economist at the Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.
 
Threats Still There
 Many of the same dangers Mr. Greenspan cited six months ago as potential threats to a recovery are still there. Specifically, the shortage of credit, identified in February by Mr. Greenspan as "the most critical thing that confronts monetary policy at this particular stage," has shown few signs of easing.
Steven Slifer, an executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers, said that "banks have tightened their lending standards a lot, and until they satisfy the new minimum-capital requirements as well as build an additional cushion from which to make new loans, they aren't going to loosen them."
Six months ago, Mr. Greenspan fretted that a prolonged war in the Persian Gulf could undercut public confidence and spending. The fighting ended less than 10 days after he made those remarks. Yet, since March, notes Joseph Carson, chief economist at Chemical Bank, retail sales have risen by only three-tenths of 1 percent.
 
No Governmental Help
 No help is coming from the governmental field either. If anything, the fiscal outlook at every level of government is more restrictive now than it was in the winter. Evidence of Washington's budget problems, and its inability to stimulate the economy, is likely to be provided today, when the Bush Administration releases its midyear budget review.
Despite a handsome profit from the Persian Gulf war because of payments from allies, the budget shortfall for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 will likely reach $280 billion, Susan Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, wrote in the firm's weekly "Comments on Credit."
Moreover, the absence of war profits in 1992 and climbing outlays to shore up the bank deposit insurance system will far outweigh any increase in revenue from a reviving economy, Ms. Hering said. The Administration will be forced to admit that the deficit problem will worsen in the 1992 fiscal year, she predicted. A shortfall of $325 billion or more, roughly 5 percent of the country's gross national product, is not unlikely, she added.
 
Local Problems Cited
 The slowdown in inflation and increases in hours worked should, in theory, help increase consumer spending. But budget cuts, tax rises and layoffs at the state and local government level will probably dampen some of those positive developments. Indeed, Mr. Carson of Chemical Bank and other analysts said they would be listening closely to see whether Mr. Greenspan addressed the issue of how the Fed might respond to the economic drag created by problems at the state and local government level.
"Last year, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed would ease monetary policy if Congress put together a credible budget package," Mr. Carson said. "But the fiscal drag produced by solving budget problems at the state and local government level is twice as large as the Federal budget cuts were last year. So far he has failed to address how the Fed might respond to that."
Mr. Carson predicts that renewed signs of economic weakness during the third quarter will prompt the Fed to lower the overnight rate on bank loans in the Federal funds market, currently at 5.75 percent, late this quarter.
 
View Not Widely Held
 That view is not widely held by most other analysts. In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan is not likely to rule out another easing of policy, but the Fed will probably adhere to a steady monetary policy for the balance of the year, other analysts said.
"I don't see any need for the Fed to move the funds rate," said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
Aside from the Greenspan testimony, June reports on housing starts and consumer prices, both expected Wednesday, will be examined carefully by credit market participants. Some analysts said the housing numbers may be particularly important, since that sector is showing signs of a renewed slowdown after an encouraging first quarter.
Lyle E. Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said a small survey of large mortgage bankers conducted by the trade group showed a clear decline since March in mortgage applications to buy new homes. "There are indications that activity is beginning to slow," he said. "But the question is whether this is a pause, or whether we are dead in the water. Right now I think the former."
Compared with the very friendly producer price report released on Friday, a report showing that producer prices fell by three-tenths of a percent last month, analysts said June's consumer price numbers may come as something of a disappointment.
"Since it contains services, it is highly unlikely the consumer price numbers will be as favorable as the producer price data," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. "But consumer prices are coming down as well. And the longer the economic recovery stays fragile, the better inflation performance becomes."
Most analysts estimate that the Consumer Price Index rose by around three-tenths of a percentage point last month, following a similar increase in May.

How Dinkins Plan To Combat Crime Detoured Critics

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
A foreign tourist dies from gunshots fired in a Chinatown gang war. A token-booth clerk is killed in a subway robbery. A woman is murdered while walking her dogs on the West Side. A 14-year-old is critically wounded by a bullet fired through his bedroom window in Harlem. A prosecutor is gunned down at a Brooklyn bank. A Bronx grocery store and a Brooklyn social club are hit by hand grenades.
And Mayor David N. Dinkins's own public appeal for gun controls is interrupted by gunfire in East New York. 
 The city's seasonal mayhem has only just started. But so far public fear and frustration has not been galvanized into the outrage that was captured last summer in a single headline -- "Dave, Do Something."
Why not? The public agenda is largely defined in the city's streets nowadays. But last summer's surge in crime was outpaced by the surge in crime reporting during a news void that has not yet developed this year.
Also, Mr. Dinkins made himself more vulnerable by seeming to respond to the crime wave with detachment. He failed to explicitly endorse the hiring of thousands more officers -- as proposed by his own police commissioner.
"This is not Dodge City," Mr. Dinkins declared defensively last summer after the fourth child in a little more than a week had been killed by bullets intended for someone else. It is arguable whether Dodge ever outpaced New York in murders, but not a single homicide was recorded there last year, although the 1991 toll has already hit one -- a shooting victim.
"Crime is up a little, like everywhere else," said Oakley Ralph, Police Chief of the Kansas city of 20,000 people (where the homicide rate has not risen high enough to inspire the headline, "Oakley, Do Something").
Illegal weapons have become so common that even Congress is moving toward a required waiting period for gun buyers, although New York's City Council, in what Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown described as "an embarrassment," failed last week to ban assault weapons. The Council is expected to do so later this month but is still debating whether to legalize the 2,163 that are already licensed.
 In the first three months of 1991, the police in New York City reported 14,393 crimes involving guns against people -- up more than 10 a day over last year.
 Some New Yorkers, numbed to the banality, to the ubiquity and -- despite modest statistical decreases -- to the quiet riot that crime represents, may simply have given up on the criminal-justice system's ability to safeguard their lives and property.
Perhaps the primary difference between this year and last is that Dave finally did do something. Mr. Dinkins coupled an anti-crime plan last fall with proposed preventive services to help young New Yorkers. After several false starts, he managed to win over the Council and the State Legislature. History may record this phase of pruning social services while expanding the police force as Mr. Dinkins's blue period.
Economies have delayed deployment of the full complement of police officers, may jeopardize some improvements that were predicated on planned civilian replacements who are now being dismissed, and have severely curtailed the planned expansion of youth services.
But, compared to June 1990, more officers were on patrol last month -- 7,279, or 652 more, on average -- and they were more visible under Commissioner Brown's strategy of community policing, which he instituted well before the Mayor's "Safe Streets, Safe City" plan was finally unveiled.
"We were doing something," said Mr. Brown, "but it wasn't getting covered."
By 1994, the police force is to have grown to more than 31,000 -- including 5,000 officers on foot and scooter patrols in communities, compared to the 750 assigned to neighborhood patrol programs a year ago.
"What we're trying to do is institutionalize the feeling of a police presence," Mr. Brown said.
In some neighborhoods, that presence may have already helped alter public perception. "While a lot of people deplore crime, what's to recommend?" said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a private organization. "That we need more cops? We're getting more cops." Moreover, Mr. Brown said, "the number we will end up with is close to being the optimum number."
By what benchmark though? During the first six months of this year, the death toll in two crime categories that only a year ago had seemed novel to many New Yorkers went down ever so slightly -- to 31 bystanders and 39 youngsters under the age of 17. Barring a sensational crime or a critical mass of killings, Mr. Dinkins may survive another summer without the public demanding that he do something more. But probably only one summer.
"If the same thing is happening next summer," Mr. Reppetto said, "people will say, 'I thought Safe Streets was going to help us.' "

Dailies Find Lower Prices At Auction

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
THE buying and selling of newspapers has all but stopped in the last year, mostly because prospective buyers have refused to pay the premium prices that dailies commanded two years ago -- prices that most sellers still demand.
Newspaper brokers say the few papers being sold are trading at prices that reflect the sharp decline in advertising and questions about whether all of it will return when the economy improves. 
 "I've got one now I could have sold three years ago over the phone at a very solid price," said Gerald D. Reilly, a newspaper broker in Greenwich, Conn. "But right now, it's going to be a lot of work, and when it does finally sell, it will sell for one third less than it would have at its peak."
Brokers say plenty of newspapers are for sale, though many owners do not want that generally known.
For example, E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company quietly tried to sell The New Haven Register last fall, without success.
John Vogelstein, vice chairman of Warburg, said the investment firm authorized Henry Ansbacher Inc., a New York company that specializes in media companies, to try to sell the paper for $350 million. The paper had been bought by Warburg in 1989 for a reported $245 million.
Mr. Vogelstein said that a few prospective buyers took a look, but that The Register was taken off the market in a few months when it became apparent that the asking price was "not attainable."
Lee Dirks, president of Lee Dirks & Associates, a newspaper brokerage based in Birmingham, Mich., said a daily paper in a booming community could have been sold for as much as five times its annual revenues in 1989. He said the same paper today would be worth perhaps four times its revenues.
Less attractive dailies, like those in very depressed areas and with heavy competition, might be worth only 1.5 times annual revenues, Mr. Dirks said. In the late 1980s, they might have been worth twice that.
Mr. Dirks sees little chance that prices will roar back, because there is a growing glut of newspapers for sale and a paucity of buyers.
 
Tabloids' Game Shocker!
The knives were out at The New York Post and The Daily News last week and both tabloids slashed each other with ferocity as they battled for circulation.
On Wednesday, The Post's front page screamed, "GAME WAS FIXED!" -- referring to The News's most recent $5,000 winner in the paper's Lucky Bucks contest. In an article inside, Jerry Nachman, The Post's editor, said he was "shocked and dismayed" that the rival News would stoop so low.
Since May 19, The News has been spending 33 dollar bills a day around New York and then publishing their serial numbers in the paper. Those holding the bills can redeem them for cash prizes. The idea is that hopeful winners will buy The News to see if their dollars match.
The Post's expose showed The News to be more hapless than sinister. Ricardo Rolon, the winner, said a man he had never seen before came into the Brooklyn bakery where he works, asked for coffee, handed over a dollar and said to him and a co-worker, "Look, that bill is going to come out in Lucky Bucks tomorrow."
The News denied that the person handing out the bills had tipped off Mr. Rolon, though an article in the paper said it was not unusual for those handing out the bills to say, "Are you playing the Lucky Bucks?"
If Mr. Rolon's account is accurate, the motive was apparently not to reward him personally, but to insure that somebody claimed a winning dollar, which could then be trumpeted in The News. Very few actual winners of big prizes have come forward since the contest began.
When Mr. Rolon won, The News ran an article and a picture. The News knew of Mr. Rolon's account of getting the winning dollar, but did not mention the comment by the anonymous benefactor.
But The Post found out anyway and put the news on page 1.
The News answered The Post's broadside by sarcastically thanking The Post for "free publicity."
And The News also lambasted The Post's game, "Second Chance Lotto," in which old lottery tickets win prizes.
On the day of The Post's page 1 blast at The News, The Post had used 56 as one of the winning numbers in its own contest. The News pointed out that the numbers available in Lotto go only to 54, and denounced The Post for printing a "phony number."
The Post asserted that it had made a typographical error.
But at The News, James P. Willse, the editor, said he was "shocked and dismayed" that the Post would stoop so low.
 
A Letter and a Pink Slip
In Nantucket, Mass., the island's two weeklies are locked in an economic battle that has been further complicated by a thorny legal dispute with First Amendment implications.
In 1989, the upstart Nantucket Beacon went into competition with The Inquirer and Mirror, which was founded in 1821.
The timing was odd. The island's real estate boom of the mid-80's had just gone bust, and a depressed New England economy had made the going tough for newspapers.
The Inquirer and Mirror, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company's Ottoway group, had previously been so fat that it needed no advertising sales force.
That has changed, and both papers are scrambling for every ad dollar.
In October, Michel Magee, a cartoonist and columnist at The Inquirer and Mirror, was dismissed by Marianne Stanton, the newspaper's editor and co-manager.
Ms. Magee said she lost her job because she sent a letter to the editor of The Beacon about abortion.
Ms. Magee said that when she told Ms. Stanton she was going to send the letter, Ms. Stanton responded, "Anyone who writes for The Beacon doesn't write for us."
Ms. Magee has filed suit charging that her civil rights were violated. In her filing, she said The Inquirer was "paranoid" about The Beacon.
Ms. Stanton said Ms. Magee's dismissal was not based on the competitive environment, but declined to discuss the issue. The Inquirer has maintained that the dismissal was for job performance.

HEADLINE: Judge Declares Rates on Medicaid In Washington State Inadequate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, July 14

 BODY:
A Federal district judge has ruled that Medicaid rates paid by Washington State failed to compensate hospitals adequately and thus were illegal.
The ruling by Judge Thomas S. Zilly follows a decision last year by United States Supreme Court allowing health care institutions to sue states for higher rates. 
 David Bennett, a lawyer who represented 10 Washington hospitals that sued the state, argued that the Medicaid payments were unreasonably low and resulted in a "hidden tax" on patients with private insurance who were charged more to make up the balance.
 
Judge to Issue Final Order
 "This is going to make the state pay its fair share," Mr. Bennett said.
Judge Zilly's opinion, which was issued July 3, is to be followed by a final order this week.
Jim Peterson, assistant secretary for medical assistance at the State Department of Social and Health Services, said the state was awaiting Judge Zilly's formal order before deciding whether to appeal it to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. He said that the state was already paying its share and that the judge's ruling would increase costs and reduce health care for poor people.
The state Medicaid program for in-patient hospital care in 1990 paid out $275 million and assisted an average of 6,700 hospital patients a month.
 
State Pays 80% of Costs
 Mr. Peterson and Mr. Bennett estimated that the state had paid an average of 80 percent of hospital costs. Mr. Bennett contended that the rate had failed to reasonably meet the financial needs of many hospitals.
The Medicaid program, which pays for certain medical and hospital expenses of poor people from state and Federal money, is federally mandated to set "reasonable and adequate" payments to meet the costs of "economic and efficient" hospitals.
Mr. Peterson argued that the state had no responsibility to pay 100 percent of costs when most hospitals negotiated discount rates with private insurers or other private payers who were not required by Federal law to pay reasonable fees.
"There are plenty of insurers getting discounts from hospitals," he said. "We're trying to strike the same balance."

HEADLINE: Japan Sets Tough Rules On Business

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 14

 BODY:
Under pressure from the United States, the Japanese Government has published new regulations prohibiting companies from fixing prices, driving competitors out of the market and blocking certain types of imports, in what could mark -- on paper at least -- a big change in the way Japan does business.
The critical question is how strictly the rules will be enforced by Japan's Fair Trade Commission, which is not known for its political clout or its eagerness to enforce the country's antitrust laws. Nonetheless, the new rules are one of the biggest changes brought about yet in Japan by the broad trade talks with Washington that are known as the Structural Impediments Initiative. 
 Most important, the rules attack a cornerstone of the "keiretsu" system, in which companies hold each other's stock to cement a business relationship. The new rules say that such a stockholding is fine -- but that it cannot be used to block a company from doing business with a competitor of the stockholder.
 
'Suggested Retail Prices'
 Under the rules, published last week by the Fair Trade Commission after a year of debate, companies operating in Japan are prohibited from enforcing "suggested retail prices," a widespread practce that accounts for the absence of many discount stores here. Companies are also enjoined from acting together to boycott new entrants to a market, a traditional way of keeping new suppliers and competitors out of a field.
Historically, Japanese business has not been regulated by laws but by informal guidance, arising from talks with Government ministries and other enforcement officials. It is generally understood here, for example, that price wars cut everyone's profits; as a result, relatively few companies are willing to break ranks and sell consumer goods at a deeply discounted price.
Japanese newspapers and consumer advocates have embraced the new regulations. "It is time for the F.T.C., which has been criticized -- not only at home but even abroad -- as a watchdog that never bites, to take action," the newspaper Asahi Shimbun said in an editorial on Friday.
In a statement last week, the commission said it was committed to "take vigorous measures" against any violations of the new rules.
 
Businesses Protest
 Perhaps the most controversial element of the new guidelines permits the Fair Trade Commission to order a company to sell its stockholdings in another company "where it is considered necessary to do so to eliminate a violation" of Japan's Antimonopoly Act. The ruling brought an immediate protest from Keidanran, the organization of Japan's biggest businesses, which said it hoped the commission would "use caution" before ordering any companies to divest their holdings in a business partner.
In fact, any such effort is likely to touch off a big political storm. The "keiretsu" relationships are considered by the Japanese to be a key to the country's economic success, and Japanese negotiators have resisted any efforts to break up those relationships. American officials maintain that they are essentially exclusive relationships that put foreign companies at a disadvantage.
 
Returning Unsold Goods
 Most of the new rules deal with the abuse of power by "influential" companies, defined as those with a market share of greater than 10 percent or a position as one of the top three suppliers or dealers in a market.
For example, it prohibits companies from using their "dominant position" to force clients to shun competitive goods, no matter how low the price or how high the quality. It bars manufacturers from preventing their dealers from handling competing lines, or cutting off a dealer that offers discounts on its goods.
It also prevents big retailers from using their "dominant bargaining position" to return unsold goods to suppliers under some circumstances. Because most companies can return their goods in Japan, there are rarely sales to clear out old merchandise.
Retailers are also barred from forcing suppliers to make frequent deliveries in small lots at no extra cost, a practice of many food and convenience stores.
Some of the strictest new rules cover "parallel imports," the importation of goods that are already available in Japan. Many luxury goods makers have been attempting to send their goods here, if they can find a distributor. Often, the Japanese companies maintain that the imported goods are fakes. Or they contend that the goods cannot be fixed in Japan.
The rules say no Japanese company can assert that parallel imports are fake in order to dissuade dealers from carrying them.
The commission said it would set up a "prior consultation" system to allow companies to seek a ruling about the legality of their pending decisions. The consultation results will be published, the commission said, adding that it would also establish a "complain section" for foreign companies.

HEADLINE: At Tourist's Burial, Grief, Hope and a Call for Justice

DATELINE: MANILA, July 14

 BODY:
It would have been better, said Dr. Renaldo Lantin, if his daughter had never gone to America.
"The Philippines is written about as a violent country where killings are common," he said. "But Rhona would have been safer here." 
 Today, relatives and friends buried Rhona Lantin, a 26-year-old tourist from Maryland who was killed in Manhattan on July 4 by a stray bullet as she searched with friends for a restaurant in Chinatown.
Those close to her remembered her as smart and caring, but they said there was a hardness to her, too,
Ms. Lantin was paradox, said her mother, Rhoda. "She has a collection of dolls and stamps but, at the same time, she was a sharpshooter, a champion in rifle-shooting competitions."
 
'She Likes to Be Independent'
 She also had her own mind. She was born in Ames, Iowa, where her parents were pursuing post-graduate studies at the Iowa State University: her father in agriculture, her mother in chemistry. After two years, they brought her back to the Philippines, where she spent most of her life.
But in 1987, she accompanied her grandfather to the United States on a vacation and decided to stay and do graduate work, her mother said. "She likes to be independent," said Mrs. Lantin.
Since Friday, Ms. Lantin's body had been kept for viewing at her family's residence in Los Banos, Laguna province, about 40 miles from Manila. Hanging on the wall of the living room were photographs of her at various stages in her life, from when she was a chubby baby up to her years as graduate student.
At the funeral, the mourners wore white instead of black, signifying purity and hope in life after death.
 
'Let Justice Be Done'
 One fierce hope is that the killer -- who the police believe fired the fatal shot during a gang dispute in Chinatown -- is captured.
"Let justice be done," said Rico Carpio, an uncle of Ms. Lantin. "We hope there is meaning to her death."
"It is a waste," lamented Dr. Jun Custodio, a former college professor of Ms. Lantin's. "I always remember her to be brainy in class and active in school organizations."
The mourners talked repeatedly of Ms. Lantin's intelligence. While in elementary and high school, she was always near the top of her class. In 1986, she graduated magna cum laude from the University of the Philippines in Los Banos. She had a bachelor's degree in agricultural business, and at the time of her death, was completing her master's in agricultural economics at the University of Maryland.
 
'But Today, We Give Her Up'
 In a Mass before the burial, Dr. Lantin held back his tears. "Twenty-six years ago, we had a jewel," he said. "Rhona was full of life. She made a big difference in our lives. But today, we give her up in human form."
Ms. Lantin was to marry 29-year-old Patrick Canning next year. Mr. Canning, also a graduate student at the University of Maryland, attended the funeral.
In a letter to the Lantin family, which was distributed to friends, Mr. Canning's parents, Sean and Evelyn, wrote: "We have often said how lucky Pat was to have such a beautiful bride-to-be. And now -- this senseless violence, this crushing loss!"

HEADLINE: Near Gang Turf, Theater Features Peace

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 14

 BODY:
The homeboys came, but they mostly left their colors at home and "dressed down," as they say in the 'hood, to see "Boyz N the Hood."
While sporadic violence on Friday night caused eight movie theaters elsewhere in Southern California and the nation to cancel showings of the film, there was no trouble where many had expected it to be the worst, at the Baldwin Hills Theater, which lies at the edge of the gang-torn South Central Los Angeles neighborhood where John Singleton's drama of growing up in the ghetto was set. 
 All weekend, long orderly lines of young black people waited to get into the theater, then quietly absorbed its message of the value of family, school and hope.
That there were no shootings or fights was testimony to two things: the hidden strengths of a community that is perceived mostly through news reports of gang violence, and the stern, fatherly management of Lance E. Drummond, a Harlem-born businessman who is chairman of the company that owns the theater.
 
A Speech to the Audience
 As at many theaters, extra security guards were hired to insure against misbehavior. Before the Saturday night showing, the 60-year-old Mr. Drummond mounted the stage of the 420-seat house, apologized for the tight security and told the audience: "Many people thought we should not show this movie. But I saw it and I felt the community needs to see it. It shows the good and bad. It also shows what is necessary. Look at this movie. I think you'll get something out of it."
The audience watched the film in rapt silence. Afterwards, many pronounced it the most realistic and positive portrait they had ever seen of South Central Los Angeles, which has been battling the ravages of gang terrorism, crack cocaine addiction, alcoholism and broken families. "It's a very positive movie," said Mashia McGraw, a receptionist. "It sends a message out to all black people. Everybody should come and watch it."
The film, written and directed by the 23-year-old Mr. Singleton, tells the story of a young man's passage to manhood in this tough setting. It preaches against gang violence, cocaine use and teen-age pregnancy, and stresses the importance of having a strong father and getting an education. Though it has bloody scenes of gang shootings, it is not a film about gangs.
Clashes among actual gang members left at least 33 people wounded and one dead when the film opened Friday at 829 screens around the nation. The film was expected to gross about $9.2 million for the weekend, said Columbia Pictures, the film's distributor.
Mr. Singleton complained Saturday in an interview with the Cable News Network that the news media were "lying in wait" for violence.
If they were lying in wait at Baldwin Hills, they were disappointed. The three-screen complex lies about 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, in a largely middle-class black neighborhood in which Mr. Singleton lives. It is about two miles from the heart of the toughest gang-dominated areas. After the film ended Saturday night, a band of Bloods in red caps and loose-fitting jeans strolled past the theater in their characteristic slouching walk, under the watchful eyes of the police.
 
'Sensitive to Our Patrons'
 The theater complex is owned by the Economic Resources Corporation, a not-for-profit company based in Lynwood, Calif., that invests in minority ventures. It calls Baldwin Hills the only black-owned first-run theater in the United States. The theater, immaculate, employs local teen-agers, who sell popcorn while neatly dressed in white shirts and bow ties. Outside, celebrities like Louis Gossett Jr., Billy Dee Williams and Marvin Gaye have put their hand prints in the cement sidewalk, just as movie stars have at the historic Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
The reason that violence occurred at white-run theaters and not at Baldwin Hills, said its general manager, Nelson Bennett, was that the theater knew and respected the community while other theaters tended to treat young blacks with fear and contempt. "We are just trying to be sensitive to our patrons," he said. "If you come from the perception of extreme, this translates into the audience's being set up for trouble."
Mr. Drummond said: "We are not going to allow what happens in other parts of the city. We are not turning this theater over to anyone. We live in this community. We hire the local kids. Maybe the gangs respect this. They walk in here and take off their hats. This is neutral territory."
Nevertheless, a certain amount of tension surrounded the Saturday night screening. Security men scrutinized the line to keep apart members of Crips and Bloods gangs. Few of them flaunted the blue of the Crips or the red of the Bloods, but they were there. One man wearing a fire-red turban that identified him as a Blood was asked to remove it at the door. "You behave yourself, now," Mr. Drummond admonished the man, who did.
Afterwards, Dana Bell, an 18-year-old high school senior who said she lived amid the nightly killing seen in the film, said the film gave a true expression to the way many people in her community felt. She was also pleased, she said, that it was directed by a black man who grew up nearby.
To Harmon Spruill, a young black man who recently graduated from California State University at Los Angeles and who supervises youth programs in a local park nearby, the film's virtue was that it "showed attitudes of many people who continue to live in South Central" and portrayed them, for all their troubles and failings, as feeling, intelligent human beings. "This was not entertainment," he said. "This was reality."

HEADLINE: Detroit Abuzz: Who After Iacocca?

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 14

 BODY:
In an industry where strong executive rule is a matter of course, Lee A. Iacocca defined authority with such force that his persona and that of the Chrysler Corporation are virtually indistinguishable.
Now, with Chrysler nearing a financial crisis and Mr. Iacocca almost two years past normal retirement age, Chrysler directors are pressing Mr. Iacocca to get on with a plan for succession that will ease the jolt of his eventual departure and prepare new leaders for Chrysler's dicey future. 
 Mr. Iacocca, who will be 67 years old in October, has alternately portrayed himself in recent months as a lion in winter who is weary of the automotive wars and as Charlie Hustle, determined to whip Chrysler into shape -- possibly so it could be sold to a bigger, stronger auto maker. Asked who is being groomed to succeed him, he adopts a third persona: the Artful Dodger.
From interviews with company officers and associates who speak on condition of anonymity, it appears Mr. Iacocca is reluctant to designate either Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president, or Robert S. Miller Jr., its vice chairman, as his heir. Instead, he seems to be prospecting for someone whose stature and forcefulness he considers equal to his own. It is not clear, however, whether Mr. Iacocca will judge anyone as meeting that standard.
Mr. Iacocca may be ambivalent about giving up power. When he was approached to fill the seat of Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania, who was killed in a plane crash, Mr. Iacocca declined, implying that it was too late to enter a new line of work and saying, "It is no secret I'm nearing the end of my automotive career."
But several executives who have left Chrysler in the last three years are convinced he will never leave voluntarily, especially since the board last year awarded him a lucrative contract permitting him to stay as long as he likes. The company has no mandatory retirement age, although most executives do not stay beyond 65.
One executive who had doubts about Mr. Iacocca's departure schedule was the former vice chairman, Gerald Greenwald. Mr. Greenwald was Mr. Iacocca's heir apparent until May 1990, when the unions representing workers at the UAL Corporation paid him $9 million to spearhead an effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to buy the company, which owns United Airlines. Mr. Greenwald subsequently went to work for Dillon, Read & Company, the Wall Street investment house.
 
Heroes Have Trouble Leaving
Leaders of heroic proportions, like Mr. Iacocca, appear infrequently in corporate America. They leave a mark on companies, industries and the American scene, but quite often they cannot surrender leadership gracefully. Past examples include Dr. Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum, William S. Paley of CBS, and Edwin Land of Polaroid.
"It's very easy for some of these individuals to believe in their own indispensability," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, professor of management at Emory University. "They have made a difference, and without their companies they feel there is an abyss of insignificance. A violinist can do many things after leaving an orchestra, but a conductor only has the group."
The uncertainty about Chrysler's survival and who will lead it has set Detroit's gossip mills buzzing. Like Washington, Detroit is a city of pecking orders and ambition, and periodically it becomes a stage for feudal power struggles. In recent weeks, newspapers have published the names of various G.M. and Ford executives rumored to be potential Chrysler chairmen. The men, through spokesmen, deny that they have been approached by Chrysler.
The Wall Street Journal last week published a story, so far unconfirmed, saying that Mr. Iacocca used the former chairman of the Ford Motor Company, Donald E. Petersen, as an intermediary last winter to approach Ford about a merger. The Detroit newspapers then reported, quoting anonymous Ford sources, that Felix G. Rohatyn, a general partner at Lazard Freres & Company was the go-between.
Mr. Rohatyn said the report was rubbish. He did say, though, that he was familiar with Chrysler's situation because he represented Fiat, the Italian auto-making giant, last year in talks with Chrysler aimed at merging the two companies.
Chrysler's president, Mr. Lutz, a 59-year-old cigar-smoking former Marine fighter pilot, makes no secret of his wish to replace Mr. Iacocca. He is known to strongly disagree with Mr. Iacocca's attempts to sell Chrysler or merge it with another auto maker, and he believes Chrysler's new Jeep and car models scheduled to debut next year, will put the company on the road to financial health.
Now, after failing to find buyers for various assets, Chrysler is reported to be mulling a common stock offering to raise as much as $500 million. The new shares would dilute current holdings, probably causing a drop in price to below Friday's close of $14.625 on the Big Board -- a price that itself is well down from the $29.625 range at which Chrysler's shares traded in January 1989. A dilution would mean that major stockholders, including Mr. Iacocca, would lose millions.
But Chrysler may be running out of options. Its low credit ratings effectively preclude borrowing in public debt markets. Banks have granted the company a $1.7 billion credit line but will attach plants and machines as collateral if Chrysler uses the credit.
Starting this month, auto makers have little revenue because they are changing tools for the 1992 model year and do not produce many vehicles. Some analysts speculate Chrysler could be pressed for cash by the end of the fiscal quarter in September.
 
Dissent Among the Designers
 Many Chrysler executives, engineers and stylists complain that many of the company's car and truck models have sold poorly in recent years because of changes and delays ordered by Mr. Iacocca. The designers, in particular, roll their eyes when describing how Mr. Iacocca, with a wave of his cigar, has forced them to submit long, boxy designs and plenty of chrome, when rounder, cleaner models were clearly winning customers.
While diplomatically declining to apportion blame, Mr. Lutz nevertheless has begun to exercise more authority and impose his own tastes on future Chrysler models, leading many engineering and styling executives to assume that he would soon take command. He has also been reorganizing departments and appointing loyalists to positions of influence, notably Francois Castaing, who is now vice president for engineering.
Chrysler's vice chairman, Mr. Miller, a financial specialist, is seen as a less likely candidate because at age 53 he is younger and does not have much nuts-and-bolts knowledge of vehicle development, production and marketing.
Chrysler spokesmen, fearful of arousing Mr. Iacocca's ire by having quotes attributed to them, nevertheless acknowledge that Mr. Lutz's differences in taste and style, complicated by his ambition for power, have led to some loud and nasty confrontations between the two men.
"You would expect that from two people with strong personalities," one said.
About four months ago Mr. Lutz and Mr. Iacocca -- who typically does not socialize with subordinates -- were spotted dining together in a suburban Detroit restaurant. During the meal Mr. Iacocca was heard loudly criticizing Mr. Lutz's job performance. By the next day the story was making the rounds at the company's Highland Park headquarters.
Some Iacocca loyalists believe that if Mr. Lutz becomes chairman he would brand his predecessor the cause of Chrysler's troubles and tarnish Mr. Iacocca's place in history as the man who dusted himself off after being dismissed as president of Ford in 1978 and only a few years later helped Chrysler avert bankruptcy.
Mr. Iacocca "might be willing to give the chief executive's job to someone who would allow him to keep his perks and stay on in an advisory capacity," one former Chrysler executive said, "but not to someone who wants to build his career on Lee's ashes."

HEADLINE: Rising Costs Force Towns to Share Various Services

SERIES: Shared Solutions Governments Cooperating/First of two articles.

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
Crusading to hold down costs, local governments across the New York metropolitan region are beginning to share everything from police forces to Latin teachers.
In Rockland County, N.Y., the village of Nyack dissolved its 23-member police force this year and now pays to be patrolled by officers from nearby Orangetown and Clarkstown. 
 On Long Island, the towns of Babylon and Islip are pooling their garbage to help make more efficient use of incinerator plants in their communities.
In Bergen County, N.J., two school boards have agreed to the joint hiring of a private food-service company -- a decision that will save the Northern Highlands Regional High School and the Allendale School District more than $40,000 each.
And in Westchester County a two-way video monitor is sending a teacher's lessons in advanced Latin from Ossining into a high school classroom in Pleasantville, while an introductory Latin class is beamed back to Ossining.
The consolidation of services comes as cuts in state aid and rising costs have placed many communities in a financial chokehold. At the same time local officials are reluctant to find a solution in property-tax increases, because many residents complain that they can scarcely afford their taxes now.
 
Breaking the Status Quo
 While municipalities in the New York region have increasingly looked to merge services, such arrangements are more difficult in other parts of the country, where towns and cities are often farther apart. But some counties, like Duval and Hendry in Florida, have agreed to share things like landfills with their neighbors.
At all levels of government in the New York region, officials who have not set in motion the sharing of services are at least thinking about it, even though the idea of giving up local control, and the jobs and prestige that go with that, has long been anathema.
"One of the good effects of a fiscal crisis is that you break the iron grasp of the status quo," said Dr. John Shannon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington. "You see it working out very well in the Northeast, where things are happening both to save money and improve efficiency."
In New Jersey, the State Assembly has passed a bill aimed at taking the pulse of voters on whether they are interested in regionalization. The measure, now before the State Senate, would give residents in towns with fewer than 10,000 people the right to vote this November on creating a committee to talk with neighboring towns about sharing services.
"I want to start a grass-roots revolution," said the bill's chief sponsor, John Paul Doyle, the Deputy Assembly Speaker and a Democrat worried about taxpayer backlash in legislative elections this fall.
But it is a revolution that is meeting considerable resistance in some quarters.
"In the cause of efficiency, are you going to wipe out this wonderful euphemism of local control?" said Dr. George Sternlieb, the former director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "Over my dead body. The real measure of local control is who sits on the money and who sits on the jobs."
Barry Skokowski, deputy commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs and the director of the Division of Local Government Services, said: "The political reality is that someone is going to lose a job somewhere, and that makes consolidation difficult. But the majority of our towns have fewer than 5,000 people. It lends itself to at least joint services, if not full consolidation."
 
Battling 'Suburban Apartheid'
 There seems to be a growing awareness that the economic arguments for joining forces may be more compelling than the arguments for going it alone, or what Dr. Shannon of the Urban Institute describes as a state of "suburban apartheid."
Jeff Morosoff, executive assistant to the Town Supervisor in Babylon, said: "The problem for many years was that towns never looked beyond their borders. But there is such a cost to isolating yourself."
The cost to Babylon in the matter of garbage disposal was a penalty assessed by the incinerator plant in its community because the town could not meet its guarantee of 750 tons of refuse a day. On the other hand, Islip, an adjacent town, had 900 tons of garbage a day, but the incinerator it used could handle but 600 tons. Islip had to ship its excess out of town at high cost. Solution: Islip now sends some of its excess to Babylon and saves.
The layers of government are so dense in the suburbs of New York City that it is not unusual to have an incorporated village lying within an incorporated town, each with its own administration, police force, highway department and local court.
In New York State, for instance, there are some 10,000 separate governmental entities, from counties, cities, towns and villages to fire, water and sewer districts. "There's a big tax revolt, and people perceive that they may be paying taxes to six or seven layers of local government," said Secretary of State Gail S. Shaffer, who heads a Commission on Consolidation in Local Government recently established by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
On the public education front, because of declining enrollment over the last 20 years, many school districts now have fewer than 2,500 students, making it difficult to pay for advanced courses and electives. In New Jersey, where Gov. Jim Florio has been pushing for regionalization, 43 high schools have fewer than 500 students.
"There's small, and then there's too small," said Tom Corcoran, the Governor's policy adviser for education. "When you start to drop below a certain level, then either your costs go up or the range of services you can offer is reduced -- or both. And that's not good."
 
Small Districts, High Costs
 A study released last month by a Princeton research group buttressed that argument. The Public Affairs Research Institute said that smaller New Jersey school districts tended to have disproportionately high administrative payrolls, based on a study of 460 of the state's roughly 600 school districts.
The research group said that all but five of the 128 districts that spent less than 3 percent of their 1988-89 budgets on administration salaries served more than 1,000 students. All but four of the 55 districts that spent 6 percent or more had fewer than 700 pupils.
In Connecticut, the Governor's Commission on Quality and Integrated Education came out last December in favor of regionalizing school districts to cut costs and achieve a measure of racial and socio-economic integration.
Education Commissioner Gerald N. Tirozzi, who says Connecticut can no longer afford to operate 166 school districts, will soon ask the state to create "some carrots and sticks" to encourage mergers. "If you were to consolidate school districts," he said, "you could save a small fortune."
"It isn't going to be an easy sell," said Mr. Tirozzi, "because home rule is so important in New England. But people are so concerned about the economic plight of the state that you might be able to put certain recommendations on the table that weren't palatable a few years ago."
 
Consolidation Catching On
 In Westchester County, a new report called "Government at the Crossroads," published by a quasi-public corporation called Westchester 2000, proposed the creation of a central school board in the county to oversee the existing 56 districts. It also floated the idea of combining some of the county's smaller towns and villages.
"The scary part is that the reaction has been unanimously positive," said Dr. Sal J. Prezioso, executive director of Westchester 2000. "Five or seven years ago this thing would never fly. But now, with the recession here and the state and Federal governments washing their hands, municipalities realize they're in trouble."
Still, officials have to be convinced that sharing services will result in savings, and they do not have much recent experience to guide them. It has been 30 years since the last time two municipalities in New Jersey became one -- when Vineland and Landis Township merged. Furthermore only a single merger occurred between two school districts in the last 10 years. And the idea of sharing services has not been actively pursued until now.
The lack of example has stymied officials like Mayor James T. Dowden of Bridgewater, N.J., who met with his counterparts in neighboring Somerville, Branchburg and Raritan to see how they could share services.
Mayor Dowden said his township and the borough of Somerville were ready to undertake a 90-day test to merge their police departments. After receiving cooperation from the county prosecutor's office and the state's Criminal Justice Division, Bridgewater's Council backed down.
 
Results in Advance Asked
 "They wanted financial data up front -- how much is this going to save, what is it going to mean," said Mayor Dowden. "Well, these were questions you could only answer once you did the test."
When two school districts in Westchester County tackled the topic of merging, the plan was derailed by arguments that were both economic and emotional.
"My guess is you might save 3 percent by merging," said Dr. Stanley Toll, the Superintendent of the Ardsley Union Free School District, which considered merging with the district serving the neighboring village of Ardsley. He said the cost of education could be driven up by the need to expand special academic programs in one district to the other and vice versa.
In any case, when the idea of folding the two districts into one was broached two years ago, it whipped up such a fury in Ardsley that a formal study was dropped. "There were no fans of this," Dr. Toll said. "They said they moved to Ardsley and not to Dobbs Ferry or anywhere else. Whether they're right or wrong, they feel we're better."
 
Identity Hard to Surrender
 Liz Jaffe, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, said: "People like their own identity, and we haven't seen the proof yet economically in terms of where the savings really are. Schools probably aren't going to start merging unless the state mandates it."
From Albany to Trenton to Hartford, state officials say they do not plan to force school districts and towns to consolidate or even to share services. But they do intend to make changes in state statutes and regulations that would at least make it easier for local officials to start the process themselves.
"We're not going to impose some grand design for local government consolidation," said Ms. Shaffer, New York's Secretary of State. "It's obvious that these issues can become emotional and political. We are trying to remove some of the impediments and create some incentives."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Big Gamble on Schwarzkopf Book

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
While the spending of more than $90 million on Arnold Schwarzenegger's capers in Carolco's new movie, "Terminator 2," strikes many as bold but quite possibly shrewd, the payment of close to $6 million for a mere book with a few hundred pages and a handful of motionless pictures still seems outlandish.
Yet that is what Bantam Books, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany, has recently agreed to spend for the world rights to the memoirs of a real-life warrior, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf. In so doing, it is betting that like Lee A. Iacocca, Donald J. Trump and Brig. Gen. Chuck Yeager the hero of the Persian Gulf war has a story that will sell books in unusual quantities. 
 The celebrity's life story, written with a collaborator, is now such a staple of American life that few big stars or heroes have resisted.
But the recent history of the genre is so checkered that a prediction is hazardous. For every Iacocca book, there is a Ronald Reagan memoir that flops; for every Trump best seller, a Trump sequel that is a disaster.
"Once in a long while, you sell a million hardcover copies of this kind of book, and that causes the entrepreneurial spirit of publishers to rise," said Roger Donald, the publisher of Little, Brown. "But if you don't do it, it's very easy to lose a couple of million dollars."
Although there are many variables that affect a book's profitability, it appears from some publishers' estimates that the Schwarzkopf book will have to sell at least 450,000 copies in hardback and 1.5 million copies in paperback to break even.
Little, Brown bid what Mr. Donald called "a great deal of money" for the Schwarzkopf book, but not enough. Macmillan Inc. bid $1.2 million; Viking Penguin, about $3.2 million, and Random House, $5 million. The very range of these offers reflects the extreme unpredictability of such projects.
The only big house that did not bid was Simon & Schuster, which lost what other publishers estimated as a seven-figure sum on Mr. Reagan's book last year. Having paid an estimated $7 million in 1989 for Mr. Reagan's memoirs, as well as a book of speeches, the house fell victim to the ephemeral whims of Americans.
"When we signed that contract, there was a warm feeling in everyone's hearts for Mr. Reagan, but we did not realize how thin that was," a Simon & Schuster executive said. "Reagan just evaporated, and the nostalgia we hoped would sell the book was not there."
And Charles Leerhsen, who collaborated with Mr. Trump on his calamitous second effort, "Surviving at the Top," said, "The ultimate thing with this kind of book is the public perception of the person at the time it is released."
 
Big Loss for Random House
 Mobbed at a booksellers' convention in June 1990, Mr. Trump was a dubious loser by the time his book came out two months later. His first book, "The Art of the Deal," sold more than a million copies; "Surviving at the Top" sold about a tenth of that. Random House is believed by other publishers to have lost well over $1 million on it.
So could the man that Bantam executives refer to as "the good general" be as vulnerable to an abrupt swing in the public's mood by the fall of 1992, when his book is due to be published?
"When you go into a project like this, you give it a great deal of thought," said Linda Grey, Bantam's publisher. "We would not have pursued it if we felt there could be a turnabout in feeling for the general. Could I be wrong? Of course, I could be."
She added: "I believe America is a country in search of heroes. We've had our problems; we've been told we're no good anymore, that we can't compete with Japan. Well, Schwarzkopf is the antithesis of that. He stands for American know-how, competence, doing a job right. He embodies values, such as the very work ethic this country was founded on, that have enduring popular appeal."
Just how popular the Schwarzkopf book must be to justify its price amounts to a complex equation. But almost all publishers now have computers "to run the numbers."
Feed in an imaginary hardback sales figure, hypothetical foreign rights sales in Japan or even Saudi Arabia, estimated marketing costs, assumed paperback sales and the author's advance, and the computer will flash back the profit or loss.
"The editor can input any assumptions he wants," said Barry Lippmann, Macmillan's publisher. "The only limits are one's ability to fantasize and capacity to delude oneself."
Peter Mayer, the chairman of Penguin U.S.A., added: "This is not like running numbers in a normal business. These are no more than 'guesstimates.' "
 
What the Book Needs to Do
 One leading publisher agreed to do some estimates on the Schwarzkopf book. Imagine the following: a $22.95 hardcover price and a $6.95 paperback price; net sales of 625,000 units in hardback and 1.5 million units in paperback; foreign rights, first serial rights and book-club sales for a total of $2.5 million; an advance paid to Schwarzkopf of $6 million; marketing costs of $750,000, and production costs of $1.44 a book for hardbacks and 51 cents a book for paperbacks.
Then, push a button: Bantam will make a net profit of $1.25 million, or a margin of 8.26 percent, slightly below the minimum of 10 percent that publishers want to earn on a book.
But change a few numbers. Cut the hardback sale to 375,000 from 625,000, the paperback sale to 1.2 million from 1.5 million, the rights sales to $2 million from $2.5 million, and Bantam posts a net loss of $1.3 million.
Of course, nobody has any idea how many copies the Schwarzkopf book will sell. All that is known is that to sell more than 500,000 copies of a nonfiction hardback is very arduous, and more than a million exceptional. But, Ms. Grey said, "we have the experience to reach a very high plateau."
Bantam is indeed renowned as a superb marketer of books and has published two other nonfiction works -- Mr. Iacocca's and General Yeager's -- that sold 2.6 million and 1.1 million in hardback, respectively. If the house can sell more than a million copies with General Schwarzkopf, it will make a killing. "I suspect that the book is probably a pretty smart buy for Bantam," Mr. Donald of Little, Brown said.
 
Advantage of a Film Maker
 But what Bantam cannot do with General Schwarzkopf, apparently, is hedge as effectively as a film maker by selling the product abroad and in other forms like videos and pay television. Carolco, for example, said it had earned back most of its investment on "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" through foreign sales before the movie came out. Even the most generous assessment of Bantam's rights sales would not allow the house to earn back more than half its investment before publication.
"On the movie side, you can spread the risk much more easily, both geographically and through products such as video," said Steven Rattner, a general partner and head of the media department at Lazard Freres & Company. "For books there has not been the same explosion of outlets. The Schwarzkopf deal strikes me as an enormous amount of money."
Bantam is clearly concerned about the general's image over the next year and what it perceives as the need for speed in getting the book out before a Reagan-like fadeout. "The general will work very hard on the book and make only a few selected public appearances," Ms. Grey said.
Marvin Josephson, the general's agent, said General Schwarzkopf "could be doing commercials, endorsements, licenses, but his desire is to keep a low profile."
Ms. Grey has told agents representing writers who may work with the general that the manuscript must be delivered by May 1, 1992 -- leaving just eight months to write it from the general's retirement -- and that it is essential the book be out before the 1992 elections.
Indeed, the book contract is believed to include a clause giving the general a substantial bonus for delivering the book on time.
The autobiography will have to compete against several quick books on General Schwarzkopf, including one by this reporter. But Ms. Grey dismissed the rival books. "People want the general's view," she said. Furthermore, Bantam is obviously betting that those books will no longer be competing for buyers when the general's autobiography appears.
Aside from the money the book earns, Stuart Applebaum, a Bantam vice president, argued that his entire company would benefit from the fact that "Scwhwarzkopf is now a Bantam author." The general's presence at sales conventions and at the American Booksellers Association's annual meeting is expected to provide excitment for all of Bantam's books.
Moreover, even if the book proves not to be worth the amount paid, it should still be a best seller.
Whatever else it is, the Schwarzkopf autobiography is representative of the modern publishing world.
Competition for celebrity names drives up prices. As Mr. Mayer of Penguin U.S.A. observed, "These are massive sums to be spending, and there is no question that the last few years has seen an enormous increase in unearned advances."

HEADLINE: After 4 Years, British Envoy Is Leaving a New South Africa

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN

 BODY:
When Sir Robin Renwick arrived here as the new British ambassador in 1987, his debut coincided with a bleak period of resistance to change in South Africa under former President P. W. Botha.
"What we were seeing at that time," Sir Robin said, "was an attempt to respond to the steam building up inside the caldron by trying to nail the lid down harder and tighter." 
 Four years later, Sir Robin takes a more optimistic leave of South Africa as it repudiates apartheid under President F. W. de Klerk.
"Now the country's facing problems of a completely different nature," said the diplomat, who is to become Britain's Ambassador to Washington next month. "I do think that the underlying situation is fundamentally better in that for the first time in South Africa's history, the possibility has been created of finding a solution to South Africa's problems."
Sir Robin worries less about black nationalists in the African National Congress than about white Marxists tempted to experiment with an ideology rejected elsewhere in Africa and in Eastern Europe. He thinks South Africa can be helped best not through sanctions but through foreign assistance to its democratic organizations.
And he contends that South Africa is lucky to have Nelson Mandela and F. W. de Klerk. Sir Robin described both leaders, whose confidences he earned, as patriots concerned about the dangers ahead, though they confronted pressure from different constituencies.
Sir Robin will not have the chance to watch the outcome. In going to the United States, Sir Robin sets aside an expertise in African affairs acquired during much of his 28-year diplomatic career. He worked on the independence settlements of Zimbabwe and Namibia and has played a quiet intermediary role in South Africa's own transition.
In an interview before his departure, Sir Robin offered some valedictory thoughts. To roll back the tide of political decay and poverty in South Africa, he said, required not just multiparty democracy but also a free-market economy that offered blacks participation through affirmative action.
"Unless you preserve the basic framework of a free economy, then I suspect that we will end up with similar economic difficulties to those that exist in the rest of Africa," he said.
"I think state-directed economies never work anywhere, but they particularly don't work in Africa, where the bureaucracy is not strong enough to administer them effectively," he said. "And I think that of all the spectacular failures of Marxism, the fact is that the most spectacular failures of Marxism anywhere have been in Africa."
Because apartheid had skewed South Africa's economy, it lacked credibility for millions of blacks, and, Sir Robin added, "there is in the liberation movements a deeply ingrained belief in state socialism."
He expressed satisfaction that the African National Congress had muted its talk of nationalizing banks and mines when it came to power.
"I do frankly worry much more about the attitude of the white Communists than I do about the black leaders," Sir Robin said, "because quite a few of the white Communists have learned nothing and forgotten nothing and really believe that all these disasters in Eastern Europe were caused by pilot error, that there was nothing wrong with the design of the plane."
"Well, people who believe that are capable of destroying a few more economies," he said.
Sir Robin has been critical of economic sanctions, but he said he was not doctrinaire about the issue. He credited the arms embargo with getting Pretoria's forces out of Angola, for example.
"What always has worried me has been disinvestment. If you talk to companies who are leaving, almost any company will tell you that in all honesty they don't intend to come back," Sir Robin said.
Sir Robin believed the best way to hasten apartheid's demise was to assist community groups and organizations in South Africa working for democratic change. But he said people could choose their strategies.
South Africa's problems, Sir Robin contended, could only be solved through negotiations between the country's black and white leaders without outside intervention. But the transition should be accelerated, he said, with both sides agreeing upon principles that they wanted in a new constitution.
"If that's done, then I do believe that the transitional problems which are difficult and dangerous do become easier to manage," Sir Robin said.

HEADLINE: Seized Bank Helped Andrew Young Firm And Carter Charities

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 14

 BODY:
Charitable organizations created by former President Jimmy Carter received $8 million in contributions from the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, and Andrew Young, the Carter Administration's representative at the United Nations, had a consulting arrangement with the bank while he was the Mayor of Atlanta.
The $8 million in donations spanned several years and were given to Mr. Carter's Global 2000 Inc., which the former President organized to help improve health and agriculture in developing countries. The bank also donated $500,000 toward the construction of the multimillion-dollar Carter Center of Emory University in Atlanta, which includes the Jimmy Carter Library and operates health, agricultural and political mediation programs around the world.
 
'No Strings Attached'
 As investigators sift through the complex history of the bank, which was seized by regulators in seven countries earlier this month, there has been no suggestion that Mr. Carter performed any services for the institution. But the details of the charitable gifts and the arrangement with Mr. Young demonstrate the way in which the bank created ties with American public officials to help it do business. 
 In the first details provided by the Carter Center, Carrie Harmon, a spokeswoman, confirmed the contributions and said today that "all of our contributions are straight, no-strings-attached contributions." She said none of the money, some of which was contributed as recently as a year ago, went to Mr. Carter, who does not draw a salary from the center.
"With everything we know today, we would not be likely to solicit funds from them in the future," Ms. Harmon said. She did not elaborate, but the bank pleaded guilty in Florida last year to charges of money-laundering for drug activities. When regulators seized the bank , the Bank of England accused it of engaging in extensive fraud.
The Central Intelligence Agency had used the bank for intelligence operations before it was seized and the bank was involved in secret arms deals, including the covert sale of American arms to Iran in 1986, according to Government and bank documents and former Government and bank officials.
At its peak, the bank had offices in more than 70 countries. It is currently under criminal investigation in four American cities and has been involved in several foreign political and business scandals.
Mr. Young had a longtime personal and business relationship with the founder of the bank, Aga Hassan Abedi, a financier in Pakistan who later left the country. The relationship lasted for nearly a decade, including years when Mr. Young served as Atlanta's Mayor. The bank provided a credit line to Mr. Young's small Washington-based trading firm, and Mr. Young introduced the bank to third world leaders in exchange for a $50,000 annual retainer paid to his firm, Andrew Young Associates Inc.
All these activities were legal under the ethics laws governing Atlanta's elected officials.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Young defended the bank and Mr. Abedi, who founded the bank with Middle East money. Mr. Young said he was convinced of Mr. Abedi's personal honesty and said the bank's far-flung financial empire seemed to reflect not only Mr. Abedi's commitment to making money but to contributing to the communities in which the bank operated.
 
 Plane Provided for Tour

"I have never been self-conscious about my relationship with B.C.C.I. and Mr. Abedi," Mr. Young said. "I saw them as a third world bank. They were very free-market oriented, but non-European. Consequently they had the trust of a lot of people who saw themselves as socialists or as victims of neocolonialist exploitation."
"Every good idea that Carter or I had, Abedi was willing to finance," Mr. Young added. "He was never really giving us cash, but he was encouraging the local banks that he controlled to seed our projects. So I am reluctant to see B.C.C.I. as this sinister operation that everybody is making it out to be."
In 1986, Mr. Young recalled, Mr. Abedi provided his personal Boeing 727 for Mr. Carter and Mr. Young to take a whirlwind, five-day tour of five African countries. The trip was an attempt by Mr. Carter to convince the leaders of those countries to allow the Global 2000 project to set up agricultural experiments using specially developed drought-resistant seeds.
Mr. Young said the B.C.C.I.-owned banks in each of the five countries was providing the money to buy the seeds and fertilizer for the experiments.
On another occasion, Mr. Young said, B.C.C.I. donated the money that allowed a number of African government leaders to attend a trade conference in Tunisia that was sponsored by Young Ideas, a non-profit organization created by Mr. Young after he left the U.N. post.
 
 Effort to Eradicate Disease

One Carter Center program that caught Mr. Abedi's eye was Global 2000's efforts to eradicate dracunculiasis, or Guinea worm disease, which infects about 10 million people in Africa, India and Pakistan, Mr. Abedi's homeland. The disease can be prevented by providing clean drinking water. Mr. Carter, who serves as chairman of Global 2000, began an eradication program in Pakistan in 1986 and was later involved in organizing efforts in Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda. The bank's contributions began in 1987.
Mr. Young's third world contacts come from his days as the United States representative at the United Nations. He stressed the building of trade and commercial bridges to Africa, Asia and Latin America during his two terms as Atlanta's Mayor in the 1980's. Mr. Young said that at a time when many in the West were "caricaturing third world" leaders like Michael Manley of Jamaica and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Mr. Abedi and his bank took them seriously and courted them.
"The way to get these countries involved in a free-market economy was through trade and investment and in that sense B.C.C.I. was practicing, to my knowledge, everything that I believed in," said Mr. Young. "I can't defend all of their banking practices, but I can certainly defend Mr. Abedi."
 
Contacts in Third World Nations

At various times in the last 10 years Mr. Young, through his modest foreign trade and consulting business, was a consultant to the bank, providing it with contacts in more than a dozen third world countries. including Nicaragua, Guatemala, Zambia and Tanzania. He said these contacts included businesses and government officials.
"The arrangement with B.C.C.I. didn't trouble me because I never got any of the money per se," Mr. Young said. He added that his firm acted as a middleman in some modest trading of typewriters and oil, for example, but it "was started largely to keep employed many of the people who were involved with me at the U.N. He formed the business in 1979, the year he resigned from the post at the U.N. after a controversy erupted when he privately opened talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Stoney Cooks, Mr. Young's longtime business and political associate who ran the now dormant firm's daily affairs, said that in 1980 it obtained a line of credit from the National Bank of Georgia, which at the time was controlled by Gaith Pharaon, a major B.C.C.I. shareholder and an associate of Mr. Abedi's. Mr. Pharaon had bought the National Bank of Georgia from Bert Lance, President Carter's one-time budget director. In 1981, the line was transferred to B.C.C.I.
 
Began With Five or Six Clients

Mr. Young's business began with five or six clients, Mr. Cooks said. "There was never a shortage of money to pay the loans but as the Mayor became more engaged in being Mayor, he was not available as much," Mr. Cooks added.
"Mr. Abedi thought we could be of assistance to the bank as it sought to expand around the world," said Mr. Cooks. "We introduced them to banking opportunities and we had a good positive feeling about them."
On one occasion, Mr. Young said a Nigerian businessman seeking a loan from a British bank to import American-made farming equipment to his country was denied the loan unless he agreed to purchase British-made equipment. The Nigerian approached Mr. Young, who referred him to the bank and the loan was arranged. Mr. Young said he did not receive any fees for this.
 
Retainer of $50,000 a Year

Of the $50,000 annual retainer, was Mr. Cooks said the money was generally taken in the form of reductions in outstanding loans or travel expenses. In 1985, Mr. Cooks said he submitted expenses on trips he and Mr. Young had made on the bank's behalf at the direction of Swaleh Naqvi, a top official of the bank and a longtime aide of Mr. Abedi's. The expenses slightly exceeded the amount Mr. Young's company owed the bank, Mr. Cooks said. So, rather than receiving the retainer, the travel expenses were used to reduce the balance on the credit line,
At its peak, the bank's credit to the firm was $175,000, said Mr. Cooks, who was its vice president. The interest rate was the prime rate, plus one percentage point, Mr. Cooks recalled. The company regularly paid interest on the outstanding balance out of money generated by the firm's trade deals or fees from Mr. Young's speaking engagements. The credit line has not been used since 1986, Mr. Cooks said.
Although the post of Mayor of Atlanta is a full-time job paying $100,000 annually, no law bars the Mayor, City Council members and even some appointed officials from having private businesses. Those concerns are, however, barred from dealing with the city. Each year, officials must disclose the total income derived from those outside businesses. Exact figures were unavaliable, but both Mr. Young and Mr. Cooks indicated that Andrew Young Associates never was a big money-maker.
 
Served Two Terms

Mr. Young, elected Mayor in 1981, served two terms. During his first term, Mr. Young was criticized because of his extensive foreign travel and absences, though it was not a major issue and Mr. Young was easily re-elected.
As Mayor, he often traveled as an invited guest of foreign governments, for speaking engagements or as a city booster for the local Chamber of Commerce. In most cases, said Carol Muldawer, a former aide to Mr. Young, city money was not used to pay for such trips.
Ms. Muldawer said that by the time Mr. Young reached his second term many Atlantans had begun to see a real benefit for the city. Foreigners financed new construction, more foreign dignitaries visited the city and last year Atlanta was chosen as the site for the 1996 summer Olympic Games.
Mr. Young, who is trained as a Congregationalist minister and was former lieutenant of the Rev. Martin Luther King's and his non-violent civil rights movement, said that he always saw a highly spiritual side to Mr. Abedi's endeavors.
This gave him a different perspective on Mr. Abedi and the bank. "I think white folks in Britain and other places didn't like these third world people having this much money and power," he said, "and I always felt that they were getting so big and powerful that they would come under attack."

HEADLINE: In Ruling, Hope for Students Deceived by Schools

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., July 14

 BODY:
No one has challenged George Leeson's claim that Northeastern Business College here lured him with false promises, failed to give him an education and left him with nearly $3,000 in student loans. A state court has called the defunct school's behavior "unconscionable."
The question is who should pay. Mr. Leeson says not him, and a sympathetic ruling by a Federal judge, permitting the suit to go forward, has opened the door to similar arguments across the country. 
 Such rulings could relieve former trade-school students like Mr. Leeson, who are often guileless poor people seeking to better themselves, of tens of millions of dollars of debt. They could also hand large losses to banks and other lenders. And facing such losses, lenders may become unwilling to do business with unscrupulous schools, bringing significant changes to the nation's troubled student loan program.
Under consumer law in many states, banks can be held liable if they act as business partners to fraudulent companies. Banks say that the Federal student loan laws pre-empt the state laws and that the Federal law protects the banks. Ruling in Mr. Leeson's case in June, Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. of Federal District Court rejected the banks' arguments, saying students could sue under state or Federal law.
 
Moral Victory, Some Say

 Advocates for students are hailing the decision as not only a potential financial victory but also a moral one.
"The Government has fostered this fraud on a wholesale level because it won't police the system," said Dan Hedges, a Charleston legal services lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of Mr. Leeson and about 2,000 other former Northeastern Business College students. "And the banks have been getting rich in the process."
Similar suits are pending in California, Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas, and lawyers expect more to follow. In at least one of those cases, though not in West Virginia, students are also suing the private accrediting agency for approving the school.
The ruling in Mr. Leeson's case comes amid increasing concern about soaring default rates in the student loan program and unscrupulous practices at many private, profit-seeking trade schools. In May, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, led by Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, found "fraud and abuse at every level" of the program, with problems concentrated "particularly in the area of proprietary schools."
The Nunn report found that such schools sometimes recruit from welfare offices promising lucrative careers in areas like cosmetology and truck driving. The report said many of the schools were more interested in collecting financial aid checks than in education and called the oversight of the schools by the Federal Department of Education "dismal."
Congress is rewriting the student loan program this year. The Government backs about $12.4 billion a year in student loans. Since 1983, the cost of defaults has more than tripled, to almost $2 billion a year.
 
Exercise in Finger Pointing

As the unpaid bills have risen, so has the fervor of what amounts to an exercise in finger pointing, both in court and beyond.
The Northeastern students here argue that the banks collaborated in a fraudulent business by winking at the school's abuses while reaping large profits in interest from the guaranteed loans. In addition, they say a guarantee agency, the middleman group between the Government and the banks, reaped lucrative servicing fees while failing to supervise the banks or the schools. And they say the Government supervised no one.
"None of them don't care a diddly-darn about us," said Mr. Leeson, who had hoped to become a police officer but now lives on a $613 monthly disability check. "They just want their money."
The lenders -- banks and guarantee agencies -- say it is unfair to hold them liable since no one ever said they were supposed to monitor the schools' quality. That, they say, is the responsibility of the Federal Education Department, state licensing agencies and private accreditation groups. The Nunn investigation faulted all three legs of the triad, saying they failed to insure educational quality.
The lenders say the only reason they lent the money to impoverished students, who are usually considered bad credit risks, is that the Government backed the loans. "To turn around and throw it back after the fact is unfair to the lenders," said Ian Macoy of the American Bankers Association.
In court, the Education Department is supporting legal arguments that would hold the banks liable. But it has also proposing regulations that would protect the banks from such liability. Repeated calls to department officials last week went unanswered.
 
Closed and Without Assets

As is typical, no one can collect from the school itself, since it is closed and without assets.
Mr. Leeson, now 44 years old, brought to the school a lifelong desire to be a police officer. Before dropping out of high school, he served in a cadet corps that allowed him to wear a badge and carry a club, but he was turned down by the force for being too short.
He said the height restriction was relaxed in the years he spent driving trucks and working in junkyards. In 1986, unemployed and recently divorced, Mr. Leeson responded to the school's advertisement for a law-enforcement course that he said virtually promised a job as an officer.
"I fell for it hook, line and sinker," he said.
Mr. Leeson said the school had promised him expense money, a weapons permit and a chance to ride in police cars. Instead, his teachers kept quitting and the course did not even include books. Then, about halfway through the yearlong course, he arrived at school one night to find it padlocked for good. All he had to show for his efforts was his unpaid student loan.
"They picked on the poor people is what they done," Mr. Leeson said. "They didn't go out there and get no highfalutin' people."
He argues that the lenders were not innocent bystanders but rather functioned as the school's business partners.
The school recruited the students, processed the paperwork and received the mailed checks directly from the banks. Mr. Leeson, like many others, never set foot in a bank and says he was not aware until partway through the course that he would be asked to repay the money.
No suits are being filed in cases where students approached a bank on their own, seeking a loan.
The banks argue that such partnership theories are being manufactured in court and were never spelled out in many years of practice or in Government regulations.
 
The Banks' Argument

"Nobody's ever told us that before," said K. Paul Davis, a lawyer for the Charleston National Bank and several others that did business with Northeastern. "The rules say if the school's on the list, you can make loans. It's that simple.
Asked whether the banks knew about the school's practices and turned its head, Mr. Davis said, "I shouldn't comment on that."
He added: "How do I know if a school out in the suburbs is providing education or not? I may hear rumors."
The ruling by Judge Copenhaver, who was appointed to the bench by President Gerald R. Ford in 1976, was handed down June 21 and is not binding on other courts. But Jonathan Sheldon of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston said that as the first clear Federal opinion it was being viewed as influential.
Students must first prove that the trade schools defrauded them before they can erase their debts. In the Northeastern case, the Federal court has not yet addressed that issue. In a separate case, a state court ruled that Northeastern did engage in deceptive practices.
The Federal ruling also left unclear who might ultimately bear the cost of the loans. The banks have already recouped their money in reimbursements from the guarantee agency, which, in turn, has been trying to collect from the students.
Mr. Leeson worries that a collection agency may go after his disability check. He said pellets left in his head 17 years ago in a hunting accident have shifted, leaving him unable to work.
"They start cutting my check, I'll be hurting," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. AND SOVIET UNION AGREE ON ALL BUT TECHNICAL ISSUE FOR STRATEGIC ARMS TREATY

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union announced today after four days of marathon talks that they had resolved all issues for a treaty reducing long-range nuclear arms, except for one highly technical dispute that they hope to resolve in the coming days.
Given the progress, it now appears that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which will reduce Soviet and American long-range nuclear arsenals by about 30 percent and has been in negotiation since 1982, is on the verge of completion. 
 Mr. Baker said that if the dispute could be wrapped up in the next few days -- which he emphasized was by no means assured -- there would still be time for full-scale summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow late this month. The two leaders had made the completion of the agreement, sometimes referred to as the Start treaty, a condition for a full summit meeting.
 
Mutual Exhaustion
 "It's a tremendous step forward to finalizing the Start treaty," said a weary-looking Mr. Bessmertnykh, standing next to a similarly weary-looking Mr. Baker at a news conference in the State Department lobby. "The long journey of nine years is coming really to the end. We're a little exhausted, but everybody's happy about the amount of job we have accomplished." [Excerpts from the news conference, page A10.]
In London tonight, President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the President was "encouraged that they've made as much progress as they have and that they're as close to reaching an agreement as they appear to be."
Mr. Fitzwater said "it's hard to say" whether a Moscow summit is possible at the end of July. "The President has been very emphatic in saying that he does not expect to have a summit meeting without a treaty to sign," he said. "So I think at this point it would be very unlikely that we would have a summit without a Start treaty."
 
Reducing Accord to Writing
 The treaty would bring the number of Soviet long-range nuclear warheads down from 11,000 to 7,000 and the United States' from 12,000 to 9,000.
For his part, Mr. Baker emphasized that all the agreements reached in the last four days still have to be turned into the formal language of written accords by treaty negotiators in Geneva .
In the past, that has often led to further wrangling, including disputes over English and Russian translation, and Mr. Baker went out of his way to say that he could not rule out something similar in this case -- even though negotiators codified their understandings in writing.
American officials said the progress signaled that the Soviets really do want to conclude a treaty, which would be the first arms-control agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weapons, apparently in the hope of propelling relations with the United States into a new era in which economic issues are predominant.
Moscow is seeking economic assistance from Western countries to help rebuild its economy. Mr. Gorbachev is expected to make his case for such aid to the leaders of seven industrial nations gathering in London this week.
Mr. Baker said that he and Mr. Bessmertnykh had assigned their specialists to try to reach an understanding on this last technical dispute -- how to define a nuclear missile's throw-weight for the purpose of determining whether the missile should be classified as a "new type," and therefore assumed to carry a different number of warheads.
 
Many Agreements
 The other major issues that divided the sides before the talks began on Thursday have been settled, Mr. Baker said, including how to monitor missile tests, the number of spare warhead spaces allowed on each missile and the broader definition of what constitutes a new type of missile.
"The one issue on which we have not been able to agree has to do with the definition of throw-weight for the purpose of determining whether the missile is a missile of a new type," Mr. Baker said. "This is a very technical issue. And our technicians and experts will continue to work on this issue. Perhaps the Minister and I might be able to follow up ourselves when the two Presidents get together in London on Wednesday.
"If we can cover this one last issue, we will have an agreement."
Mr. Baker suggested that in the endgame of negotiations the Soviets made most of the concessions, and the Americans virtually none, which drew a few amused smiles from Mr. Bessmertnykh. The Russian did, however, acknowledge some concessions.
Politically, both Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh came into the talks keenly aware that the appearance of how they concluded the treaty could be almost as important as the actual substance in selling the pact to their respective legislatures -- the Senate and the Supreme Soviet -- for approval.
Richard R. Burt, the former chief American negotiator on long-range arms, said that "neither side wants to appear to have made the last concession."
Both American and Soviet hard-liners put their respective negotiators on notice that they intend to scrutinize every aspect of this treaty with an eye to rejecting it.
Indeed, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, told Mr. Baker hours before he began his talks with Mr. Bessmertnykh that the Soviets are "cheats and liars and scoundrels," so Mr. Baker had better come to the Senate with a treaty that is airtight to prevent Soviet evasions.
 
Who Conceded What?
 While all of the details have not been disclosed, there appears to be some basis for Mr. Baker's suggestion that the Soviet side made more concessions. The Americans appear to have gotten much of what they were seeking from the Soviets on the issues of spaces for warheads and of data denial, or how missile tests are monitored, while the Soviets got close to what they had been seeking on defining and dealing with new types of missiles.
For instance, on the issue of data denial, the Soviets agreed to an American proposal that they exchange tapes from every one of each other's long-range nuclear missile tests, as a way to insure compliance with the treaty.
The Soviets had initially resisted exchanging so much data, and when they accepted the concept of trading tapes they wanted to do it on some tests rather than on all, as Washington demanded.
Because the United States tests its missiles over water, where Soviet ships can easily pick up their telemetry data, they had an advantage over the Americans, as Soviet tests are conducted primarily over land and the electronic data is harder to pick up.
 The Soviets also seem to have given ground somewhat on the limits on the number of nuclear warheads for both sides. Many missiles now carry 10 warheads. Both sides would prefer to reduce the number of warheads per missile, without having to build new missiles expressly designed for fewer warheads, because it is cheaper.
To accomplish this, missiles capable of carrying 10 warheads will carry fewer andbe counted as though they carry fewer. Nevertheless, they will have the capacity to carry spares and if eitherside wanted to break out of the treaty, the missiles could carry 10 warheads again.
The two sides agreed to a total ceiling of 1,250 of such missile warheads for each. That could include the Minuteman 3, the SS-N-18, plus two other missiles for each side.
"The Soviet side," Mr. Baker said, "was willing to move substantially from what their position had been."
While ratification of the treaty, once it is completed and signed, is by no means a foregone conclusion, at this stage it seems highly likely. With a Republican President lobbying his party, and the Senate Democrats by inclination favoring the treaty, the two-thirds needed for ratification appears likely.
 
A Ranking Democrat's View
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee on European Affairs, who will play a leading role in the ratification process, issued a statement saying:
"The treaty favors the United States, but still leaves superpowers with Armageddon arsenals that far exceed any rational need. While the treaty's details may engender some Senate controversy, resistance to it would be foolhardy. We should move quickly to bring nuclear arsenals into line with post-cold-war realities."
The treaty requires both sides to reduce the number of their bomber aircraft and sea- and land-based missile delivery systems to a total of 1,600 each and to reduce the number of warheads carried by those delivery systems to a total of 6,000 per nation.
But 3,000 American nuclear gravity bombs, short-range missiles carried by bombers and sea-launched cruise missiles are excluded from the treaty limits for a variety of political and military reasons negotiated over the last decade. This also applies to roughly 1,000 similar Soviet warhead systems.

HEADLINE: 7 Arrive With Soviets on Their Minds

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 14

 BODY:
Leaders of the seven largest industrialized democracies gathered here today for three days of talks that are expected to focus on ways of encouraging the Soviet Union to move to a market economy without much help from any of them.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union will present his latest plan for economic change to the leaders here on Wednesday afternoon. That meeting, sought by Mr. Gorbachev for two years, is a recognition of the interdependence of all the world's economies now that the cold war is over. 
 But a 23-page letter that Mr. Gorbachev sent to all the summit participants last week gave them little reason to believe that he is going to present the kind of detailed, step-by-step plan that could draw aid from Western financial institutions, officials of several countries said today.
United States officials dismissed the letter as a vague "circular," and one economist said, "It's clear on the aim, but not on the means of getting there." Others said it now appears that it might take decades rather than years for the Soviet Union to switch to a market economy.
 
Letting Gorbachev Have His Say
 "I think it would be courteous to hear what he says," the host of the summit meeting, Prime Minister John Major of Britain, said today after seeing Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada.
Mr. Mulroney told reporters, "I don't believe you will see either miracles or blank checks."
President Bush, who is to meet separately with Mr. Gorbachev on Wednesday, flew in this evening from Paris after talks with President Francois Mitterrand of France and joined Mr. Major for dinner at 10 Downing Street.
How to respond to Soviet plans for economic change is only one of the pressing issues that will be on the table when the leaders of the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- plus the representative of the European Community -- begin their talks Monday afternoon in Lancaster House, near St. James's Palace.
Mr. Bush has been consulting with allies on ways of insuring the destruction of Iraq's capacity to build nuclear weapons as required under United Nations cease-fire resolutions.
The summit participants are unlikely to endorse military strikes, officials of several countries said, but they could agree on a statement opposing the lifting of United Nations sanctions against Iraq until it complies with all Security Council resolutions connected with its occupation of Kuwait.
Mr. Major wants the summit participants to back a proposal by the British, Americans and Japanese for a United Nations register of arms sales, which would be aimed at preventing countries like Iraq from amassing vast stocks of offensive weapons. Iraq has successfully played international suppliers off against each other in the past.
The threat of civil war in Yugoslavia will also be on the minds of the leaders. And Mr. Major, who is presiding over his first summit meeting, wants the heads of government to pledge to attend the international conference on global warming in Rio de Janeiro next year, and to push negotiators toward a a new worldwide trade treaty by the end of this year.
 
Soviets Point to Difficulties
 Some Soviet economists working in London in advance of Mr. Gorbachev's arrival emphasized the difficulty of moving to a market economy while the existing Communist-run system is rapidly deteriorating and people are anxious about scarce supplies of food and consumer goods.
"In the political sphere, we've made tremendous progress," said Leonid A. Abalkin, a Soviet economist who helped draft Mr. Gorbachev's letter. "But in the economic sphere things remain where they were five or six years ago. The Soviet Union itself has to do the bulk of the work of change."
He acknowledged that Mr. Gorbachev's latest plan is the 10th one he has reviewed, and that none has been put into action.
Grigory A. Yavlinsky, who worked with Mr. Gorbachev over the weekend and has been urging him to adopt elements of a radical plan backed by professors at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, decided not to come to the summit meeting, a Harvard official said. The official said Mr. Yavlinsky had not explained whether he was forgoing the meeting because Mr. Gorbachev had not gone as far as he wanted.
Mr. Abalkin said the letter from Mr. Gorbachev outlined Soviet plans to privatize 80 percent of the country's light industry by the end of 1992. He acknowledged that Soviet heavy industry, which is mainly related to the military, would take longer. The Western leaders are expected to demand the rapid conversion of plants to civilian use as proof of Moscow's intention to make fundamental changes in the economy.
Mr. Major, like Mr. Bush and the Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, whom he also met here today, is skeptical about the usefulness of large financial aid to the Soviet Union while the uncertainty continues.
"We are very concerned to insure that not only the Soviets pass the legislation for economic reform, but they actually implement the legislation so that the economic reform itself can actually come about," Mr. Major said.
Germany has provided or pledged $31 billion worth of aid to the Soviet Union over the last year in exchange for Moscow's assent to German unification. The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, said in an interview released today that he would argue that helping the Soviet Union to introduce democracy and a market economy would be in the West's interest.
But "the Germans obviously can't do everything," he told the paper Frankfurter Allgemeine. "Our resources are limited. We have no cash cow."
 
Advice Instead of Money
 Instead of cash, the summit participants are expected to offer the Soviet Union a form of association with the International Monetary Fund. That would enable Moscow to receive technical advice on making the ruble convertible, getting inflation under control and freeing prices on domestic goods.
"If anybody is looking for anything dramatic in London, they'll be disappointed," one American official said. "But if the Soviet Union comes forward with a real plan, and it's clearly thought through, and lays out a timetable and then keeps to it, I think there will be a response on the part of the West to attempt to underpin it."
Whatever they decide about the Soviet Union, the Western leaders will seek in the declarations they issue on Wednesday to offer firm support for continuing the flow of aid and capital to Eastern Europe. Most Eastern European countries have gone much further than the Soviet Union in adopting free-market reforms.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Briefing Held by Bush and Mitterrand

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and President Francois Mitterrand today in Rambouillet, France, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription company, through the facilities of CNN: 
 Q. Mr. President. The President of France is being quoted as saying there are circumstances that he would cause intervention, that would take intervention in Iraq. . . . Have you seen that statement or could you tell us your own position, your own terms for moving militarily against Iraq?
MR. BUSH. I just have not seen the statement, but if it says you phrased it, I would support his statement. We are together in the way we're looking at this situation in Iraq, the situation I'm referring to being Saddam Hussein's continuation of lying and trying to go forward with some nuclear capability. And that is a cause for alarm all over the world, and having -- I don't like to talk about a statement I've not seen, but after a discussion with President Mitterrand I am confident that France and the United States, once again, are looking at this important matter in the same way.
. . .
There has been incontrovertible evidence presented to the United Nations Security Council that the man is lying and cheating. There were rumors that force might be used. Shortly after that, Saddam Hussein came forward and said essentially this: I have been lying and cheating. I have been doing things that I heretofore said I have not been doing. But now I'm not going to do them anymore. And I think it is very important to the security of the whole region, indeed to the world, that he not do them any more, that he not go forward with the nuclear program, that he comply with each and every United Nations resolution. So that's what this is all about. And let us hope that his last confession or his last statement that he would comply is followed to the letter and to the T. I can tell you I am still, in spite of that, very much concerned about his intentions, and with reason. I'm not just thinking that way; I have evidence to back that up.
. . .
MR. MITTERRAND. Now, would we be prepared for military intervention? You would not talk about Kurdistan incidentally, and yet I decided to maintain by transfer of troops from northern Iraq to Turkey, we decided to keep on the spot a few hundred troops . . . in order to be able to intervene within the framework of the Kurdish if Iraq decided to exercise repression of the Kurds. And that is a fact. That has already been decided.
As to military intervention against the proposed nuclear site, I said to President Bush that the important thing would be the information forthcoming to us so we could be sufficiently certain that there was nuclear activity going on, for it to be justified.
. . .
Q. President Saddam Hussein -- let's put the question in a very straight way -- do you think it's time to get rid of him?
MR. BUSH. You put it in a straight way, and I'll put the answer in a rather circuitous way. The United States will not have improved nor normalized relations with Iraq as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. I will not have our people voting to lift sanctions as long as he is in power. He is hurting his people. Before the war started, I made very clear over and over again that our argument was not with the people of Iraq, it wasn't even with the regime in Iraq. It was with Saddam Hussein. And I've had a chance to talk to President Mitterrand on this and get his views, and my view remains that the best thing that could happen would be for him to step aside and let us all begin with whoever took his place to try to have improved relations. And that would mean, of course, full and total compliance to every T and every I in that, in the U.N. resolutions.
. . .
Q.There've been some reports that because of the focus on President Gorbachev's need for economic reform and assistance from western nations, that some of the needs of the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe might be ignored or not taken care of adequately. Could you address yourself, sir, to your perception of where G-7 might end up with respect to providing aid that's needed for other emerging democracies, not only in Eastern Europe but around the world?
 MR.BUSH: Well I had a chance to get President Mitterrand's views on that, his advice on that, and I can tell you that he and I, and I am confident the rest of the G-7 will not do anything that will send a signal that we are shifting our attention away from the fledgling democracies in eastern Europe in order to help the Soviet Union. They need not be mutually exclusive.
But you raise a very important point, and one that has concerned me, and as for the U.S. side, we will be doing everything we can to make clear to Eastern Europe that we want to be a participant in their continued march down democracy's path.

LENGTH: 1301 words

HEADLINE: Weicker: A Maverick Visionary or a Political Realist?

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 13

 BODY:
Former Gov. William A. O'Neill, Connecticut's chief executive throughout the prosperous, placid 1980's, liked to call his home state "the land of steady habits." Under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., it might more aptly be called the land of the rising blood pressure.
In his first six months as the state's first independent non-party governor since the Civil War, Mr. Weicker has ridden roughshod over about as many sensibilities as his brief time in office has allowed. Two-party government? An anachronism. The long-avoided and politically verboten income tax? Long overdue, and anyone who disagrees is lacking in courage or intelligence. But as the state enters its third week without a budget on Monday with Mr. Weicker and lawmakers still apparently deadlocked over the income-tax issue, the questions are growing ever more urgent about just how much a non-traditional governor without a single member of his party in the Legislature can achieve.
 
Thorn in Nixon's Side
 Behind that is the question of who exactly Mr. Weicker is and what makes him push as hard as he has -- through two budget vetoes over the last six weeks and a partial shutdown of the state government carried out over the objections of the state Attorney General and the Comptroller. It is a subject that others have tried to plumb before, and failed.Former President Richard M. Nixon, to name just one, began asking about Mr. Weicker in 1973. Mr. Weicker was gaining national attention and the cover of Time magazine as the young Republican Senator on the Watergate committee who dared attack his own party's Administration. 
 "What the hell makes Weicker tick?" the beleaguered President said to his chief aide, John D. Ehrlichman, according to transcripts of one White House conversation in March of that year.
"Nobody's been able to figure that out," Mr. Ehrlichman said.
Dale Harden, a senior policy analyst from Windsor who has followed the budget follies from his office at Aetna Life and Casualty, thinks that perhaps Mr. Weicker's very size has something to do with it. Mr. Weicker, at 6 feet 6 inches in his stocking feet, often displays an irritable manner and a propensity to reach for barnyard metaphors that allow him to bluster with the best. As a Senator, that manner may have been fine, Mr. Harden said, but as a Governor, perhaps not. "His intimidation creates some of the problems," Mr. Harden said. "When you're dealing with someone who's intimidating, you have a tendency to strike back."
 
Maybe Just a Realist?
 Others say it is simply a matter of Mr. Weicker's ideas. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that do not tax wages. Many residents and lawmakers have attached a deep symbolism to the state's historical aversion to the income tax. They speak of the tax structure as almost a natural resource that has made the state great and must not be squandered. Breaking the income-tax barrier, those opponents say, will create a new revenue source and lead to a sharp expansion of state spending and destroy forever the sense of identity that the lack of an income tax has bestowed.
Income-tax supporters argue that by avoiding the wage tax, the state's other taxes have been pushed to the limit and that the recession brought on the current budget crisis -- not Mr. Weicker. The 8 percent sales tax, the 13.8 percent corporate profits tax and the tax on earnings from dividends and interest, which is as high as 14 percent, are all the highest statewide rates in the nation. A broad-based wage tax would allow all those taxes to be lowered, spurring economic growth, Mr. Weicker and his supporters argue.
 
Born to Wealth
 "Whether he were a little, smooth, pleasant sugary person, or a large, tough, self-assured figure -- I don't think it makes that much difference," said Representative Irving J. Stolberg, a Democrat from New Haven and a staunch supporter of the Weicker income-tax plan. "If he was weaker, he might have buckled, that's all."
Whatever else Mr. Weicker may be, he is not known for buckling under.
Mr. Weicker, who was born in Paris 60 years ago to great wealth as the grandson of one of the founders of the Squibb Pharmaceutical Corporation, earned his political reputation by swimming against the currents and making a great noise while doing it. As one of the last of a disappearing breed of liberal Republican lawmakers in Washington, he battled the party's conservative wing through the Reagan years on a range of issues, including school prayer and abortion.
 
Hero Among Many Liberals
 In 1988, his last year in Washington before being defeated by Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, Mr. Weicker was given a 90 percent approval rating by the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal lobby group. The average Republican Senator, by contrast, agreed with the group's positions only 27 percent of the time that year, while the average Democrat scored a 72 percent approval rating. Mr. Weicker is the only Republican in the House or Senate that the group has ever endorsed since its founding in the 1940's.
He has also been unpredictable. In the budget struggles here, he vowed that he would immediately veto any resolution that would keep the government running temporarily. But he allowed a two-week resolution to go into law without his signature. The resolution veto would have been overridden, he said.
 
'Phony as a Three-Dollar Bill'
 This has all provided ample ammunition for his detractors.
"He's as phony as a three-dollar bill," said John Gizzi, a former campaign volunteer who supported Mr. Weicker through the 1970's but grew disillusioned as the Senator embraced increasingly liberal causes. Mr. Gizzi, now the political director of the Conservative National Committee, a lobbying group, believes Mr. Weicker is essentially a man who found he could win votes by being contrary and has stuck with the technique.
His supporters say he simply speaks his mind.
"It may not always be popular, but you don't have to guess around him to know what he's talking about," said Audrey Brett, a retired secretary from Manchester. "I appreciate that."
 
A Master of Quotes
 During the course of a 40-minute interview, Mr. Weicker, a Yale University graduate, quoted Saint Paul, the poet John Donne, and former Representative Earl F. Landgrebe, an Indiana Congressman during the 1970's. While doing so, Mr. Weicker said he does not expect, or even really desire, popularity for having put the state on its current course. He said that because the state has "cooked the figures" for years to avoid overhauling its revenue system, a clean break from the practices of the past is the only answer, however painful.
"You tell me who's going to love anybody that is in the role of bringing people face to face with themselves," he said. "The drying-out process is not pleasant for either an individual or a state, and that's exactly what we're in right now, and I'm the doctor."
Opinion poll experts say that the Governor's popularity slipped steadily through the spring, as Mr. Weicker and lawmakers grappled with the budget and the income-tax issue.
 
Ambivalence About Hartford
 In such a climate, even Mr. Weicker's apparent ambivalence about Hartford has become an issue. Shortly after the election, for example, he said he would live instead at his home in Greenwich, called Applejack Farm. The decision provoked a storm of letters and editorials in local newspapers. Though Mr. Weicker subsequently changed his mind, the move to Hartford was delayed by major structural repairs that the governor's mansion's was later found to need.
Even now, he expresses a desire to be away from the building he sought.
"I'm a pretty peripatetic governor, he said, calling his office "the last place I enjoy being."

HEADLINE: Syria Accepts Bush Plan for Mideast Peace Talks

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria responded today to President Bush's proposal for a Middle East peace conference, saying the plan was an "acceptable basis for achieving a comprehensive solution," state-run Syrian Television reported.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, speaking to reporters after arms talks at the State Department, said the letter was Syria's most positive and forthcoming approach to Arab-Israeli peacemaking that he could recall. The letter, he said, appeared to have no obvious conditions, although he said there were some points -- which he did not specify -- that Washington would like to explore with Damascus. 
 The apparently positive Syrian response to President Bush's proposals now puts the Israeli Government on the spot, since it has rejected Mr. Bush's plan for a peace conference. There was no formal Israeli comment on the Syrian report.
 
Baker Trip Possible
 "I would characterize the response as positive," Mr. Baker said of the Syrian letter. "I have only briefly read the letter. It is quite long. But I do believe it is fair to characterize the response as positive. I did not see anything expressed specifically as conditions. However, I do think there are in there some suggestions that we would want to probe to determine whether or not they are in any way conditions."
Mr. Baker added that overall, the Syrian response "in this letter moves the Syrian Government further than they have been willing to move in any peace process effort, that I am aware of, before, or any conference."
Mr. Baker, who is traveling to London to join President Bush at the economic summit meeting, is known to be considering splitting off later in the week to go to the Middle East and pursue the peace conference.
In the first week in June, President Bush wrote to both the Syrians and Israelis and proposed a compromise formula for holding a peace conference. That formula was meant to bridge the differences between Israel and Syria over two points: first, what role the United Nations would play at the conference, and second, whether it would be a continuing conference or a one-day ceremonial affair to open direct talks between the parties.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel wrote back to President Bush almost immediately and rejected his compromise formula. But the Syrians spent the last six weeks asking Washington various questions to clarify the proposal and pin down some private assurances before answering today. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union all privately lobbied the Syrians to give Mr. Bush a positive answer that would then put Israel in a corner.
Israeli officials made little effort to disguise their hope that the Syrian response would be negative so that they would not be alone in opposing the Bush plan.
 
Confrontation With Israel?
 If the Syrian response is as positive and unconditional as the Syrian Television report, it could set up yet another confrontation between the Bush Administration and Israel, whose relations have been tense in recent weeks because of President Bush's opposition to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank. The Administration will almost certainly now go back to the Israelis and try to persuade them to drop their opposition to the American conference proposal.
Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, delivered the Syrian response to President Bush's letter of June 1 to the American Ambassador in Damascus, Edward Djerejian, this morning.
Reporting on the Syrian response, Syrian Television said: "In his letter, President Hafez al-Assad commends the efforts President Bush and Secretary Baker exerted to overcome the difficulties facing the convening of the conference. The President considers President Bush's proposals and the subsequent clarifications positive and balanced and constitute an acceptable basis for achieving a comprehensive solution and a peace process in the region, especially since these proposals are based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which apply to all fronts and secure legitimate Palestinian political rights."
The television report also said Mr. Assad expressed "satisfaction" with Mr. Bush's compromise proposals "because President Bush based his proposals on the principles of international legitimacy, gave special attention to the U.N. role in the peace conference, and stressed European participation."
In particular, the televsion added, Mr. Assad highly values "President Bush's pledge that the United States and the U.S.S.R. will be a catalyst for peace and that they will have a special responsibility to make the conference succeed in its objectives as defined by the relevant U.N. resolutions."
President Bush had asked Syria and Israel to agree that the United Nations would be represented at the peace conference by a single observer, who would not be allowed to speak or participate. That was an attempt to bridge Israel's demand that the United Nations play no role and the Syrian demand that the United Nations actually sponsor the conference.
In addition, President Bush proposed that the conference, which would be co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union, would open with a ceremonial session, after which the Israelis and the different Arab parties would break up into direct two-way negotiations, with no formal interference from the co-sponsors.
 
Option to Reconvene
 The President proposed that the conference reconvene periodically to hear reports from the negotiating groups, provided that both Israel and its Arab negotiating partner agree. This was meant to bridge the Syrian position that the conference have some ongoing and permanent nature, so that neither side could stall indefinitely without anyone's taking note, and the Israeli position that the conference function as a purely ceremonial opening and that the co-sponsors not be permitted to pressure the parties or intervene in the talks.
In his initial June 1 letter to Mr. Assad, and in later messages of clarification, Mr. Bush made it clear that even though the conference would not have a permanent structure, Moscow and Washington would actively follow the talks and in that regard the United States would be guided by its own interpretation of United Nations Resolution 242.
That interpretation is that Israel should trade lands occupied in the 1967 war for secured and recognized boundaries with its Arab neighbors and that while Israel has already accomplished that with Egypt, it must do the same with Syria and Jordan as well. Israel holds the Golan Heights, which were seized from Syria, and the West Bank, which was previously held by Jordan.
The current Israeli Government argues that in trading the Egyptian Sinai desert for peace with Egypt it has already fulfilled all of the land-for-peace provisions of Resolution 242.

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Trading Hide-and-Seek For the Old 1-2 Punch

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 14,1991

 BODY:
It started on the streets of East Los Angeles. The fights were for fun, arranged on the moment as just another recreation.
One of the de la Hoyas, Joel or his little brother Oscar, would square off against one of their cousins and pretty soon two of them would be left throwing punches while the others loudly urged them on. 
 For 6-year-old Oscar, it didn't take long for him to think of ringalevio or stoop ball or hide-and-seek as safer ways to spend a leisure hour.
"Cousin George or Rudy or Eddie, they were older than me -- 8, 9, 10 years old -- and stronger," said de la Hoya, who is now 18 years old. "So my father decided to take me to the gym so I could learn to defend myself."
It turned out that Oscar de la Hoya, who meets Patrice Brooks in the final of the 132-pound class of the United States Olympic Festival on Tuesday, was a quick study.
In a matter of days, he said, he was throwing punches in smart combinations and showing such a flair for boxing that his father, Joel Sr., a former professional fighter, kept him in the gym.
"I had my first bout at the age of 6 at the Pico Rivera Sports Arena," de la Hoya said. "The other boy was 6 also. I hit him so hard they stopped the fight in the first round."
Then came payback time for his cousins.
"By the time I was 9 or 10, I went back and fought them again," de la Hoya said. "This time I made them cry."
Now de la Hoya, with an amateur record of 206-4, stands ready to give the rest of the world a boxing lesson. The fighter, a graduate of Garfield High School here, is regarded as one of the United States' likelier gold-medal prospects in boxing for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.
"Eric Griffin, who fights in the 106-pound class, and de la Hoya are the class of the team," said Alex Wallau, the ABC-TV boxing analyst. "What's most unique about Oscar is his body punching. He works very hard with both hands and in combinations. And to be willing to do that in the amateurs' three-round bouts -- to take the time to work the body -- is very unusual.
"Sometimes you can see an entire amateur fight card and not a meaningful body punch will be thrown. Besides that, he's very economical. He doesn't spray lots of punches, the way most amateurs do."
Amateur coaches have an expression: When they want a boxer to accelerate his offense, they sometimes holler, "Shoeshine!" That's a buzz word to trigger the sort of rapid-motion punching that scores points with judges but in truth is not calculated to hurt the opponent.
The scoring in amateur boxing places more emphasis on the number of blows landed than the overall impact of what's thrown.
Shoeshining is a logical way to take advantage of the system.
But de la Hoya does not throw punches for show. He has, as Mike Tyson would say, "bad intentions" when he lets a punch go. Forget shoeshining. By his own account, de la Hoya's instincts are ready made for the pro game.
In his workouts under his trainer, Robert Alcazar, a former professional lightweight, de la Hoya spars with professionals -- last month he went two rounds with Julio Cesar Chavez, the world champion junior welterweight -- and he has come to view himself as a fighter more attuned to the hurt orientation of pro boxing.
"I can't wait to fight 10- and 12-round bouts," he said.
Nor can Shelly Finkel.
Finkel manages the undisputed heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, and Mark Breland and, with Lou Duva, co-manages world champions Meldrick Taylor and Pernell Whitaker.
 
Patient Approach
 Finkel has been acting as an unofficial adviser to de la Hoya, who said that when he turns professional he expects Finkel to be involved.
In a semifinal bout on Saturday, against Dezi Ford of Alliance, Ohio, de la Hoya was so patient in the first round, blocking punches and gauging his distance, that he made his handlers uneasy. They were fearful the lack of volume of punches would blow the round.
But the fighter quickly put their fears to rest. He knocked down Ford in the second round with a left-right combination, and disassembled him with three-punch body shots and crisp scoring blows to the head. De la Hoya's mastery over Ford was plain and he won an easy decision.
Now, as the countdown begins on the Olympic year, de la Hoya has begun zeroing in on Olympic glory. He has, he said, extra motivation. Last Oct. 28, the fighter's mother, Cecilia, died of breast cancer.
"Before she died, she told me she was confident I was going to win the gold," de la Hoya said. " 'Do it for me,' she said. I feel I will."

The Great Panhandler

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Not since the Treaty of Brest-Li tovsk in 1918 when Lenin granted independence to Georgia, the Ukraine and the Baltic states, and groveled before Germany -- has a Soviet leader inflicted such humiliation on his nation.
Mikhail Gorbachev protests that he is not "going on his knees to beg" for money at the economic confabulation this week in London. On the contrary; he will rattle his tin cup standing up, even menacingly, warning that chaos and war will break out if the West does not help Beggar, thy neighbor. 
 The Great Panhandler will combine his dire threat of nuclear anarchy with delicious incentives: give us the investment capital that will permit us to convert our armaments factories to plowshare production -- just as you want. Give us the grain and consumer goods to prevent riots in the streets as we permit prices to rise in a free economy -- just as you want.
Germany, France and Italy, fearful of an invasion of hungry immigrants, will urge the U.S. and Japan to underwrite the salvation of Communism with a capitalist face. President Bush will be sorely tempted to take the middle way: a little money at first, not a lot, and with strings attached to be nice to separatist republics, and to encourage glasnost.
Mr. Bush shows signs of having given up asking if he should help the Soviet leader maintain power; he seems to be negotiating only how much and when and under what conditions. If he allows himself to be drawn down this path of gradual superpower blackmail, this summer's summits will be his Yalta.
The underlying assumption of government-to-government investment and government handout is wrong. That is their statist way of doing business; it is not our way. If we are to help them at all, we must first await their realization that the only way to attract capital is to offer incentive, and the only way to put food on the table is to adopt the profit motive.
The way for Moscow to prevent runaway inflation when it ends subsidies and price controls is not to promote a black market for Western-contributed consumer goods, but to lower the "ruble overhang" by selling property to the people who now hold the unconvertible currency.
The way for Moscow to finance the conversion of war plants to consumer-goods factories is not to beg for loan guarantees; it is to stop wasting assets making tanks and planes and paying a huge standing army, and to stop subsidizing Cuba at the rate of $4.5 billion a year.
The immediate cause of the collapse of the Soviet economy is the crushing cost of the Red Army. Now 30 percent of all Soviet production goes for arms; U.S. expenditure is 6 percent, everyone else less than 3 percent.
The reason for such huge spending was to build and police an internal and external empire; apparently that has been set aside. The only excuse Red Army and K.G.B. generals still put forward is to defend the motherland against a hostile world.
That excuse, never true, is now an obvious absurdity. What nation or alliance would want to invade or defeat the Soviet Union? Who would want to buy such a headache? The Warsaw Pact has dissolved and Napoleon's route lies open; NATO's response is to break up and go home.
To avoid chaos, to find the money to build a new system under private enterprise, the Soviet people must bring their troops home. Standing army, stand down; you are crushing the people you are supposed to protect.
But if I demobilize the Red Army, Gorbachev says, not only do I lose my power base, but I will have an army of unemployed. If I bring troops home from Germany, where will they live?
Answer: Use the money saved on war production on home production. Give former soldiers a piece of land as their private property, or stock in a privatized company producing consumer goods; homes will get built as never before. Private foreign capital will flow to where profit can be made in convertible currency.
Will the menacing mendicant crashing the summit hear this truth from the free-world leader? Not likely. Mr. Bush will probably sign a communique to permit kibbitzing at the International Monetary Fund, to raid Jacques Attali's Socialist Slush Fund, to form the Spaso House Oil Wildcatters Consortium and to merge the muddy waters of Harvard's Charles River with the Volga.

HEADLINE: Ban the Replacement of Workers on Strike

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that the Communications Workers of America canceled a speech by Labor Secretary Lynn Martin at its annual convention in San Francisco because of fear of protest against Administration opposition to a bill banning the permanent replacement of striking workers (news article, June 27). You quote Ms. Martin's statement in response, voicing regret that "there are those who let single-issue politics stifle discussion and communication." 
 I was a delegate at the convention, and I must say that Ms. Martin's reply was not only predictable but even the primary reason the delegates chose not to listen to further rhetoric from an Administration that has clearly demonstrated its anti-union beliefs time and again. Ms. Martin is no friend of labor and has no right to speak on our behalf or represent organized labor's interests.
The National Labor Relations Act became law in 1935, providing workers with three basic rights: the right to organize, the right to bargain collectively and the right to withhold their labor (strike). The right to strike has always been a last alternative in any bargaining arena. Its purpose is to force economic pressure on employers to bargain in good faith and insure fair and equitable contracts. A strike is meant as an interruption of the labor-management relationship, not the termination of it.
The labor movement requires acts of substance and not symbolism. Ms. Martin represents administrations in the White House that praise unions abroad as the cornerstone for democracy, yet the Reagan-Bush domestic policies have inundated unions with anti-labor legislation and union-busting tactics.
If it had not been for President Reagan's reprehensible act of firing the air traffic controllers and permanently replacing those workers, corporate America would still see permanent replacements as unacceptable corporate behavior. However, Mr. Reagan's action sent a green light to employers that it is O.K. to engage in union busting. The devastation of unions throughout the United States continues at an alarming rate. Something has to change.
The Communication Workers, and organized labor, have sent a clear message to the White House, and all lawmakers, that passage of legislation to ban permanent replacement of striking workers is our No. 1 priority. Without such legislation, unions everywhere are threatened.
This country cannot continue with the retrogressive labor policies that are coming out of Washington. Passage of the striker replacement legislation is paramount to protect all workers. Lawmakers who support House Resolution 5 (H.R. 5) and Senate Bill 55 (S. 55) should be thanked for saying yes to democracy, and no to permanent replacements and union busting.

HEADLINE: SIDELINES: A BULL IN A BEAR MARKET;
Ard Playing Let's Make a Deal

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
In these days of a struggling economy and an unpredictable stock market, brokers try to be creative. None is trying harder than WILLIAM DONOVAN ARD of the Westfield, N.J., brokerage house of Butcher & Singer.
Yes, this is the same Billy Ard who played guard for the Giants from 1981-88 and the Green Bay Packers in 1989 and 1990. For eight years, he has spent the off season as a broker. At age 32, he still wants to play football, but he says he will not play unless the Packers guarantee some of his salary. 
 He said the Packers had offered him a two-year contract that would pay him $450,000 this year and $500,000 next year. He said the money was all right, even though four other offensive linemen on the Packers make 50 percent more. But he does not want to report to camp, get cut and go home with nothing. He said the Packers told him they do not make any guarantees.
All right, he told the Packers, let's try to work something out. He told them that three times during his career with the Giants, he was given loans. He suggested that the Packers give him a loan when he signed, and if he was cut he would not have to repay the loan. The Packers turned that down.
Then he suggested that the Packers give him a $25,000 cut clause, as they did last year. He said that if the Packers agreed to that, he would collect the $25,000 if they cut him by July 31 this year. He also proposed that if he was on the roster Aug. 15, he would get a $100,000 loan against his salary. The Packers didn't buy that, either.
"So I'm a full-time broker until they call me and give me what I want," Ard said last week. "I'm in shape to play football, but I don't want to waste my time getting cut in camp and getting nothing out of it."

HEADLINE: Clarence Thomas and 'Natural Law'

BYLINE: By Laurence H. Tribe; Laurence H. Tribe, professor at Harvard Law School, is author of "On Reading The Constitution."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
What is really at stake in the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court? While any candidate nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall would likely accelerate the Court's rightward trend, Judge Thomas's adherence to "natural law" as a judicial philosophy could take the Court in an even more troubling direction.
Most conservatives criticize the judiciary for expanding its powers, "creating" rights rather than "interpreting" the Constitution. These critics talk of returning issues like abortion to democratically elected and politically accountable bodies. 
 Clarence Thomas, judging from his speeches and scholarly writings, seems instead to believe judges should enforce the Founders' natural law philosophy -- the inalienable rights "given man by his Creator" -- which he maintains is revealed most completely in the Declaration of Independence. He is the first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to maintain that natural law should be readily consulted in constitutional interpretation.
When a child born today reaches voting age, Judge Thomas will be 61, still five years younger than Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is now. By then, the nation will face many new issues -- new reproductive technologies, computer privacy, genetic engineering.
Might a Justice Thomas some day provide a fifth vote to hold that Congress and the states may not respond with measures contrary to natural law, as construed by the justices on the basis of their understanding of the rights "given to man by his Creator?" Whether that understanding coincides with specific religious teachings matters less than how it affects legislative power and personal liberty.
Consider abortion. Judge Thomas has called even the right of married couples to use birth control -- recognized by the Court 26 years ago in Griswold v. Connecticut -- an "invention." Unfortunately, he seems likely to help overturn Roe v. Wade.
But whether Roe v. Wade is overruled is only half the question. No less important is the kind of regime that would follow. The Court in a post-Roe world would probably debate whether the Constitution permitted states to ban the French abortion drug RU-486 and whether state abortion bans must contain life, health or rape exceptions.
In these debates, a Justice Thomas, for whom the right to privacy may seem anathema, might seek to replace Roe not with a system that strengthens states' rights, but with a decree that abortion is murder and that its practice or counseling cannot be permitted by any state.
Judge Thomas has already dismissed talk of states' rights as a "constitutional sideshow." He also endorsed Lewis Lehrman's 1987 American Spectator article, which argued that because abortion violates the "right to life" guaranteed by the law of God in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution cannot tolerate even a neutral stance on the issue. To Judge Thomas, that extraordinary theological argument was a "splendid example of applying natural law" to define the "right to life" secured by the Declaration.
Or consider Judge Thomas's insistence that "economic liberties [are] a vital part of the rights protected by constitutional government." To be sure, judges today understand that certain economic rights, like the right to fair compensation when private property is taken for public use, are constitutionally guaranteed.
But the last time a Supreme Court majority invoked natural rights theories, some 80 years ago, the Court held that the Constitution protects such economic rights as the "liberty" of employers to conduct business free of health and safety regulations and minimum wage laws.
Libertarians, though, can take little solace: Natural law has most often been cited to justify moralistic intrusions on personal choice -- as illustrated by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's appeal to "Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards" in Bowers v. Hardwick, a 1986 case condemning oral and anal sex between consenting adults.
And, perhaps echoing the Declaration's language that "all men are created equal," the Court 120 years ago relied on the law of "nature" and "the law of the Creator" to deny a woman the right to practice law, deeming it the "paramount destiny and mission of woman . . . to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother."
Before the Senate decides whether to confirm Judge Thomas, they should explore the implications of his views about natural law as the lodestar of constitutional interpretation. With the power of Congress and of every state and local legislature hanging in the balance, the Senate cannot avoid sharing the responsibility for the fate of self-government in the U.S.

HEADLINE: Goodbye $, Hello "B"

BYLINE: By Eugene R. Fidell; Eugene R. Fidell is a lawyer.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Numbers have gotten too big. The gross national product, the national debt, the Federal budget, the Social Security Trust Fund. I first thought that I was the problem; perhaps I had lost the ability to tell whether things were costing too much or too little.
However, I now think the problem is in the numbers -- they are just too far from what normal people encounter in their daily lives. Ordinary people are paid in the unit of currency that is legal tender -- here, the dollar. Our mistake lies in assuming that when the House Ways and Means Committee, the Office of Management and Budget and General Motors discuss money, they too are referring to dollars. 
 They're not. What they are thinking of is a unit of currency that bears no relation to the money we earn. The time has come to make official this disparity by giving these high-rollers their own unit of currency. I suggest we call it a Business Unit of Account (B.U.A.).
You can usually tell when a number is calculated in B.U.A.'s from its context or the number of zeros at the end. It would be preferable, then, if instead of marking such sums with the familiar (but misleading) dollar sign, we had a new symbol.
I propose the letter "B" (or the Greek letter beta). Ten billion dollars would appear not as $10,000,000,000 but as B10,000,000,000. Use of the B would prevent taxpayers from equating their grocery bill with the tab for a space shuttle flight.
There is precedent for this. In Britain, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the guinea (valued at 21 shillings) "is the ordinary unit for a professional fee and for a subscription to a society or institution; the prices obtained for works of art, racehorses, and sometimes landed property are also stated in guineas." Never mind the fact that the coin has not been minted since 1813 and there no longer is a unit of currency called a shilling.
Following this approach, B.U.A.'s need not be confined to Government or large-scale corporate transactions. A useful rule of thumb might be to require lawyers or doctors -- anyone who serves "clients" or "patients" instead of "customers" -- to send their bills in B.U.A.'s. This will alert consumers to the need to shift gears when they open their mail.
Eventually, of course, we can look forward to regulations, B.U.A. futures trading, and so forth. For the moment, however, it might be wise to start with the deficit.

HEADLINE: Careers;
'Forensic Accountants' In Demand

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
THE accountant at a cocktail party in New Jersey looked weary. "I thought I had retired," he said, "but I keep getting called by towns and counties around here to work on fraud cases."
Two weeks earlier he had testified in court, he added, which takes a lot of preparation. 
 Fraud, whether in corporations or government agencies, and related areas like imminent bankruptcies, which often involve sleuthing for management misdeeds, have become busy new areas for accountants.
The large demand for accountants with pertinent training was confirmed by Terry R. Storevik, national placement director for litigation support services at Robert Half International Inc., one of the largest management recruiters of accountants, financial personnel and information specialists, with 160 offices around the world.
"We call them forensic accountants," he said. "It is the hottest field in accounting firms. We see an explosion of this type of recruitment, especially in major cities." He also wants to see resumes of accountants with experience in other litigation support areas, such as bankruptcy-insolvency and merger-acquisition and the setting of loss damages, workouts and restructuring.
Mr. Storevik, whose office is in San Diego, said, "I place partners and managers with the Big Six accounting firms and with boutique firms that specialize in what we call litigation support services." Salaries range from $50,000 to $200,000.
He added that he could not give figures, but demand for such forensic accountants increased by 100 percent in each of the last three years. "Job openings now are backlogged," he said. "The problem is finding the right persons."
In addition to demand from accounting firms that want permanent employees, there is also a big demand for temporary accountants to work for governmental units like the Resolution Trust Corporation, which has been handling financially troubled savings and loan organizations.
The need is for accountants who can not only do some sleuthing work for fraud but also figure out the market value of assets to be sold, Mr. Storevik said.
The surge in interest in forensic accounting began about three years ago. He attributed it to the impact of the recession, the "junk bond" problems, the savings and loan difficulties and more recently the problems of bad loans at many banks and now at insurance companies.
Misuse of funds by managers, money-laundering and suspicious insurance claims are growing areas of concern that require the new type of forensic accountant. For example, such accountants are at work in the wake of the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, tracing its connections to other institutions and people. "It is an exciting area," Mr. Storevik said.
Following a carefully disguised trail of funds requires not only an in-depth knowledge of financial practices but also exceptional investigative and computer skills, he added.
Until recently, forensic accountants received most of their training on an earlier job, haphazardly. Job candidates who had the misfortune to work for several now-bankrupt companies suddenly find their experience to be highly prized, Mr. Storevik said.
"It is almost by accident, or learning through the school of hard knocks," he added. "One good training area is experience with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I placed two from the F.B.I. at Big Six accounting firms recently."
In the last few years, major accounting organizations like the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants have realized the need.
"More and more seminars about fraud and bankruptcy are being given," Mr. Storevik said.
He also cited the National Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, which has its headquarters in Austin, Tex. It awards the designation of Certified Fraud Examiner, following intensive study of a manual and a two-day examination, costing $150.
The group, which began giving the designation in June 1988, now has 4,000 members. It was founded by its current chairman, Joseph T. Wells, a C.P.A. who worked for the F.B.I. However, anyone with a college degree and two years of experience in a fraud-related area can apply.
A decade ago lawyers generally handled the sale of assets of a bankrupt company. But the increased number of business failures has created a demand for accountants skilled in discovering assets conveyed improperly by insiders, and investigating the doctoring of books and the payment of kickbacks, which Mr. Storevik calls "gumshoe accounting."
Today's investigative accountants are also advising companies on whether to declare bankruptcy or take steps to remain solvent, he said.
He also cited other areas in which the forensic accountant might work, such as the setting of loss damages in the case of insurance companies and construction claims.

Pressure on Fed Without Letup

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AS chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul Volcker displeased the Reagan Administration in the mid-1980's, and the President's top aides often said so, in blunt public statements. The Bush Administration deals more softly with Alan Greenspan, the current chairman, but the pressure on the Federal Reserve to shape policy the White House way has been roughly the same -- and without letup.
The President waited until last Wednesday, a month before Mr. Greenspan's term expired, to name him to a second four years as Fed chairman. Bush officials pooh-poohed speculation that the reappointment was ever in doubt. Quite the contrary. One senior adviser, who declined to be named, even suggested that since January, Mr. Greenspan had steered Fed policy roughly as the White House would have steered it, if the President's advisers had been running the central bank. 
 Such talk encourages the impression that the White House deals softly with Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues because harsh criticism isn't necessary: they respond to quiet pressure. It is an impression the Fed's policy makers indignantly reject, arguing that the nation's central bank must remain insulated from political pressures to carry out its functions, and does. "I would not do anything for political reasons," said Robert Black, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and a voting member of the Fed's policy council.
Whatever the truth, the struggle goes on. During the late winter and early spring, when the recession seemed to be ending, the issue was whether interest rates should be a few notches lower as insurance that a recovery would indeed materialize. With Mr. Greenspan and his vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., leading the way, the Fed on three occasions in this period reduced short-term rates, over which it has the most control. The central bank's action helped to lower rates slightly on mortgages, some commercial loans, home equity loans and the like. And the Bush Administration applauded.
Now, the White House and the Fed have concluded that a recovery is under way, so their struggle is taking a different shape. The delay in naming Mr. Greenspan served notice that the White House was beating the drums for a more robust economic recovery than the Fed's policy makers seem to have in mind. How is this to be achieved? In a recent speech, Michael F. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, hinted at what the Fed should do. He argued in effect that the Fed should allow the money supply to grow more rapidly, a process that puts more money in pockets and pushes down interest rates.
The President's advisers -- among them Nicholas F. Brady, the Treasury Secretary; Richard Darman, the budget director, and Mr. Boskin -- speak publicly of an economy capable of expanding at an annual rate of 3 percent or more over the next 18 months, a respectable performance in an election year. Many of the Fed's policy makers, however, argue that a 2.5 percent annual rise in the gross national product is the very most the economy can handle over the next two years.
In this Fed view, neither the nation's supply of workers nor the efficiency of businesses is sufficient to generate a 3 percent increase each year in the G.N.P. An attempt to reach the 3 percent level by increasing the money flow would only encourage inflation. People would bid for more than Corporate America could provide in new manufactured goods and numerous services.
This immensely important White House-Fed debate over growth -- one that will affect employment levels, profits, wages and interest rates -- is still very low key. The recovery that both sides believe is under way will have to continue for months before the G.N.P.'s growth rate becomes apparent. Given today's high unemployment level and idle factories, the G.N.P. might even grow for a few months at a 5 percent annual rate without straining the nation's resources.
"The real policy dilemma, the trade-off between inflation and growth, might not come into focus for some time," Mr. Mullins said.
Among the Fed's 17 current policy makers, Mr. Mullins is clearly pro-growth, close to the Administration's position. Mr. Greenspan and a few others appear to be between the Mullins view and a middle-of-the-road group that would accept long-term G.N.P. growth of about 2.5 percent a year. A few policy makers would like to squeeze inflation below its present weak level, keeping the economy on the edge of recession to achieve this.
The Fed policy makers, in sum, aren't as united in their thinking as the President's advisers appear to be. For the moment, in fact, the Fed's leadership seems tilted toward the Administration's view, which helps to explain why the White House can put pressure on the central bank in a soft voice.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed in Slow Day; Prices of Gold Rise Slightly

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed in quiet trading yesterday as the market took a breather after last week's volatile sessions.
Gold prices edged higher in New York, picking up 50 cents to close at $369.10 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $368.75, also up 50 cents. 
 Analysts said the dollar was undergoing a period of consolidation after it soared on Thursday and then fell sharply on Friday. On Thursday, traders snapped up the dollar after German officials decided against raising interest rates, but they bid the dollar down the next day in response to selling of the dollar by central banks.
"Friday had a very tumultuous effect on trading," said John McCarthy, chief dealer with the Algemene Bank Nederland. He added that traders were also waiting to see what kind of stand the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, meeting in London, might take on the dollar.
The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that industrial production rose by seven-tenths of a percent in June, the third straight advance and more evidence that the manufacturing economy was continuing a modest recovery.
But the good economic news had little effect on the dollar. The numbers "were moderately better than anticipated, but not enough to take the dollar through new higher levels," Mr. McCarthy said.
The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen, rising to 136.94 yen in New York from Friday's 136.35. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 137.00 yen, down 1.73 yen from Friday's close but above its finish in New York on Friday. In London, it was quoted at 136.60 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.65375, from $1.6505 late Friday in New York trading. In London, sterling rose to $1.6510, from $1.6505 late Friday.
Against the German mark, the dollar rose slightly, to 1.78895 from 1.7885.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.5483 Swiss francs, down from 1.5580; 6.0745 French francs, up from 6.0730; 1,332.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1462 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14825.
Earlier, gold rose in London to a late bid of $368.85, up from $368.25 late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $368, up from $367.25 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.97 to close at $369.85.
Silver fell 1.3 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.352 a troy ounce. Silver was unchanged in London at a late bid of $4.38.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Abandon Volcano-Ravaged Air Base, Manila Is Told

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, July 15

 BODY:
The United States informed the Philippine Government today that it expected to abandon Clark Air Base in the central Philippines, once a major military air hub, because of the damage caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and the huge costs needed to rebuild the base, American and Philippine officials say.
At the same time, the officials said, American negotiators have told their Philippine counterparts that the United States wishes to retain the use of the giant Subic Bay Naval Station, which was also seriously damaged by the eruption of the volcano but which is considered too valuable to abandon. 
 In recent years, the United States has shown little enthusiasm for keeping Clark because it is no longer as vital to American military and strategic policy as it once was. But Subic, with its logistic and port installations -- the largest outside of the United States -- is deemed important by American strategic planners.
The American lease on the two bases expires in September. Officials said President Corazon C. Aquino was informed of the American plans to pull out of Clark, one of the largest American military installations outside the United States, at a meeting in Manila today with Adm. Charles Larson, who commands all United States military operations in the Pacific.
The Clark base, 10 miles east of Mount Pinatubo, has been smothered by a layer of thick volcanic ash that is two feet deep at points. A Defense Department survey team found that it would cost $500 million to $800 million to dig out the 9,000-acre base and to repair runways and more than 70 buildings that collapsed or were damaged by the ash, American officials said.
 
Volcano Still Spewing
 The Pentagon investigators, they said, warned that the threat from the 5,800-foot volcano was not over. Scientists say Mount Pinatubo could continue spewing its noxious cloud of ash and steam for three more years.
While the decision to abandon Clark has not been announced, the chief American negotiator in the base talks, Richard L. Armitage, gave a strong hint of the American position when he arrived in Manila today for another round of base negotiations with Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus.
"Our facilities at Clark and Subic have sustained substantial damage,' Mr. Armitage said in a statement read at the city's international airport.
"The estimated cost of reconstituting either or both of these facilities, as well as the time involved, promises to be considerable," he said. "Clark's outlook is further clouded by the continuing emissions of ash from Mount Pinatubo that pose a serious hazard to aviation. I have already indicated to Secretary Manglapus, unfortunately, that the future of Clark is questionable."
Mr. Armitage met Mr. Manglapus later in the day in what was described by an American official as a "cordial" one-on-one meeting before formal talks between the nations open on Tuesday.
An American pullout from Clark would be serious blow to the faltering economy of the Philippines. The base employed thousands of Filipinos and injected hundreds of millions of dollars into local businesses each year.
 
90 Years of Ties
 A shutdown would end nearly 90 years of American ties to the base, which was opened at the turn of the century as a United States Army cavalry post, Fort Stotsenburg, and was renamed Clark Air Base after World War II. A decision to end the American presence at the base would doubtless please prominent Philippine lawmakers and academics who have long described Clark and Subic as symbols of American neo-colonialism.
The Philippine Government is all too aware of the damage at Clark and appears ready, although not eager, to accept a deal only for the naval base. "I think they've realized that because of the volcano, this is a one-base arrangement," said an American official.
American officials say that while the Bush Administration initially sought to obtain a new lease agreement for both Clark and Subic, the Navy base was considered the real prize in the talks.
"In an age of satellites and long-range jets, the United States can get along without Clark," an American military official said. "But Subic is a different matter. It is a nearly perfect, well-sheltered deep-water harbor that is irreplaceable. For the United States Navy, there is nothing like it in this part of the world."
Before the first eruption of Mount Pinatubo on June 9, the United States offered $360 million in annual compensation for a 10-year extension on the leases for both Clark and Subic. Philippine negotiators asked for $825 million a year in exchange for a seven-year treaty. In the wake of the eruption, American officials say they will now insist on at least a decadelong lease for Subic at far less money than had been requested by the Philippine Government for use of both bases.
 
Questions in Congress
 In what appeared to be a warning to Philippine negotiators not to push too far on compensation, Mr. Armitage said in his statement that he had been approached by several members of Congress who questioned the wisdom of an American military presence in the Philippines at a time when budget cuts were forcing the Pentagon to shut down large numbers of military installations in the United States.
The lawmakers ask "why the U.S. Government is contemplating spending large sums of money for military facilities in the shadow of an active volcano halfway around the world," Mr. Armitage said. "My answer is that despite the devastations of Mount Pinatubo, the strategic rationale for these facilities remains valid."
Nearly 2,400 Air Force employees remain at Clark. Some have begun cleaning up the base, while others are packing household belongings left behind by the 15,000 Americans ordered to evacuate the Philippines in the wake of the volcano. "The fact that we're sending all of their belongings home should tell you what you need to know about Clark," said an American military official in Manila. "We're not going back."

HEADLINE: Court Nominee Defied Labels As Head of Job-Rights Panel

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
As head of the Federal agency responsible for enforcing the laws against job discrimination, Clarence Thomas was often at war with other Reagan Administration officials, with members of Congress, with civil rights groups and with himself.
Judge Thomas, President Bush's nominee for the Supreme Court, was chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from May 1982 to March 1990, longer than any of his predecessors. A review of agency files for that period shows that he expressed complex, continually changing, often contradictory views, particularly on questions of affirmative action. 
 As a member of Ronald Reagan's transition team in 1980, he had written a memorandum challenging affirmative action. But as commission chairman in 1983, he defended the use of numerical hiring goals in several celebrated cases.
He abruptly switched his public position after the 1984 election and assailed such remedies for the next 20 months. Then in July 1986, at a confirmation hearing for his second term on the commission, he said the agency would once again advocate the use of goals and timetables, despite his personal opposition to them.
Trying to elucidate his shifting views on affirmative action, and acknowledging his personal reservations, the chairman once told a Congressional hearing, "I'll abide by the Supreme Court, whether I like it or not."
If confirmed for a seat on the High Court, Judge Thomas would shape the law by which others must abide. It is by no means certain that his judicial rulings would echo his views from the world of politics and policy. But for those searching for clues to his likely course on the Court, his record at the commission yields many clues to what he might do.
Judge Thomas, who has sat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since early 1990, declines to discuss his record with reporters, but the commission's files, including some of his speeches and correspondence, suggest he was often torn by conflicts inside himself and with others.
For instance, he said the "single most devastating event" of his tenure was the commission's failure to pursue thousands of age-discrimination complaints in a timely manner. He said the agency's performance was "embarrassing and inexcusable," and attributed the lapses in part to management problems in district offices. Congress eventually passed a law extending the statute of limitations for victims of age bias who would otherwise have lost the right to sue employers.
 
'Tired of Rhetoric About Quotas'
 He had mixed results in his effort to improve the internal management of the commission, which he said was "teetering on the brink of self-destruction" when he took office. The agency adopted many policies to increase the "certainty and predictability" of its law enforcement. Annual statistics compiled by the commission show that the number of lawsuits filed by the agency rose sharply during his tenure, to 640 in the fiscal year 1990 from 241 in 1982. But there was no increase in monetary benefits secured for the victims of discrimination.
Other Reagan Administration officials crusaded against the use of numerical goals for hiring blacks, women and Hispanic Americans; he shunned the flamboyant, confrontational tactics of officials like William Bradford Reynolds of the Justice Department. "We have a job to do," he often said, adding that he was "tired of rhetoric about quotas, about affirmative action."
In a 1985 speech, Mr. Thomas said, "My approach to doing my job has been more methodical, cautious and certainly less noisy and less well-publicized than others." Perhaps remembering his days as a seminary student, he said he had the personality and style of "a monastic recluse."
Judge Thomas contends that goals and quotas, a subject of endless political debate, "don't amount to a hill of beans" in practice, as he put it in a 1986 meeting with reporters, because they are rarely appropriate in cases brought before the commission.
In his memorandum for the transition team in December 1980, he said the commission had gone too far in encouraging affirmative action and should re-examine its policy. But in early 1983, he strongly supported an affirmative action plan under which the New Orleans Police Department was required to promote equal numbers of blacks and whites until blacks accounted for 50 percent of the officers at every rank.
The Justice Department adamantly opposed those goals, telling a Federal appeals court that they were illegal. Echoing the concerns of civil rights groups, Mr. Thomas complained in April 1983 that the Justice Department's position would "invalidate innumerable conciliation agreements, consent decrees and adjudicated decrees to which the commission is a party, as well as the commission's own published guidelines regarding appropriate affirmative action."
The commission had drafted a legal brief in the New Orleans case, but decided, under pressure from the White House, not to file it with the court. Mr. Thomas testified at a Congressional hearing in May 1983 that his agency would continue pressing for affirmative action, including "race-conscious relief" of the type abhorred by the Justice Department.
In October 1983, the commission signed a landmark agreement with the General Motors Corporation setting numerical goals for the hiring, training and promoting of thousands of blacks, women and Hispanic people. In July 1984, Mr. Thomas needled the Justice Department, saying that it was widely perceived as having "a negative rather than a positive agenda on civil rights."
His tone changed after President Reagan won re-election by a landslide in 1984. He indicated that the commission and the Administration were more likely to speak with one voice. He said that numerical goals and timetables were ineffective, and that the commission had overused statistical disparities as evidence of discrimination. In October 1985, the agency's general counsel told staff lawyers not to propose settlements containing goals and timetables.
In a speech in February 1986, Mr. Thomas said preferences based on race or ethnic origin were "a ticking time bomb" that would "hasten the socio-economic demise of black Americans." But at the confirmation hearing for his second term, he promised to abide by Supreme Court decisions endorsing the use of numerical goals.
"Whatever reservations I have are purely personal," he testified. "They're subversive literature now." In the spring of 1987, in an article in The Yale Law and Policy Review, Mr. Thomas affirmed his "personal disagreement with the Court's approval of numerical remedies."
 
Criticized Handling Of Age-Bias Cases
Since 1979, the commission has been responsible for enforcing the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which protects people who are at least 40 years old. Mr. Thomas has said "bad management" was responsible for the agency's failure to act on thousands of complaints from older workers within the two-year statute of limitations.
In a separate case, the commission delayed action on rules requiring employers to make pension contributions for employees who work beyond the age of 65. Federal officials conceded that the delay could cost older workers $450 million a year in lost benefits.
Ruling on a lawsuit filed here by the American Association of Retired Persons, Judge Harold H. Greene of United States District Court declared in 1987 that the delay was "entirely unjustified and unlawful." He said the commission itself had repeatedly acknowledged over the previous seven years that such contributions were required by the age discrimination law. "That agency has at best been slothful, at worst deceptive to the public," the judge said.
At a Senate hearing six months later, Mr. Thomas defended himself, saying, "To suggest that we are derelict in our duties is an ad hominem attack that impugns my integrity and the agency's."
The commission under Clarence Thomas filed many lawsuits charging that companies had discriminated against women in violation of a 1963 law that requires equal pay for equal work. But he resisted the doctrine of "comparable worth," which holds that men and women should be paid the same for different jobs having the same intrinsic value.
Labor unions and women's groups embraced comparable worth as a way to reduce the differences in pay between jobs held mainly by women, like nursing and secretarial work, and those held mainly by men, like truck driving and warehouse work, which tend to pay more.
But in a 1985 case, Mr. Thomas said such pay disparities, by themselves, did not prove a violation of Federal law. "Congress never authorized the Government to take on wholesale restructuring of wages that were set by non-sex-based decisions of employers, by collective bargaining or by the marketplace," he said.
 
Records of Agency Were in Chaos
The E.E.O.C. chairman's first objective was to solve severe management problems at the commission, on the theory that "there was absolutely no way we could take care of the public's business if we couldn't take care of our own." He said he found financial records in chaotic condition and said there was too much emphasis on settling cases quickly, with little or no investigation, to eliminate a big backlog. He said he tried to establish the commission's "credibility as a law enforcement agency," contending that it had been a forum for "social activism" and arcane legal theories under some of his predecessors.
In its zeal to challenge a broad pattern or practice of discrimination, the chairman said, the commission sometimes overlooked individual "flesh-and-blood victims" of discrimination who came to its offices seeking help. He declared that "every case brought to the E.E.O.C., no matter how small, should be fully investigated and litigated, if necessary," to obtain jobs and back pay for victims.
In 1984, in a major policy change, the commission decided to consider filing a lawsuit in every case in which its staff had found discrimination and tried unsuccessfully to persuade the employer to correct the problem.
Mr. Thomas often asserted that the commission was getting record amounts of money for victims of discrimination through lawsuits, settlements and conciliation. But the agency's data show such monetary benefits were lower in 1989 and 1990 than in 1982. (The figures were $126.7 million, $98.9 million and $134.7 million, respectively, with no adjustment of inflation.)
In 1988, the General Accounting Office, an auditing arm of Congress, said the commission was still closing many cases without full investigations. In many cases closed with no finding of discrimination, "critical evidence was not verified" and "relevant witnesses were not interviewed," the auditors reported.
Mr. Thomas disputed the criticism, saying at the time that the report "trivializes civil rights enforcement to a level commensurate with widget-making."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
New Deficit Estimate Hurts Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Estimates from the White House that next year's Federal budget deficit will be nearly $350 billion, a figure that was on the high end of what Wall Street had expected, helped to depress prices of Treasury securities yesterday.
Over the last few weeks credit market participants have worried about how they would cope with the huge volume of government debt to be issued this quarter, a number many analysts put at $100 billion. The news about the heftier borrowing in the 12 months beginning Oct. 1 intensified those concerns. 
 In its deficit report, which was released late in the afternoon, the Bush Administration said the shortfall during the current 1991 fiscal year would be $282.2 billion. Much of the increase during the coming year is because of a sharp rise in payments to shore up the bank deposit insurance system.
 
Dulling the Pain
 "The fact that a lot of this increase is due to deposit insurance helps to dull the pain," said Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers. "But the direction is wrong for a recovery."
In issuing its revised figures, the Administration is forecasting economic growth in the coming fiscal year at 3.6 percent, up from eight-tenths of 1 percent in the 1991 fiscal year.
The deficit news came near the end of a session in which traders had effectively shrugged off reports showing that the economy was continuing to gain momentum, as well as developments that underscored the fragility of the nation's financial system.
Dealers said the seven-tenths of a percent rise in industrial production reported for June, the third straight monthly advance, had been widely anticipated and did not have lasting impact on market participants. A report that automobile manufacturers sold 7.4 million vehicles at an annual rate in the first 10 days of July, roughly equal to the final 10-day period in June, was also ignored.
 
Unimpressed With Bank Merger
 Traders also seemed unimpressed with news that the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, two large, troubled banking companies, intend to merge. That development followed the disclosure over the weekend that beacause of bad real estate loans New Jersey regulators would take control of the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, one of the most conservative institutions in the insurance industry.
"The financial system is still in trouble, and to me these developments favor investing in fixed-income instruments rather than equities, and in Treasury securities rather than corporate or municipal issues," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
The Treasury held its weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday. But concern among traders about the coming supply is focused on record auctions of two-year and five-year notes later this month, and on the quarterly refunding auctions in August.
"We aren't negative on the market per se, but we do doubt the Street's ability to get the refunding issues distributed," one government bond trader said. "The last two refundings caused rates to back up about 40 basis points before the longer-dated securities got sold. The possibility that may happen again remains the biggest threat to the market."
 
Bill Auctions Yesterday
 At the bill auctions yesterday, three-month bills were sold at a an average discount rate of 5.56 percent, down slightly from an average rate of 5.58 percent at last week's sale.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.7 percent, down from an average rate of 5.71 percent a week ago.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds were offered in late trading at 96 15/32, down 5/32, to yield 8.44 percent, compared with a yield of 8.43 percent late Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 1/4, down 3/32, to yield 8.26 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 7/32, down 2/32, to yield 6.87 percent.
Word of the Chemical-Manufacturers Hanover merger proposal had a big impact in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, pushing up prices of most big bank bonds by a point or more.
 
Bank Issues Score Gains
 Not surprisingly, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover issues scored the biggest gains.
By late yesterday, traders said that a 8.5 percent Manufacturers Hanover issue due to mature in 1999 was offered at a price to yield 10.15 percent. Late Friday the same issue was offered at a price to yield 10.6 percent.
An outstanding 9 3/4 percent Chemical Bank bond maturing in 1999 was also offered at a price to yield 10.15 percent, compared with a yield of 10.7 percent late Friday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Improvement Seen in July Vehicle Sales

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 15

 BODY:
Confirming that the American automotive market is growing ever more robust, sales of domestically built vehicles fell a modest 7.7 percent in early July from a strong sales period a year earlier.
Sales of cars built in North America -- which the industry considers domestic production -- dropped 4.4 percent, and light-truck sales were off 12.9 percent. The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate was 7.3 million, the second-highest 10-day rate this year, after the 7.4 million of the last reporting period. 
 "I was afraid we might have a downward correction, given the recent strong trend," said Scott Merlis, automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in New York. He said the continued strength could mean higher car production schedules for the rest of the year. Failing that, he said, spot shortages of certain models could develop by the end of the year.
 
Seasonal Factors Vary
 A year earlier, the rate was also 7.3 million. But the Commerce Department's seasonal adjustment factors vary from year to year, which is why this year's unadjusted sales are significantly lower, on a daily-rate basis, than last year's.
The Big Three and a half-dozen Japanese auto makers sold 270,499 cars and light trucks in the period, compared with 256,448 a year ago. There were eight selling days in the July 1-10 period this year, compared with seven days last year; percentage changes are based on daily rates.
Car sales were 170,755, compared with 156,220 last year; light-truck sales were 99,744, compared with 100,228 last year.
On a historical basis, the recovery in car sales the last two months is nearly as strong as recoveries from the recessions in 1981 and 1975, said Ronald Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco.
The General Motors Corporation's car sales rose 2.4 percent, to 87,759, and the Ford Motor Company said its sales fell 23.2 percent, to 42,389.
The Toyota Motor Corporation showed a substantial 49.3 percent increase in car sales, to 8,411; the Honda Motor Company posted a 2.5 percent increase, to 8,803, and the Nissan Motor Company reported a 7.1 percent increase, to 2,036.
Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication, estimated that the Chrysler Corporation's car sales fell 7.8 percent, to 17,500. Chrysler reports vehicle sales once a month.
"It would appear the gradual recovery has not been interrupted," said Joel Pitcoff, a sales analyst for Ford. He noted that early July was the first time since February that the company reported positive year-to-year sales comparisons for its redesigned Escort subcompact. The Taurus and Sable midsize models were also selling well, he said.
 
Large Toyota Rebates
 In explaining Toyota's large percentage increase, a company spokesman acknowledged that July sales were helped by especially generous rebates intended to clear inventories before the 1992 model year begins in October.
G.M.'s light-truck sales fell 17.5 percent, to 41,859; Ford's light-truck sales were off 17.5 percent, to 31,972, and Nissan's rose 1.4 percent, to 2,473. Ward's estimated that Chrysler's light-truck sales also rose 1.4 percent, to 22,850.
As a group, the Big Three's share of the market for American-made cars was 86.5 percent, compared with 89.5 percent a year earlier. The sales share of Japanese cars assembled in the United States -- known as "transplants" -- grew to 13.5 percent, from 10.5 percent.
The Big Three's share of sales of domestically produced light trucks fell slightly, to 96.9 percent from 97.8 percent. Light-truck sales from Japanese transplants grew to 3.1 percent, from 2.2 percent.
