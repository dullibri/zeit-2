HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Professional Judgment vs. Visual Imperatives in TV News

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Anyone who judges the newsworthiness of events by the pictures on the nightly news is likely to come away with a dim comprehension of recent goings-on in places like Lithuania, Nepal, the Natal province of South Africa, the Arab villages of the West Bank and other hot spots. It is a constant challenge to television journalists.
Why the lack of striking images of striking events? Well, Lithuania's Soviet masters have simply booted journalists out, and even when they were still there the nighttime takeovers by Soviet troops of important buildings and the roughing up of army deserters proceeded without benefit of cameras. The networks had to make do with routine shots of Soviet tanks rolling peaceably along the streets of Vilnius and after-the-fact interviews.
There is nothing unusual about governments keeping reporters and, more particularly, photographers at a distance from certain activities. It's a propensity that the leaders of democracies share with dictators when they can get away with it. Press and television were not permitted within reporting range of United States forces during the invasion of Panama. 
Some places, like the Himalayas, may just be too difficult to get to in time to photograph protesters being mowed down. News division resources being limited, slaughters of one sort or another often go unrecorded. Some killing grounds are remote; others are dangerous. There are regimes extant that do not make nice distinctions between television crews and uncredentialed victims. Baghdad does not encourage investigative reporting.
As for the recent spate of internecine killings in Natal and on the West Bank, they are harder to catch as they are happening, much harder, for example, than scenes of South African soldiers beating protesters with whips. (When Pretoria barred photographers, the networks accompanied reports of new disturbances with the old pictures, in most cases properly identified.) The difficulty for the television journalist is that there is no relationship between the significance of a story and the available film clips.
To be sure, all these events have been reported on network news, often intelligently, but in a less vivid manner than audiences have come to expect from the tube at its liveliest. The best-intentioned television journalists must constantly find their professional judgment colliding with the visual imperatives. Sometimes they and the news win. On Friday all the programs led with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's tough new threats against Lithuania. But the difficulty remains. The journalists are like missionaries competing with witch doctors from their own denomination to catch the attentions of impressionable locals.
The customary picture-directed coverage may have left many Americans with the conviction that the issue in Africa, for example, is exclusively one between white rulers and black subjects, or that the issue in the Middle East is exclusively between Israeli occupiers and uprooted Palestinians. Not outlandish notions, but at best incomplete.
It has been suggested that such black-white formulations are congenial to many journalists, but even those not so predisposed are to some extent at the mercy of the available photography. For the millions who watched the release of the estimable Nelson Mandela live on the networks, the glow of those dramatic moments is probably still obscuring his political plans and problems. Smitten correspondents will have to play catch-up as they are already doing in the case of the decreasingly glamorous President Gorbachev.
The pictures of the ravages that battling Christian militias have been inflicting on East Beirut - knocked-down buildings and burned-out cars - are identical to those resulting from Christian assaults on Muslim neighborhoods and Muslim assaults on Christian neighborhoods and Muslim assaults on Muslim neighborhoods. How unsatisfying compared with the clear-cut, often-repeated pictures of Israeli soldiers chasing Palestinian kids. (There they were again last week on ''World News Tonight,'' only you could not tell whether the pictures had been taken the other day or last year.) The rush of events in Eastern Europe presents a similar difficulty. From those exhilarating scenes a few months ago of people taking to the streets in defiance of their rulers, viewers can be pardoned for concluding that Eastern Europe is simply a field of confrontation between democracy and dictatorship. But that, alas, is not the end of the story, and the aftermath, the activities in the corridors of power, cannot match the activities on the streets for visual excitement. The ramifications of German unity, for a knotty example, is a far tougher story to report on television than the fall of the Berlin wall.
How many Americans can keep track of how Poland differs from Czechoslovakia or how both differ from Romania? Those, perhaps, who watched Ted Koppel's special early this month on the overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu. Perhaps Peter Jennings's special on Cambodia scheduled for next week will do as much for that unhappy country. But specials are sporadic, and a few minutes on the nightly news are inadequate. The lead stories on ABC as the Hungarian election results came in were about the death of young Ryan White from AIDS and a follow-up on the sinking of a North Sea ferry, audience grabbers both. The pictures accompanying them were so much stronger than those of lines of Hungarians waiting to vote that a producer would have had to be unusually committed, not to say committable, to put Hungary up front.
Wherever one looks, the problem is apparent. It takes an event like violence in Trafalgar Square to give punch to so unvisual a subject as the economics of Thatcherite Britain. All the networks have reported on Corazon Aquino's troubles since winning the election in the Philippines, but how many viewers, impressed by the stunning pictures of the downfall of Ferdinand Marcos, have a clear sense of what has been happening since to the heroine of the week? And how many, though stirred by accounts so movingly photographed of starving children in Africa, grasp the extent of the little-photographed repression and tribal warfare throughout the continent? By the standard of pictorial excitement, nothing much is happening these days in such politically stressful places as China, Panama and Myanmar (formerly Burma). It will be interesting to see how Nicaragua is covered during its crucial post-election threshings.
How are television journalists to deal with this chronic predicament? They can't be everywhere at once; they can't compel governments to time their crackdowns conveniently and offer them as photo opportunities. And they certainly can't count on the fascination of their viewers with distant places. Producers know that Americans' patience for the details of bloodless foreign commotions is limited. Even at their most dramatic, the displays of people power in Eastern Europe did not win big ratings.
The main ingredients of the nightly news - headlines and pictures - are just not very useful for getting beyond the obvious; something there is that doesn't love a picture. For that you need more time and a willingness to settle for less drama. The television journalists, try though they may, are under pressure; competition seems to be pushing the three main news programs in the direction of features along the lines of ''The Person of the Week'' on ''World News Tonight,'' which are never short of good pictures. It may be the right direction for audience appeal but will do nothing to bring viewers into the picture on less photo-friendly subjects.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Extension Is Weighed

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 15

 BODY:
The Administration is considering a significant extension of antitrust laws to strike at American subsidiaries of foreign companies that are found to engage in price-fixing, the carving up of markets and other anti-competitive practices in their home markets.
Under the plan, disclosed last week, the Government could file antitrust lawsuits against these foreign-owned companies for damage their collusion might cause to American concerns operating abroad. The action could ruffle relations with trading partners of the United States who might see it as an attack on their authority and an infringement on their laws.
The application of American antitrust law could be costly for the subsidiaries, since it subjects those that are found guilty to the payment of triple damages. 
 
Export Impairment Cited
''The Justice Department will not tolerate violations of the U.S. antitrust laws, where we have jurisdiction, which impair export opportunities for U.S. businesses,'' said James F. Rill, an Assistant Attorney General and head of the antitrust division.
He said at a news conference, and in a subsequent interview last week, that the division's foreign commerce section was actively reviewing the change and expected to complete its study by fall.
The division might then consider revising its international anti-monopoly guidelines. In the last revision, in 1988, the Reagan Administration stopped short of suggesting the extension now being considered.
Yet to be determined is whether new legislation would be needed, or whether the change could be effected by executive order.
 
Right to Challenge Practices
Throughout the postwar era, the United States has asserted that it has the right to challenge anti-competitive practices of foreign companies if those practices hurt American consumers. An example would be price-fixing that forces Americans to pay more for goods and services. Under the new plan, the United States could, for the first time, challenge foreign companies because of damage their collusion might cause American companies in export markets.
Thus, if Japanese auto makers were found to be part of anti-competitive arrangements that restrict markets for American cars or auto parts in Japan, the United States could strike at the American subsidiaries of those companies.
Although Mr. Rill, the antitrust chief, said the initiative was not aimed at any particular country, the review coincided with stepped-up American pressure on Japan to toughen its antitrust enforcement.
Stronger antitrust activity has been promised as one of the broad ''structural'' measures that Japan agreed to on April 5.
American antitrust experts generally welcomed the Justice Department review, but foreign governments, sensitive to any infringement of their sovereignty, expressed concern.
 
Japanese 'Not Surprised'
''We have to look at it; I can't comment right now,'' said Makoto Kurita, a spokesman on antitrust matters at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, He added that he was ''not surprised that the Justice Department is taking a stronger position on the issue.''
A British official, who asked not to be identified, warned that there could be trouble if the United States acted against a foreign company that complied with the laws of its home country.
Rather than strike out on its own, the United States should deal with such cases on a ''cooperative international basis,'' he said, establishing international guidelines through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development or other such international consultative bodies.
 
No International Consensus
Although business increasingly moves across international borders, there is no international consensus, as yet, on ways to deal with anti-competitive practices in various countries.
''If a foreign cartel is deliberately cutting down American exports, you have not only an antitrust problem, but a foreign relations problem,'' said Robert H. Bork, the former United States Court of Appeals judge who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based research organization.
A constitutional as well as antitrust expert whose nomination to the United States Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987, Judge Bork said that while the extension of antitrust laws to cover a foreign cartel is a ''very complex'' issue, ''I think it's well worth studying.''
 
Significant Evolution Seen
Andrew F. Popper, deputy dean at the American University Law School, said the change would mark a significant step in the evolution of American antitrust policy. There has always been conflict, he noted, between ''our Horatio Alger view of competition engaging independently to provide the best service for consumers and the suspicion that nationalized foreign competitors will do violence to our fragile version of the market.''
''It's a natural development,'' commented Robert Pitofsky, former dean at the Georgetown University Law Center who is now at the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy research group. ''The world is growing smaller, with the result that American companies and American consumers can be injured by what foreign companies do abroad.''
The proposed broadening of antitrust enforcement would be the second Government move in recent months aimed at American subsidiaries of foreign companies. In February, Federal tax officials were reported to be investigating what they suspected to be underpayment of taxes by subsidiaries of companies from Japan and other countries.
 
Stretching of Doctrine
The antitrust proposal would stretch the ''effects doctrine'' established by a Federal appellate judge, Learned Hand, in a seminal 1945 decision. That decision, which the Supreme Court let stand, held that a foreign company engaging in behavior with anticompetitive consequences inside the United States was liable to punitive action.
Because of the growing importance of exports to the nation's welfare, the doctrine would be extended to embrace American marketing activities abroad. ''So long as the conspiring company does business in the United States, the fact that the conspiracy actually took place overseas wouldn't prevent us from exercising jurisdiction,'' Mr. Rill said.
The Justice Department has already moved in this direction. Last year, at the prodding of the department, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which is similar to the Federal Trade Commission, investigated allegations of bid-rigging by 140 companies at the Yokusuka Naval Base near Tokyo.
The practice was found to have hurt American construction companies, and the Japanese companies were assessed fines of $37 million.
''We know that Yokosuka is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who is considered an expert on Japanese construction industry practices.
 
Request by Pickens
Last week, T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and investor, asked the Japanese trade agency to look at exclusive business arrangements between Japanese car makers and parts suppliers to see whether these violated antitrust laws. Mr. Pickens is the largest stockholder in the Koito Manufacturing Company, a maker of auto headlamps that has close ties to the Toyota Motor Corporation, Koito's largest customer and second-largest stockholder.
The complaint said that close relationships between auto makers and parts companies restricted competition and hindered the entry of outside companies into the market.
Timothy P. Andree, public relations manager for Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America, said the company had no comment. ''This is a matter between Mr. Pickens and Koito, and so we don't feel any need to comment or reply to anything that he alleges,'' he added.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Canada Trade Border Blurs

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba

 BODY:
The 16-month-old free-trade agreement between Canada and the United States, intended to eliminate virtually all tariffs and duties in that enormous trading relationship by 1999, is already having some unexpected grass-roots side effects, promoting a wide array of bilateral business and civic partnerships.
Provincial and state governments are pursuing several new joint economic development programs, from designing a snowmobile trail that wanders back and forth across the border to encouraging governments and businesses to disregard distant domestic suppliers if they can do business more cheaply nearby, even if it is in the other country. Minnesota and Manitoba are working to make government scholarships and academic credits mutually acceptable in their public university systems.
For the second year, Manitoba's tourism agency has negotiated a joint promotion with McDonald's restaurants in Minnesota. This year's grand prize: four families will journey by special railcar nearly 1,100 miles north to Hudson Bay to see the annual migration of beluga whales and their calves. 
 
Cross-Border Bank Effort
Canadian and American banks are working to program automatic teller machines so customers can gain access to their bank accounts on either side of the border. In February, New Flyer Industries, a Winnipeg bus manufacturer, opened an assembly plant in Grand Forks, N.D.
''These new developments are fascinating,'' said Jules Katz, a deputy United States trade representative. ''I doubt that anyone anticipated anything quite like it.''
In some sectors, the growing north-south links are forging closer ties between states and provinces than exist between Canadian provinces, which are still negotiating a domestic free-trade pact to eliminate discriminatory purchasing and trading practices.
''People realize they've got to go global to survive,'' said Jerry Nagel, executive director of the Northwest Regional Development Commission in Thief River Falls, Minn., in the northwest part of the state, 60 miles south of the Canadian border and 240 miles northwest of Minneapolis and St. Paul. ''The free-trade agreement made us realize who our natural economic allies were. And it's not the Twin Cities far away; it's Manitoba right next door.''
The trade pact, approved by the United States Congress and Canada's Parliament, was expected to stimulate economic growth on both sides of the border. More than $160 billion (United States) in trade flows across the border each year, giving the two nations by far the world's largest bilateral economic relationship. The United States trades more with Ontario, for instance, than with Japan.
Some of the stimulus is practical, like the elimination of tariffs. And some is psychological.
''Eliminating government trade barriers creates a spirit of cooperation that stimulates all kinds of activities, expected and unforeseen, that begin rolling like a snowball and yielding benefits for both sides far outside the legal framework of the agreement,'' said Judith Bello, who was general counsel for the United States trade representative during the negotiations for the free-trade agreement.
 
Strong Ties in the Prairie
The new cooperation seems strongest in the prairie regions of the mid-continent, but similar efforts are emerging elsewhere along the frontier. To help local businesses in both countries, economic development officials in Calais, Me., and St. Stephen, New Brunswick, for instance, are working together from an office on the American side to develop a scenic driving tour that meanders back and forth across the border.
''The free-trade agreement has focused folks' interest,'' said Jim Eldridge, the Manitoba official charged with intergovernmental relations. ''It's been an incredible catalyst.'' Indeed, northern Minnesota, Montana and the Dakotas have many things in common with Manitoba and Saskatchewan: heavy reliance on troubled agricultural sectors, faltering rural economies far from major markets, an exodus of young people unable to find steady work, pristine natural resources and distant federal governments that seem to place their regions' concerns low on the priority list.
 
Longtime Economic Ties
There have long been limited economic links between the northern prairie regions of the United States and their Canadian neighbors. About 30 percent of Manitoba's $800 million a year in tourism income is spent by Americans. Forty percent of all foreign visitors to the United States are Canadian, many of them weekend shoppers. Manitoba Hydro and the Northern States Power Company in Minnesota regularly sell each other electricity during their peak demand seasons, which is summer in the United States and winter in Canada.
The drive to cooperate is so strong now that an exploratory conference on the idea of mutual efforts, held last month in Grand Forks, was expected to attract 40 officials and business officers, but more than 210 attended. ''The idea was to get to know each other,'' said Joe Nathan, a conference organizer. ''Instead, we've had this explosion of joint ideas.''
Manitoba and Minnesota tourism officials have already met and agreed to distribute each other's literature and to program each other's computers to include their neighbor's offerings. They are planning several joint attractions, including an international fishing tournament, a canoe race from Winnipeg to Fargo, N.D., and construction of a snowmobile trail that would wind back and forth across the border.
 
Promotions in Europe
In recent weeks, the same tourism officials have traveled to Europe together to promote the region as a destination for European campers, hunters and history buffs. ''By itself, our parts might be a weak attraction,'' said Paul Robson, Manitoba's assistant deputy tourism minister. ''But together we form a critical mass and a viable destination.''
Regional bankers will meet next month to explore interlocking their automatic teller machines and making currency exchanges easier for travelers. Manufacturers on both sides are developing a regional directory so companies can buy from each other instead of from more distant national suppliers.
''We expect many more links like that going both ways,'' said Mr. Nagel, the executive director of the development commission in Minnesota, who is pressing his state bar association to make more training in international law available for local lawyers.
Manitoba, which is widening the main road between Winnipeg and the border, is also exchanging two provincial trade officials with the state of Kansas, about 600 miles south of the border. ''We'll learn how each other works,'' said Mr. Eldridge, Manitoba's government-affairs offical. ''Sure, sometimes we'll be competing. But other times we can throw business to each other.''
 
Coordinating Health Systems
Government and private health executives are drawing plans to coordinate the Minneapolis area's impressive health-care services with hospitals in Manitoba, where the Canadian Government is building a national disease center. The plan is to coordinate health-care equipment manufacturing, too. ''That way,'' Mr. Eldridge added, ''we can be more efficient, avoid costly duplication and together sell to the rest of the world.''
The political leaders of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, North Dakota and Minnesota have signed a compact to consider the environmental effect on their neighbors when examining broad economic development proposals.
Minnesota and Manitoba are making their college credits immediately transferable across the border and are working on the same for scholarships. Minnesota has sent experts to brief Manitoban educators on its satellite-television education program for rural areas. Winnipeg sends its Royal Ballet for regular appearances in the Twin Cities.
Mr. Eldridge is working on having the Timberwolves, the National Basketball Association team whose home is the Twin Cities, play some games in Winnipeg, where, thanks to cable television, the team is developing a following.
Last year, the Manitoba tourism office, which uses as its United States spokesman Bud Grant, the former coach of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, flew in the winners of a contest sponsored by McDonald's in the Twin Cities to see some visiting panda bears. About 100,000 people entered the contest.
One measure of the dramatic changes will come in the next few days, Mr. Nagel said. His agency in Minnesota will submit a grant application to the United States Economic Development Administration that will rely in part on Canadian statistics. Northern Minnesota wants to attract new factory investment and jobs by improving the area around Warroad, Minn., a border community that relies heavily on binational business.
The figures will show the need for new jobs in Minnesota by including, among other things, unemployment data for the nearby Canadian side. ''Listen,'' Mr. Nagel said, ''we may be two countries. But we are one economy.''

A New Role for the Anti-Apartheid T-Shirt

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa

 BODY:
The war against apartheid is proving to be good business for manufacturers of the politically relevant T-shirt.
The removal of the ban on the African National Congress and the release of Nelson Mandela have improved not only the prospects for black majority rule but also the appearance of its proponents.
Such garments were worn before as a symbol of defiance, but cautiously, because the police would confiscate them. Now, T-shirts legally endorse organizations that the white minority Government once decreed must be unseen and unheard. Even a Government official acknowledged that he bought his son a popular T-shirt welcoming home Nelson Mandela. 
But not every T-shirt will do. ''It's got to be a part of some struggle,'' said Don Joseph, a graphic artist. ''It's got to have a relevant message on it.'' Mr. Joseph has been designing T-shirts for Zenzeleni, a Durban cooperative that has become the leading purveyor of protest wear to apartheid's opponents.

Zenzeleni - the name means ''we do it ourselves'' in Zulu - was set up a year ago with labor union assistance for black workers left unemployed by the automation of South Africa's textile industry. The cooperative now has 320 employees, who, as a condition of employment, belong to the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
Zenzeleni's few white employees include the cooperative's managing director, Glen Cormack, who took a two-thirds cut in salary and benefits from his former position as personnel director for Tiger Oats, a leading food corporation.
With a goal of employment over profit, Zenzeleni makes its T-shirts the old-fashioned way. The cotton cloth is cut and sewn by hand, and the messages are stenciled using a basic silk-screen technique.
''We elected to go the archaic method, which is certainly the least efficient, but maintains jobs,'' said Stephanie Miller, Zenzeleni's marketing director.
 
Logotypes of Liberation
Half of the ideas for new T-shirts come from the employees. When they proposed something for the newly unbanned South African Communist Party, Mr. Joseph designed a red T-shirt with a yellow star and a hammer and sickle imposed over a black fist. Other T-shirts hailing the African National Congress and Mr. Mandela feature the liberation movement's black, green and yellow colors.
Last year, Zenzeleni's garments upset both the South African Police and the United States Customs Service. While the security police here seized one batch of T-shirts as subversive, American customs officials declared another shipment illegal under the sanctions Congress legislated against South Africa.
''Ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,'' Mrs. Miller said, referring to the American action. ''You would imagine that people would have a little more vision.''
The cotton material for each T-shirt costs 5 to 8 rand - about $2 to $3.20 - a meter, and the labor costs an additional 3.20 rand. The T-shirts sell for 15 rand - about $6 - which includes a 1 rand commission for the vendor, leaving Zenzeleni with a markup that Mr. Cormack said was half of what its competitors made.
 
Hoping to Break-Even Soon
Zenzeleni has yet to make money. South African banks refused to give loans, Mr. Cormack said, because of Zenzeleni's ties to the militantly anti-apartheid labor union movement. Indeed, two senior union stewards serve as directors of the corporation.
But Mr. Cormack hopes the cooperative will start breaking-even later this year. And any profits will be invested in the creation of more jobs for unemployed blacks.
Mr. Cormack said trendy T-shirts would not sustain Zenzeleni forever. So he has developed a line of work clothes, which will eventually account for most of its production.
Zenzeleni now has the capacity to manufacture 400,000 T-shirts a year for a domestic market that Mr. Cormack estimated can absorb at least two million.
The company could beat overseas sanctions and increase sales if it stenciled T-shirts imported from China, like some competitors, and distributed them through Swaziland or another country.

HEADLINE: Housing the Poor - Without Subsidies

BYLINE: By Howard Husock; Howard Husock is director of case studies at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
While social, political and judicial pressures to construct new low-income housing are growing, there is no obvious way to do so. Tight budgets at all levels of government have made the return of large-scale subsidized housing construction, whatever its merits, extremely unlikely.
Why not consider instead a ''back to the future'' solution: housing and neighborhoods that sheltered the poor and aspiring at the turn of the century but have withered in a world of zoning constraints and government subsidies?
It was not until Franklin Roosevelt's second term that public housing emerged as the leading response to the horrors and crowding of tenement life. Before that, with government acquiescence but not financial support, America produced a variety of housing that served both as shelter and as a means of upward mobility. Such housing became synonymous with the streetscape of our cities: row houses in Philadelphia, brownstones in Brooklyn, three-family houses (''three-deckers'') in Boston. 
This was construction on a grand scale, built at a level of density that almost no suburban area would permit today. But it did its job. The New England three-family house - 15,000 of which were built in Boston between 1890 and 1930 - is a particularly good case in point.
In addition to the obvious economic advantages of dividing the cost of construction three ways, small-scale, multifamily housing provided for social controls. Small landlords screened tenants carefully. Children were disciplined for disturbing rent payers. And, most important, low-income owners were brought into the social mainstream.
So it was that neighborhood and community were built, as well as housing provided, much of which has had a long, useful life. Even in relatively affluent streetcar suburbs (such as parts of Westchester County and northern New Jersey), districts of two-family houses, as well as small apartment buildings, coexisted happily with larger single-family homes.
The emergence of zoning laws in the 1920's began to change matters. By the time housing construction began in earnest again after World War II, multifamily housing was zoned out of newly developing suburbs. Long Island's Nassau County became a sea of single-family homes. One-acre and half-acre zoning became common in growth areas, insuring income stratification.
At the same time, government began the paternalistic practice of housing the poor in projects. Isolating the poor proved to have disastrous social results, both for residents and the surrounding communities. Just as important, the bad name acquired by projects persuaded suburban communities, such as Yonkers, to fight their hardest to keep them out.
Amidst these trends, the successful middle way represented by small-scale, owner-occupied multifamily housing, was forgotten. The time is ripe for its revival - and in some places it has already begun.
In Albany, for instance, new two-family row houses have been built with minimal public subsidies (to be later repaid). The houses should be affordable for people with an annual income of only $15,560. (Paying the mortgage was predicated on a tenant paying rent of $262 monthly.) In Boston, the city has begun an ambitious program to allow new homes to be built on some 747 vacant lots. It has eased zoning restrictions to allow the first new construction of three-family houses since the 1920's.
Such efforts should be a model for other cities with large vacant parcels and for suburban municipalities as well. Higher-density, owner-occupied housing with its own rental units represents a way for suburbs both to live up to their civic obligations to provide for those in need and to provide homes for local teachers, police and firefighters who cannot afford to buy single-family homes in many municipalities.
Such housing is likely to be far more politically palatable than projects for the poor. It has the further advantage of building its affordability on the Federal tax code - the mortgage interest deduction and deductions for rental unit maintenance - rather than on up-front subsidies.
Call it housing deregulation. Or upzoning. There is ample opportunity to apply it. The courts will need to do their part by accepting rezoning for higher-density construction, as opposed to construction of housing projects, as a good-faith effort to provide low-income housing. The result can be new housing and new neighborhoods for those in need.

All About What's Going On in Zambia, Slyly Told

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUSAKA, Zambia, April 15

 BODY:
For more than two decades, Kapelwa Musonda has been charming, amusing and occasionally provoking Zambians about the absurdities and frustrations of surviving amid the beleaguered economy and party politics of their African nation.
Every Tuesday, lines form around the newsboys on Cairo Road here for The Times of Zambia, one of the country's two daily newspapers, to catch how Musonda's characters, Aunt Agatha and Comrade Bonzo, view the world.
At a time when President Kenneth D. Kaunda has insisted that the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe have no application in his own backyard, Comrade Bonzo had some tough things to say recently.
Eastern Europe will have no effect, the character said rather tartly, because ''adequate and convincing lies have been invented to explain and justify our miseries and deprivations.'' 
 
A Risky Business
In a lighter mood, Comrade Bonzo, hired as protocol officer for Namibia's independence celebrations, bemoaned that he did not have the time to order up the ''luxury mansionettes'' deserving of the visiting heads of state.
The mere existence of Kapelwa Musonda and his characters is unusual in Africa, where challenging the wisdom of the ruling party, and particularly the President, is a risky business. A Ugandan journalist was locked up by the Ugandan authorities this year for daring to ask President Kaunda, during a visit to Uganda, whether after 26 years he had not been in power too long.
Columnists appear in some newspapers, but few have the dedicated following of Kapelwa Musonda or his skills at getting at the heart of the matter but still skirting trouble.
Indeed, one of the clues to the success of the column is that its creator is generally unknown, appearing in the columns only in the first person as an urban Zambian with a quizzical mind. An educated Zambian and follower of the column, asked the other day who she thought the pen name Kapelwa Musonda belonged to, said she thought he was a truck driver.
In fact, he is Wizas Phiri, an agronomist, who during the day works as the operations manager of Shell Chemical in Lusaka and, with an inspirational poster of Mark Twain in front of him and a library of books behind, writes at his electric typewriter at night. Three years ago, he was one of four Africans selected to attend the international writing course at the University of Iowa.
 
'Not Advancing Any Cause'
''I'm not advancing any cause and I'm not associated with any of the groupings - tribal groupings, trade unions, Zambian business,'' Mr. Phiri said, explaining his 23 years of durability as a columnist. ''If I was championing any cause I don't think I would have lasted.''
And he has a simple rule: ''You don't make a direct attack on any single individual.'' That, of course, especially applies to President Kaunda, his often talked-about wife and sons, and prominent politicians.
Mr. Phiri was hired by The Times of Zambia in 1967, some years before a Government takeover, as a way for the paper to maintain a thread of independence from the inward-looking discussion dominating post-colonial politics. Mr. Phiri said he determined not to be ''sycophantic'' but not to take a ''direct approach.''
His Aunt Agatha is an irrepressible, loyal member of the ruling party and the women's league's most ''eminent political theorist and prosperous marketeer.'' But lately, she has been down in the dumps, frustrated in her profession on the black market because of a new Government policy, mandated by the International Monetary Fund, that price controls be lifted.
''The cardinal duty of every black marketeer is to empty the shelves of any shop of all available essential commodities and have these displayed for resale at markets and roadside stands,'' Aunt Agatha said recently. But now, she lamented, ''our problem is we can't generate enough cash to enable us to empty the shelves.''
 
At the 'Rock of Authority'
Needless to say, Aunt Agatha was organizing a conference at Lusaka's major convention hall, the site of garrulous political gatherings and facetiously referred to in the column as the ''rock of authority,'' to get around the problem of lack of cash.
About to turn 50 - ''already past the average life expectancy of a Zambian,'' he said wryly - Mr. Phiri is soft-spoken and sociable, a sort of antithesis to the strident and striving party hack, Aunt Agatha. In a city where a chosen place for socializing implies a certain status, he avoids the obvious watering holes - the bar at the Inter-Continental, the gossip at the Flying Club - and sticks to the modest club for the employees of his company.
One of his biggest personal concerns is finding ways to get books from overseas, which because of the chronic economic crisis are nonexistent in Zambia.
''The worst thing we have done to ourselves is the state of education,'' he said. ''Walk around Lusaka and ask for a bookshop. You can't find one. And this is a capital city. In the whole nation, you can't find anything to read. You can't have a nation where the only thing you do is drink, and if you're thirsty for reading, you can't satisfy your thirst.''
 
Some Columns Are Censored
Two collections of his columns were published in the 1970's. There is now no functioning publishing house in Zambia and an effort he made to publish a new collection himself last year was stalled by interest rates of 35 percent.
Now and then his column does not appear, censored by the managing editor, who by tradition is appointed by the President. The last one to get the ax was due to appear the day before the opening of the annual convention of the ruling party last month.
The column expressed enthusiasm for a multiparty system in Zambia, a possibility that had actually been floated from the State House. But during the convention, President Kaunda denounced the motion of a multiparty state as ''Stone Age barbarism.'' Clearly, Mr. Phiri said, his editor knew more than he did.

HEADLINE: MALAYSIA ACCUSED ON BOAT PEOPLE

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, April 16

 BODY:
Despite continued protests from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Malaysia is turning away Vietnamese boat people with increasing frequency, diplomats and international relief workers say.
Since the end of May 1989, in violation of its agreement to provide first asylum to the Vietnamese, the Malaysians have sent back out to sea at least 5,401 people arriving in at least 109 boats.
In March alone, according to the High Commissioner, at least 1,050 Vietnamese in 22 boats were denied asylum in Malaysia and forced to return to sea.
On Feb. 19, the Malaysians towed out to sea in a new boat 159 Vietnamese who had been rescued on Feb. 8 by a commercial ship in Malaysian waters. 
 
Plight 'Speaks for Itself'
The captain of the vessel, upon receiving a letter from the Vietnamese, wrote an angry letter of his own to the refugee commissioner's office in Geneva, saying the Vietnamese letter ''speaks for itself and I would not know any other way to get attention to the fact that the Malaysian Government is knowingly putting refugees back on the high seas from which they have just been rescued.''
The Malaysians have even tried to push off boats landing on Bidong Island, where there is a refugee camp for Vietnamese boat people, in sight of officials of the United Nations refugee office. But after intervention by those officials, the Malaysians have been persuaded to accept the boats. The waters around Bidong Island are ''defended'' against Vietnamese boats by naval and police patrol boats and helicopters, diplomats and refugee officials say.
''In the beginning, the Malaysians were being very careful and selective, and seemed to be simply trying to make a point,'' a senior refugee worker said. ''But now they are pushing off more and more people in a more haphazard way. The noose seems to be tightening.''
As many as 50 to 60 percent of those Vietnamese boat people arriving in Malaysia are now being sent back out to sea, diplomats say.
The Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, again denied last week that Vietnamese boat people are being towed away or otherwise denied asylum. He has said Malaysia is only ''preventing foreign vessels from entering our waters'' and protecting the rights of Malaysian fishermen.
 
Malaysian Is Indignant
But according to Eric E. Morris, representative of the High Commissioner in Malaysia and Brunei, virtually all the Vietnamese boats first came ashore in Malaysia. Often, the Vietnamese are regrouped and sent back out to sea by the Malaysians in different, refurbished boats, diplomats said.
Mr. Mahathir also said Malaysia has done a great deal for refugees since 1975, and diplomats say Malaysia treats those who are allowed to stay on Bidong Island with decency. Mr. Mahathir renewed his complaint that resettlement countries like the United States, Canada and Australia were ''picking and choosing'' the Vietnamese they want, leaving Malaysia with what he has variously called ''the residue'' and ''the scum.''
''Why should Malaysia be the repository of the unwanted of this world?'' he has asked.
But according to the High Commissioner's office and to Western diplomats, the Malaysian expulsions violate an agreement reached in June 1989 between first-asylum countries like Malaysia and resettlement countries. The agreement was reached at a conference in Geneva instigated by Malaysia.
The conference decided that all Vietnamese boat people arriving after a cutoff date - June 16, 1988, in Hong Kong and March 14, 1989, for other Southeast Asian nations - would no longer receive automatic status as refugees, but would be screened to decide who among them were real refugees with a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' and who were economic migrants.
 
Where U.S. Differs
The resettlement countries agreed to take all those who arrived before the cutoff dates and those judged to be refugees. But a disagreement persists over what to do with the economic migrants. Southeast Asian nations, the British, and officials in some other countries think these migrants should be returned to Vietnam, forcibly if necessary, as illegal immigrants. The United States and Vietnam object to forcible repatriation.
In the meantime, the numbers of those screened out are growing, which is a prime reason, diplomats say, that the Malaysians continue to push the new arrivals away - despite an agreement in June that first-asylum countries would in the meantime provide shelter for all who arrive.
The United Nations refugee officials interview Vietnamese who land further south on Galang Island, near Singapore, which belongs to Indonesia. There is no way of knowing how many Vietnamese are lost at sea after being denied asylum in Malaysia, the High Commissioner's office says, but a Western diplomat said that 3 to 10 percent of boat people do not find safe havens and perish in shipwrecks, from starvation or at the hands of pirates.
The Indonesians have sheltered all those pushed off from Malaysia, thus far without complaint, diplomats say. The Thais have also kept the June agreement, the diplomats say, but have been receiving about 1,000 boat people a month for the last three months and are unhappy about it.

HEADLINE: Blocked Funds Put U.S. Role In Seville World Fair in Doubt

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADRID, April 16

 BODY:
As work advances on the new auditoriums, pavilions and stadiums for the Seville World's Fair, Expo '92, Spanish and American officials are concerned that construction may never begin on one of the main attractions: the United States pavilion.
Congress has approved only $2.9 million of the $15 million in seed money needed for the United States to officially guarantee its attendance.
The money has been budgeted for the fiscal year 1990 to contribute to the building of the United States pavilion, and it is hoped that a further $30 million will come from private sponsors. 
Former President Reagan, in a letter to King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, committed the United States to participation in Expo '92, which is to draw 103 countries as well as at least 20 corporate exhibitors. President Bush endorsed Mr. Reagan's commitment.
 
Money Is Frozen
But the rest of the $15 million has been frozen by Representative Neil Smith, Democrat of Iowa, and Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who strongly oppose Federal financing of trade fairs. Mr. Smith and Mr. Hollings are the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees, which allocate the money.
In 1992, Spain will be host not only to Expo '92 as part of celebrations of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to the New World, but also to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The absence of the United States from the first of these events would dampen Spain's celebration of its new self-image as a mainstream European player.
Though several American corporations are planning to take part, Spanish officials are increasingly concerned that the United States Government may not occupy the 90,000-square-foot site allocated to it, the second largest after Spain's.
''We are worried because the United States is a star participant,'' said Emilio Casinello, president of the Expo '92 State Corporation. Referring to the fair's theme, ''The Age of Discovery,'' he added, ''How can the United States stay away from the age of discovery when they are the discoverers and innovators of modern times?''
 
U.S. Officials Anxious, Too
Mr. Casinello said the United States trade deficit could grow if it stayed away from Seville while all its major competitors were represented. American officials are also anxious. ''It would send the wrong signals not just to Europe on the eve of economic unification,'' Marvin Stone, commissioner general of the United States national section at Expo 92, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Stone said that ''at this point it's a possibility'' that the United States might not attend.
But Spanish officials say they are confident that the United States will officially confirm its attendance.
''Every Western country, every member state of the O.E.C.D., every NATO member will be there,'' said Inocencio Arias, Under Secretary General of the Spanish Foreign Ministry. ''The United States cannot afford not to come.''
But he added that if the United States did not show up, ''it's not the end of the world.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Lack of Ads Kills 7 Days Magazine

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
Just two years after it was started with great fanfare, 7 Days magazine has ceased publishing.
In a tense meeting yesterday at the weekly's newly renovated offices in lower Manhattan, the publication's owner, Leonard N. Stern, told the staff that even though 7 Days covered New York City's social and political happenings in a ''stylish and provocative'' way, it could not generate the advertising support it needed to survive.
Some media analysts said the death of 7 Days might mark the beginning of a shakeout among magazines in the New York market aimed at young, trend-setting readers. ''These are the wine coolers of magazines,'' said John Meskil, executive vice president in charge of media at Warwick, Baker & Fiore, a New York advertising agency. ''They've had their moment and now they're becoming passe.'' 
Recently, for example, Spy magazine hired an investment banking firm to seek additional backing. Details, which once covered the trendy New York social scene, is being reintroduced as a men's fashion magazine, and Egg, a new Manhattan lifestyle magazine published by Forbes Inc., received a lukewarm reception.
Media analysts said that this category of magazines is suffering now because it is a marginal buy for advertisers. ''When the economy gets bad, advertisers only use the primary magazines,'' said John Power, a group vice president at Vitt Media International, a media buying and planning service.
Mr. Meskil said that ''young readers are hard to hold on to; they are too busy making a living and having social lives to spend much time reading.''
That is a lesson that Mr. Stern said cost him an estimated $10 million to learn. ''I'm terribly disappointed,'' he said in an interview. ''The costs to bring the magazine to the point of breaking even would have been enormous. It did not make sense on a business basis.''
Just two weeks ago Mr. Stern had begun looking for a buyer for the tabloid-size magazine. But none could be found. ''I didn't get any serious offers,'' said Mr. Stern, the sole owner of the Hartz Mountain Corporation and The Village Voice and a group of regional real estate publications.
''I believed that if we built a superior editorial product, the advertising would come in,'' Mr. Stern said.
But that was not the case. With a circulation of only 75,000, 7 Days was never able to attract large national advertisers, mainly because its readership was too small and because most of its subscriptions were given away, media analysts said. Only about one-third of the circulation for 7 Days went to paid subscribers.
At the same time, the magazine's original base of retail and real estate advertising sharply declined during the last six months.
To make a go of it, Mr. Stern said that 7 Days would have had to increase its readership to about 400,000, about the size of New York magazine. To do so, he added, the magazine would need a broader editorial approach, but a broader approach would include a segment of readers already dominated by New York magazine.
Other options were considered as a way of keeping the magazine alive, he said. At one point, there were discussions about turning 7 Days into a monthly. ''That wasn't viable,'' said David Schneiderman, the president of Stern Publications. ''We would have had to reinvent 7 Days, and that would have been too risky.''
A continually changing identity was one of the magazine's major problems, Mr. Stern said. ''We started out as an uptown Manhattan newspaper, then we evolved in a newspaper-magazine hybrid and finally changed into a magazine,'' he added.
The magazine had been praised for its sometimes wisely irreverent articles about New York's cultural and social scene. And although it came too late to make a difference, after the closing announcement the magazine's staff also learned that 7 Days had been chosen as a finalist for a National Magazine Award for general excellence in the small-magazine category.
''We were just hitting our stride,'' said Adam Moss, the magazine's editor. Readers were immediately captivated by the magazine's media, restaurant and other columns, he said.
The failure of 7 Days has not discouraged Mr. Stern, who plans to start another newspaper either in New York or some other major city. Sooner or later, he said, ''I'll find the key to success.''

Big Growth In Helping The Jobless

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
FEW businesses have grown as fast as outplacement in recent years, with much of that growth related to the rash of corporate mergers and work-force reductions around the country.
Outplacement firms receive a fee from corporations to handle job terminations as humanely as possible. Not to be confused with employment agencies, the firms help individuals who have lost jobs, usually middle- or upper-level managers. The firms provide counseling, office space, a telephone and secretarial help and aid in preparing and printing resumes. 
''January through March was the best quarter we've had,'' William J. Morin, said last week. He is chairman of Drake Beam Morin Inc., the nation's largest outplacement firm, with 47 offices in the United States and 40 internationally. The firm plans to open an office in East Germany in September and is considering opening offices in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
''In 1974, our revenue was under $1 million,'' Mr. Morin said. ''Last year, it was $100 million around the world.''
For the industry as a whole, business is expected to grow another 15 percent this year, to more than $400 million in annual revenues from about $350 million in 1989, said Louis LeHane, president of the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms.
So far this year, Mr. Morin said, there has been a ''steady flow'' of modest layoffs, in contrast to the large but sporadic layoffs in 1986-87. On average, the firm works with about 2,000 individual clients a year in New York and provides group counseling to about 15,000 others.
Mr. Morin, a man who thrives on statistics, said 20 percent of those dismissed decided to retire, especially those near the age at which they can collect pensions and Social Security benefits. Another 20 percent try to become entrepreneurs, with half of those actually going so far as to start their own businesses. But the bulk of those dismissed, 60 percent, seek jobs in the same field of work.
In Mr. Morin's view, finding a job usually is a numbers game, with success depending on how many resumes are mailed and interviews are held, and how much time is spent searching. He says about 60 percent of the firm's clients find jobs through ''networking'' among their acquaintances; another 20 percent find them through employment agencies and executive search firms, and the remaining 20 percent find them through advertisements, mass mailings of resumes and using the firm's computerized listing of jobs at more than 186 client companies.
Drake Beam was among the first to use such job lists, which now help ''4 or 5 percent of our clients find jobs, up from about 1 percent in 1987 shortly after the program began,'' Mr. Morin said. He added that he expects that figure to rise to 25 percent by 1995.
The best fields now for job searchers are marketing and sales, he said.
''Accounting is down or flat; human resources is flat,'' he said. ''Industrial and manufacturing jobs are coming back, and we see a revival in the Rust Belt: Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Detroit. Staff jobs are hard to find, but when found they pay higher salaries than previously.''
A crucial question is how long it will take to find a satisfactory job.
''Half of our people find jobs in 4.2 months, but the average runs around 5 months,'' he said. The time involved varies by region: 4.9 months in the Northeast and 5 in the New York metropolitan area; 4.8 in the Northwest; 5.4 in the Southwest, and 4.6 in the Southeast.
As for the Midwest, ''It is still tough out there,'' Mr. Morin said, estimating the job-hunting time at 5.1 months.
He urged managers to take charge of their careers and not count on staying a lifetime with one company. On average, people change jobs 4.7 times in a lifetime, although Mr. Morin said that several of these job changes came early in a career, while a person was trying to find a niche.
There is talk in the outplacement industry about the need for certification of counselors, and Mr. Morin thinks that should be done through the Association of Outplacement Consulting Firms. ''We favor more professionalism, and we're backing it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Alcoa's Income Fell 46.2% in First Quarter

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The Aluminum Company of America, the nation's largest aluminum producer, reported a 46.2 percent decline in first-quarter earnings yesterday. The company cited an overall slower economy, lower prices and slightly higher costs.
Alcoa said its net income fell to $148.6 million, or $1.69 a share, from $276 million, or $3.12 a share, in the comparable period last year. Sales were up slightly for the quarter, to $2.63 billion, from $2.62 billion in the quarter a year earlier. 
Analysts said the results were generally in line with expectations. They mentioned that demand for many aluminum products had slowed in the first quarter because of slowdowns in the automotive, packaging and construction industries.
''Their costs are among the best in the industry,'' said Peter F. Marcus, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''We expect them to do well relative to the others in the industry, given what has occurred in the economy.''
On the New York Stock Exchange, Alcoa's shares rose 25 cents yesterday, closing at $64.875.
Paul H. O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said management was pleased with the results, given the softness of the economy. He added, ''The deterioration in the economy that began in the third quarter of last year seems to have stopped in the first two months of 1990.'' He said the company's order rates were higher than they had been in recent months.
 
Orders Pick Up
Mr. Marcus said that Alcoa's orders for can sheet aluminum had picked up in recent months, ''with no indication that the company was forced to cut price.''
The Pittsburgh-based company also attributed the lower earnings to lower prices for ingot and aluminum products from its operation in Brazil, Alcoa Aluminio, which accounted for 14 percent of the company's earnings last year. Alcoa, which owns a 65 percent stake in the Brazilian aluminum producer, said that earnings from that operation were at a break-even level; a year earlier it had income of $36 million.
''It is our expectation that earnings from Brazil will be negatively affected throughout the year,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''But we believe the strong measures that are being taken to curb rampant inflation in that country are in the long-term interest of Brazil and our company.''

Verdict On Reagan

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
History is closing in fast on Ronald Reagan. Fifteen months ago he left office in a glow of public affection. Today he is increasingly identified with greed, corruption and conspiracy.
Conspiracy was one of the five felony counts on which a jury convicted his former national security adviser John Poindexter. The jury found that there had been a conspiracy in the Reagan White House to cover up the truth about arms sales to Iran and aid to the Nicaraguan contras. 
Mr. Reagan had denied that there was any such effort to deceive Congress and the public. The jury verdict meant either that his denial was false or that he didn't know what was going on: that he was a liar or a fool.
In a sense the jury verdict was a comment on the failings of the American political process. For it was the political system that should long ago have dealt with Mr. Reagan's performance in the Iran-contra affair.
Consider just one item: the shipment of American Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran in November 1985. The White House and various security agencies were involved in the deal. President Reagan knew about it. He later signed an intelligence finding that said the shipment was expected to lead to the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. (Mr. Poindexter, according to the prosecution, destroyed that document.) When the Iran-contra affair first began to emerge publicly, in November 1986, Mr. Reagan said: ''We have not - I repeat, did not - trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we ever.'' He denied knowing about the 1985 Hawk shipment before it happened.
The political system dealt with those absurd misstatements by treating the President of the United States as ignorant. The Tower Commission used the euphemism of Mr. Reagan's ''management style.'' The Congressional investigating committees, focusing on the diversion of Iranian arms funds to the contras, assumed that the President had not been informed by Mr. Poindexter, Oliver North and others.
With all the polite evasions, it was plain enough that Mr. Reagan had not lived up to the minimum responsibilities of the Presidency. But his amiable style, his hold on the public's affection, made Congress shy away from the impeachment process or any serious political challenge.
The grin and the wave have faded now. The less pleasant realities of the Reagan years are becoming evident to more people.
Greed is one of those realities. In that regard the former President has done himself as much injury as anyone else.
Last fall Mr. Reagan went to Japan for a $2 million fee from a communications conglomerate. To many, including Republicans, it looked distastefully like payment for sympathetic policies in office.
Money rather than service has been the theme of this ex-President. In February he spent an hour at a Florida convention of hamburger franchise operators and collected $60,000.
Then there are the larger economic consequences of Reaganism. For one, the 1980's saw the boom in leveraged buyouts, financed by imposing huge debts on the acquired companies. Now some of those companies are having trouble meeting the debt obligations. And the junk bonds used for the deals are dangerous elements in portfolios. There is a risk of large-scale failure and economic distress.
The leveraged buyout craze was encouraged by Mr. Reagan's exaltation of the market as the final judge of what is good for society, and by his treatment of government as the enemy. His Administration did all it could to weaken Government regulation, by amending laws and appointing spineless regulators.
The most disastrous single result of weakened regulation was the savings and loan spree, which is going to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. Then there is the corruption at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, still unfolding.
The environment is another area hurt badly by Mr. Reagan's assault on Government regulation. A commission that investigated the Alaskan oil spill, for example, said that conditions for the spill were created by the collapse of the oil tanker regulatory system in the 1980's.
Of course there are a good many Americans who are still contented that Ronald Reagan was President. But Warren G. Harding was popular, too. My guess is that history will be not much kinder to Reagan than it has been to Harding. The process of deglamorization has begun.

HEADLINE: Public Housing: For Workers or the Needy?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 16

 BODY:
The growing shortage of affordable shelter for millions of needy people is putting enormous pressure on the nation's already overburdened public housing system and giving a new edge to an old policy debate: who is it that public housing ought to serve?
While advocacy groups and Federal officials urge that the homeless, the disabled and the poorest of the poor be given priority for scarce public housing vacancies, officials of many large urban housing projects are arguing that they need a broader mix of incomes, including more low-income working families, to insure social stability in their developments.
The Chicago Housing Authority is the nation's second largest and one of the most troubled. To encourage working people to remain as residents, officials of the Chicago authority are pushing the Department of Housing and Urban Development for more flexibility in setting rents for those tenants with the highest incomes.
 
'Warehouses for the Poor'
''As it is now, our buildings have become little more than warehouses for the poor,'' said Vincent Lane, the chairman of the Chicago authority, noting that more than 80 percent of the city's 200,000 housing tenants are on welfare. ''More working people in the buildings would enhance diversity and community life, and insure stronger role models to compete with the gangs and drug dealers.'' 
The predicament facing some tenants was described by Pat Perry, a resident of a South Side public housing building, who said her family's rent rose from $65 a month to $742 when she and her husband got jobs and went off welfare. Federal housing rules require tenants to pay 30 percent of their income as rent.
''I like working, but you can see why a lot of people don't want to get jobs,'' said Mrs. Perry, who also serves as a resident manager in her building.
Mrs. Perry said she would stay in her apartment, in part because it is her longtime home and her family is comfortable there. But other working tenants are lured into the private market as their rents soar in the projects. And many tenants who are on welfare see little incentive to join the ranks of the working, because they know 30 percent of their pay will go for rent.
Delores Wilson, a resident of Cabrini-Green, a housing development on the city's North Side plagued with gang warfare and sniper attacks, told of a neighbor who recently moved out when her rent climbed to $900 a month. The rent rose after the woman and her husband both started working.
''It wasn't the shooting and the gangs that pushed them out; it was the rent,'' said Mrs. Wilson, a 61-year-old secretary for the city, who pays $539 a month in rent. Asked why she stayed, she said: ''It's my house. I love my neighbors and I love my building.''
New York, with the nation's largest system, is the exception: most of its public housing residents are families with at least one person working. Many of New York's poorest people are concentrated not in public housing projects but in older, rundown tenement buildings, many of which were taken over by the city after landlords defaulted on their property taxes.
Officials at H.U.D. and in Congress feel they have already addressed the problem of high rents for job-holding tenants by adopting regulations in March 1989 that enable public housing authorities to impose temporary rent ceilings for some tenants.
Under those regulations, rents may be lowered for as many as three years, so tenants would pay as little as the equivalent amount it costs the authority, on an average, to cover the overhead and any other operating costs necessary to maintain apartments of similar size.
Joseph G. Schiff, the special adviser to Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp for public and Indian housing, said about a dozen of the nation's 3,000 housing authorities have so far been granted permission to use the new formula in setting rents. At the same, he noted that Chicago and some other housing authorities had raised objections, arguing that the new rules did not bring rents down enough.
 
Permanent Rent Ceilings Urged
Mr. Lane said the rent ceilings ought to be permanent, rather than temporary. And he said they ought to be pegged to prevailing market rates in the neighborhoods surrounding public housing.
In addition, housing managers in Chicago, St. Paul and other cities complain that that new Federal policies are forcing them to accept former mental patients, including young single males, as tenants in buildings intended mostly for the elderly poor.
Mental hospitals across the country in recent decades released patients who do not need permanent care. But the small group homes that were envisioned for them rarely materialized -leaving them nowhere to go but public housing or the streets.
In Seattle, for example, more than 50 percent of the tenants in some high-rise elderly buildings are now younger people requiring special social services and whose life styles clash with those of older residents, said Harry Thomas, director of the Seattle authority.
''If you focus too much on housing the hard to house in existing public housing complexes, you run the risk of making the whole building, the whole community, fall apart,'' he said.
 
Federal Role Is Reduced
The debate has sharpened as the Federal Government has reduced its role in providing new housing and as the nation's stock of privately owned low-income housing has declined because of gentrification, the demolition of many single-room-occupancy hotels and the conversion of many apartments to condominiums. Meanwhile, the number of low-income households and homeless people has grown.
This has put more pressure on the nation's existing stock of 1.4 million public housing units as housing of last resort, as more and more people crowd waiting lists for the few vacancies that open each year.
Although the demand for public housing units varies greatly from city to city, a survey in 1986 counted 247,500 families on lists waiting for vacancies among 374,150 units in 64 cities. It also counted 32,555 elderly people on lists for 103,203 units for the elderly.
The trend toward giving preference to those least able to care for themselves has won the support of many advocacy groups for the mentally ill, people with disabilities and the infirm.
On the other side are public housing managers and many tenants' organizations that say they are sympathetic with the shelter needs of the very poor and infirm but believe it is unfair to force public housing communities, many of which are already under extreme pressure because of crime and poverty, to take in even more people least able to help themselves.
Their argument is that public housing's role today should be what it was when it was first created 50 years ago: an agent of social change that provides transitional housing for poor people, including the working poor.
Robert McKay, the executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, says he finds it wrenching to be fighting with advocates for the mentally ill or patients with AIDS. ''But it is not right either that public housing is being asked to take in these populations because no place else will,'' he said.
In the middle are officials at H.U.D., where Secretary Kemp has pledged to give tenants a much greater role in managing their own buildings.
Mr. Schiff said he believes public housing is serving ''the appropriate population.'' But he said he also supports the idea of economic integration in public housing.
In fact, a Federal housing act passed by Congress in 1974 specifically authorized tenant selection criteria that would insure that buildings include families with a range of incomes. But recent Federal policy has run in the opposite direction.
A survey of large, urban public housing by the Citizens Housing and Planning Association in Boston found that 70 percent of the households are headed by women and that fewer than 36 percent of the heads of households are employed.
The major exception to this trend is New York City, where more than 72 percent of the city's public housing tenants are employed. Val Coleman, a spokesman for the New York Housing Authority, said the authority has delibrately sought to maintain a mix of different income levels in its buidlings.
''Without economic integration, public housing self-destructs,'' Mr. Coleman said. But he added that recent pressures have forced the authority to accept a greater proportion of the very poor, those with annual incomes of less than $8,000, whenever vacancies occur.
 
New York as a Role Model
Chicago has three times the proportion of welfare recipients as New York, and its aging high-rise buildings are plagued by crime, gangs and drug dealers. ''If we are going to make public housing work in Chicago, we have to begin to move closer to the New York model,'' said Mr. Lane, the Chicago authority's chairman.
George Sternlieb, a professor of urban affairs at Rutgers University, said the debate over housing policy reflected a clash of conflicting values.
''It's a very difficult dilemma,'' he said. ''If you want to preserve these public housing developments as stable communities, the managers need to be able to control the selection and eviction of their tenants. But we also have to find the room to address today's tragedies - the growing numbers of homeless and people without shelter.''
Gordon Cavanagh, a legal adviser to the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities, said public housing was being unfairly asked to absorb ''a whole set of problems that the rest of America refuses to accommodate.''
Part of the problem, he said, is that public housing ''is a stepchild within H.U.D., because its constituencies are poor and have virtually no politicall clout.''
In Congress, public housing is regarded as a drain on the Treasury.
The amount of money H.U.D. pays to subsidize the operating costs of local public housing authorities has increased to nearly $1.9 billion this year from $500 million in 1970. Those higher subsidies reflect in part the growing concentration of poor people in buildings who pay rents that do not cover the cost of building operations.

HEADLINE: 2 Top Dinkins Advisers Form Unlikely Pairing

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
When Mayor David N. Dinkins discusses the New York City budget with his senior advisers, an unlikely pair of portly men is virtually always among them. After the Happy Land Social Club fire, they were at his side for hours. On weekends at Gracie Mansion, at sunset in City Hall, the two are there.
They are Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, and Bill Lynch, the Deputy Mayor for Intergovernmental Affairs, and 15 weeks into the Mayor's term they have emerged to almost no one's surprise as the two people Mr. Dinkins most depends on - Mr. Steisel for operations and Mr. Lynch for politics.
But in an evolution that was by no means as assured, other politicians said, the two potential rivals, steeped in different schools, have developed a steady relationship, comfortably sharing power and the Mayor's confidence. 
''We've occasionally had our differences, a few food fights,'' said Mr. Steisel, whose bravura and flexible face conjure up the curtness of a cabdriver and the comedy of Bert Lahr.
 
'A Lot of Similiarity'
''I think it's working out fine,'' said Mr. Lynch, a bearded owlish figure almost as disheveled as Mr. Dinkins is dapper. ''Although we might approach things differently, there is a lot of similiarity, and I think we read each other's body language well.''
There is no doubt that Mr. Lynch, a longtime aide who managed Mr. Dinkins's campaign, and Mr. Steisel, a former Sanitation Commissioner who had not known Mr. Dinkins well, are keeping long hours. It is harder to measure what they have done, because the new administration has been consumed with making appointments and coping with unexpected revenue shortfalls.
The budget troubles have helped put Mr. Steisel, who leads fiscal strategy, and Mr. Lynch, who is responsible for selling the plan's mix of tax proposals to Albany and the City Council, at the forefront of Mr. Dinkins's inner circle, although both are quick to insist they are part of a team.
The team has other players, including the other three deputy mayors, Barbara J. Fife for planning, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero for economic development and Milton Mollen for public saftey, as well as Mr. Dinkins's senior special adviser, Ken Sunshine. The deputies meet together with Mr. Dinkins a few mornings a week and perhaps on the weekend. So far, their portfolios have not put them as much in the public eye.
 
No 'Calls From Rabbis'
On the other hand, Mr. Lynch is highly visible and accessible. He is likely to begin his day with a stream of calls from concerned constituents - black ministers or Hispanic community groups. And the stream virtually never stops. He ended a recent 12-hour day talking with a group of disabled people.
Mr. Steisel is more likely to focus on a problem in an agency or a snag in the budget. But he takes his share of calls from politicians and civic leaders. He said with a smile, however, ''I don't get calls from rabbis.''
Aides to both men said Mr. Steisel had played a central role in negotiating with the Council on a bill that would force the city to move homeless families out of barracks-style shelters by a fixed date. Mr. Steisel has negotiated because such a deadline would affect the operation of housing programs, and the administration is not sure it could comply.
Mr. Steisel said it was Mr. Lynch who made him realize that finding places to put the families was just the first question and that deciding how best to help them once they were housed was just as important and raised management challenges for Mr. Steisel's staff.
 
'Input on the Substantive Side'
''He convinced me that part of what we do has got to go beyond just moving people around,'' Mr. Steisel said.
Mr. Lynch said that if he was sometimes pegged as the ''people person'' in the administration, ''I have input on the substantive side,'' too.
''They each understand that the job of helping David Dinkins to run the City of New York is so huge,'' Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger said, ''that there's plenty of room for dividing up the responsibility and for using the other person to be helpful. They're both smart and they know how to play good cop, bad cop in different ways.''
Each man professes admiration for qualities in the other.
''He's more touchy-feely than I am, and he's better at it,'' said Mr. Steisel, a chemical engineer by training who as Sanitation Commissioner under Mayor Edward I. Koch built a reputation as a skilled and demanding manager. ''Sometimes I wish I were a little more like that.''
 
Frustrations and Stresses
Mr. Lynch, a former community organizer and employment training expert, said, ''I've learned a lot of things from Norman about city government.'' He said they have a ''similar sense of values'' and dedication to social justice. ''I think there is a side of Norman Steisel that people don't know about.''
Mr. Steisel, who grew up in Brooklyn and is the son of Polish immigrants, said he had more in common with Mr. Lynch than might be obvious. Mr. Lynch grew up on eastern Long Island, the son of a potato farmer and factory worker.
''We understand each other,'' Mr. Steisel said. ''He's a poor farmboy who made good, and I'm a poor baker's son who made good.''
Inevitably, there are some stresses. Aides to Mr. Steisel said he could sometimes be frustrated at how hard it is to reach Mr. Lynch, who talks to so many of the people who want to talk to him that he is perpetually behind in returning phone calls.
Mr. Lynch, in turn, bristles at any suggestion that he may be spread too thin. ''I like to believe that when you're in the people business, you've got to be in touch with people,'' he said. ''I don't think that every deputy mayor has to do that. But I think one of us should.''
Both men said nothing could have prepared them for the range and relentlessness of the decisions they face.
 
Reacting to Developments
''In the Borough President's office, you could almost pick and choose what you would react to,'' said Mr. Lynch, who was Mr. Dinkins's chief of staff in the Manhattan Borough President's office. ''Now it's the whole city, and all the time.''
Mr. Steisel cited a maxim of a predecessor, Nathan Levenathal, who allowed that short-term planning at the top of city government consisted of figuring out how to react to this afternoon's news and long-term planning in deciding how to respond to tomorrow morning's news.
Mr. Dinkins freely acknowledges that he can be a difficult boss, and his relationship with Mr. Lynch and Mr. Steisel is one among professionals, not pals. That in itself helps avert potential rivalries, other aides said.
 
'Businesslike Relationship'
When the Mayor swore in the first of his aides a few minutes after midnight on Jan. 1, he gave Mr. Steisel a warm handshake, not the bear hugs proferred to Mr. Lynch, Mrs. Fife and Ms. Hernandez-Pinero.
But despite Mr. Dinkins's years with Mr. Lynch, a senior aide said, the two have ''an extremely distant impersonal businesslike relationship.''
Explaining his decision to join Mr. Dinkins's team, Mr. Steisel said, ''I was interested in making the system work for the guy who sets the policy.''
Mr. Lynch said, ''I just want to be part of what we're going to do.''

Sony Is Said To Be in Deal For TV Plant

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation is expected to announce today that it will produce television picture tubes in a vacated Volkswagen factory near Pittsburgh.
Officials familiar with the deal said Sony plans at first to employ about 1,000 in the factory, in New Stanton, Pa., southeast of Pittsburgh. 
The Sony plant might also be used to produce high-definition television sets. But standards for such sets have not yet been agreed upon, and the market is still several years away from getting started in the United States. officials said. $300 Million Project Koh Shimizu, a spokesman for Sony, and David Stone, the director of communications for Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, said yesterday that the company and the state were in negotiations but were not ready to make an official announcement.
But a news conference to be attended by Governor Casey and Sony officials is planned for today in Pittsburgh.
Officials described Sony's effort to renovate the factory as a $300 million project that would be assisted by state loans and incentives valued at $23 million.
Volkswagen A.G. shut the plant, which made the Rabbit model, in July 1988, after its business had slumped. The plant employed 5,700 at its peak and 2,500 when it was shut.
Sony already makes television sets and picture tubes in San Diego and has several other big American manufacturing plants for other products. It is doing research on high-definition television in San Jose, Calif.
The prospect that Sony may make high-definition television sets in the United States cheered some analysts. Robert B. Reich, a professor of political economy at Harvard University, said that even if American companies do not make the sets, at least the technological expertise would be in the United States.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Rewriting A Budget (And Its Rules?)

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
The senators and representatives who will begin the thankless task of writing a new Federal budget this week have three basic choices.
They can produce a serious budget with real spending cuts and tax increases that would actually reduce the deficit in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 from more than $100 billion to $64 billion, the figure required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.
They can hoke up some phony numbers like unrealistically large reductions in military spending and an impossible-to-achieve revenue increase and hope that will lead them into serious talks with the White House.
Or they can change the budget-balancing law to make the deficit target this year easier to hit. 
At the moment, the odds favor the third alternative. ''When they can't deal with the deficit, they deal with the process,'' said Stanley E. Collender, a budget specialist at Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
Writing a serious budget is just politically too difficult for the lawmakers. They are under no pressure from either constituents or the financial markets to raise taxes or make deep spending cuts. The November elections are on the horizon. And President Bush holds a veto card that can trump any play by Congress.
''If there is a serious agreement, it will have to be an immaculate conception,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''Neither party can afford to take responsibility for the parentage of something that imposes significant pain on the American people.''
A bill with phony numbers probably could not make it through the House and Senate intact. Nearly all the Republicans would vote against it. Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, would object to a budget crudely slashing the military, even if he knew it was just a bargaining chip. And the Democratic chairmen of the tax committees, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, would oppose a measure that puts the onus on them to raise taxes.
The annual deficit targets set by the budget-balancing law could be changed in the guise of improving budget-making procedures. The first step would be to remove Social Security from the deficit calculations, an action supported by many lawmakers in both parties. That would raise the official deficit figure by $75 billion more, making the current deficit figure impossible to meet. The next step would be to write new annual targets that would show a balanced budget by the late 1990's.
Changing the goals is exactly what Congress and the White House did three years ago, after the stock market collapse, when they could not meet the original targets.
''It's the easiest thing in the world,'' said Mr. Collender. ''You get to vote in favor of a balanced budget six or seven years from now. But you don't have to say right now whose programs will be cut or whose taxes will be increased.''
Whether the President will go along with this ploy is another matter. His budget director, Richard G. Darman, has been hinting for the last month that he would like to sit down with Congress and negotiate a real deficit-cutting budget. Two weeks ago he made a special trip to Capitol Hill to try to mend fences with Senate leaders. But the Democrats who control Congress still do not trust him.
The Democrats believe the budget Mr. Darman submitted last January relied on phony economic assumptions, a wrongheaded proposal to raise revenue by cutting the capital gains tax, and spending cuts that are unpalatable even to members of his own party.
Moreover, they suspect that Mr. Darman, for political reasons, will manipulate the way the savings and loan bailout is accounted for. For example, one way the Administration could reduce the official deficit for next year would be to spend money to take over failed savings institutions this year and collect money by selling them at a discount next year.
Whatever the case, nothing is likely to be decided quickly. Budget matters never are. Mr. Bush submitted his budget to Congress three weeks late. The lawmakers were supposed to have finished writing a budget resolution by April 15, and they are just starting to draft one this week. The last round of this shadowboxing may not end until after November.

HEADLINE: Rising Clamor by Airport Neighbors Brings Gains in Fight Against Noise

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
Neighbors of airports around the country, whose complaints were once often shunted aside by government officials and the airlines, are enjoying increasing success in their battle against aircraft noise.
In Seattle, communities near the airport earlier this month reached an agreement with airlines, pilots and the Federal Aviation Administration to cut noise in half by 2001; it is thought to be the first time that airport neighbors participated in drafting such a plan from the outset.
In northern New Jersey, where more than 1,000 flights a day pass over neighborhoods that hardly saw a plane four years ago, residents from 208 communities have banded together in what may be the largest display of opposition to aircraft noise. They have persuaded the F.A.A. to alter some flight paths over the region and have joined with their members of Congress to fight for more changes on Capitol Hill.
In Dallas, opposition to two new runways has been so potent that officials at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport are considering buying from homeowners the rights to fly over their neighborhoods. 
 
Gains in Noise Controls
In other areas, communities have won stricter flight curfews and bans on takeoffs and landings of noisier jets. They have also stalled airport expansions and discouraged construction of new airports. More than 300 airports now have some type of curfew or other noise control, compared with only a few dozen two decades ago.
But the victories are coming at a time when flight delays are on the rise and Federal officials agree with frustrated travelers that more runways and additional flight paths are desperately needed to ease congestion. Industry experts say the biggest obstacle to expanding the nation's air transportation system is not the cost but the opposition to aircraft noise, as well as to other environmental concerns like increased vehicle traffic.
Further, pilots say some of the noise controls compromise safety. At some airports, pilots are required to reduce engine power after takeoff.
The airlines complain that the growing number of curfews and other restrictions across the country also create a scheduling nightmare. They are calling for national noise standards that would override those limits.
In a draft version of his national transportation policy, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner had included a provision for such national noise standards. But under pressure from communities and the Office of Management and Budget, which was concerned about the lawsuits on noise that the Government might face, Mr. Skinner retreated and simply acknowledged that the issue was a serious one.
 
Community Pressure on Rules
The communities insist on setting their own standards, contending that they must live with the noise. ''We go 17 or 18 hours at a stretch with airplanes overhead,'' said Shirley Gazsi, a resident of Cranford, N.J., who is a spokeswoman for the Coalition Against Aircraft Noise, a group objecting to a re-routing of planes over the area. ''My windows rattle terribly; I can't hear the stereo or watch TV. Even speaking on the phone is difficult.''
The community groups have been successful in part because they are now displaying some of the political influence of other environmental groups. They are hiring Washington law firms and commissioning sophisticated lobbying campaigns.
The fury comes at a time when the airlines are phasing in quieter planes, and according to the F.A.A. fewer than half as many people are exposed to significant aircraft noise as in the 1970's.
''It's part of the whole environmental movement,'' said John Wesler, a noise expert with Wyle Laboratories, a consulting firm. ''People's expectations have changed.''
But many groups, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, say the F.A.A. drastically underestimates the problem because of the way it calculates noise levels. It averages noise over 24 hours, with noise at night weighed more heavily.
Critics say such averages mean little. ''Four hours of jet noise and 20 hours of quiet is still four hours of jet noise,'' said Patrick Russell, a lawyer representing the residents in northern New Jersey.
 
Impact on the Pilots
Under pressure from neighbors, some airports have agreed to require pilots to use lower power after takeoff and to steer planes over more sparsely populated areas. At John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif., which has the toughest noise restrictions in the country, most airlines require that pilots be trained to carry out the special maneuvers needed.
''It's getting downright dangerous'' at John Wayne Airport, said Richard Deeds, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association's Noise Abatement Committee.
Other airports, including ones at Washington, Boston and Long Beach, Calif., have imposed nighttime curfews on all but the quietest jets, which include new models like the Boeing 757 and 767 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-80. John Wayne Airport and the airport at Burbank, Calif., have even banned noisier planes.
Groups of airport operators are urging a nationwide ban of noisier jets, which include older versions of the Boeing 727 and 747, by the end of the decade.
But the airlines argue that with order backlogs for new planes reaching four or five years, they cannot get the new planes quickly enough. About 55 percent of the jets flying in this country are still the louder planes.
The agreement reached in Seattle, which must still be approved by the city's Port Commission, establishes a steadily shrinking ''noise budget'' for the airlines. Under the plan, an airline must meet a cap on total noise - deciding between fewer flights using noisy planes and more using quieter planes.
 
Protests at Rerouting
Residents of northern New Jersey have been battling the Government since 1987, when the aviation agency rerouted planes flying into the New York area to reduce flight delays. The residents, who also complain that the residue from jet fuel stains their homes, want the aviation agency to roll back the plan.
The group complains that the Government had no environmental assessment before carrying out the plan. The F.A.A. said such a study was not required because the rerouting involved planes flying miles from an airport and at altitudes above 3,000 feet. ''We never anticipated the change would have this effect,'' said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the agency. Indeed, some of the people complaining about the noise live as far as 40 miles from Newark International, the nearest major airport.
The agency has since changed some of the flight paths to Newark International but rejected the group's request that it reroute planes over the ocean, saying such a move would be unsafe and too costly.
''The economic side of this far outweighs the inconvenience of someone out in the rolling hills who hears a distant roar,'' said one F.A.A. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''It's not like we're pumping toxic waste into a stream.''
Airport officials in Dallas, who are trying to build two new runways, are considering unusual means of overcoming opposition, including not only paying nearby residents for the right to fly over their homes but also guaranteeing the property value of people affected by the new runways, said Dana Ryan, senior planner for the airport.
Given such battles, ''airports are reluctant to roll out plans for expansion because they know about this kind of opposition,'' said E. Tazewell Ellett, a Washington lawyer and former chief counsel for the aviation agency.
Only one major airport - in Denver - is to be built this decade. Local officials were able to overcome environmental objections to that airport, which will be the world's largest when it is completed in 1993, by buying land for a buffer zone around it.
Eliot Cutler, a Washington lawyer who represents communities in such cases and whose firm has grown to 20 lawyers from four a few years ago, said better land planning was a good solution. ''This obsession with new runways is wrongheaded,'' he said. ''The solution is to build new airports where we can accommodate them.''

HEADLINE: Meditators and Money Find Home in Heartland

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Iowa, April 16

 BODY:
In the quiet of the early morning, the trek to the golden dome begins. One by one the business executives and owners arrive, ready to start their day - by sitting in silence.
All are successful entrepreneurs. And all are meditators. Thousands of people have flocked to this small city in southeastern Iowa, home of Maharishi International University, to study, share a style of living and build their own businesses. And they have brought with them prosperity and growth. 
''It is a remarkable community,'' said Daniel Dittemore, head of the Iowa Product Development Corporation, a state-sponsored seed capital investment program. ''They have an uncommon appetite and knack for entrepreneurship.''
 
A Variety of Businesses
In the last several years, scores of transcendental meditators have moved their companies to Fairfield or begun new ones here. There is an ice cream maker who sells to stores in New York, Chicago and other cities, a chimney sweep supplier with thousands of customers, and a studio owner who photographs many of the country's major marathons. Others are engineers, lawyers, insurance agents or computer experts.
''There's a remarkable population of technologically oriented companies out of all proportion of what you'd expect to find in a community that size,'' Mr. Dittemore said.
Gov. Terry E. Branstad has called Fairfield, a city of 11,000 people, one of Iowa's economic ''superstars.''
The local Chamber of Commerce does not track the number of companies run or owned by meditators, but some in the community say that such companies employ about 1,000 people. More than 50 do business nationally or overseas.
 
'A Lot of Job Opportunities'
''We've put a lot of energy into this town, a lot of money, a lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities,'' said John Narducci, president of Chappell Studio-Marathon Foto, which photographs marathons.
But Mike Brouwer, executive vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, said that even though meditators contribute to Fairfield's successs they are not the prime movers.
''I'm not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this community,'' he said. ''Some have been here over 100 years.''
Still, Mr. Brouwer credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to support themselves.
Some come because of the university, which was founded by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Indian guru who once dazzled the Beatles and other celebrities. Others come because ''the benefits seem to grow when you're meditating with other people,'' said Patty Schneider, the university's public affairs chief.
 
The Maharishi Effect
Transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large numbers, they create the Maharishi Effect, a positive influence on events ranging from global conflicts to traffic deaths.
Each morning and afternoon the meditators, segregated by sex to avoid distractions, practice their technique in the Golden Domes of Pure Knowledge. Estimates of meditators range from 2,000 to 3,000; many attend or work at the university, which moved from California in 1974 into the campus of defunct Parsons College and has a full-time enrollment of 799. Meditators also run their own elementary and high schools.
Meditators work side-by-side with nonmeditators in businesses and the City Council. But ''there's still the dividing line between those people and some people in the community,'' said Royse Huff, president of the Fairfield Economic Development Association.
There are, for example, jokes about yogic flying competitions, which prompted one enterprising company years ago to sell cushions to soften levitation landings.
 
'A Stronger Acceptance' Now
But Mayor Bob Rasmussen said attitudes have changed since the early days, when some townspeople wondered if the meditators were a cult. ''There's certainly a stronger acceptance, less divisiveness,'' he said. ''They've integrated much better. We respect each other and get along.''
Some problems remain. Mr. Huff, for example, said there had been a ''tremendous turnover'' of businesses owned by meditators.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Value of a USX Spinoff Is Disputed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GARY, Ind.

 BODY:
The USX Corporation's sprawling plant along the shore of Lake Michigan here is the foundation of what many consider to be among the most efficient steel operations in the United States.
Yet some analysts say the nation's largest steel producer would have difficulty continuing to outperform the industry as an independent company, spun off from USX as proposed by Carl C. Icahn, its largest shareholder. They also doubt that a spinoff would make each existing USX share worth $48 - 40 percent more than the current price - as Mr. Icahn stated in proxy material sent to shareholders early in April.
''If the value of the company were $48 with a spinoff of steel, the stock price would reflect a value closer to that,'' said Jeffrey Miller, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
 
Shareholder Vote Set
Shareholders will vote at the company's annual meeting on May 7 whether to spin off at least 80 percent of the steel business into a separate company called the U.S. Steel Corporation, the name used by USX for 85 years until 1986. Under Mr. Icahn's plan, each existing USX share would be replaced with two types of shares - one representing the steel company and the other an energy company composed of USX's large oil and gas holdings. Management would be under no obligation to carry out the plan if it was approved. 
Mr. Icahn, who urged management to put his proposal to a vote in lieu of his waging a proxy fight, is eager to rid USX of the steel business, which accounts for one-third of the company's sales and earnings. During a down cycle, he argues, the lagging steel unit could weaken the earnings of the energy subsidiary.
He believes the market would value a pure energy and a pure steel stock higher than it now does a hybrid USX, which he contends is trading at less than its fair value because few analysts understand the intricacies of both businesses.
Mr. Icahn has valued a separate steel company at $9 a share and the energy company at $39 a share. [Shares of USX closed on the New York Stock Exchange Monday at $34.50 each, up 37.5 cents.] But some analysts believe the stock is already overvalued, run up by the presence of Mr. Icahn, who owns 13.3 percent of USX. And most say the value and virtue of spinning off the steel group depend on how certain issues regarding taxes and retiree benefits are resolved.
Other analysts agree that steel should be sold, but question the timing of a sale. They say the unit would bring a higher price if the steel market were healthier. Some believe that Charles A. Corry, chairman and chief executive of Pittsburgh-based USX, opposes Mr. Icahn's proposal because he would rather sell steel when the market improves.
While shareholders are expected to defeat the spinoff proposal by voting with management, as they usually do in these situations, Mr. Icahn could get support from some institutional investors. Like Mr. Icahn, some of these investors are irritated that USX's stock has risen only 8.4 percent in the last 15 years, lagging behind the 308 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index during the same period.
They contend that a restructuring undertaken by USX in 1987, after Mr. Icahn proposed taking over the company, was not radical enough, and welcome his latest threat as a much-needed catalyst for change. Under the restructuring, which management promised would raise the value of the stock, the company repurchased shares and placed its faltering Texas Oil and Gas unit up for sale. That unit is still unsold.
 
Earnings Improve
But management argues that the company is healthier than it has been in years. It earned $965 million last year on sales of $18.7 billion, up from net income of $756 million on sales of $16.8 billion in 1988.
Also, since Mr. Icahn began to invest in USX three years ago, the company's stock price has increased 66 percent, compared with the 37 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 during that period.
And the oil and gas business, entered into in 1982 with the purchase of the Marathon Oil Company to protect against the cyclicality of the steel sector, now accounts for nearly two-thirds of USX's sales and earnings, up from 58 percent in 1988.
Operating earnings of Marathon, the centerpiece of USX's energy holdings, have climbed significantly since 1987, to $862 million last year. They should continue to grow with the anticipated improvement in oil production and demand, analysts said.
''Marathon is a valuable energy company with significant growth potential,'' said Rolf Wagner, an analyst at Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond. ''If the steel business were separated, none of that would change.''
The steel business has also staged a turnaround. After losing more than $2 billion during the four-year industry slump that began in 1983, the company became profitable in 1987 -helped by widespread layoffs, new equipment, improved demand and Federal restrictions on imported steel. It earned $432 million in 1989.
 
Evidence of Revival
Here in Gary, it now takes only 3.5 hours of labor to produce a ton of steel, down from 10 hours 10 years ago and significantly less than the domestic industry average of 6.6 hours. USX has pruned its work force to about 20,000 people, from 75,000 a decade ago. And by next year, Gary's output will be produced entirely by continuous casters, the equipment that casts steel far more efficiently than the old method, in which ingots were used. Now, more than 60 percent is continuously casted.
But management calculates that operating the steel group as a stand-alone company could cost an additional $100 million to $200 million a year. Without the energy assets, analysts said, the steel company would have more difficulty raising the equity and debt capital it needs to keep pace in technology and modernization. It likely would also be saddled with more than $1.5 billion in debt at a time when steel earnings are expected to fall.
Management is also concerned about losing $900 million in tax-loss carry-forwards. In the proxy materials, Mr. Icahn said USX's tax carry-forwards could be used up by the end of this year, before the spinoff.
 
Question of Pensions
But Mr. Icahn did not address several other concerns, such as how the steel company could cover its enormous retiree and medical benefits. Last year alone, the company paid $972 million in pension benefits.
''It may be necessary for USX to create a trust fund, or to make a commitment to fund retiree benefits beyond the time of a steel spinoff,'' said John C. Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''That would have some impact on the results for the energy segment's performance.''
What is more, while issuing stock in the entity would invite an acquisition, top management and analysts say the steel business might be worth more in the second half of this year, or in 1991, when auto demand is expected to pick up and the steel market, which began to soften in the last quarter, bounces back.
Based on their longstanding interest in the United States steel industry, Japanese steel companies are among the most likely acquirers, according to analysts. Japanese steel companies have ownership stakes or joint ventures with all of the large, integrated steel producers in the United States, including USX.
USX officials say that Japanese companies have expressed interest in acquiring the company's huge plant here. But Mr. Corry has opposed a piecemeal divestiture.
 
Interest From Europe
Company officials say there is also growing interest from steel companies in Europe. That was underscored last month when the LTV Corporation, the nation's third-largest steel producer, said it was talking about a possible sale of part of its steel unit to Groupe Usinor-Sacilor, the giant French steel company.
Hans Mueller, an industry consultant and professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University, in Murfreesboro, Tenn., said candidates for a purchase or joint venture include Thyssen Stahl A.G., the large West German steel company, and British Steel P.L.C.
However, several European steel officials say that the smaller, specialty steel companies in the United States are more likely targets than companies like USX, because their margins are higher. ''It seems that an investment in a large, integrated steel producer in the United States is not the best way to make money,'' said Heinz Kriwet, chairman of Thyssen.
Still, some foreign steel companies say that USX's mill here would be a significant foothold in the United States market. ''The Gary facility,'' said a senior official at another West German steel company, ''is now something to look at seriously, considering the activity of Carl Icahn.''

Talkative Policy Is Aiding P.&G.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
THE stock price of the Procter & Gamble Company, which has taken a beating in recent months, has made a strong recovery in the last few weeks.
Shares of the consumer-products giant rose 50 cents yesterday, to $71.25 a share, a new 52-week high and up from about $67 in late March.
P.&G., known for consumer products like Ivory soap and Pampers diapers, has long been derided by many people on Wall Street for being slow, parochial and secretive. Among some analysts, P.&G.'s nickname is the Kremlin. 
But now Procter & Gamble may at last be getting respect from investors.
In part, that is because P.&G. has a consistent record of turning in earnings that are better than analysts expected. That has been the case in at least six of the last eight quarters, by the count of Jay H. Freedman, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody.
Still, the stock action, on the face of it, is somewhat puzzling. P.&G., which has more than 80 brand names and annual revenue exceeding $21 billion, reported no developments that would account for the recent increase. Company spokesmen in Cincinnati routinely decline to comment on stock fluctuations.
P.&G. is not the only stock in its sector showing gains. Institutional investors in a cautious mood often seek the shelter of ''recession-proof'' packaged-goods companies in the belief that consumers will always shave with Gillette razors, guzzle Coca-Cola and munch Sara Lee cakes.
But P.&G. is different because of its Kremlin reputation. ''There have been a lot of people who just did not believe in P.&G.,'' said William K. Newbury, an analyst at College Retirement Equities Fund, an $80 billion pension fund that is one of P.&G.'s largest holders. In the mid-1980's, sales were strong but earnings were spotty. ''P.&G. had been a disappointment to investors,'' he said.
The company's reluctance to talk to analysts made matters worse. ''Imagine, one of the premier marketing companies in America couldn't market itself,'' said Lynne R. Hyman, an analyst with First Boston.
But, just as with the one in Moscow, the Kremlin at P.&G. has been undergoing revolutionary change. P.&G. has strengthened its international business through acquisitions. Overseas business provided about a third of revenue and profits last year, but by 1995 it is expected to account for more than half of revenue and more than 40 percent of earnings, Mr. Freedman said. Much of that business is in Europe, and P.&G. should benefit from the opening up of Eastern Europe.
The international operations have a friend in Edwin L. Artzt, who became the company's chairman in January. He once headed foreign operations and was responsible for much of the company's international growth.
Mr. Artzt has also been showing unexpected vigor in cutting costs, something P.&G. has been slow to do in the past, analysts say. As a result, several analysts have upgraded the stock from ''moderately attractive'' to ''buy.''
Most revolutionary of all, at least to analysts, P.&G. is slightly less secretive than before. It has just sent out invitations to analysts for a May 21 meeting with management, the first such gathering in eight years. That last meeting occurred when Mr. Artzt's predecessor, John Smale, became chairman.
''That is really the last time we heard from Smale,'' Ms. Hyman said. ''He was afraid that he'd say something at a meeting and the stock would go down.''
But the hopes aroused by such changes and P.&G.'s habit of outperforming expectations may have set the stock up for the tumble it took early this year.
Anticipating a good second-quarter report in late January, analysts reviewed their earnings projections. ''Even the dumbest of us started taking notice and jacking up our estimates,'' Ms. Hyman said. ''I jacked up mine from $1.18 a share to $1.25. Nobody wanted to be caught short again.'' P.&G., in the new spirit of openness, answered analysts' inquiries, confirmed that business was encouraging, but cautioned them that nothing had really changed to support revised forecasts.
Many analysts were projecting quarterly operating profit of $1.20 to $1.25 a share, an increase of 31 percent to 36 percent. But some were projecting numbers as high as $1.30 or more and saying so to big institutional investors. The stock price rose in the weeks before the earnings report.
The upshot: On Jan. 25, when P.&G. reported $1.22 a share, an increase of 33 percent, Wall Street was ''disappointed.'' Share prices tumbled $3.50 that day on volume of more than 1.6 million shares.
Will P.&G. tumble again when it reports third-quarter earnings on April 25? Some analysts say no, because earnings projections are more conservative now, with most putting operating earnings at $1.05 a share, an increase of 20 percent or so.
Others are not so sure. ''P.&G. seems to be falling into this pattern,'' Mr. Newbury said. ''And there is that old saying, 'Buy on the rumor and sell on the news.' ''

HEADLINE: Ancient Find, But How Ancient?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: SAO RAIMUNDO NONATO, Brazil

 BODY:
STANDING in the hollow of a 135-foot high rock shelter, Fabio Parenti painted a mental picture of hunters at the same spot thousands of years ago, surveying the valley floor below for game.
Near a spring, the Italian archeologist used his machete to draw aside bushes covering sandstone paintings that depicted an ancient menu: antelope, deer and armadillo.
Where Mr. Parenti usually sparks controversy is with his next contention: that ancient man hunted animals, built cookfires and bedded down in this rock shelter 47,000 years ago, at the time Neanderthal man inhabited Europe.
That claim has rocked the prevailing wisdom, which holds that the first Americans inhabited the Western Hemisphere 12,000 years ago. Although many archeologists are coming to believe that the date of the first human habitation may be earlier than that, Mr. Parenti's proposed date is so astonishingly early that it has been greeted with skepticism by mainstream American archeologists. Many doubt, in particular, that Mr. Parenti and his colleague, Niede Guidon, have accurately dated the geologic layers as they dug into dirt at the foot of this cliff wall, producing a series of increasingly older sites they say show signs of being inhabited. 
Criticisms of their findings by other archeologists were systematically rebutted by Mr. Parenti one recent morning as the calls of birds echoed against the soaring rockface, formally called Pedra Furada. Mr. Parenti, who is a doctoral student at an Italian university, removed his straw hat, wiped his brow from the 100-degree heat and recounted what a decade of research had found.
Between two 16-foot-deep trenches, a block of undisturbed soil illustrated descending layers of sedimentation from the present era to 55,000 years ago.
Judging from paint drops found on loose rocks, the archeologists estimate that the wall paintings were made as long ago as 10,000 B.C.
''These are deer, here is a jaguar, these men are probably hunters,'' the bearded archeologist said, studying a series of stick figures scrawled on stone.
 
Stones Arranged for Hearths
As far down as the 12,000-year level, Dr. Guidon found stones arranged in semi-circular hearths filled with charcoal and surrounded by flint artifacts.
The nearest source of flint is almost a mile away, indicating that the inhabitants quarried the flint to make knives, scrapers and choppers.
American archeology generally accepts the earliest dating of human habitation in the Americas to be provided by 11,500-year-old stone projectile points found in the 1920's near the town of Clovis, N.M., and later identified in sites throughout North America.
Here, digging below the 12,000-year level, the team continued to find charcoal and burned rocks arranged in hearths. Using two dating methods, radiocarbon or thermoluminescence, researchers dated 21 samples from 14,300 years ago to 47,000 years ago. In an unbroken sequence, the deeper the samples were found, the older the dates became.
 
Critics Point to Forest Fires
Academic skeptics have speculated that the charcoal samples were produced by ancient forest fires.
''Forest fires, sure - but do forest fires place rocks in circles?'' responded Mr. Parenti.
Skeptics have also speculated that rain, water runoff from the cliff or flooding from the valley disturbed sediments, mixing ancient charcoal with modern charcoal.
Mr. Parenti replied that the cliff's concave face protects the excavated area from direct rainfall, that runoff flows through two water chutes flanking the site and that nearby sample trenches show no evidence of floods in the area in the last 50,000 years.
Critics also charge that the 1,000 quartzite rocks believed to be crude tools from before 10,000 B.C. are actually rocks that fell from the top of the cliff.
 
Throwing Stones From Cliff
In response, Mr. Parenti said that he studied quartzite rocks, dropping hundreds off the cliff to study the natural fracturing processes.
''In nature, it is highly improbable that a rock will be repeatedly chipped on one end to form a blade,'' he said. ''I am certain that 200 to 300 are real artifacts.''
The Italian said that American archeologists were used to looking for defined arrow heads. European archeologists, he said, have more experience recognizing the primitive tools customarily found at prehistoric sites in Europe.
Foreseeing another criticism, Mr. Parenti said that the acidity of the sandstone soil has precluded finding human or animal bones older than 10,000 years. This year, excavation is to start in a limestone cave where soil conditions are suitable for preserving bone fragments.
The center of this growing debate over the first Americans is a remote and rugged range of cliffs and canyons reminiscent of the American West. Lying five hundred miles from the sea and a five-hour drive from the nearest airport, Sao Raimundo Nonato is lost in the dry northeastern backlands of Piaui state, an area often described in Brazilian novels as ''the end of the world.''
 
Threat From Quarries Averted
Here a trove of ancient rock paintings and engravings lay forgotten until the early 1960's when Dr. Guidon first ventured into this wilderness on a donkey.
In 1970, Dr. Guidon started a systematic survey of the ancient rock art. She has catalogued 310 prehistoric sites containing hundreds of engravings and about 10,000 rock paintings of red ochre.
But, at the same time as archeologists became interested in the rock art, economic development reached the area, leading to quarrying of limestone, which now threatens prehistoric sites here and in the Brazilian states of Goias and Rio Grande do Norte.
''Some paintings have been transformed into lime,'' Mr. Parenti said of this area.
Racing against the spreading quarries, Dr. Guidon managed to have 170 of the sites protected in a new, 320,000-acre national park, Serra da Capivara. In a rare arrangement for Brazil, the federal government delegated the administration of the park to Dr. Guidon's new Museum of the American Man Foundation.
With the most important sites safe, the archeologists returned to their digging.
In rural Brazil, laborers can be hired for $2 a day. With a cheap, skilled work force, Mr. Parenti said that he and Dr. Guidon were able to perform the kind of large, exhaustive excavation that is prohibitively expensive in Europe and the United States.
 
'This Is Hot Stuff'
Until the dig was suspended last year, a 15-man team dug for a decade, sifting through 3,300 cubic meters of soil at the base of the cliff here. About 7,000 rocks, many of them artifacts, were catalogued.
The Brazilian findings have set off sharp debate among archeologists. ''This is hot stuff - this will change our understanding of the peopling of the Americas,'' Robson Bonnichsen, the director of the Center for the Study of the First Americans at the University of Maine, said in a telephone interview.
''The Brazilian work is at the top of our list for studying the peopling of the Americas,'' added Mr. Bonnichsen, who is virtually the only American archeologist to have visited this isolated site.
But from a different quarter, Tom D. Dillehay, an archeologist at the University of Kentucky, who is digging at an ancient site in Chile, said in a telephone interview, ''Everybody has pretty much deep-sixed Guidon's work.''
Archeologsts on both sides of the argument agree that much of the dispute stems from a lack of communication.
Dr. Guidon, an archeologist at the Institute of Advanced Social Science Studies in Paris, has reported most of her findings in French. News reports from this desolate spot have been rare and written in French or Portuguese.
''Most of the arguments have been made by people who have never visited the site,'' said Dr. Bonnichsen. ''We are trying to arrange to get some eminent American scholars down there to study the methods and the results.''
Next year Mr. Bonnichsen plans to lead the first American excavation here. With at least 150 sites available for excavation, the American archeologist said he believed that further work will either prove or disprove the theory that man walked these canyons nearly 500 centuries ago.

'New Harvest, Old Shame,' About Farm Workers

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
In the 30 years since Edward R. Murrow's powerful report ''Harvest of Shame,'' the safety and welfare of America's migrant workers have been improved by Federal legislation and union bargaining. Nevertheless, as tonight's strong documentary, ''New Harvest, Old Shame,'' shows, for the 800,000 farm workers who follow the crops north each spring, it's still mighty hard traveling. The latest offering from ''Frontline'' can be seen at 10 on Channel 13.
Dave Marash, tonight's correspondent, joins a family in Indiana as it prepares for the September trip back to Florida. Pedro Silva, 40 years old and the family head, was already working in the fields when the Murrow documentary appeared. It has been a tough year for his 15-member family, ages 9 to 62. The tomato crop suffered from too much rain, and at 35 cents a bucket, the Silvas are ending their six-week picking season with only $1,400. 
By the time they arrive at what serves as their home in the Everglades Migrant Camp, truck breakdowns and illness along the way have put them in debt. Their plans to stop off for some picking in South Carolina were destroyed by Hurricane Hugo, and the crops in Florida have been killed by a freeze.
In interviews with union organizers, farmers, officials and community workers, Mr. Marash finds that big growers are still enjoying an oversupply of labor. In Florida, he notes, there are three farm workers for every available job, and Americans like the Silvas are losing out to people from poor countries who are willing to work for less. A woman who has been hiring migrants for generations tells how the black Americans who did the picking 30 years ago were replaced first by Mexicans and Salvadorans and more recently by Guatemalans and Haitians, many of them illegal aliens.
In a particularly painful passage, Mr. Silva directs his anger not at the growers or at the authorities who set the minimum picking wage, but at the newcomers. ''It's killing us,'' he says. ''They're running us out of there. Those Guatemalans, they say, 'If you pay him $3.35 an hour, you can pay me $3 an hour.' '' Marshall Barry, a professor at Florida International University who has made a study of the state's agricultural economy, directs responsibility elsewhere: ''Employers will lower the wages and then if you refuse to accept those wages, they'll hire a man who's hungry or someone who desperately needs work.''
The farmers, lobbyists and officials interviewed seem bland and evasive compared with the workers and union organizers. That may be a tribute to the editing skills of the program's producers, but the evidence appears to support the case that despite the recent reform of the immigration law, illegal aliens continue to pour into the United States, where, with the cooperation of growers, they depress wages. Mr. Marash draws attention to the power of big farm interests in states like Florida as well as in Washington, D.C., to create loopholes in the law and discourage strict enforcement. As a rural organizer observes, ''Farm workers are not anyone's constituency in Congress.''
The income of Florida's farm workers, Professor Barry reports, buys less than half the goods it did in 1967. Moreover, the great majority of workers have no health insurance, no sick days, no paid vacations, no pensions. Their children, constantly on the move, are unlikely to complete the schooling that might break the migrant cycle. ''This ain't no life really,'' says Pedro Silva.
 
A LIFE OF INDIGNITIES - NEW HARVEST, OLD SHAME, a ''Frontline'' report, written by Hector Galan and Dave Marash; produced by Mr. Galan for PBS; David Fanning, executive producer; Mr. Marash, correspondent; Judy Woodruff, anchor. Tonight at 10 P.M. on Channel 13.

A Benefit Performance by and for Students

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
The Emergency Fund for Student Dancers, which presented its first benefit program on Friday night at the Merce Cunningham Studio, was devised by administrators from five leading New York City dance schools in response to the slaying last year of a dance student in Manhattan. Four or five benefits a year are to be presented, to build a fund that will lend money to students from other countries and other parts of the United States to meet financial crises.
The participating schools - the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center, Laban-Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies, Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance, Merce Cunningham Studios and Nikolais and Louis Dance Lab - could not have put together a better opening program. There was not a dull, unsophisticated or unimaginative spot in the dances choreographed, staged and performed by students from 13 countries, representing 4 of the studios. This unself-conscious, professional format could become one of the city's best showcases for new dance talent. 
Ben Geboe, an American Indian studying at the Graham school, opened the program with ''Tokahe's Medicine Song,'' set to music by Mr. Geboe and George Zaks. Based on a Sioux legend, the solo was a provocative and eloquent blend of Indian dance and Graham technique. ''Path Winding Through Tall Grass,'' choreographed by Wendy S. Turner, an American Graham student, was a dance for six women, set to Debussy, that succeeded completely on its own lyrical, simple terms. ''Untitled,'' a solo choreographed and performed in silence by Sioned Huws, a Welsh student at Cunningham, served as a quietly powerful display for Ms. Huws's fiercely uncompromising, mysterious presence.
''Sol,'' a dance set to music by Strafe fur Rebellion and choreographed by Gabriela Simon and Tanja Meding - Cunningham students from Argentina and West Germany, respectively - looked like lithe and nuzzling play for animals. It was performed by Ms. Simon, Ms. Meding and Bruce Jones, all dressed in tights and T-shirts with stylish patterns drawn on them. Bruno Sajous, a French student at the Nikolais and Louis Lab, choreographed and danced an expressionistic solo called ''Moment Donne,'' set to Schubert, that was a powerfully weighted and capricious dance for a show-stopping performer.
''Poem for Brenda,'' choreographed by Camille Brown, an American Graham dancer, was a simple, potent journey for Brenda Baden-Semper, a performer of iridescent intensity from Trinidad and Tobago. The piece was danced to music by Nakai with a text written and spoken by Ms. Brown.
Mr. Sajous returned in ''Polar Synthesis,'' a starkly dramatic duet set to music by Peter Gabriel and created and performed with Andrea Didisheim, an American student at Nikolais and Louis who moves with a dragonfly's lightness. ''The Memorial,'' a solo set to music by Minoru Miko and choreographed and performed by Reiko Uemura, a Japanese student at Graham, offered a look at a performer of special delicacy and dramatic intensity.
A solo from Murray Louis's ''Deja Vu'' was the evening's only dance by a well-known professional. Jim Xing, a young Chinese dancer from Nikolais and Louis, made the solo his own, dancing it with an extraordinary deftness, modulation and dramatic shading. His profoundly moving performance was a highlight of the evening.
The program closed with ''Tinig Ng Lupa,'' a charged ritual for 14 dancers from the Ailey School and the Ailey second company, led by Takeshi Yazaki, Cynthia Prim and the electric Guillermo Asca. Choreographed by Max Luna 3d, an Ailey teacher from the Philippines, to music by Ryan Kayabyab and Rick Mascarinas, the dance would have been even more powerful with a little editing.

HEADLINE: Farm Policies Called Wasteful

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, April 16

 BODY:
Farm subsidies and import barriers cost the world's richest nations $72 billion a year in lost income, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reports.
Agricultural policies waste resources by overstimulating output in farming and food processing and pushing up land and consumer food prices, the study by the research group said. It concludes that eliminating all farm supports in the 17 large nations reviewed in the study would increase income in O.E.C.D. households by almost 1 percent.
The study focuses on agricultural policies in Australia, Canada, the European Community, Japan, New Zealand and the United States, the dominant nations in the 24-member O.E.C.D.
Although eliminating farm supports would hurt farming in North America, Japan and the European Community, the study said, it would reduce food prices by 1.6 percent and knock down land prices by 40 percent.

HEADLINE: Companies' Anti-Union Tack In Strikes Is Blocked by Court

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The Supreme Court today strengthened labor unions' hand in strikes marked by the hiring of replacement workers.
By a 5-to-4 vote, the Court upheld a National Labor Relations Board policy against automatically presuming that the replacements are anti-union for purposes of deciding whether the union any longer commands majority support.
The effect of the ruling was to make it more difficult for struck employers that hire replacements to free themselves of dealing with the striking union.
The decision today, N.L.R.B. v. Curtin Matheson, No. 88-1685, cut across the Court's usual ideological divisions. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices William J. Brennan, Byron R. White and John Paul Stevens. 
Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
The decision upheld a much-disputed policy of the labor board that a number of lower Federal courts have refused to enforce.
The board supervises elections for union affiliation and certifies unions chosen by a majority of the workers. For years, it took the view that replacement workers hired during a strike were presumably anti-union, and could be counted as such by an employer seeking to show that a union had lost its majority.
Three years ago, however, the board adopted a new policy of refusing to presume anything about the union sentiments of replacement workers. Instead, the board said it would evaluate each situation case by case.
The issue is significant because under Federal labor law, an employer is justified in refusing to bargain with a union when there is a ''good faith'' doubt that it still enjoys majority support. The labor board's former policy of presuming that replacement workers were hostile to the union supplied the requisite doubt, permitting employers who had replaced a majority of striking workers to stop dealing with the union.
The labor board said today that it kept no records that would show how many employers had asserted such doubt in the past. But employers are increasingly using replacement workers to keep operating during strikes, offering the new workers permanent positions.
Greyhound Lines, which has been operating with replacement bus drivers during a drivers' strike that began six weeks ago, is only one current example. Other companies that have made extensive use of replacement workers are Eastern and Continental Airlines, the International Paper Company, the Boise Cascade Corporation and the Phelps Dodge Corporation.
The case before the Court today concerned a small Texas company, Curtin Matheson Scientific, which was struck by 22 out of 27 members of a bargaining unit represented by the teamsters' union. The company, which buys and sells laboratory supplies, hired 29 replacement workers. It then refused to bargain further with the union, asserting that with replacement workers now in the majority, it was legally entitled to doubt the majority status of the union.
 
Appeals Court Backs Company
The union charged the company with an unfair labor practice for its refusal to bargain. The board ruled for the union in 1987, citing its new policy against presuming the new workers' views and concluding that the company had not demonstrated that the teamsters had become ineligible to represent the workers. The board ordered the company to bargain over a new contract.
But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, refused to enforce the order. It ruled that the board should have permitted the company to presume that the replacement workers no longer supported the union. The labor board appealed to the Supreme Court.
The dispute between the majority and the dissent was not so much over the intricacies of Federal labor law, including the National Labor Relations Act, as over the degree of deference owed by Federal judges to policies adopted by specialized administrative agencies.
''We will uphold a board rule as long as it is rational and consistent with the Act,'' Justice Marshall said, ''even if we would have formulated a different rule had we sat on the board.''
 
Wanting It Both Ways
Justice Marshall said the board's decision to presume nothing about replacement workers' union sentiments was ''rational as an empirical matter.'' He said replacement workers might have felt driven by economic necessity to cross the picket lines, but might still want the protection of union representation once on the job.
''Because the circumstances of each strike and the leverage of each union will vary greatly,'' he said, ''it was not irrational for the board to reject the anti-union presumption and adopt a case-by-case approach in determining replacements' union sentiments.''
In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist said, ''The board's no-presumption rule seems to me to press to the limit the deference to which the board is entitled in assessing industrial reality.'' But he added, ''I agree that limit is not exceeded.''
In dissenting opinions, Justices Blackmun and Scalia said the labor board had not adequately supported its position. Justice Scalia said: ''Since the principal employment-related interest of strike replacements (to retain their jobs) is almost invariably opposed to the principal interest of the striking union (to replace them with its striking members), it seems to me impossible to conclude on this record that the employer did not have a reasonable, good-faith doubt regarding the union's majority status.''
 
Ruling on Civil Rights
In another decision today, the Court ruled unanimously that suits brought under an important Federal civil rights law may be filed in state court as well as in Federal court.
The statute, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race or sex. Lower courts have disagreed over whether the Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases brought under the law.
The decision today, Yellow Freight System v. Donnelly, No. 89-431, upheld a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, that state as well as Federal courts can hear these cases. Justice Stevens wrote the opinion.

HEADLINE: Bush Warns Moscow of U.S. Move Over Cut in Fuel for Lithuanians

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Bush warned Moscow today that he would retaliate for a cut in fuel shipments to Lithuania, and officials said possible responses ranged from canceling official meetings and educational exchanges to stalling talks on a variety of trade issues.
That could affect negotiations on civil aviation, trade, investment and tax treaties and maritime transportation that grew out of the Malta summit meeting and that the Soviet Union is anxious to conclude, officials said. But they said the White House was not prepared to cancel the summit meeting between Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, planned for May 30 to June 3.
Mr. Bush summoned his top advisers, including Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, to the White House this evening to discuss reports from Moscow that the Lithuanian government had been told that its natural gas shipments would be reduced. 
 
Watching 'Very Closely'
Before the meeting, Mr. Bush called the move ''contrary to the approach that we have urged and that others have urged upon the Soviet Union.''
''Obviously, we are watching this situation very, very closely,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We are considering appropriate responses if these threats are implemented.''
But the President refused to elaborate on his comments and concluded by repeating his plea for ''dialogue, discussion and a peaceful resolution of this great difficulty'' in Lithuania. The republic's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union prompted a test of wills that has strained Soviet-American relations just as they seemed to be steadily improving.
 
Meeting With Honduran
The President raised the issue of Lithuania today at a brief photography session in the Oval Office before a meeting with President Rafael Callejas of Honduras. This departure from his usual practice in such meetings signaled that the White House was anxious not to appear to be inactive when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was increasing the pressure on the Lithuanians.
Mr. Bush refused to say what particular options he was considering and other Administration officials also were careful to avoid making specific threats toward the Soviet Union, in part because they are concerned about inflaming already high tensions in the Soviet Union and in part because the Administration believes that in the final analysis, there is little it could do.
Some officials also have argued that taking any action, even the most innocuous, could increase public expectations that Mr. Bush would respond more harshly if the Soviet Union cracked down further on Lithuania and thus propel the Administration toward actions it might not want to take.
 
Under Pressure in Congress
Mr. Bush has come under pressure from some members of Congress to take more forceful action. But after a White House meeting today, Senator George Mitchell, the Democratic leader, signaled that he was satisfied so far with the President's approach and declined to say how he thought Mr. Bush should respond to Moscow's latest move.
Speaking in an interview with Cable News Network, President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania also declined to say what he thought Mr. Bush should do. He said only that the United States should make clear that the ''Soviet Union has no right in Lithuania, no constitutional or lawful rights.''
Administration officials said the list of possible responses if Moscow carried out its threat of economic sanctions against Lithuania were reviewed at an interagency meeting here today.
The mildest measures would involve canceling such things as official visits or programs like educational and cultural exchanges. Officials acknowledged that such action is unlikely to hurt Mr. Gorbachev or the Soviet leadership much and that it might be considered inadequate by those who have been pressing Mr. Bush to act more strongly.
 
Economic Area Responses
If Mr. Bush decided on a tougher response, officials said he had the option of suspending or canceling a range of discussions that are planned in the near future on trade and economic initiatives that Mr. Bush offered to Mr. Gorbachev in Malta last December.
''In all reality, the most likely response would be in the economic area, since that's the most logical and has the least widespread potential damage,'' one official said.
In the next several weeks, the Soviet Union and the United States are scheduled to begin a third round of talks on a trade agreement and to open negotiations on expanded civil aviation, maritime transportation and proposed treaties covering investment and tax arrangements.
At Malta, Mr. Bush also pledged to help the Soviet Union gain the status of observer in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade starting in 1991, to work for the lifting of export-import credits and to pursue expanded cooperation in finance, agriculture and other areas. The Soviet-American grain agreement also is on the Lithuanian contingency list, officials said.
 
'Good, the Bad and the Ugly'
In considering its options, an official said, ''The Administration is focusing on this aspect of the relationship first.''
There is strong resistance within the Administration to allowing Lithuania to interfere with the summit, officials said.
''A lot of people want to go through with that summit,'' an official said. ''Any relationship is a mixed thing. There's the good, the bad and the ugly, and you don't sacrifice everything because you have tensions in one area.''
Administration officials argued that the summit should proceed as scheduled since, as one put it, ''it serves a certain function in itself by putting things on the agenda, keeping on the pressure and allowing the relationship to go forward.''

HEADLINE: CONSUMER PRICES CLIMBED IN MARCH BY A SHARP 0.5%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed five-tenths of 1 percent in March to make the annual inflation rate 8.5 percent for the first three months of 1990, the most rapid increase in a quarter in nearly eight years, the Labor Department reported today.
Higher prices for housing and apparel accounted for more than two-thirds of last month's increase, which was considerably more than most analysts expected and which sent bond prices tumbling.
The widespread assumption among economists today was that the Federal Reserve has lost, at least for the foreseeable future, any leeway it might have had to reduce interest rates and might eventually have to raise them. Recent economic signals, including data today showing strength in industrial output but weakness in housing starts, have left unclear whether the economy is rebounding from slight growth in the final quarter of 1989 or is still in danger of tipping into a recession. 
 
Economic Vigor Suggested
By itself, today's inflation report tends to suggest economic vigor, but if the Federal Reserve was to decide to combat inflation more strenuously, it could raise interest rates and possibly induce a recession.
Most analysts, however, believe the economy is strong enough not to require lower rates and that inflation is not high enough to prompt higher rates. The Federal Reserve is further inhibited from raising rates by the strength of the dollar in currency markets, which is making it difficult for world leaders to coordinate economic policy.
In today's inflation report, some analysts were particularly disconcerted by the fact that the so-called core rate of inflation - the Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy - rose even faster than the index as a whole, by seven-tenths of 1 percent. This meant that the increase could not be easily dismissed, as frequently occurs, by pointing to aberrations such as harsh weather pushing up the price of fuel oil or fresh vegetables.
''You take away the special stuff and you still have a reading on inflation that is not very favorable,'' said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''Inflation is worse than we thought.'' But while economists generally agreed that there was little consolation to be found in today's figures, several suggested that future reports would reflect considerably diminished price pressures.

Jackman, senior economist in the Labor Department branch that prepares the price index, called the first quarter ''very bad'' but observed that prices of much food and energy had now moderated or turned lower and that the price of apparel - which rose 1.6 percent in March after climbing more than twice that in February on the introduction of higher-priced spring and summer clothing - would almost certainly fall in April.
Mr. Jackman also said a 1 percent rise in homeowners' costs last month, which contributed to a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in the housing category, did not reflect any identifiable factor that would continue to push prices higher.
 
Housing Is 42 Percent
Housing accounts for 42 percent of the price index, with food and transportation almost equally splitting another 35 percent. Apparel and its upkeep represent 6 percent. The other categories are medical, clothing, entertainment and ''other'' goods and services.
Consumer prices are nonetheless rising faster than those at the producer level. The Labor Department last week reported a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods in March.
A big part of the difference, according to some economists, is that 55 percent of the consumer index consists of services, which rose seven-tenths of 1 percent last month. That is a 6.3 percent rate of increase for the six months through March.
The producer index, a tabulation of prices received by domestic producers for their goods, contains no directly measured services.
Service jobs have been expanding smartly and, with the nation's unemployment rate of 5.2 percent hovering just above 16-year lows, it appears that a tight labor market is generating cost pressures.
Some of the tightest labor markets are in metropolitan areas where bidding for certain kinds of workers has raised rates of pay substantially and put pressure on prices. Of the five major metropolitan areas for which price data are collected monthly, Philadelphia and New York had by far the biggest increases in March -1.1 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Los Angeles rose seven-tenths of 1 percent; San Francisco, six-tenths, and Chicago, two-tenths.
These wage pressures are likely to be given additional impetus by the April 1 rise in the minimum wage to $3.80, from $3.35 an hour.
Among those stressing the effect of wage pressure on inflation is Kathryn L. Kobe, a vice president of Joel Popkin & Company, a firm named for a former senior Labor Department official who specializes in analyzing inflation. Ms. Kobe predicts the core inflation rate will rise to 5 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in 1989.
 
All Categories Show Rises
All seven of the main Consumer Price Index categories showed price acceleration during the first quarter, making the total the fastest inflation in a quarter since the 10.1 percent posted in the second quarter of 1982. For 1989, the rate was 4.6 percent.
Food and beverage prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in March as declines for fruits and vegetables and for dairy products largely offset increases for poultry, pork and eggs.
Transportation, which showed an overall decline of one-tenth of 1 percent, benefited from a 1.4 percent drop in the price of gasoline after an 8.5 percent January-February increase.

A Call to the Downtrodden: Break Down the Door

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 17

 BODY:
A brown washcloth in hand to mop his brow under the fiery Indian sun, Kanshi Ram stepped up to the microphones to start a revolution.
Tens of thousands of India's most disadvantaged people - the poor, the powerless, the untouchables - sat along the capital's stately Rajpath boulevard to listen to the message that he asked them to carry to millions more ''in all the corners of India.''
Daring to attack half a century of official self-satisfaction that ''the weaker sections'' were being looked after by those better born, and rejecting the label ''harijan,'' or ''children of God,'' that Mohandas K. Gandhi bestowed on the millions of outcastes who remain victims of Hindu prejudice, Mr. Ram, a 56-year-old former Government scientist, said simply:
''For too long we have been knocking at the doors of the system, asking for justice and getting nothing. It is time to break down those doors. No sacrifice will be too great.'' 
 
'The Party of the Majority'
His message was addressed, he said, to what is potentially the most powerful political force the country has ever known, the 650 million of India's 840 million people who exist outside Hinduism top three caste groupings: Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaisya. Mr. Ram calls his new political organization the Bahujan Samaj, the Party of the Majority.
Saturday was the beginning of a yearlong commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Bhim Rao Ambedkar, India's first Law Minister and one of the framers of the national Constitution. Mr. Ambedkar was born in untouchability in 1891; his teacher would not handle his books or papers as he sat isolated on a burlap bag at a far corner of the classroom. He died in 1956 still despairing of Hinduism. One of his last acts was to become a Buddhist, along with several hundred thousand followers.
Mr. Ram, saying he is picking up the struggle for social equality where Mr. Ambedkar left off, has given his followers a year - until April 14, 1991, his mentor's birthday - to travel by bicycle all over India spreading the exhortation ''to develop ourselves'' and ''be worthy sons of our father.''
In the next general election, which could occur any time between now and 1994, Mr. Ram, whose followers call him ''the second savior,'' says he will field hundreds of candidates, ''the majority of them Ph.D.'s.''
Mr. Ambedkar, helped by the Maharajah of Baroda, who recognized his brilliance, eventually graduated from Columbia University in 1915 and then from the London School of Economics. He also became a barrister at law at Gray's Inn.
 
An Opponent of Gandhi
His experiences in the United States, where he developed a belief far ahead of his time in the efficacy of social change through law, caused him to oppose Gandhi, a higher-caste Bania, who thought Hindus could be persuaded to change their ways by example.
Gandhi and his Congress Party prevailed. Only now has India, under a non-Congress Government, honored Mr. Ambedkar posthumously with its highest award, the Bharat Ratna.
Mr. Ram, also born an outcaste but educated as a scientist in India, left his Defense Department job in 1965 after becoming involved in another employee's discrimination problems.
''His life changed forever after he read Ambedkar's Caste Annihilation,'' an associate, Arun Choudhury, said. ''He wrote to his mother. It was a 24-page letter that said: I am not coming home. I am not going to marry. I am going to give my life to this cause.''
Mr. Ram, who began his campaign by organizing self-help projects among the educated lower castes in government jobs, was a newcomer to Indian politics when his party came from nowhere to capture three seats in the Indian Parliament in November 1989 and to cut substantially into votes cast for many other candidates.
Within five years, he said in an interview, his Bahujan Samaj could take power through the ballot.
 
Obstacles to Overcome
There are obstacles to overcome. The new party, formed less than a decade ago, is still limited in strength geographically, with most of its support in the populous Hindi-speaking north and New Delhi. Other, often competing, parties draw on the vote of the poor in other parts of India. There are also subcaste antagonisms and personal rivalries to face.
Mr. Ram is in favor of continued affirmative action programs in education and jobs that have given many of the lowest caste and outcaste people better lives. He encourages young people to make the most of these opportunities.
But he is solidly opposed to what are known as ''political reservations'' - the setting aside of certain parliamentary or state-level seats for people who fall into categories called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These designations also include members of minority religions, all of whom would be technically outcastes since they are not part of the Hindu universe.
 
Fundamental Changes Sought
Mr. Ram said the political reservation system had created token seats for ''stooges'' of the major parties, all of them controlled by Brahmins or other high-caste people.
The Bahujan Samaj is not ideological. In fact, it has begun to lure young people away from leftist groups because the Communist parties are also dominated by higher castes.
''Our main targets are social transformation and economic emancipation,'' he said. ''But basically, our problem is the unique social system of India.''
''Where Brahminism is a success, no other 'ism' can succeed,'' he said. ''We need fundamental, structural social changes.''

HEADLINE: ALLIES STILL LAG ON ARMS, U.S. SAYS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The United States, which spent a larger share of its national income for the military budget in 1988 than virtually all its NATO allies and Japan together, criticized its friends today for not doing enough to close the military spending gap in recent years.
In an annual study of military ''burden sharing,'' the Pentagon cited two of the largest and wealthiest allies, Japan and Canada, for what it called below-par contributions to Western defenses.
But the Pentagon acknowleged that Canada has increased its rate of arms spending in recent years. It also said Japan has significantly increased its military spending and purchases of American military goods since the report was compiled. 
Congress has required the Pentagon to report each year since 1985 on allied contributions to Western arms expenditures. This year's report has added significance, however, because the Pentagon is under new pressure to sharply reduce its commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in light of the reduced Soviet military threat to Europe and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact.
 
Some U.S. Cutbacks in Process
The United States has already proposed to reduce its Army and Air Force troops in Europe from 305,000 to 225,000, as part of an East-West agreement reducing conventional forces in Europe. Some members of Congress have called for European nations to assume a greater share of NATO military spending to simplify the process of making sharp cuts in Pentagon spending later this decade.
The Pentagon report uses several gauges to measure military spending by the United States and 15 allied nations, and finds ''substantial differences among the burden-sharing and force improvement efforts'' of individual countries.
The United States spent $293.1 billion on defense in 1988, or 60 percent of all military spending by the nations surveyed, according to the report. By comparison, Japan spent $28.9 billion, or 5.9 percent; West Germany spent $35.1 billion, or 7.1 percent; France spent 36.1 billion, or 7.4 percent, and Canada spent $10 billion, or 2 percent.
But when military spending is measured as a percentage of gross domestic product - the sum of all goods and services sold in a nation - the United States, with 6.1 percent devoted to defense, ranks second to Greece, with 6.4 percent.
Britain, Turkey and France also devote relatively large shares of their gross domestic products to military spending, the report said.
 
Pentagon's Heroes and Laggards
The Pentagon report praised Turkey, Greece, Britain and France for contributing relatively more than their share to the common defense, and called Luxembourg, Denmark and Canada as laggards in military spending.
Japan, the only non-European nation included in the survey, is ''substantially below par'' in military spending as measured by the usual indicators, such as percentage of gross domestic product, the report says. But because it is so wealthy, the total amount of money spent by Japan on defense in 1988 - $28.9 billion - is larger than all but a handful of nations.
Japan also purchases more American-made products under the Foreign Military Sales program than any other nation, and more than Italy, Britain, France and West Germany combined, the report stated.
A spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington said today that the Pentagon report contains ''some truth'' in its assessment of the country's arms spending. But the spokesman pointed out that Canada has a relatively small population, and said that its spending appears far more robust when it is measured on a dollars-per-person basis. The report also ignores Canadian contributions of military aid to Turkey, Greece and other poorer NATO members, he said.

HEADLINE: Use of Drugs in Religious Rituals Can Be Prosecuted, Justices Rule

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that governments may prosecute those who use illegal drugs as part of religious rituals. It said such prosecutions were not a violation of the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.
By a vote of 6 to 3, the Court refused to grant two men who are members of an American Indian church a religious exemption from an Oregon law that makes it a crime to possess or use peyote.
The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, has broader implications for the Court's approach to resolving the conflicts that occur with some frequency between individual religious practice and generally applicable government policies. 
The ruling overturned a decision by the Oregon Supreme Court that the First Amendment's protection for the ''free exercise'' of religion required an exemption in state law for the sacramental use of peyote.
 
A 'Desirable' Exemption
Oregon had not sought to prosecute the two men, who used peyote in the rituals of the Native American Church. Rather, the state's employment division refused to pay the men unemployment benefits after they were dismissed from their jobs for using peyote. The state agency said the criminal status of peyote use rendered the men ineligible for the benefits.
Peyote, a cactus that contains the hallucinogenic substance mescaline, has been used for centuries in Indian religious ceremonies. Federal law and the laws of 23 states, including many with substantial Indian populations, exempt the sacramental use of peyote from criminal penalties.
Justice Scalia said such an exemption was permissible, even ''desirable,'' as a choice for legislators to make. But, he added, ''the First Amendment's protection of religious liberty does not require this.''
He noted that the Court ruled more than a century ago that Mormons could be prosecuted for polygamy even though their religion incorporated it. ''We have never held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate,'' he said.
''It may fairly be said that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in,'' Justice Scalia said, ''but that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a system in which each conscience is a law unto itself.''
A generally applicable law or regulation that places an incidental burden on religious practice is constitutional, Justice Scalia said, unless it is ''specifically directed'' at a religious act. As an example, he said, a law prohibiting ''bowing down before a golden calf'' would ''doubtless be unconstitutional.''
The majority's analysis drew strong dissents, not only from the three Justices who said the Constitution required an exemption for sacramental peyote use, but also from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who agreed with the outcome of the case but differed sharply with Justice Scalia's approach.
The three Justices who disagreed with the outcome as well as the approach were Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and William J. Brennan Jr. In her opinion concurring only in the result of the case, Justice O'Connor called the majority opinion ''incompatible with our nation's fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty.''
 
'Vitality' of First Amendment
She added: ''If the First Amendment is to have any vitality, it ought not be construed to cover only the extreme and hypothetical situation in which a state directly targets a religious practice,'' she said.
''The essence of a free exercise claim,'' she said, ''is relief from a burden imposed by government on religious practices or beliefs, whether the burden is imposed directly through laws that prohibit or compel specific religious practices, or indirectly through laws that, in effect, make abandonment of one's own religious or conformity to the religious beliefs of others the price of an equal place in the civil community.
''The history of our free-exercise doctrine amply demonstrates the harsh impact majoritarian rule has had on unpopular or emerging religious groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Amish.''
In addition to filing their own dissenting opinion, Justices Blackmun, Marshall and Brennan signed much of Justice O'Connor's opinion. All four agreed that the Government must be required to justify a burden on religious practice by demonstrating that it served a ''compelling state interest.''
Justice O'Connor concluded that Oregon could have met that test in this case because of the state's compelling interest in curbing drug use. The three others concluded that the state's interest was not sufficiently compelling.
Justice Scalia's majority opinion rejected the ''compelling state interest'' test, saying it would ''open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.''
He said: ''We cannot afford the luxury of deeming presumptively invalid, as applied to a religious objector, every regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the highest order.''
The majority opinion, Employment Division v. Smith, No. 88-1213, was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.

HEADLINE: Baby Orphaned but Enriched By Quake Is Going to Cousins

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, April 17

 BODY:
A 10-month-old baby orphaned in the earthquake last Oct. 17 will be raised by second cousins who own a hog farm in the Central Valley town of Chowchilla, a judge announced today, six months to the day since the parents were crushed to death beneath the Nimitz Freeway.
In announcing the custody for Jimmy Brown, after months of hearings and genealogical research, Judge Roderic Duncan of Alameda County Superior Court rejected the claims of two grandparents. Each had charged that the other was unfit to raise the child and collect compensation from the State of California to the baby that could reach a quarter of a million dollars. 
Just hours before the hearing today, the grandparents met with a mediator and accepted the judge's custody decision. They also set up a visitation schedule that will bring Jimmy to the Bay Area for a few days every other month.
The baby has been in Chowchilla with the second cousins, Arthur and Tonia Lewis, since the end of March, when Judge Duncan awarded them temporary custody.
 
Praise for the Family
''Everybody has pulled back and recognized that their own personal wishes are not the most important thing,'' said Judge Duncan, who congratulated the relatives for sparing Jimmy continued conflict.
Jimmy was born to unmarried, unemployed teen-agers in a family in which generations of women have had children out of wedlock and generations of men have served time in jail. The case was closely watched here because of the poignancy of Jimmy's circumstances and the judge's insistence that he hoped to reverse the course of the child's life even if it meant making an unconventional custody choice.
Jimmy has already been awarded $100,000 from the state in compensation for the death of his parents. At a previous hearing, the judge placed that money under the control of the Alameda County's public guardian. Potentially the baby could be awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars more as the state processes other claims from the earthquake.
 
Down the Family Tree
The Chowchilla couple were found by officials of Alameda County Family Court. The officials investigated the grandparents, then looked further into the family tree for a suitable home for Jimmy. The Lewises, who have a 5-year-old daughter, run a 50-acre hog farm halfway between Modesto and Fresno, in the rich farm belt that runs through central California.
Arthur Lewis, 30 years old, is a cousin of Jimmy's late mother, Michelle Marie Richard, although apparently Mr. Lewis has had little contact with other members of the family. He was in the courtroom today, but declined comment except to say that the baby was ''doing wonderful.''
The main petitioners for custody had been Anita Williams, Jimmy's 35-year-old maternal grandmother, and James Brown 2d, the baby's 37-year-old paternal grandfather. Ms. Williams is raising her own children on welfare and during court proceedings was accused of consorting with drug-abusing men. Mr. Brown, who runs a landscaping and hauling business, is on parole after a prison term for grand theft.
Also seeking custody of the infant were Vickie Reed, Mr. Brown's former wife, who is Jimmy's paternal grandmother, and Gerald Brown, an Army major who is Jimmy's uncle.

HEADLINE: Black Militancy

 BODY:
In Milwaukee, a black alderman has called for a black militia to wage ''urban guerrilla warfare'' - actual violence - unless ''racial parity'' is achieved in the city by 1995. In Teaneck, N.J., black youths angered by the killing of a black teen-ager by police erupted in violence after a prayer vigil.
In Harlem, the pastor of a famous black church is campaigning to paint over billboards carrying cigarette and liquor ads because, he feels, blacks are disproportionately victimized by both tobacco and alcohol. And in Brooklyn, a black neighborhood is boycotting a Korean grocer for allegedly abusing his black customers. 
In American cities and some suburbs as well, a new militancy is evident among African-Americans. It takes different forms, not always laudable. But each instance is a reminder of an old agenda overshadowed by the thawing of the cold war and forgotten by all except those whose circumstances won't let them forget.
Milwaukee is a case in point. Alderman Michael McGee's call for a black militia was actually a dramatic attempt to call the city's attention to the desperate situation of African-Americans there. The first item on his list of three demands was a $100 million emergency jobs program. That's jobs, not welfare - or certainly no more welfare than is involved in the jobs of featherbedding union members or business executives on golden parachutes. The emergency is clear. While the overall unemployment in Milwaukee is about 5 percent, it's 25 percent among blacks. And 40 percent of Milwaukee's blacks live in poverty.
What justifies his militancy, says Mr. McGee, is not just desperation but Milwaukee's ability to act decisively when it wants to. He points to the city's exertions on behalf of its sports teams, including a baseball stadium that could cost $100 million.
The same sort of densely compacted, highly distilled poverty and disadvantage exist in virtually every American city. And as the recent events in Teaneck indicate, the problems for blacks, including poor relations with police, don't end with affluence and a move to suburbia.
Talk of armed militias understandably frightens many people. But those who listen will hear a cry of anguish over unyielding poverty, joblessness, bad education and health care; a demand for compassion leading to practical help, and a determination not to settle for a degrading status quo.

HEADLINE: Believe It, the Deficit Affects Interest Rates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Rostenkowski Plan: A G.O.P. Triumph'' (Op-Ed, March 15), Paul Craig Roberts again rejects sound economic science with his denial that budget deficits affect interest rates -specifically, in denying that balancing the United States budget would reduce interest rates.
In rebuttal to this virtually self-evident thesis, he asks: ''Why do West Germany, with its trade surplus, and Britain, with its budget surplus,'' have higher interest rates than the United States? 
The simple answer is that interest-rate determinants are complex. Real inflation in Britain and feared inflation in inflation-phobic West Germany explain their higher interest rates. Since each national economy carries its own economic configurations, the scientific question is this: What happens, other factors assumed equal, to Britain's, or Germany's or America's, interest rates when budget deficits rise?
Economic logic decrees that, in strict accordance with the law of supply and demand, interest rates rise when budget deficits rise. This virtually axiomatic truth can be demonstrated by linear regression analyses of United States interest rates. Such analyses show definite correlations between mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, Treasury bond rates and Federal budget deficits.
Mr. Roberts tacitly recognizes the critical role of the law of supply and demand when he warns that ''raising taxes could put the economy in the tank.'' Why? Because the consequently reduced income could reduce demand for goods and services.
The same law operates in the money markets. When borrowers compete for a budget-reduced pool of lendable dollars, the price of money - i.e., the interest rate - tends to rise. Significantly, this basic economic truth is rejected only by the Reagan Administration's supply-side ideologues.

HEADLINE: A New Service Begins at Stewart Airport

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: NEWBURGH, N.Y., April 17

 BODY:
American Airlines Flight 793, seven minutes late but its 118 seats filled, roared out of Stewart International Airport for Chicago today, the first regularly scheduled passenger service in the history of this former Air Force base 60 miles north of New York City.
Amid champagne, speeches and drumrolls, state and local officials gave the maiden flight a festive send-off. Officials hope the service will help relieve congestion at the metropolitan region's three major airports and help the economy of the Hudson Valley.
''If you look at the greater New York region, the only place left for expansion is the Hudson Valley,'' said Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development. 
This first step toward Stewart's development as a commercial airport is small: American is offering three daily flights to Chicago and three to Raleigh, N.C. But it comes in the face of continued opposition from a coalition of environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club and Scenic Hudson.
The coalition has sued New York State, demanding a comprehensive environmental review of the new air service and the proposed development of some 1,500 acres of state-owned land around the airport.
A State Supreme Court justice has ruled in favor of the coalition, but the state has appealed the decision.
 
'Intelligent Decisions' Asked
Carol Sondheimer, associate director of Scenic Hudson of Poughkeepsie, said the public had a right ''to have the full ramifications of the largest development project in the Hudson Valley clearly and completely laid out, so we can make intelligent decisions about our future.''
Today, however, there was an air of possibility as officials reviewed the credentials of the state-owned airport, which has been used only by cargo carriers, the Air and Marine National Guards and private jet owners, including Donald J. Trump and Bill Cosby. In area, the 10,000-acre airport, just west of Newburgh, is the second largest in the nation, behind Dallas-Fort Worth.
Stewart's 11,818-foot main runway -2,518 feet longer than Newark International Airport's top runway, but 2,754 feet shorter than Kennedy International's - can handle the largest jetliners. And the state has proposed transforming as many as 1,500 acres into a series of light industrial and office parks.
In addition the airport is near two highways: the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and Interstate 84. Land has been set aside for a second major terminal. The airport also has foreign trade zone status, meaning that goods coming through are not subject to Federal customs duties.
A spokesman for American Airlines, Ed Stewart, said flights for the next month were ''more than 80 percent booked, which is much higher than any of us projected.''
 
Airline Wins Concessions
After months of negotiations with the state, American announced last October that it would begin flying out of Stewart. The state won over the airline by offering six extra gates at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark and by waiving the state sales tax on materials bought in New York for the addition to the passenger terminal.
Initially American Airlines will offer three round trips a day on Boeing 727's to Chicago and Raleigh-Durham.
While Mr. Tese played down Stewart's potential as a multi-carrier hub -''If another airline comes in here, that's fine,'' he said, ''but we're not thinking long-range'' - other state officials were more blunt. ''We're talking to all of the airlines all of the time,'' said Russell B. Vachon, the Director of Aviation with the State Department of Transportation.
 
Easier Driving Reported
The assumption is that many people who live in the half-dozen counties of the Hudson Valley region, as well as some in northern New Jersey, are tired of fighting traffic to reach La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark. A sampling of the passengers boarding the 12:50 P.M. flight today seemed to bear that out.
''The key is not the distance, but the driving time,'' said Bob Scherreik of Bloomingdale, N.J., the general manager of McBride Corporate Real Estate in Harriman, N.Y.
''It takes me an hour and a half to drive 30 miles from my home in Bergen County to Newark during rush hour. It takes only 45 to 50 minutes to get to Stewart, and there really aren't any rush hours here.''
Michael J. DiTullo, president of the Orange County Partnership, a quasi-public corporation that coordinates economic development for the county, said passenger service was essential to attract businesses.
But it is the airport's potential service as a catalyst for growth, not only around the airport but throughout the Hudson Valley, that troubles many residents and environmental groups.
Only 2,000 acres are now used for aviation purposes, and an 8,000-acre buffer zone is valued as open space for hikers and hunters. The state has targeted a maximum of 1,500 acres in the buffer zone for possible development over the next 20 years.
Six proposals, ranging from no development to development of the full 1,500 acres, are now the subject of an environmental review, overseen by the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration.
''We're seeking a balance between preservation and controlled growth,'' said Stephen M. Finkle, the director of economic development for Stewart International Airport at the state's Urban Development Corporation.
 
Rubber-Stamping Charged
But environmentalists, who charge that the state ''rubber-stamped'' the passenger-service expansion a year ago, argue that any development must be reviewed in light of the increased flights.
''The development in the buffer zone and the expansion of the airport ought to be studied together in one comprehensive document,'' said Michael S. Elder, a partner in the law firm of Elder & Long in Kingston, who represents the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition, one of the plaintiffs.
''This is the state's effort to take an unproductive piece of property from a financial point of view and turn it into a money-making operation,'' Mr. Elder said. ''It's sad that money is the primary objective here and that the environmental review is secondary.''

The News Is Accused Of Unfair Practices

DATELINE: MANHATTAN

 BODY:
The largest union at The Daily News struck back at the paper's management yesterday, accusing it of 10 separate instances of unfair labor practices in violation of Federal law.
The accusations, filed with the National Labor Relations Board by the Newspaper Guild of New York, came a day after The News said it had halted its practice of deducting union dues from employees' paychecks. 
Barry F. Lipton, president of the Guild, which represents nearly 800 news, advertising and clerical workers at the paper, asserted that the management was refusing to bargain in good faith or to honor its contractual obligations, including the dues checkoff. A spokesman for the paper, John T. Sloan, said there would be no immediate comment by The News.
The News, which terminated its contracts with all 10 unions at the paper last week, has said that apart from wages and benefits, it was no longer legally bound to observe most provisions of the previous agreements, which expired March 30. Management has tied the paper's economic survival to the need for sweeping work-rule concessions by the unions and has vowed to continue publishing in the event of a strike.
Mr. Lipton and other union leaders said they had arranged for alternative methods of collecting dues from the paper's 2,466 unionized workers, including having the employees' credit union deduct the money from paychecks. There will also be various forms of direct billing, they said.

HEADLINE: Witness Calls Commissions Routine in Marcos Dealings

BYLINE: By CRAIG WOLFF

 BODY:
A Philippine shipping executive, testifying at the racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos, said yesterday that he paid more than $25 million in commissions as a routine part of doing business with the Philippine Government.
The executive said he was instructed to deliver the money, not to the Government, but to a man who has been described by prosecutors as ''the Marcoses' personal Swiss banker.''
The executive, Jose M. Reyes, said he paid the money over a 10-year period while Ferdinand Marcos was the Philippine President, and that as soon as Mr. Marcos was forced from power in February 1986, most of those payments were no longer required.
Mr. Reyes did not say the commissions went directly to an account owned by Mrs. Marcos or her husband, nor did he suggest that the money was spent improperly, but his testimony seemed to enhance one of the prosecution's chief contentions: The Marcoses amassed a huge fortune by covertly sending money to foreign banks. 
 
The Economy Was in Crisis
Mrs. Marcos is charged with stealing more than $222 million from the Philippines and through a variety of channels around the world, investing most of the money in four Manhattan buildings.
Gerry Spence, Mrs. Marcos's lawyer, noted that the payments made by Mr. Reyes were made in the late 1970's and early 80's while the Philippine economy was in crisis. The money, he said, was deposited in Swiss accounts to help the Phillipine Government secure Swiss loans.
Mr. Spence also said that the Aquino Government had dropped the commissions in exchange for his testimony.
It was another uneven, difficult day for Mrs. Marcos and Mr. Spence, who has tangled several times with Judge John F. Keenan of Federal District Court in Manhattan.
 
'Go Away From the Bench'
In a lengthy session yesterday morning, Mr. Spence questioned Dr. Angelita Reyes, Mr. Reyes's wife, who testified about documents belonging to the Marcoses that she had reviewed for the Aquino Government. When Mr. Spence asked her to identify a document that he held up from about 20 feet away, Judge Keenan interrupted, saying, ''How in the world is she going to be able to identify that?''
Mr. Spence, citing the laughter that erupted in the courtroom, asked the judge to refrain from chastising him.
Strangely, it was in Mr. Spence's cross-examination of Mr. Reyes yesterday that the shipping executive said the payments he made totaled $25 million. He said he paid the money while doing business with the Philippine National Oil Corporation, which is owned by the Government.
 
Accounts in Switzerland
Mr. Reyes said that he paid from $100,000 to $200,000 for each trip and that with few exceptions, those payments have stopped.
The commissions, he said, were paid to accounts in the name of Stephane Cattaui, who worked for Banque Paribas in Switzerland. An assistant United States Attorney, Debra A. Livingston, had said in her opening statment that Mr. Cattaui had arranged the Marcoses purchase of the Crown Building at 730 Fifth Avenue at 57th Street.
Mr. Reyes said that as of Feb. 26, 1986, when the Marcoses left Manila, he stopped making the payments, except for shipping he does for the Philippine International Trading Corporation.
In unrelated testimony, Mr. Reyes's wife, Angelita, said that two days after the Marcoses left Manila, she went to the Malacanang Palace, the president's residence, to pick up documents.
One of the documents, she said, was a contract between Mrs. Marcos and the Swiss Credit Bank. The name Jane Ryan appeared on the first page of the documents, with the notation pseudonym. Underneath was the name, Imelda Romualdez Marcos, followed by the notation true name.

HEADLINE: European Officials Dispute Bush Over Global Warming

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
President Bush called today for more research into the scientific and economic ramifications of global warming linked to pollution, but several European officials attending a conference here argued for more concrete and prompt action as well.
The differences over how quickly to proceed highlighted the opening session of a two-day conference called by the White House to discuss research into the scientific and economic uncertainties surrounding the issue of the warming of the earth.
In his speech, Mr. Bush urged environmental ministers and other delegates from 18 nations to consider the economic consequences while drawing up policies to deal with the problem.
The delegates, Mr. Bush said, should ''sort out the science on this complex issue'' as well as explore ''the links between our environmental well-being and our economic welfare.'' 
 
'An Excuse' for Inaction
But West Germany's Minister for the Environment, Klaus Topfer, said in a statement today, ''Worldwide action against the climatic threat is urgently required, even if the complicated scientific interrelationships of climatic change have not all been fully understood.'' He added, ''Gaps in knowledge must not be used as an excuse for worldwide inaction.''
The disagreement comes at a potentially embarrassing time for the Administration as several nations, including the United States, focus on pollution and environmental issues in advance of Earth Day next Sunday.
In the last year, there has been considerable debate within the Bush Administration over how quickly to respond to potential global warming. William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, at first urged a specific commitment to reduce carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and is thought to contribute to global warming.
But the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and other officials opposed such a move. At this point the entire Administration, including Mr. Reilly, appears to have closed ranks behind Mr. Sununu's more cautious approach.
Many scientists now predict that climate shifts will occur in the next century as the gases in the atmosphere retain radiation from the sun that would otherwise be reflected back into space. But in his speech to the conference, Mr. Bush made it plain that more research was necessary and that actions to deal with the situation should be weighed against economic consequences.
''Environmental policies that ignore the economic factor, the human factor, are bound to fail,'' Mr. Bush declared.
Several officials of major European nations attending the White House Conference on Science and Economics Research Related to Global Change, said it was time for action to reduce the pollution, mainly from carbon dioxide, that is expected to cause the earth to warm in the next century.
West Germany, the Netherlands and France, disclosed their own plans for unilateral action to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide.
Bert Bolin, the Swede who is chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in an interview, ''This conference avoided bringing up certain issues such as how do you get an effective decision-making process without too much delay.'' He said that while there was a need for research, ''it must be in parallel with action.''
In his remarks, Mr. Bush said the conference was intended to help speed the efforts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a panel of experts organized by the United Nations Environmental Program and the World Meteorological Organization. The panel has been given the task of assessing the state of science with regard to global warming and to recommend possible international responses.
Other Administration officials who addressed the plenary sessions held today, sounded similar themes. They included Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; D. Allan Bromley, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology; Michael R. Deland, chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, and Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. administrator.
Several noted that the United States had committed $1 billion to research into global warming and that Mr. Bush had agreed to act as host to a meeting to plan a framework treaty for international cooperation to deal with the problem.
Dr. Topfer of West Germany said he had prepared a proposal for his Government's cabinet that would reduce his country's emissions of carbon dioxid, by at least 25 percent by the year 2005. He said the cabinet would take up the issue before its summer recess.
Per Villinga, who is in charge of global warming issues in the Netherlands environmental ministry, said his country was planning to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by 5 percent by the end of the decade.
Mr. Villinga told reporters on Monday that his country believed this conference should discuss policy as well as research and said that the economic problems may be exaggerated.
Brice Lalond, the French Environmental Minister, said his country had set a goal of reducing per capita emissions of carbon dioxide, now 2.3 tons a year per person, to 1.7 tons. He did not say when France hoped to achieve that goal.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Modest University in Florida Is Blazing a Trail For Blacks to Careers in the World of Business

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

 BODY:
A bespectacled young man, beaming in a double-breasted suit, thrust out his hand at a reception here. ''Matthew Bowman,'' he said. ''I'm a business administration major at FAM U., and I'm from Fayetteville, N.C.'' Without pause, he produced a business card with his school address, his home address and his telephone numbers. ''What brings you here?'' he asked. At the School of Business and Industry at Florida A&M University, Mr. Bowman's attire and his welcoming speech are routine; only the card is optional. These and bigger things -like annual three-month internships at major companies and training in persuasion, adapting to change and jockeying for power - are a part of an unusual approach to teaching business at this predominantly black university, and one that some major American companies say the top business schools would do well to emulate.
While many companies are paring management and curbing hiring because of the soft economy, recruiters from Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Champion International, Pepsico, Merck, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Amoco are pouring through Florida A&M's business school handing out job offers.
Recruiters say the school's blend of a business curriculum with grooming in the methods and manners of business is at least as appealing as the fact that the students are skimmed from the top ranks of 40 states' high schools, or the fact that almost all of the 1,150 students are black. 
In addition to about 250 bachelor's degrees in business, the School of Business and Industry expects to award 80 to 90 M.B.A.'s this year, up from 30 last year and 14 the year before. The school's dean and creator, Sybil C. Mobley, is trying to steer Florida A&M into the ranks of the business school elite.
This seems a quixotic ambition for an institution of otherwise modest dimensions. The university is not even accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. It cannot meet some standards for accreditation because of its limited resources: it has a tiny endowment of less than $10 million, is short of faculty, and does not offer some basic business courses, like marketing.
For its undergraduates, the concentration on business behavior means it cannot provide as big a dose of liberal arts courses as most undergraduate business schools do. A freshman complained that Florida A&M does not offer courses in the language of the nation's No. 1 economic rival, Japan. And rather than stay here for a fifth year to get an M.B.A., some students move on to schools like Wharton or Northwestern because they believe those M.B.A. degrees carry more weight. 'Ready to Go Right to the Job' But in the judgment of many of those who hire business school students, Florida A&M's training in business behavior more than compensates for its shortcomings.
''The difference among these students is that they are ready to go right to the job,'' said Barbara Recchia, a recruiter who was here recently for Hewlett-Packard, which hired six graduates for career jobs last year and nine more as interns.
''We've identified this as one of our key business schools for students of finance,'' Ms. Recchia said. ''FAM U. is in the top five.''
B. Lawrence Branch, who led a team here from Merck, the pharmaceuticals company, said: ''We are looking for certain skills at Wharton, Columbia, Carnegie-Mellon and FAM U. FAM U. is providing the same caliber of student the others are.''
Among this year's objects of recruiters' blandishments is Seralyn Pink, a 23-year-old master's degree candidate. Ms. Pink said she was juggling four offers at salaries ranging from $40,000 to $60,000 - right in line with offers to Harvard and Stanford M.B.A.'s - and she said two included job-signing bonuses of $2,500 and $4,000. ''Money is secondary,'' she said. ''I'm interested in the job and upward mobility.''
Darryl Jordan, 23, a candidate for a bachelor's degree, said he had had offers of $25,000 to $30,000 from Dow Chemical, Barnett Banks of Florida, the Bank of Boston, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing before accepting one from Atlantic Richfield. ''When I came here I was a jock,'' he said. ''I couldn't speak to people.''
That the students are black matters to companies, the recruiters say, but not so much because of moral considerations or affirmative action programs. The companies say they are driven by hard-core business reasons; they are suffering a post-baby-boom shortage of talented managers, they like Florida A&M's training in business behavior, and they want culturally diverse executive staffs to master an increasingly diverse marketplace.
Barbara J. Laski, vice president and treasurer of Capital Holding, a big financial services concern in Louisville, said: ''The days of affirmative action and equal employment opportunity left a bad taste among some companies. That has evolved into thinking that as an organization, you have to value diversity.''
In teaching methods of maneuvering in management, like vying for top management's ear, competing for slices of the corporate budget, winning others over in developing a new product, she said, ''there is not anything that comes close to FAM U.'' Reading and Dress With Eye on Career Business Week or The Wall Street Journal are required reading for freshmen, after which the students are presumably hooked. A visitor saw only six earrings on men (and three were on one ear). Men and women, who are in a majority at the school, wear conservative suits one or two days a week when they listen to speeches given by the chief executives of leading companies and join them in seminars. At such times, the suits are mandatory, but there is no formal dress code. The business dress is part of a culture that the faculty and the upperclass students inspire.
The woman who devised this novel approach to business education is Dean Mobley, whom business leaders call an extraordinary promoter and scholar. The 64-year-old dean spends part of every week on the road, visiting chief executives and cajoling them to come speak at the school -with the expectation that once they see it, they will send money and recruiting teams, and advise her on curriculum changes to keep the school abreast of their needs.
Dean Mobley, who has an M.B.A. from Wharton and a doctorate in accounting from the University of Illinois, worked as a clerk-typist at Florida A&M, after getting her degrees, became an accounting teacher, then head of the business department, and then dean when the department became an autonomous school 16 years ago.
Early on, she said, she found that her graduates were struggling in their jobs, so she went to see their bosses and asked, ''What is the instrument by which you decide who makes it and who doesn't?'' It turned out to be the evaluation form. ''So we sent out for evaluation forms from 100 companies,'' she said, ''and they were all consistent.''
The forms, she said, asked supervisors to assess subordinates' technical knowledge and ability to apply it, their written and oral communication, their teamwork skills and their social graces. She said business schools, including her own, were sending out graduates who were trained in only one category, technical knowledge.
''So,'' she continued, ''we went to other business schools and said, 'How do you prepare your students for this and for that?' They said, 'We don't.' So we said, 'How could we in good conscience neglect these things, when we are the only people in control of four or five years of the students' lives?' ''
In the years since, Dean Mobley has constructed a two-track curriculum, one devoted to conventional business courses, the other devoted to personal development.
In one class, for example, George R. Auzenne, the assistant dean, requires that freshmen write him a one-page letter the first day, a two-page letter the second, a three-page letter the third. Thus starts a long process in business communication.
Freshmen are also instructed to buy a blank book and collect autographs from students and faculty. No one signs until the student introduces himself as Mr. Bowman did at the reception.
''Now what are we doing there?'' said Amos Bradford, a professor of organizational behavior. ''We're trying to teach one of the first steps in interpersonal competence. Dress is important. How you persuade is important. How you impact with your peers is important.'' Mock Corporations: A Flavor of Reality To give students a flavor of business organization, the school has established seven mock corporations, with seniors serving as chief executives and presidents and lower classmen filling lower management ranks where they vie for promotion. One company prepares and manages visitors' itineraries; another drills students in writing, public speaking and personal appearance; a third handles public relations and publications; a fourth manages a small shopping center the school owns.
''You feel you're in the corporate world,'' said LaDeidra Ellis, 22, a senior from Ocala, Fla. ''It's the way you begin to think.''
A vital part of the program is the internship. Students go off to three-month paying jobs three or four times in their years at the school, rarely to the same company or the same part of the country. During the internships, management sizes up the students for permanent jobs, and the students size up management.
Irene Jones, 22, a senior who has taken a job at the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm, spent one internship at another company. ''I noticed that my supervisor had been in the same job for 17 years,'' she said, a sign that she could be stymied there, too. Determination To Accept Challenge Students say they have no qualms about joining a business establishment that blacks have often reviled for discrimination and exploitation.
''Some people might see this as selling out,'' said Alisa Mosley, 20, a sophomore who ranked first in her class at Dunbar High School in Fort Worth. ''Others see it as getting the tools you need to deal with the world.''
LaTonia Davis, 21, a senior undergraduate, added: ''I know who I am, If you know who you are, you don't have to run around in a dashiki. There's a time to do that and a time to wear a suit.''
It is too soon to tell how Dean Mobley's progeny will do in the upper ranks of management, since her first graduates are under 40 years of age, generally the threshold for promotion to senior jobs. But some seem well on their way.
Ronald E. DeNard graduated seven years ago and went to Alcoa, where he is now cash manager for the company's subsidiaries. He has been moved three times, from Cleveland to Chicago to Pittsburgh, and been promoted four times. Dean Mobley's business school served him well, he said: ''I wouldn't change a thing.''

HEADLINE: Star Chefs Find Themselves On the Outside Looking In

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
BY the early 1980's, as restaurant mania began to build, chefs became celebrities. And like star baseball players, if a kitchen home-run king left one restaurant team, there was always a more lucrative contract waiting.
But in the last year or two the business has slowed and established restaurants have started fighting for customers who seem less willing to spend large sums dining out. Fewer expensive restaurants are being built as monuments to chefs' and owners' egos, especially in New York. Now when talented young chefs leave jobs, they have no guarantee of finding better positions.
Recently many head chefs left well-known New York restaurants not knowing where their next kitchens would be. Geoffrey Zakarian of 44 in the Hotel Royalton, Thomas Keller of Rakel, Michel Attali of Petrossian and Ali Barker of 150 Wooster Street have spent weeks, even months, sitting on the bench. 
Others had plans that did not quite work out. Brendan Walsh, highly acclaimed for his Southwestern cooking at Arizona 206 when he left there in January 1989, had a deal to open a restaurant in SoHo. When that fell through last August, he had no prospect for another project in Manhattan. He is making his debut Friday as chef at the new Coyote Grill in Island Park, L.I.
Another talented chef, Bob Pritsker did not reopen his restaurant, Brive, after its usual summer vacation last year. He had been unable to attract enough customers for his very personal interpretation of haute cuisine. He said that he was unsure of his next move but that he is likely to cook again, although he is also a lawyer and has a graduate business degree.
''I don't remember a situation like this, with five or six lionized chefs out of work,'' said Alan Reyburn, a restaurant consultant and recruiter. ''Each is hopeful of reassignment exploring possibilities but there aren't enough new restaurants to snap them up.''
Other prominent chefs no longer cooking in New York include Alain Sailhac, formerly of the Plaza, who is now in France, and Jonathan Waxman of Jams who is now working in Aspen, Colo.
Not all chefs are having these problems. Seppi Renggli, the former executive chef at the Four Seasons, said he has received several offers since becoming a consultant there three weeks ago.
Experts say the New York scenario has not played out in other cities. Market Watch, a monthly trade publication for the wine, spirits and beer industry, recently suggested that the restaurant industry in Los Angeles had become saturated and is slowing. But as yet there are no star chefs without kitchens.
''New York became a restaurant mecca almost overnight in the 1980's,'' said Marc Sarrazin, owner of De Bragga & Spitler, a wholesale butcher, who often helps chefs obtain jobs. ''There was a glut. Now it has become time to re-evaluate. There are fewer investors.''
Mr. Sarrazin said once-typical salary offers in the $75,000-to-$90,000 range are extremely scarce now and he is seeing offers of around $45,000 for chefs.
The chefs without portfolio tend to agree about the reasons for their situation. ''People are less eager to commit the kind of capital it takes, the millions needed to establish a place and keep it going on a sound basis for a couple of years,'' Mr. Zakarian said.
He had planned to leave 44 in May to open his own restaurant but quit in early March in what he characterized as a dispute with management over the quality of the service. Nancy Robinson, the manager of 44, said, ''We were all frustrated about the service, but Geoffrey did not give us a chance to work it out.''
Mr. Zakarian took his sous-chef, Patrick Robertson, and the pastry chef, Melissa De Mayo, with him for his yet-undetermined venture.
Mr. Attali said he left Petrossian in September because word was out that he was planning to open his own place. He said that he was still optimistic that the project, an elaborate caviar restaurant and shop in midtown Manhattan, will materialize, but that finding investors to put up the $5 million needed has been a struggle. ''Some people say it's nuts, but we think there's a market for it,'' Mr. Attali said.
If investors are more cautious these days, so are the chefs. ''The past three months have been like a crash course in real estate, investments and law,'' Mr. Zakarian said. ''There's so much fine print in this business.''
Other chefs, among them Mr. Walsh, Mr. Keller and Mr. Barker, have also learned that talent at the stove is not enough. Mr. Walsh said he walked away from the Hudson Street deal because the financing did not seem sound.
''I didn't want to wind up in a situation where the suppliers won't deliver the food because the bills aren't paid,'' he said. ''And I didn't want to be personally liable for someone else's financial nightmare.''
Mr. Barker left 150 Wooster Street at the end of November after disagreements with Brian McNally, the owner. Both say that there were problems and that Mr. Barker would have left sooner or later. He is now executive chef for the restaurant that is opening in late May in the new Macklowe Hotel on West 44th Street.
Lydia Shire, former executive chef of the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, devoted more than a year to setting up her Boston restaurant, Biba. She said the experience amounted to a business education. ''When you're working for someone else you don't get involved in these kinds of details,'' she said.
Even Mr. Renggli of the Four Seasons is carefully considering the proposals before him.
Steve Zagor, manager of restaurant consulting for Laventhol & Horwatch, an accounting and consulting firm, said: ''Chefs have to be more cautious than in the past because there are no guarantees that the up-side will be there these days. They have to look closely at the capitalization and management side.''
Mr. Keller left Rakel, where he was the chef and an owner, in November in a dispute with his partner, Serge Raoul, over the restaurant's direction. But he said he is still liable for about $250,000 in financing.
''People say I was unwilling to compromise on my food,'' he said. ''But I'm not convinced that merely downscaling the food and prices could solve the restaurant's problems.''
The fiduciary conservativism of investors and chefs has been generated to a great extent by the public mood. ''Customers have more choices and they have become more selective about where they want to spend their money,'' Mr. Reyburn said.
Many owners have lowered prices and recast restaurants as bistros, a notion that infuriates some chefs and consultants, who regard it as a faddish makeshift solution. Mr. Zagor said the public was looking for more value, not just a smaller check. ''There are expensive places that deliver value and there'll always be an audience for that kind of experience,'' he said. ''These days we can probably count on good food, but the quality of service will make the difference between success and failure.''
But he added that sometimes chefs concentrated too much on the kitchen and not enough on service. ''They all have egos,'' Mr. Reyburn said. ''But perhaps it's time for them to be a little less impatient.''
Mr. Keller, for one, said he was redefining his focus and might put some goals on hold. Meanwhile, he misses the kitchen. ''I really need to be in a public arena,'' he said.
Mr. Reyburn also suggested that these chefs might find it increasingly difficult to reintroduce themselves into the New York restaurant world as time went on. Some chefs worry about that, too.
''I may lose something by being away for a period of time, but I'm here for the long term and I'll be back,'' Mr. Walsh said. ''I love the power of running a big kitchen and seeing it click.''
A number of experts suggested that because a number of established locations were on the market at lowered rents, this is a sensible time to think about starting a restaurant in New York. ''You can also pick up equipment for less,'' Mr. Zagor added, ''and your start-up costs are lower. Now there's a chance for rebirth.''
Mr. Walsh plans to open a restaurant in New York in the future with his new backer, John Vitale, the owner of Coyote Grill and an adjacent restaurant, Paddy McGee's.
Other chefs, notably Mr. Zakarian and Mr. Keller, have explored opportunities outside New York but see New York as the place to be.
''Everyone still dreams of opening an economically viable 125-seat restaurant in midtown,'' Mr. Walsh said.

HEADLINE: Citicorp Earnings Drop 56.3%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said yesterday that problems with real estate loans and loans for corporate takeovers caused its earnings to fall 56.3 percent in the first quarter, to $231 million, from $529 million a year ago.
Other regional banking companies announced strong gains in earnings. The NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., grew rapidly enough to raise earnings despite more real estate problems. Earnings also rose at Wells Fargo & Company, San Francisco, which is a heavy lender for real estate and corporate takeovers, but has managed to avoid making loans that turn sour. 
 
Problems Expected
As the nation's largest lender for real estate, Citicorp has not avoided lending to projects in regions where a glut of new buildings has caused prices to fall and made some developers unable to repay their loans. Problems with real estate loans began increasing more than a year ago, and Citicorp executives have warned investors that they expected problems to grow this year.
''The key question for Citicorp is whether they will have another round of loan difficulties after the examiners come in June,'' said Thomas Hanley, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Citicorp earned 60 cents a share, slightly less than most analysts had expected, and well below the $1.52 it earned in the first quarter last year.
Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, said last month that examiners would be focusing on real estate loans. In the earnings report released yesterday the bank said that becuase of unsettled conditions in the real estate market, a ''relatively high level of real estate charge-offs may continue.''
The real estate loans causing problems are for commercial properties like apartments, shopping centers and offices. Mortgages for single-family houses have not been a problem at major banks recently.
In the first quarter, the company charged off $135 million of commercial loans in developed countries, including $56 million of real estate loans, mostly in North America. About 40 million of loans to finance corporate takeovers or other heavily indebted borrowers were charged off. A year ago, charge-offs in those countries totaled only $36 million.
Citicorp said that problems with loans to highly indebted companies involved in corporate takeovers or other refinancings accounted for about half the $548 million increase since the end of the year in loans that are troubled and not paying interest. Analysts noted that Citibank was one of the leading lenders to the Campeau Corporation, whose American retail operations filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.
Another sign of real estate problems was the $570 million allocated to the reserve for loan losses, up $212 million from a year earlier. About $56 million of the increase was to cover commercial real estate loans. American real estate loans that are not paying interest rose $119 million, to $1.3 billion.
The strongest aspect of Citicorp's business continues to be consumer banking, which reported record profits of $270 million, up from $214 million a year ago. The credit card business, where Citicorp's various banks are the most active in the country, and the consumer banking business in the New York City market were especially strong,the company said.
Despite the decline, Citicorp said its long-term prospects were favorable enough to increase its quarterly stock dividend nearly 10 percent, to 44.5 cents a share from 40.5 cents. Citicorp stock rose 25 cents, closing on the New York Stock Exchange at $24.50 a share.
 
NCNB
The NCNB Corporation, the seventh-largest banking company, announced first-quarter earnings of $140.1 million, or $1.33 a share, up 84.5 percent from $75.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Much of the growth reflects the acquisiton last year of a 100 pwercent ownership of the Republicbank Corporation of Texas, now known as NCNB Texas.
As it warned analysts in March, NCNB said the weakening economy in the Southeastern part of the country caused some increase in problem loans, particularly for real estate. The banking company added $88.7 million to its reserve for loan losses in the first quarter compared with a $57.2 million addition a year ago. Troubled loans not paying interest, or facing other difficulties were $599.1 million, up from 446.1 million at the end of 1989.
NCNB is benefiting from cost savings as it develops its operations in Texas. Non-interest expnses in the first quarter fell 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1989. NCNB's shares gained 37.5 cents yesterday, to $37.375.
 
Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo & Company, the nation's 12th-largest banking company, which relied heavily on lending to real estate and corporate takeovers to become one of the country's most profitable banks in the 1980's yesterday reported a 12.9 percent gain in earnings, to $159.8 million from $141.5 million.
The strong gain in earnings confused many banking analysts, who have expected that Wells Fargo's concentration in real estate and corporate takeover lending would eventually result in losses.
''They continue to defy Wall Street,'' said Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers, ''and the quality of their loans remains squarely intact.''
In the first quarter, Wells Fargo added only $75 million to its reserve for loan losses, down from $100 million a year earlier. Troubled loans that are not paying interest or have been restructured rose to $752.1 million, from $625.1 million a year earlier. Wells Fargo stock rose 50 cents, to $71.50.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Trade Wars Postponed

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
HAUNTED by visions of Toshibas and Toyotas being shoved off the pier in Seattle, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is making a big push to appease America's Japan-bashers. The Bush Administration, which has been playing good cop to Congress's bad cop in the unfolding trade drama, emerged from the latest round of negotiations with a sheaf of commitments that should make it far easier for American consumer goods to break into the Japanese market.
But as John B. Taylor, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, told the Senate last month, greasing the wheels of commerce will not reduce Japan's trade surplus or America's trade deficit by more than a few billion dollars. What might make a big difference are a variety of freshly negotiated measures aimed at narrowing the gap between savings and investment in each of the two countries. 
This breakthrough in the ''structural impediments initiative'' is not, however, guaranteed to take the wind out of the Japan-bashers' sails. The White House seems unwilling to put real muscle behind its part of the deal, commitments to cut the budget deficit and change tax policy to stimulate private savings.
Tokyo's promises to beef up investment in public works and open land for housing can be taken more seriously, if only because Japan's long-suffering urban majority is growing impatient with Government policies geared solely to the interests of exporters and farmers. In the best of circumstances, though, it would take years for these measures to reabsorb Japan's savings surplus. And in any case, the impulse of Congress to bash seems to have taken on a life of its own - one that has more to do with an ill-defined sense of American economic decline than evidence of dirty tricks by Japan.
Trade barriers do, of course, make a difference. The latest Japanese concessions should make it easier for American brands to navigate the labyrinth of Japanese distribution from portside to retailer's shelf. But the promised changes, which range from fast-track licensing of discount malls to overnight clearance of imports through Japanese customs, cannot possibly accomplish what Congressional trade hawks seem to have in mind.
Neither, for that matter, would the declaration of Japan as the 51st state. Forget economic theory: The laws of accounting alone guarantee that Japan will run a surplus on its external financial accounts as long as Japanese savings exceeds Japanese domestic investment. Thus, to narrow the trade surplus, Japan must consume more or invest more.
It would be a pity, Mr. Taylor says, for the Japanese to adjust by imitating America's profligate ways. Far better, he suggests, for Japan to make long-overdue investments in infrastructure. For example, just 50 percent of the dwellings in that nation of cities are connected to sewer systems. Bringing such public services in Japan up to the standards of other rich nations would cost hundreds of billions of dollars - hundreds of billions' worth of productive resources, most of which would probably be diverted from exports.
By the same token, promised changes in zoning and tax laws that now discourage investment in housing could make an enormous difference. And along with easing trade frictions, they would defuse the smoldering resentment of overworked Japanese ''salarymen,'' who have yet to share in the bounty from Japan's economic miracle.
How Japanese promises of long-run structural change will play on short-run American politics is unclear. Until recently, it was widely believed that behind every unfocused Congressional denunciation of Japanese economic perfidy lay a highly focused complaint by some special interest. By that cynical logic, the way to quiet the protectionists was to pay off their corporate and union sponsors.
But a decade of appeasement in which the domestic steel, auto and computer chip industries gained protection at the expense of consumers does not seem to have made much difference on Capitol Hill. Nor has the Japanese decision to build plants in the United States that employ tens of thousands of workers.
Indeed, the vague equation of Japanese economic success with American failure seems to have taken deeper root in the political culture. And the ubiquitous presence of high-quality Japanese products seems to evoke resentment from people who can no longer imagine life without them.
Buoyed by the agreement, free traders in the White House and the State Department will probably be able to resist pressure for anti-Japanese protectionism a while longer. Just what will happen, though, if Tokyo grows weary of the appeasement game or the American economy slips into recession is anyone's guess.

HEADLINE: Sales of Vehicles Down By 11.3% in Early April

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 17

 BODY:
Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks fell by 11.3 percent in early April, compared with relatively strong sales a year ago, despite aggressive cash rebates and other discounts.
The nine auto companies that report their domestic sales every 10 days combined to sell 163,507 cars in early April, down 13.3 percent from 188,608 cars sold a year ago.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.6 million during the first 10 days of April, slightly below the 6.7 million pace for the last 30 days, and lagging behind the annual rate of 7 million cars set during the first quarter. The seasonally adjusted annual rate a year ago was 7.5 million cars. There were eight selling days in both periods. 
Auto makers sold 98,864 light trucks and mini-vans during the 10 days, a decline of 7.7 percent from 107,127 a year earlier.
The Big Three - the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation - which offer the most extensive rebates, also showed the biggest declines in the first 10 days of April, while the Japanese auto companies with plants in the United States continued to increase their sales.
The G.M., Ford and Chrysler rebates average $1,200 a vehicle, some analysts estimate.
Soft sales provoked a gloomy prediction from an economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association, Tom Webb, who said, ''Unless there is a major change in the economy, such as reduced interest rates, domestic new-car sales appear destined to remain in their current doldrums.''
Other analysts, however, were still hopeful that auto sales would pick up this spring. ''Consumer demand can turn on a dime,'' said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco. Mr. Glantz attributed the sluggish auto sales to ''slow income growth and falling real estate prices, which have made people more cautious, especially in areas of the country like New England and California,'' where property values have tumbled.
Chrysler registered the biggest drop in the 10-day period, posting a 29.2 percent decline in car sales, to 18,007 units. Sales of the No. 3 auto maker's light trucks and mini-vans fell by 24.9 percent, to 17,974 units.
G.M.'s car sales fell by 13.6 percent, to 74,400 units, while its sales of light trucks rose by 2.2 percent, to 43,298 units.
Ford sold 50,116 cars in early April, down 20.7 percent from a year ago, and 34,861 light trucks, a decline of 9.3 percent.
The foreign makers in the United States continued to add sales despite the overall decline in the American car market, extending a trend that began last July.
The Honda Motor Company sold 9,455 cars in early April, a gain of 17 percent. The Toyota Motor Corporation doubled sales, to 5,379 cars, while the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation tripled its car sales, to 1,485 units. The Mazda Motor Corporation sold 3,139 cars in the period, a gain of 221 percent.
The Nissan Motor Company once again lagged behind as the only Japanese producer in the United States to report a decline, with sales of Nissan cars off by 6 percent. However, Nissan's sales of light trucks rose by 14.2 percent in the period.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Up by 0.7% in March

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
The nation's industrial production rose by seven-tenths of 1 percent in March, the Federal Reserve reported today, in a second consecutive strong showing that led analysts to suggest that the manufacturing recession may have ended.
''We may have been through the worst of the slowdown,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an industrial analyst with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''You'll hear less talk of recession from the pessimists for a while.'' 
March's increase followed an even stronger rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent a month earlier. Both increases reflected rises in the output of automobiles, the Fed said.
 
Rise in Utility Output
''The other major contributor to the overall production increase in March was utility output, which increased markedly as temperatures were more normal after an unseasonably warm January and February,'' the Fed added. ''Elsewhere, production was little changed, on balance.''
That report was the first to combine the previously separate output and capacity utilization reports.
The Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities - which usually move in tandem with industrial production - rose by four-tenths of 1 percent, to 83.3 percent, last month. The operating rate measures not only output but also changes in productivity levels.
Production had plummeted by 1.3 percent in January because of the effect of the weather on utility output and of layoffs in the auto industry as car makers trimmed bloated inventories.
 
Questions on Sector's Strength
''The suggestion is that the bottom has been reached in the industrial-sector weakness, and the issue raised is whether, in light of such high inflation, the industrial sector now may be too strong,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Company.
Evelina Tainer, senior economist for the First National Bank of Chicago, said she believed the slowdown in manufacturing reached bottom in the fourth quarter of 1989, but added that the industrial sector was still ''not showing particular strength.''
Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both durable and nondurable goods rose by three-tenths of 1 percent in March on top of a 1.1 percent increase a month earlier.
Manufacturing of durables was up by nine-tenths of 1 percent after jumping 1.7 percent in February. Manufacturing of nondurables was down four-tenths in March after inching up by two-tenths a month earlier.
Output at mines rose by six-tenths of 1 percent last month after dropping by 1.6 percent in February. Reflecting the return to relatively normal weather, utility output jumped by 6.1 percent in March after falling by 1.2 percent in February.
 
First Report With 1987 Base
The Fed said its industrial production index in March stood at 108.8 percent of its 1987 base, up from 108.1 percent in February. It was the first report using a revised production index with 1987 as its reference period. Previous indexes were pegged to 1977.
The manufacturing operating rate rose by one-tenth of 1 percent, to 82.7 percent. The rate at factories producing durable goods increased by five-tenths, to 81.6 percent, while the rate at plants producing nondurable goods dropped by six-tenths, to 84.1 percent.
The operating rate at mines moved ahead by six-tenths of 1 percent, to 87.8 percent, while it jumped at utilities from 81.5 percent in February to 86.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Europe's Buyouts Draw More Firms

BYLINE: By Kurt Eichenwald

 BODY:
THE flurry of corporate buyouts that has swept across Europe in recent years appears to be on the verge of new growth. At least, that is the hope of some on Wall Street and in the international financial community.
In recent months, a number of funds have been established by European firms, as well as American investment houses, to try to tap into this buyout binge, which is in large part a response to the European Community's plans to drop trade barriers by the end of 1992. These funds would provide a layer of financing that is essential in many large takeovers. 
Yesterday, Wasserstein, Perella Group Inc., the mergers and acquisitions firm, jumped into the business of providing such financing for European deals. The New York firm, formed in 1988, announced that it had created the largest such fund in an agreement with a number of European financial institutions.
The fund holds the equivalent of about $366 million, and is being managed in coordination with Banque Paribas, the French financial institution. Other managers of the fund will include Commerzbank, the third largest bank in Germany, and Amsterdam-Rotterdam, or Amro, Bank, the largest bank in the Netherlands.
A number of other investors are also negotiating to invest in the fund, including financial institutions from Italy, Spain, the United States and Japan. Any deal with those parties should be announced within 8 to 10 weeks, and would increase the fund's capital to about $427 million to $488 million.
The fund will hold 300 million European currency units, which are baskets of 12 European Community currencies. At current exchange rates, each unit is worth approximately $1.20.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, the capital will be used to provide so-called mezzanine financing for friendly merchant banking deals and corporate reorganizations in Europe. Mezzanine financing generally involves subordinated debt and equity securities, like warrants, and is used as one piece of a total financing package for deals.
Wasserstein and the other firms join a number of financial institutions that have already put together similar funds. The largest of those is a $326 million fund established two years ago by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment house that collapsed in February. A spokesman for Drexel said yesterday that the fund was run by a third party and was still operating.
Stephen A. Oxman, the deputy chairman of Wasserstein, Perella International, said the firm was forming the fund because of the opportunites being created by the economic upheaval throughout Western Europe. ''We see attractive opportunities for mezzanine finance in Europe that are the result of a number of factors, including the approach of 1992, the globalization of business and the restructuring that is occurring in a number of industries,'' Mr. Oxman said.
While some people had feared that the upheaval that has swept across Eastern Europe in recent months would possibly delay the implementation of the plans for 1992, a number of international investment bankers said yesterday that they had seen no evidence of a slowdown in the European Community's interest in strategic buyouts.
Mr. Oxman said the additional investors would not change the types of financing by the fund and he emphasized that no unfriendly deals would be undertaken.
Rather, both Wasserstein and Paribas would use the capital in transactions in which the firms could invest as participants, either together or separate, in the equity portion of the deal. Both firms have equity funds that are used to commit their capital in such investments.
''The transactions that the mezzanine fund may invest in may well be the ones that are controlled by either of us at the pure equity level,'' Mr. Oxman said.
Although Wasserstein had originally hoped to establish the mezzanine fund by itself, it chose to enter into the agreement with the foreign firms so that it would be better able to understand local attitudes toward financing techniques.
''We concluded from our point of view that it would be better to have a leading institution as a local partner so as to increase our sensitivity to local markets,'' Mr. Oxman said. ''It is always useful to have someone with local eyes and ears.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar, Up Modestly Abroad, Ends Trading Day Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended lower yesterday against major foreign currencies after rising modestly overseas. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's slide to Government reports that consumer prices surged an unexpectedly sharp five-tenths of 1 percent last month and that industrial production rose seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Traders said the market thought the rise in inflation was too steep and could cause future economic problems. 
Dealers said trading was relatively quiet, however, before the release of the February trade data today. The market has been expecting the trade gap to narrow to around $7.5 billion, dealers said, from January's $9.25 billion shortfall.
 
Dollar Up in Tokyo
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 159.83 Japanese yen, from 159.42 yen Monday. It stood at 159.85 yen in London, and 159.69 yen in New York, up from Monday's close of 159.30.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.6340 in London, down from $1.6425 late Thursday, and $1.6383 in New York, up from $1.6304 late Monday.
The European markets were closed on Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday quotes, included: 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6768; 1.4895 Swiss francs, down from 1.4900; 5.6360 French francs, down from 5.6365; 1,231.75 Italian lire, down from 1,232.50, and 1.16485 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16885.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday, were: 1.6770 marks, up from 1.6730; 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4835; 5.6370 French francs, up from 5.6213; 1.8885 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8840; 1,232.00 Italian lire, up from 1,231.50, and 1.1680 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633.
Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375.20 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $375 an ounce, up 40 cents.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $374.05 an ounce, from $375.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $374 an ounce from $375.50. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at $375.39 an ounce.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE: LITHUANIANS SAY MOSCOW HAS CUT MAIN OIL PIPELINE;
Growing Pressure

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, April 18

 BODY:
After a confusing day of threats and denials, Lithuania reported tonight that the Soviet authorities had cut off the principal supply of oil to the republic as part of the Kremlin's campaign to force Lithuania to retreat from its declaration of independence.
The Lithuanian information office said the pipeline supply of crude oil to the Mazeikiai refinery in the northwest of the republic was cut off at 9:30 P.M. Vilnius time, five minutes after notice was telephoned to the plant in the name of Kremlin officials. On Tuesday, Lithuania said it had been warned that the supply would be halted today in keeping with an ultimatum issued by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last Friday.
 
Search for a Solution
Even as the announcement came, it was clear that attempts to find a solution to the crisis were continuing. During the day in Vilnius, the Lithuanian Parliament offered a conciliatory gesture to the Kremlin by voting to refrain from enacting new laws for two weeks if Moscow agreed to begin preliminary consultations on the independence campaign. 
But the Parliament also said that it ''confirms its loyalty to the acts of March 11,'' when the Parliament declared independence and suspended the Soviet Constitution. [Text of the Parliament's resolution and letter to Mr. Gorbachev, page A10.] There was no confirmation in Moscow tonight that the ultimatum threatening an oil cutoff had, in fact, been carried out.
 
Signs of Pressure
Its enactment would signal a far higher level of pressure from Mr. Gorbachev than has previously been seen in the five-week-long sovereignty crisis and would also increase the calls in other nations for retaliatory economic measures against the Soviet Union. [In Washington, the Bush Administration said that until it could confirm reports of the cutoff it would not have any response. The reports came only a few hours after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told a Congressional committee that the United States would consider severing certain commercial arrangements with the Soviet Union if Mr. Gorbachev continued tightening a economic noose around Lithuania. Page A10.] Soviet officials denied earlier today that orders for a cutoff had yet gone out. But managers at Mazeikiai, the sole refinery in Lithuania, said tonight that the pipeline supply from the city of Polotsk in the republic of Byelorussia in the western Soviet Union was finally stopped tonight.
 
Resolve Called Deeper
''The Soviet Union, being unable to find a humane solution, is resorting to economic coercion against a neighboring country,'' the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, said after receiving the news and vowing that the pressure would only deepen the republic's commitment to independence.
There was no immediate indication of how long the reported cutoff might continue. The struggle between the Kremlin and the republic has been marked by steady psychological pressure and changing Kremlin tactics, with alternate waxing and waning of the sense of crisis.
The reported cutoff of oil itself would presumably mean no immediate industrial hardship or shortage of refined oil in the republic, because Lithuanian officials estimated earlier this week that there was a stockpile of up to four months of crude oil with which to continue operations in the event of a cutoff.
Plant officials confirmed tonight that work was continuing after the pipeline inflow fully stopped, about an hour after a decrease was first evident.
Lithuanian officials quoted plant officials on the night shift as reporting that the authorizatiofofor the toppage was gngned by uhe Soviet Primeininister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, under a resolution of the Council of Ministers.
 
A 48-Hour Ultimatum
On Friday, just before the long Easter weekend, President Gorbachev issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Landsbergis government to repeal a series of independence laws or face reductions in supplies from the rest of the Soviet Union. On Monday, the Lithuanians had responded to the ultimatum with an offer of talks on central issues mentioned in the ultimatum.
Before the cutoff, a Soviet deputy oil and gas industry minister, Aklim Mukhamedzyanov, said in a telephone interview that ''allegations that these supplies have been terminated are completely groundless.
''We have received no instructions from the Council of Ministers to implement such measures,'' he said.
 
Republic Dependent for Energy
With no fuel resources of its own, Lithuania is completely dependent on the crude oil, natural gas and petroleum shipped in from the Soviet Union, and panicked citizens have been lining up daily at gas stations around the republic to fill up their cars and trucks. There was no sign today of a cutoff of natural gas, which had also been threatened.
The Mazeikiai refinery processed almost 13 million tons of oil last year. About 7 million tons of that was used in Lithuania, while the remainder was sent to the other Baltic republics and elsewhere. Small amounts also are sold into northwestern Europe through Hamburg, West Germany.
Lithuania imports 97 percent of the fuel it consumes, with nearly half of the total supplied by oil produced in other Soviet republics that is used to heat and power Lithuanian factories. Factories and other industrial activities also run on coal. Homes are heated mainly by natural gas. Lithuania does produce some energy at a nuclear power station at Ignalina and in some small hydroelectric stations.
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Ryzhkov threatened Lithuania on friday with a cut-off of critical supplies if the Parliament there did not revoke within 48 hours recently passed legislation, including a call to boycott the Soviet spring military call-up and the introduction of mandatory citizen identity cards.
The ultimatum from Moscow did not include a demand that the republic revoke its declaration of independence, made March 11, a move the republic has repeatedly rejected.
 
A Gesture to Moscow
Lithuania's Parliament, in a conciliatory gesture to the Kremlin, voted unanimously today to refrain from passing new laws for two weeks if Moscow agrees to begin preliminary consultations about the republic's drive for independence. The Parliament's resolution did not specifically mention the status of laws passed since the independence declaration, except to say the Parliament supports a statement made Monday by the Lithuanian Prime Minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene.
In that statement, the first sign that the republic was willing to compromise with Moscow, Mrs. Prunskiene sent a telegram to the Soviet leadership saying that Lithuania would not stand in the way of Lithuanian men willing to serve in the army and would not take action against Soviet citizens choosing to stay in the republic while maintaining their soviet citizenship. Then, Tuesday, as the specter of a fuel blockade loomed, Lithuanian legislators began urging that serious concessions be offered to Moscow in the hopes of encouraging the Kremlin to agree to negotiations.
In addition to the proposal on temporarily suspending the passage of any new laws, the Lithuanian resolution urges Moscow ''to refrain from using force, including economic pressure, against Lithuania and it citizens.''
It further calls on Lithuanian citizens and economic organizations ''to prepare for a period of austerity and spiritual endurance.''
 
Letter to Soviet Leaders
The Parliament also unanimously adopted a letter to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Ryzhkov, outlining its latest position and supporting the points raised by Mrs. Prunskiene in her telegram to the Soviet President earlier this week.
The parliamentary letter says that a Lithuanian delegation will soon be going to Moscow and will be ready to meet with Kremlin representatives to begin the proposed ''preliminary consultations.'' The delegation is to be led by Bronius Kuzmickas, deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament.
In the one critical note raised in the letter, the Parliament says it ''regrets the position and methods chosen by the U.S.S.R.'' during the current crisis.
Mr. Gorbachev issued his ultimatum to Lithuania after a month of steadily increasing threats and warnings that Lithuania must rescind its declaration and all subsequent legislation. Moscow has maintained that Lithuania and all other Soviet republics are free to secede from the Soviet Union provided they follow guidelines recently adopted by the national Parliament in Moscow, which include a referendum requiring a two-thirds vote to approve secession, a transition period running a minimum of five years and approval by the Congress of People's Deputies, the full Soviet Parliament.
Lithuanian officials insist that they are seeking not to secede, but rather to re-establish the independence that was lost in 1940, when Lithuania and the neighboring Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union by Stalin.
As the Parliament worked today on a political solution to the stalemate with Moscow, Mrs. Prunskiene and the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Algirdas Saudargas, left for a trip to Norway, trying to find practical help for the fledgling republic through foreign investors and economic aid.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE: LITHUANIANS SAY MOSCOW HAS CUT MAIN OIL PIPELINE;
Soviets Hold All the Cards

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Lithuania is ill equipped to withstand an economic siege by Moscow, Eastern European analysts agree. The New Hampshire-sized republic is utterly dependent on energy purchased from the Soviet Government at bargain rates, Nor is there reason to believe that a retaliatory cutoff of Lithuanian exports would do much damage to the Soviet economy. While farms and factories do supply the other Soviet republics with a handful of critical products, Moscow could easily find alternative sources in European markets.
Looking down the road, however, the risks to each side appear more balanced. An independent Lithuania, suggests Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist who has been advising the republic's rebellious government, could serve Soviet interests as well as its own. By failing to make a deal on mutually acceptable terms, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is passing by a vital opportunity to transform the dependent Baltic economies into Hong Kong-style windows to the West. 
Lithuania and the other Baltic republics are relatively prosperous. According to PlanEcon, a Washington consulting firm, output per person was more than double that of the impoverished Tadzhik Republic, and exceeded the overall Soviet average by one-fourth.
 
Highly Vulnerable
But with a population under four million, Lithuania is much too small to be self-sufficient. As a matter of practical economics and longstanding Soviet political policy, it is tightly bound to the greater Soviet economy. Most of the manufactures and raw materials used in Lithuania come from other republics still within the Soviet fold. And while Lithuanians might be able to survive for months or years without the bulk of the these imports, they are highly vulnerable to the embargo on energy.
According to a Lithuanian government report published last month, 97 percent of the fuel used to heat Lithuanian homes and run its factories is imported. A nuclear plant, which has been the focus of protest by Lithuanian nationalists, would be able to supply electricity for some time. But stockpiles of oil are reportedly only sufficient to carry the economy for about six weeks. Supplies of natural gas, used in four out of five Lithuanian homes, are yet smaller.
Lithuania has little or no hard currency to pay for Western imports to replace the losses. It is not clear, in any case, that the Soviet Navy would permit foreign oil tankers to dock.
Nor would Lithuania have much hope in the short run of earning desperately needed foreign exchange through sales to the West. Just 20 percent of Lithuanian exports, Mr. Summers estimates, are of sufficient quality to compete in world markets. Even exports of Lithuanian foodstuffs, tainted by pesticides banned in Europe, are problematic.
 
Major TV Parts Supplier
For the Soviet side, a trade embargo would mean losses for its enterprises and consumers who now depend on exports, however inferior, from Lithuania. The little economy produces, for example, some 75 percent of the components for Soviet television sets and 30 percent of vital tractor parts.
But in the view of Thomas Telma, an economist at PlanEcon, the creaky Soviet economy could bumble along for many months without feeling the loss. And within that time, it could easily open the economic bottlenecks with substitutes from the West.
In fact, there is reason to believe that the Soviets would gain in the short run by severing economic ties with Lithuania. The prices Lithuanian enterprises have been paying for oil and gas and other raw materials, analysts agree, are far below those the Soviets could fetch in the West. And while this implicit annual subsidy to the Lithuanian economy may be much smaller than the $5.9 billion claimed by Moscow, there is little doubt that the immediate impact of a cutoff would be a windfall for the Soviets.
But other considerations, Mr. Summers argues, ought to temper President Gorbachev's taste for a fight. A Lithuania subdued by Soviet power is likely to remain a focus of economically costly ethnic conflict and a bottomless pit for Soviet subsidies. By contrast, an independent Lithuania, one with close ties to the Soviet Union based solely on mutual interest, could serve as a conduit for the Western technology and organizational skills so desperately needed by Moscow.
 
High-Quality Labor
In Mr. Summers's view an independent Lithuania (or Estonia, or Latvia for that matter) would be able to attract capital - and modern factories -from nearby Scandinavia. ''Where else,'' he asks, can you hire high-quality labor for one-eighth the wage of a South Korean?''
Lithuanians would, of course, benefit most directly from newly forged ties with the West. But Moscow would benefit, too, as capital and technology followed the path of greatest expected profit.
The battle over Lithuania might only delay the day when the Baltics might become Moscow's Hong Kong. But with the Soviet political system in ferment and the Soviet economy in free fall, delay is a luxury that Mr. Gorbachev call ill afford.

HEADLINE: MILITANTS PROMISE TO FREE AMERICAN

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 18

 BODY:
A pro-Iranian group believed to be holding three American hostages in Beirut said today that it would release one of them within 48 hours.
The group, the Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine, said it was acting in response to ''urgent appeals by officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran for a good-will initiative in order to close the hostage file.''
News agencies in Beirut said the group's handwritten statement was delivered to the Beirut newspaper An Nahar and to a Western news agency. [Text of statement, page A8.] Baker Reacts Cautiously The statement was acompanied by a photograph of Jesse Turner, 42 years old, who was a professor at Beirut University College when he was taken hostage in January 1987. Islamic Holy War has also said it is holding Alan Steen, 50, and Robert Polhill, 54, both of whom were professors at the University College. Experts on Iranian affairs speculated that the hostage to be released was Mr. Turner. 
In its statement, Islamic Holy War said that it would like John H. Kelly, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, to be on hand in Damascus, Syria, to ''coordinate final measures necessary for the success of the release within 48 hours.''
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d reacted cautiously to the reports and said there were no plans to send Mr. Kelly, who is in Bonn, to Damascus.
Iranian affairs experts said the formal linking of Iran's name to the pro-Iranian groups said to be holding hostages, and the positive reference to resolving the matter, was a notable change. Iran has previously denied all formal ties to the pro-Iranian groups, who are believed to be holding 18 Western hostages, including 8 Americans.
 
Syrian Efforts Noted
Senior Arab Government officials said the move also underlined Syria's wish to improve its ties to the West and its role in the release of hostages held by pro-Iranian militias.
In its statement, Islamic Holy War emphasized ''the permanent Syrian efforts in this line,'' and a senior Palestinian official said tonight that ''the whole thing has been cooked up by the Syrians.''
Irfan Parviz, the editor of The Teheran Times, the first Iranian publication to call for the release of foreign hostages, also said Syria had helped bring about the development.
''I am really happy,'' Mr. Parviz said in a telephone interview from his home in the Iranian capital. ''I can say it is the beginning and there will be more good news in the pipeline.'' The Teheran Times is known for its close ties to the Iranian Foreign Ministry and President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
The move by Islamic Holy War gives support to the view that the so-called pragmatic faction of the Iranian Government led by President Rafsanjani may have settled a long-running power struggle in Teheran to its advantage.
''I think it does in fact mean that Rafsanjani and company are winning,'' said Gary Sick, an Iranian affairs expert formerly on the United States National Security Council who handled the first hostage crisis when American diplomats were taken prisoner in Teheran in 1979.
 
'A Humanitarian Gesture'
Mr. Parviz said the expected release of American hostages was because of Mr. Rafsanjani's efforts. He dismissed all notions of opposition to the Iranian President's decision to end the hostage question as a ''fiction'' of the Western press.
''Everything has always been under his control,'' Mr. Parviz said, adding, ''It is a humanitarian gesture to which America can respond by ending its hostile attitude towards Iran.''
Mr. Rafsanjani and his supporters in the Iranian Government have long advocated a resolution of the hostage issue to allow Iran to pursue the normalization of relations with Western countries, a process that began with France in 1988 when all French hostages held by pro-Iranian militias were released.
On March 21, Iran began a five-year development program for which it says it needs $27 billion in foreign credits and in hard currency.
Mr. Sick said the Bush Administration should respond to the potential release of an American hostage with ''a gesture, but only a small one,'' adding that the Iranians have begun a long process of negotiations.
''The bottom line is that Rafsanjani wants to see the hostage business ended, not for humanitarian reasons, but so as to get on with his economic programs and to get access to United States technology, particularly in the area of improving Iran's oilfields,'' Mr. Sick said in a telephone interview tonight.
Arab diplomats noted that the good-will gesture toward the West comes when Iraq, an enemy of Iran and Syria, finds its relations with the West deteriorating after a long period of improvement that started when the Iraq-Iran war began in 1980.
Virtually all Iranian affairs experts consulted said the offer to release an American hostage and the way it was announced strongly suggested that Iran expects countersteps by the United States.
The United States has repeatedly vowed not to bargain over the release of hostages. For its part, Iran has often asked for the return of Iranian Government funds frozen in the United States.
The statement by the terrorist organization strongly suggested that the move came after negotiations it described as assuring ''a fruitful solution for all parties.'' It said that ''all those who should be consulted were unanimous that fruitful and convincing formulas should be sought.''
 
'An Implicit Bargain'
The group also said it was moving to liberate an American hostage ''on the basis of reciprocal positive action from the other party to speed the issue toward a happy ending,'' suggesting that some bargaining over Iranian demands had taken place or was expected.
Mr. Sick and a number of other Iranian affairs experts said they felt some kind of talks between the Bush Administration and the Iranian Government must have taken place. ''I don't really know, but I feel there is here an implicit bargain,'' Mr. Sick said.
Although little is known about Islamic Holy War, it is generally acknowledged that all the pro-Iranian groups holding hostages fall under the umbrella of a Shiite Muslim Lebanese organization known as the Party of God. The group is financed by Iran, but also has ties with Syria, which controls some of Iran's access to Lebanon.
Islamic Holy War said today that it had proposed a way for the United States to respond to its offer in ''a verbal message which will be carried to President Bush.''
The statement added, ''We wish the humanitarian aspect of this move to be balanced from both sides as a condition for it to move forward, otherwise there is no point in advancing from one side.''
On March 15, Islamic Holy War threatened in a statement in Beirut to kill all three hostages unless the United States met its demands. It also threatened to blow up planes carrying Jewish Russian immigrants to Israel.
The group previously offered to trade the three professors for 400 Arabs held in Israeli jails. Israel rejected the proposal.

HEADLINE: U.S. TRADE DEFICIT FELL IN FEBRUARY TO A SIX-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit took an unexpectedly sharp fall in February, the Commerce Department said today. At $6.49 billion, it is the smallest gap between imports and exports in more than six years.
Administration officials hailed the report, which showed the smallest monthly trade imbalance for the United States since the $5.68 billion in December 1983 and reflected impressive gains with many trading partners.
''The overall situation in U.S. trade has been improving for some time, and we are pleased with these numbers,'' said Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
 
'Elements of a Fluke'
But private economists were more skeptical. ''There were the elements of a fluke,'' said Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist for DRI/McGraw Hill. And some analysts, in studying parts of the report, saw signs of a softer economy.
On Wall Street today, stock prices tumbled, but traders said the main factor was rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 32.89 points, to 2,732.88. [Page D12.] In currency trading, the dollar fell despite expectations that a strong trade report would provide support.
The trade deficit fell 30 percent from a revised $9.32 billion in January. But the improvement reflected declining imports; exports actually fell slightly. Oil accounted for nearly two-fifths of the overall $3.14 billion decline in imports from January to $38.12 billion in February. The price of imported oil, which had surged in January, declined as unseasonably warm weather curbed energy demand in February and oil exporting countries maintained high production levels.
Most analysts expect that over the longer term both oil import volumes and prices will rise. Ms. Latta of DRI/McGraw Hill said, ''The energy import bill is going to have to have an upward trend to it.''
Acknowledging the volatility of trade numbers, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher still noted that exports over the first two months of the year rose ''an encouraging'' 11.6 percent over the corresponding months last year with more than half the increase in advanced technology products.
The Bush Administration is counting on export growth to lift the fortunes of American manufacturers and to add overall strength to the economy.
But there were declines in the capital goods and industrial product sectors as well, suggesting a softer economy to some analysts, including Joel L. Prakken, vice president of Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, and William T. Archey, vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
''The economy has been in a temporary lull,'' said Mr. Prakken, whose St. Louis firm forecasts economic growth. ''Once the economy rebounds later this year, imports will pick up.'' He expects that economic growth for the first quarter, to be announced by the Commerce Department next week, will be at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, compared with 3 percent for all of 1989.
The trade report showed that exports at $31.63 billion were off 1 percent from the record $31.93 billion, but would have been off more had it not been for the strength of aircraft orders, reflecting a backlog at Boeing whose assembly operations were hit by a strike late last year.
The most striking improvement was with the European Community. The United States converted a $48.9 million deficit with the community in January into a $1.15 billion surplus.
The gap with Japan widened, after shrinking in January, but the average for the first two months was still 27 percent narrower than the corresponding months of 1989. Exports to Japan increased by 24 percent, while imports fell 5 percent.
 
Discussion With Tokyo
The improvement in the trade deficit with Japan over the first two months comes as the Bush Administration, under heavy Congressional pressure, has been urging Tokyo to open its market to more foreign products.
Although recent trade pacts with Japan have been hailed by the Administration, Congress remains skeptical and many lawmakers are demanding that Japan be cited again for its trade practices and be subjected to negotiations as a so-called priority country under tough provisions of 1988 trade legislation. The Administration is deeply divided on the issue, and today's report was seen as bolstering the position of those who are against citing Japan again.
As for the overall deficit, imports of manufactured goods at $28.8 billion were $1.6 billion less than the $30.4 billion of January. Among sectors showing steep declines were clothing and footwear, specialized industrial machinery, iron and steel mill products, airplanes, organic and inorganic chemicals, telecommunications equipment, textile yarns and fabrics, metalworking machinery and electrical machinery. But an increase was shown in imports of passenger cars.
 
More Aircraft Exports
Exports of manufactured goods at $23.3 billion were $600 million more than the $22.7 billion of January. Exports of aircraft, up $1.2 billion, more than accounted for the increase. Other increases were shown in vehicle parts, new passenger cars, trucks, and spacecraft and parts.
Decreases were shown in the categories for power generating machinery, organic and inorganic chemicals, chemicals-plastics, office machines and scientific instruments.
Oil imports at $4.7 billion in February were $1.2 billion less than the $5.9 billion of January. Imports totaled 243 million barrels, down 48 million from January. The February average price of $19.39 for a barrel was 74 cents below January.

HEADLINE: State Acquires Most of Times Square Project Site

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
After a six-year legal battle, New York State acquired most of the Times Square development area yesterday, and officials said demolition to clear the way for the $2.5 billion project could begin as early as the fall.
Under a condemnation order signed by Justice Stanley Parness of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the State Urban Development Corporation took title to about two-thirds of the 13-acre site, including parcels at Seventh Avenue, Broadway and 42d Street on which four huge office towers are planned. The order also includes eight of the nine theaters that are to be renovated as part of the project.
Vincent Tese, chairman of the development corporation, said of the significance of yesterday's action: ''We own it. It's ours.'' State officials characterized the action as a decisive step forward for the largest public commercial urban-renewal project ever planned in the state. 
 
More Than 40 Lawsuits
Before the condemnation order was signed, the project's developers, Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, increased their letter of credit from $155 million to $241 million, in compliance with an earlier ruling by Justice Parness that took into account increasing real-estate values. The letter of credit will cover the cost of acquiring the property.
The project, a decade in the making, has been delayed by more than 40 lawsuits, two of which are pending. But Mr. Tese, who is also the State Commissioner of Economic Development, said the two lawsuits were not ''deal breakers.''
The developers withdrew their declaration that there was significant litigation affecting the project, signifying their belief that the pending lawsuits would not materially affect the project.
Mr. Tese said companies and individuals occupying offices in the buildings to be demolished would be moved in the next three to four months. The agency will also conduct a final appraisal of the 34 properties the state acquired to determine purchase prices.
A revised plan for the area, unveiled last summer, calls for four skyscrapers varying in height from 32 to 57 stories and comprising 4.1 million square feet. The buildings were redesigned to reflect the honky-tonk atmosphere of the area, with setbacks, cutouts, asymmetrical grids, angled roofs, reflective surfaces in blue and green glass and built-in multicolored neon signs.
 
Hotel and Mart Proposed
The 42d Street-Seventh Avenue subway station would be reconstructed, and one official said work on the subway station would help determine the sequence of construction on the project.
The plan also calls for a hotel and a wholesale merchandise mart on Eighth Avenue at the western end of the project. But the agency does not yet have a deal with a developer for those projects, and yesterday's condemnation order does not include those sites.
''Now that the east has been resolved, I think the west will pretty quickly fall into line,'' said Carl Weisbrod, former head of the 42d Street Redevelopment Project, a state agency set up to manage the huge undertaking. As head of New York City Public Development Corporation, Mr. Weisbrod is now the city's lead representative to the project.
The fate of the former Times Tower is uncertain, but Mr. Weisbrod said it was unlikely that the building on an island between Seventh Avenue and Broadway would be torn down.
Although the condemnation order does not include the ninth theater planned for renovation, the New Amsterdam, the Urban Development Corporation is already working with its owners.
 
Tens of Thousands of Jobs
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo called yesterday's action ''a milestone for the economy of New York.'' Mayor David N. Dinkins said the project would create 16,000 construction jobs and 20,000 permanent jobs, making it ''one of the most productive public projects of the decade.'' It is certainly among the most controversial.
Supporters contended that it would clean up an area marred by seediness and afflicted with crime. Opponents condemned the skyscrapers as too large and the tax abatements granted to the developers as too generous.
Many new office towers have already risen in the Times Square area, and in a soft real-estate market there are fears that a project once intended to stimulate development could now flood the city with unneeded office space. And because of tax abatements, the project's developers might have an edge in luring tenants.
''This will not save Times Square,'' said State Senator Franz S. Leichter, Democrat of Manhattan and a longtime critic of the project. ''It will destroy Times Square.''
But Veronica W. Hackett, a senior vice president of Park Tower, said that despite all the development in the area, the 42d Street project was necessary because 42d Street was still ''a terrible disgrace to this city.''
As the legal wrangling over the project dragged on, Chemical Bank, which was expected to be a prime tenant, withdrew, concluding that the new buildings might not be ready by the time the lease on its current Park Avenue headquarters expired in 1994.
But even without such a tenant, and despite the weak real-estate market, both developers expressed confidence that the project would be a success.
''Even though the short-term picture isn't rosy, we feel that by the time the office buildings are constructed, there will be a new cycle and it will be a great opportunity,'' said Tom R. Jago, a spokesman for Prudential.
 
'No Grounds That We Can See'
Valerie Caproni, senior vice president and general counsel for the Urban Development Corporation, said that Justice Parness's condemnation order could be appealed, but that her agency had no indication it would be.
In any event, she asserted, there were ''no grounds that we can see that will result in a reversal.'' She also said a property owner could contest the value of an appraisal.
Gary M. Rosenberg, a lawyer for the Durst Organization, a real-estate concern that has a lease on property that includes seven of the theaters on West 42d Street and has been one of the project's most determined foes, said he had yet to read the judge's order and could not comment on it.
But, he acknowledged, ''I would say that from U.D.C.'s point of view, yes, this is a big step.''

HEADLINE: Nepal's Tense Days: Foreign Aid Reported at Risk

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KATMANDU, Nepal, April 18

 BODY:
The World Bank and several nations that give aid to Nepal warned aides to King Birendra last month that financial help for this impoverished kingdom could be jeopardized if the King failed to respond to the democracy movement that has since started to take power, officials here say.
The movement, led by the Nepalese Congress Party and a Communist coalition, included a surge of popular unrest and street marches that reached a peak 12 days ago, and won an end to Nepal's 30-year ban on political activity. A member of the Nepalese Congress Party, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, was named Prime Minister, and he announced the names of the 11 members of his Cabinet today. 
An international aid official said today that the World Bank's concern about the future of Nepal was made known to officials in the palace and the Finance Ministry late in March as the movement grew in strength.
The bank financed $65 million in projects last year and plans to finance a series of projects worth about $120 million per year for the next five years.
The former Foreign Minister, Shailendra Upadyaya, who was in the Government at the time, said he knew about threats of aid disruption from France, Britain, the United States, West Germany and Switzerland.
Fresh commitments of $466 million in aid to Nepal in fiscal year 1988-89 were made by the Aid Nepal group, a consortium including West Germany, Japan, Britain, Switzerland and Canada, that is led by the World Bank.
''If the Government had come to the Aid Nepal meeting in Paris in May'' without making major political and economic changes ''it would have got a rocket,'' said the international aid official. The warnings, he said, ''did have some effect.'' He did not elaborate. He and others here said West Germany and Switzerland had virtually decided on April 8 to pull back on existing projects and delay future assistance. Then, King Birendra bowed to the movement and ended the ban on political activity. The democracy movement took another week to force the resignation of the King's Prime Minister, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, and the dissolution of Parliament, paving the way for an opposition government and new elections.
The new 11-member government led by Mr. Bhattarai, which is to be installed Thursday, gives important economic posts like Industry, Commerce, Agriculture, Tourism and Land Reform to leftists. The Finance post went to Dhirendra Raj Pande, a prominent human-rights organizer and independent economist Mr. Bhattarai kept for himself the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Defense and Palace Affairs. The last post involves coordination with the 44-year-old King, who has ruled with nearly absolute power since 1972. Aides in the Nepalese Congress Party were given Ministries of Home Affairs, which involves control of law enforcement and the intelligence network, and Water Resources.
The international aid specialist said that donor nations, while impressed by Nepal's prudent management of its foreign-exchange reserves, credit restraints and budget management, were irked by its use of large amounts of money on projects. He estimated that more than $1 billion in aid has not been disbursed over several years because of poor handling of projects and administrative inefficiency.

HEADLINE: Census Chief Believes in Numbers and Optimism

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Long before she came to Washington, Barbara Everitt Bryant had established herself as an information-age alchemist, using survey research to transform the public's needs and habits into the numbers necessary to manage hospitals, television stations and schools.
Now, just four months after President Bush appointed her to be Director of the Federal Census Bureau, Dr. Bryant's skills are being put to a daunting test: She is being asked to rally an apathetic public and transform the problem-plagued census.
On Thursday, Dr. Bryant will appear before the Census and Population Subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee to try to explain an unexpectedly poor return rate of census forms - as of today, only 62 percent had been mailed back - and to say what she plans to do. Many in the bureau and Congress think the appearance will give Dr. Bryant, the 64-year-old executive of a Michigan survey-research firm, a chance to answer the one big question about her ability: whether she has the mettle to handle the political rough-and-tumble.
 
Going After Money
At the hearing, Dr. Bryant will be seeking at least $130 million to complete the census. She will also get barbed questions on what is going wrong, and why. 
''I knew I'd be jumping immediately into the tidal wave,'' she said. Although she worried ahead of time about taking control of a machine she had not designed, she has said nothing publicly about the stress of the past two weeks, since her people in the field let her know how far behind the mail-response rate was from the 70 percent rate originally projected.
Her response to these and other problems is dogged optimism. ''I think we at the Census Bureau always shoot for extremely high goals,'' she said. ''We'll count everybody, even if we do it door to door.''
Since the revelation of the low return rate, Dr. Bryant has run daily afternoon staff meetings, trying to pinpoint the cause. Much of the rest of her time has been spent trying to generate publicity for the census and logging mileage on the Suitland Parkway as she shuttles from her own meetings in Maryland to almost daily ones at the Commerce Department, 10 miles away.
 
Criticism Called Inevitable
''There's no way you're going to have that job right now and not have a lot of criticism,'' said Robert Teeter, once a campaign poll taker for George Bush. Mr. Teeter is a former colleague of Dr. Bryant at Market Opinion Research and the man who, as head of the President's transition team, suggested her for the job she considers ''the mountaintop of the field.''
Dr. Bryant was finally appointed by President Bush during Congress's Christmas break. The timing of the recess appointment, which filled a job that had been vacant for nearly a year, meant that she not only had to take over responsibility for a census on the eve of the massive operation, but that she would do so without Senate confirmation. Also, during the interregnum, a lot of management of the bureau had been picked up by the Department of Commerce's Division of Economic Affairs.
She had not been the White House's first choice. She won the appointment after White House officials, bruised by the rejection of John G. Tower's nomination as Defense Secretary, realized they would be courting another fight with Congressional Democrats if they persisted in their intention to nominate Alan Heslop, a Republican redistricting specialist from California. He provoked strong opposition from that state's Democratic Congressional delegation, who considered him far too partisan.
Dr. Bryant's stength, at a time when partisan nerves were raw, was her reputation for both technical competence and fairness. Her background in communications, Commerce Department officials said, was also a plus, since the 1990 head count would need a public relations effort.
''She's a very public person,'' said Mark Plant, a deputy Under Secretary at the Commerce Department. ''She is a very intelligent, bright woman walking into the biggest government operation outside of a war.'' Cheerleader or Quarterback? As for the census, Mr. Plant said: ''If anything was certain, it was that unforeseen circunmstances would come up. That's where the director of the census comes in. She calls herself a cheerleader. Cheerleader is too modest. She's the quarterback.''
Compared wtih some earlier census directors, he said, ''she's a much gentler person.'' Her approach, Mr. Plant said, ''plays well at the bureau.'' He added, ''It plays well upstairs.''
To the public Dr. Bryant's cheery manner and neatly coiffed white hair may seem oddly dissonant with her mission. ''The nature of the dissonance is that this is a high school math teacher; this is my grandmother, running a huge statistical agency,'' Mr. Plant said. ''It doesn't compute.''
For Census Bureau officials, she does compute. Several of her colleagues, preferring professional anonymity, refused to repeat for the record the complimentary things they say about her. Privately, they respect her as someone who talks their language and shares their values about how data should be produced, analyzed and distributed.
 
Biggest Place of All
At a time when many census bureau veterans are doubling or tripling their government salaries with jobs in the booming information industry, and when the political and legal pressures on the bureau are intense, Dr. Bryant wanted to move in the opposite direction. ''After a career in survey and market research, this is the biggest place of them all for doing the total census and the largest surveys,'' she said in an interview.
A generation ahead of the demographic curve, she started on her new career in 1961, after the youngest of her three children entered first grade. Oakland, a small university in Michigan, offered her a part-time job doing public relations and teaching science in the continuing-education program. Her neighbors disapproved, saying her decision to work would deprive her children.
She persisted. In 1965, she began graduate studies in communications, first at Oakland and later at the University of Michigan.
She had taken her undergraduate degree from Cornell University in physics, though her father had accused her of spending more time on the student newspaper, The Cornell Daily Sun, than in the lab.
 
Father Taught Engineering
But numbers fascinated her. At the age of 10, she was using a slide rule. ''Dad thought that anyone with his genes had to be good at math,'' she said. Her father, who taught engineering at the University of Ohio, became dean of the school of engineering at the University of Illinois.
When she was 8, her father asked her and her younger brother to solve a puzzle. The needles had fallen off the Christmas tree. He gave them a thimble, a cup, and a bucket and asked them to calculate how many needles the tree had shed. ''We figured out how many needles fit in a thimble, how many thimbles in a cup, how many cups in a bucket, and so on,'' she said. ''We figured out the number. I've forgotten it now.''
She met her husband, John H. Bryant, an engineer, at a party her father threw for students. Before their children were born, she worked as a science writer. When his work took him to the Detroit area, she continued her graduate studies in communications at the University of Michigan. Her work on her doctorate caught the eye of Mr. Teeter, who asked her to join his public opinion-research firm in 1970. There, while doing polling and survey research for health care agencies and transportation planners, she paid closer and closer attention to census data.
 
Changes in a Decade
By the mid-1980's, she had become head of a census advisory committee of the American Marketing Association and had gotten to know Vincent Barabba. A former census director now General Motors' executive director for market research and planning, he became legendary at Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Md., for his ability to rescue the troubled 1980 census and to maneuver within the Commerce Department and on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Barabba was one of the people she consulted before deciding to take the job, as was Mr. Teeter. Both encouraged her, but both pointed out the way the job had changed since 1980.
For one thing, since Mr. Barabba declined to make statistical adjustments in the 1980 count to compensate for the acknowledged undercount of minorities, more than 50 lawsuits had been filed seeking to force adjustment. In 1987, the Commerce Department took control of the adjustment issue - the biggest statistical policy question facing the bureau - as Under Secretary Robert Ortner announced the Commerce Department's opposition to statistical adjustment.
Last summer, in settling a lawsuit brought by New York City, the department agreed to consider adjusting the 1990 count.
In the decade between Mr. Barabba's departure and Dr. Bryant's arrival, the adjustment issue had been the cause not only of external lawsuits but bitter internal disputes, culminating with the 1988 departure of Barbara Bailor, the respected head of the bureau's Statistical Methods Division, after she switched to the pro-adjustment camp.
Her job, which had symbolized both statistical creativity and independence for the bureau, had been vacant since 1988, amid rumors, never confirmed, that all candidates had to convince the Commerce Department that they were anti-adjustment.
 
Professor Is Recruited
One of Dr. Bryant's first moves, since arriving last January, has been to appoint Robert M. Groves, a respected sociology professor from the University of Michigan, to fill the statistical-methods job.
The problems of the census have left Dr. Bryant scrambling to divide her time between managing the census and the bureau's budget planning for fiscal 1992. She is also trying to work on the two tasks closest to her heart: figuring out how to get more and better data out to the bureau's clients in government and business and industry, and how to find a way to make the census a smoother operation in the year 2000.
''I saw that coming in late I couldn't drastically change plans for this year,'' she said. ''But I could exercise some real leadership for the future.''

HEADLINE: Kansas City Rights Leaders Praise Supreme Court Ruling

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 18

 BODY:
Civil rights leaders here voiced satisfaction today over a Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of Federal judges to make local officials raise taxes to remedy problems left by a history of Kansas City school segregation.
But William Webster, the Missouri Attorney General, who had appealed lower-court decisions requiring costly actions by both the state and the Kansas City School District, found some consolation in the Court's ruling. He noted that the Court found that although a judge can order a local governing body to raise taxes, the court cannot directly impose the tax increase itself. 
''It's a victory for civil rights litigants,'' said Arthur A. Benson 2d, a lawyer for a group of plaintiffs in the city's long-running battle over desegregation. ''It affirms the principle that constitutional violations can and must be remedied, even if the remedy requires the constitutional violators to raise taxes, and whether or not their constituents are in favor of new taxes.''
 
Board President 'Delighted'
At a news conference this afternoon, Mr. Webster said requiring tax increases to be imposed by the school board was ''a positive step,'' because ''these school board members are elected and therefore accountable to those whom they represent.''
The school board has consistently sided with the plaintiffs in this case. ''I'm delighted,'' the board president, Julia Hill, said of today's ruling.
The legal battle began in 1977 when Mr. Benson, representing a group of schoolchildren and their parents, filed suit seeking to reverse the effects of local school segregation. Over the years, many whites had fled the school district, putting their children in mostly white private or suburban schools. Voters in the city, meanwhile, had rejected a series of proposed tax increases to pay for school improvements.
After a series of complicated interim rulings, Federal District Judge Russell G. Clark in 1986 ordered the state and the Kansas City School District to share the cost of a plan for city school improvements. When voters rejected tax increases to pay for them, Judge Clark in 1987 issued an order increasing the school district's property tax and imposing an income tax surcharge.
 
Many Paid Under Protest
The state appealed, with the Landmark Legal Foundation, a private group, joining the appeal on behalf of district taxpayers. At the Landmark Legal Foundation's urging, many residents paid the increased taxes under protest. That money was put into escrow.
In 1988, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, overturned the surcharge. It upheld the property tax increase, but it made a key modification. It required that the school board impose the increase, rather than Judge Clark.
The Supreme Court ruling today upheld that modification.
Since Judge Clark's original order, $36 million in tax increases have been paid under protest and held in escrow, according to Jerry Hill, president of Landmark.
About $10 million of the protested taxes were paid in 1987, the year of the direct imposition ordered by Judge Clark. Both Mr. Webster and Mr. Hill said today that they thought the money in escrow would be refunded to taxpayers, and Mr. Hill argued that all the increased taxes paid that year ($17 million was paid without protest) should be subject to refunds because they were unconstitutionally imposed by Judge Clark.
Questions about the taxes paid in protest since 1987, a total of $26 million, were settled by the Supreme Court today when it said they were properly imposed and collected.

HEADLINE: Zeal Won't Free Lithuania

 BODY:
There's no shortage of absolutism in the Soviet Union, Lithuania or the United States on the question of Lithuanian independence:
Soviet hard-liners believe that Mikhail Gorbachev, facing widespread unrest, must tolerate absolutely no impudence from the Lithuanians. Lithuanian patriots, rightly excited at the prospect of reclaiming their destiny, insist on driving to independence immediately. American true believers affirm that, as he loves freedom, President Bush must absolutely support that drive. 
On all sides, they act as though the only choice is to be purist or pusillanimous. But that's harsh, hasty and false. Despite Moscow's cutoff of oil supplies yesterday, there's still an honorable way to resolve the crisis. For all their reciprocal threats and bluster, Lithuania's leaders and President Gorbachev are groping for ways to work out their differences. And with measured skill, President Bush continues to encourage them to find a political solution to a political problem.
Mr. Bush rightly resists pressures to retaliate against Moscow over Lithuania. He warned Tuesday of ''appropriate responses'' if Moscow carried out its economic blockade. But he was careful not to draw lines in the sand.
His critics think they detect a pattern in his reactions to the violent crackdown in Tiananmen Square and the intimidation of Lithuania - indifference to human rights. But that misses a key distinction. Unlike those struggling for rights to be freer in China, Lithuanians seek to secede from the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev says he accepts their right to choose independence, if not their procedures. Having acknowledged the guarantee of self-determination in the Soviet Constitution, Mr. Gorbachev had a statute drafted to give it effect. But Lithuania's leaders did not wait. No lengthy due process slowed their annexation by the Soviets in 1940. Why go slow now in undoing it?
Even before the secession law was enacted, they declared independence. They also passed laws to form a militia, suspend the draft of Lithuanians, issue new national identity cards and take over buildings and factories that are, under Soviet law, Moscow's property.
Mr. Gorbachev then turned tough. He refused to talk to the Lithuanians until they backed down from these acts of self-determination. He reportedly came under pressure to take control of the republic, by force if necessary. Instead he has begun an economic blockade that he says will last until the Lithuanians repeal their new laws - though not necessarily their declaration of independence. In effect, he's floating a concession on a tide of threats.
Some Lithuanian leaders have sensed an opening and tried to enlarge it. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said she took ''Moscow's newer, softer position as a sign of their willingness to negotiate.'' Yesterday she persuaded the Lithuanian Parliament to halt new laws asserting independence. She has also hinted at suspending implementation of other new laws. Those conciliatory gestures may not satisfy Mr. Gorbachev but they betoken political realism in Vilnius.
Compromise would be unwarranted if Moscow were still trying to deny self-rule. But it's not. It's contesting the pace of secession and the interim rules. Those are matters for political dialogue, not zealous purism.

HEADLINE: Miracle on 42d Street

 BODY:
Finally, it looks like a go. The redevelopment of shabby West 42d Street, an ambitious idea born two decades ago and then delayed by esthetic objections, lawsuits and economic pressures, has taken a giant stride toward reality.
It won't be easy, given the troubled real estate market. But by signing a condemnation order yesterday allowing the state's Urban Development Corporation to take title to most of the site, State Supreme Court Justice Stanley Parness opened the way. That, and a $241 million letter of credit from the developers, mean the transformation of 13 deteriorated, dangerous acres in midtown could actually begin in the fall. 
The saga of 42d Street means something even more profound: It proves that New York has learned from its costly mistakes how to Build Big. Westway, the proposed highway on Manhattan's Hudson River shoreline, died five years ago, a victim of litigation and naive, ill-coordinated political leadership. By contrast, every official involved in the 42d Street project, led by Gov. Mario Cuomo and former Mayor Edward Koch, worked to common purpose.
The result: 43 lawsuits won, only two minor cases still pending, and the prospect of reclaiming what should be a dazzling stretch of urban life. To get to this point, city and state officials have managed to deal with a collection of remarkably diverse interests. For instance, producers and preservationists are concerned about grace and taste for Broadway; community activists are intent on retaining 42d Street's honky-tonk environment, and neighborhood residents are worried about their homes.
The project involves rebuilding eight treasured but dilapidated theaters, constructing four office towers, renovating the Times Square subway station, creating 16,000 construction jobs and 20,000 permanent jobs and, eventually, building a hotel and merchandise mart.
The Great White Way, people used to call the area. They may call it that again, for New York officials are now free to show they can build as big as they think.

HEADLINE: Legislators Tangle Over Trenton Budget

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 18

 BODY:
Republican legislators tangled repeatedly today with their Democratic colleagues and members of the Florio administration as hearings opened on an austere budget everyone agrees will cost taxpayers more and give them less.
Republicans accused the Democratic Governor, Jim Florio, of stifling debate, gagging department heads and pulling the strings of Democratic leaders to ram through a $12.1 billion budget that promises substantially higher taxes and sharply reduced services across the board.
Assemblyman Rodney Frelinghuysen, the ranking Republican on the Joint Appropriations Committee, warned of a ''rush to higher taxes'' that ''may very well be leading our state on the road to economic disaster.''
He also accused the administration of trying to ''railroad'' the budget through the Legislature and vowed, ''I won't be gagged.'' 
 
'A Puppet Show'
Another Republican, State Senator John H. Ewing of Somerset County, charged that ''Governor Florio has turned the budget process into a puppet show in which he controls the strings.''
''The puppeteer has arranged things in such a way as to make informed decisions impossible,'' he said.
There was considerable difference on who should be blamed, but all sides agreed that the state was in the midst of a fiscal crisis.
Democrats blamed former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who in eight years in office presided over a state budget that doubled from $6 billion to $12 billion, with a deficit that, without drastic cuts and new taxes, threatens to go well over $1 billion next year.
The Republicans did not address that criticism head on, but instead maintained that Mr. Kean's successor, Governor Florio, and the Democrats were exaggerating the fiscal crunch in a bid to wrest total control of the purse strings from the Legislature and into the Governor's office and to lay on excessive new taxes.
They suggested even sharper budget cuts and little or no new taxes.
Although the Office of Legislative Services projected revenues about $175 million higher than the administration's estimates over the current and next year's budgets, it agreed revenues remain ''far short'' of supporting the recommended spending without new revenues.
 
Pessimistic Estimates
State Senator Laurence Weiss, the Middlesex Democrat who is chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee and Governor Florio's legislative point-man on the budget, called it ''New Jersey's worst budget crisis in history.'' He based his assessment on the administration's more pessimistic estimates.
Confronted with a $590 million shortfall in the budget for the fiscal year ending June 30 and $1.4 billion over two years, the budget calls both for new revenues and reduced spending to balance the budget. Neither is likely to be popular in a state that already has a high tax burden but benefited in recent years from a strong economy that made the burden bearable and state service expenditures ample.
Beyond the treacherous political situation that creates for the Governor - who is clearly trying to get the crisis behind him early in his new four-year term - the tightly controlled method he is using to contain it is raising criticisms of its own.
Rather than calling all or most of the state's 19 department heads to answer questions about the new budget, which includes such politically sensitive items as an increase in the state sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent and elimination of $305 million in homeowner property-tax rebates, the Democratic leadership opted to call only Treasurer Douglas Berman to answer legislators' questions about the budget.
Republican legislators charged that the order to do so came directly from Mr. Florio. Senator Weiss repeatedly denied this, saying the departure from tradition was entirely his idea, although a Democratic colleague conceded that changing the mode of debate was ''admininistration prerogative.''
 
Tactics Could Backfire
While Republicans complained loudly in public over the change, even some Democrats conceded privately that the Governor's close-to-the-chest tactics could backfire.
Besides the decision not to call department heads to testify, ostensibly by the Democratic leadership, Governor Florio has himself mandated that all news releases in the executive branch, not only on the budget but on all other matters as well, go through his office.
This has made not only the Republicans but also reporters restive. A news article Monday in The Trentonian, with the headline ''King Florio and palace guard keep tight hold on power,'' got wide circulation and set off wide discussion in Statehouse corridors.
Mr. Berman also reminded the committee that it was Governor Kean who as late as last October was predicting a $300 million surplus by the end of the fiscal year in June, while it actually is turning out to be a $590 million deficit.
 
Broad Range of New Taxes
It is the shortfall, the admnistratin says, that will require a broad range of new taxes, as well as elimination of about 1,480 state jobs and spending reductions at state colleges and universities that could cut an additional 1,400 jobs.
The proposed budget also cuts state aid to public schools to the lowest level since 1977, recommends no funds for capital construction and a static subsidy for mass transit that will mean a fare rise of 15 percent along with service reductions.
The budget also recommends a wide range of other cuts, including $3 million from the $8 million allocated for community drug programs, $1.2 million from the $17.8 million for AIDS-related programs, and about half of the $18 million for the State Council on the Arts.

HEADLINE: Bush Denies Putting Off Action On Averting Global Climate Shift

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
President Bush, responding to criticism that the United States had delayed taking concrete steps to address the threat of global warming linked to pollution, said today, ''We have never considered research a substitute for action.''
Closing a two-day White House conference on the issue, Mr. Bush said: ''To those who suggest we're only trying to balance economic growth and environmental protection, I say they miss the point. We are calling for an entirely new way of thinking, to achieve both while compromising neither, by applying the power of the marketplace in the service of the environment.''
Mr. Bush also proposed a series of steps for integrating international responses to the issue of global climate change. They included an international ''charter'' for cooperation in science and economics related to global change, a statement of principles to guide such research, the creation of international research institutes and a communications network to monitor global changes. 
 
Criticism From Europeans
Although Administration officials said the drafting of the speech had begun some time ago, Mr. Bush's remarks clearly addressed concerns voiced Tuesday by European delegates to the 18-nation conference who complained that the United States only wanted to discuss the scientific and economic uncertainties surrounding the issue rather than specific remedial action.
White House officials warned on Tuesday of the potentially huge cost of reducing the pollution that many scientists believe will raise the temperature of the earth's surface in the next century. They said more research was needed into the economic and scientific uncertainties.
At today's session, a document was inadvertently released, revealing specific proposals made by Mr. Bush later in the day. The document was written in the form of a resolution, seemingly for the approval of the conference.
Many of the delegates protested vigorously when they were given the document, saying they could not approve such sweeping proposals with only a short time to study them. Several commented that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change convened by the United Nations was doing a good job and that there was no need to create more institutions to address the problem.
Within an hour, the United States re-issued the paper with a cover sheet saying that it had been released in error and was not meant to be acted on by this conference.
White House officials were uneasy over the unauthorized release to reporters of a document containing ''talking points'' for use by American delegates to the conference. Among the points listed under ''debates to avoid'' was the statement that it was ''not beneficial to discuss whether there is or is not'' global warming or how much or how little warming. ''In the eyes of the public,'' it went on, ''we will lose this debate. A better approach is to raise the many uncertainties that need to be better understood on this issue.''
 
Suspicions of Environmentalists
A spokesman for the President's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, a co-chairman of the conference, said the talking points had been prepared by the conference staff to assist the American delegation.
Environmentalists who provided the document to reporters said it confirmed their suspicions that the conference was called by the White House to plead scientific uncertainty as an excuse for delaying action to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other industrial gases in the atmosphere. Such gases, many scientists contend, will cause a substantial warming of the globe because they retain infrared radiation from the sun that would otherwise be reflected back into space.
Several European officials praised Mr. Bush's speech today, saying it was an improvement over his remarks on Tuesday, which stressed the need for more research. Bert Bolin of Sweden, the chairman of the intergovernmental panel, said, ''I take the President's speech to be a clear signal to proceed very vigorously with what we are trying to do with the I.P.C.C.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins Names Executive Panel On Volunteers

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
To encourage businesses and foundations to adopt programs that need money and manpower, Mayor David N. Dinkins named a committee of business executives yesterday to coordinate volunteer efforts in New York City.
Mr. Dinkins said the committee, which will be known as the Mayor's Committee for Public-Private Partnerships, would expand existing volunteer eforts and develop new ones. The panel will work with a newly created unit at City Hall, the Office of Partnership Programs, he said. 
The Mayor named Carl Spielvogel, the chairman and chief executive officer of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., to head the committee. Larry Bortoluzzi, who headed economic development efforts in the Manhattan Borough President's office when Mr. Dinkins had that job, has been chosen director of the partnership programs office. Mr. Bortoluzzi will report to First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel.
 
Examples Offered
Mr. Dinkins cited several examples of joint efforts between public and private groups, saying he hoped that the committee and the partnership programs office would find ways to copy them. These were among the ventures he mentioned:
* A program - agreed to by the City Bar Association and the city's Human Rights Commissioner, Dennis deLeon - to recruit and train lawyers to handle discrimination cases on a pro bono basis.
* A plan for the city and Mr. Spielvogel's ad agency to adopt We Can, an organization that redeems empty bottles and cans collected by homeless people. We Can collection boxes will be placed in city-owned office buildings and in Backer Spielvogel Bates offices in the Chrysler Building.
* A pilot program run by the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and the Village Nursing Home to bring corporate sponsors together with groups that work with people who have AIDS.
* Adopt-a-Park programs involving Samuel LeFrak, the builder, who will redevelop the landscaping around Willow Lake in Flushing Meadow Park; the Combat roach-control unit of Shulton Inc., which has adopted the Cedar Sedgewick park in the Bronx and will subsidize a summer program for children there, and Grenadier Realty, which has promised to pay for a full-time recreation specialist at the Breukelen Houses Playground, in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
City officials said the leaders of the programs mentioned by the Mayor had agreed to urge other businesses and individuals to join in volunteering. These are the vice chairmen of the committee:
 
Donald Platten, chairman emeritus of Chemical Bank.
Margaret Mahoney, president, Commonwealth Fund.
Horace Morris, executive vice president, the United Way.
Lewis Rudin, president, Rudin Management Company.
Lawrence Tisch, president and chief executive officer, CBS Inc.
J. Richard Munro, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, Time Warner Inc.
James Robinson, chairman, president and chief executive officer, American Express Company.

HEADLINE: Takeovers Face New Obstacles

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's capital, a long-running battle is being watched in corporate board rooms across the country because it raises issues that will affect how American companies are managed in the 1990's.
Within days, Pennsylvania is expected to enact the most far-reaching anti-takeover law in the nation. To be sure, the corporate buying spree of the last decade has slowed strikingly with the economy sluggish, the junk bond market in a shambles and other takeover financing getting tighter.
But the Pennsylvania law would make it more difficult not only for hostile predators to buy a company with headquarters in the state but also for dissatisfied shareholders to change management through tactics like proxy fights.
 
Statutes in Other States
The Pennsylvania measure is the most sweeping, but other states, including Indiana, Ohio and Delaware, have enacted anti-takeover statutes in recent years. And Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts signed a bill yesterday to increase the protections for its companies. State and Federal courts have also made a series of rulings making it harder to force changes in corporate control. 
Behind the debate in Pennsylvania is a power struggle between the shareholders who own corporations and the directors and managers who run them. In this case, Pennsylvania business groups supporting the bill are aligned with unions seeking to protect the jobs of their members and local politicians worried about the impact of corporate takeovers on communities.
The bill's supporters point to a wave of populist revulsion with the takeover boom of the 1980's and say the statute is just what corporate America needs. It will free companies, they insist, from living in constant fear of being taken over and will allow them to invest to become more competitive rather than worry about increasing quarterly profits to ward off raiders.
 
S.E.C. Chief Among Critics
But critics, including economists and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, say that moves like the Pennsylvania bill, however well intentioned, will only make American industry less competitive by protecting incompetent managers from being ousted. The law may also be challenged on constitutional grounds of hindering interstate trade and conflicting with Federal securities laws.
The Pennsylvania bill has already overwhelmingly passed both chambers of the Legislature, and the Governor has pledged to sign it.
Its ground-breaking provision requires any person or investment institution owning more than 20 percent of a company's shares for less than two years to forfeit - or ''disgorge'' - any profit on shares sold within 18 months after a failed buyout or proxy fight. The disgorgement provision increases the potential losses to raiders, should they fail.
A ''control share'' provision in the bill would prohibit a shareholder with more than 20 percent of the company from voting his or her own shares to change corporate control, without the approval of the remaining shareholders. And another provision places others - employees, suppliers, or any other identifiable group - on the same footing with shareholders in giving them a say in board decisions.
 
Blunt Criticisms
Harvey J. Goldschmid, a professor in securities law at the Columbia University Law School, said the disgorgement provision was ''clearly one of the most significant and least wise provisions passed by any state legislature.'' It is an unwarranted deterrant to hostile takeovers, and proxy fights, he said, that makes management less accountable to shareholders.
Other critics were even more blunt. Too many corporate managements, said Senator Vincent Fumo, the ranking Democrat on the Pennsylvania Senate Appropriations Committee, are merely ''hacks trying to protect their fat-cat jobs.'' He added, ''I see this bill as a catastrophe and I'm offended as someone who believes in capitalism.''
But in the Pennsylvania Legislature, Mr. Fumo is an exception. The bill passed the state Senate by 45 to 4 last December, and the House this month by 182 to 10.
 
Proponents Equally Passionate
Proponents of the measure are equally passionate, viewing it as a way to protect companies and workers' jobs from becoming the playthings of big investment funds, which often profit from takeovers. ''Pension funds want to see companies in play,'' said Clifford L. Jones, president of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry.
Advocates of the bill contend it is intended to let Pennsylvania corporations - like H. J. Heinz, Scott Paper, Westinghouse Electric and Conrail -operate for the long term, unimpaired by raiders.
''We've seen our country go from a major world power to the now-nowism of a short-term orientation,'' said Steven H. Wallman, a lawyer at the Washington firm of Covington & Burling, who drafted the bill. ''The Pennsylvania vote shows we want to go back to that long-term view.''
 
Effect of Local Politics
The overwhelming support for the bill is explained less by philosophy than by local politics. Politicians, business executives and organized labor view it as a means of protecting local jobs and communities.
''Once a company is in play, from what we see, that starts the death dance on the corporation,'' said William M. George, a steelworker and secretary-treasurer of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. The bill includes a provision requiring anyone acquiring a Pennsylvania company to honor all existing labor contracts.
The bill's opponents also lobbied hard. These critics were a diverse group, including the Belzberg family of Canada, which is engaged in a proxy fight to take over Armstrong World Industries in Lancaster, Pa., as well as large institutional investors and public officials like Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the S.E.C.
Even some leading Pennsylvania companies had qualms. Westinghouse, for instance, reluctantly supported the bill only after a provision was added allowing it and other companies to ''opt out'' of the measure.
But local politics prevailed. ''If you are a representative or a senator, are you more interested in the Belzbergs or in seeing your community prosper?'' Mr. Jones, the State Chamber of Commerce president, asked.
 
Slower Pace of Takeovers
Even without laws like the one in Pennsylvania, the pace of corporate takeovers has slowed considerably. Potential buyers have found the financing for big takeovers in short supply, and courts have increasingly ruled in favor of measures that deter acquisitions.
In 1987, the United States Supreme Court upheld an Indiana statute that limited takeover activity in that state by requiring certain hostile bidders to obtain approval of ''disinterested'' shareholders in order to vote their own shares. Other states followed suit by enacting similar measures.
Last February a three-judge panel of the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that corporations had the right to decide their own future rather than having to sell to the highest bidder. The suit was a reaffirmation of a decision in a case brought by Paramount Communications Inc., which had tried to block the offer by Time Inc. to buy Warner Communications Inc.
Still, a constitutional challenge to the Pennsylvania law seems likely, Professor Goldschmid of Columbia said. And Mr. Breeden has said that the S.E.C. may try to use Federal laws to invalidate portions of the Pennsylvania bill.
Large institutional investors, who now own nearly 50 percent of the equity in American corporations, have been most irked by the Pennsylvania law's provisions that discourage proxy contests. The fund managers do not want to acquire companies, but they increasingly want a say in the management and policies of companies in which they invest heavily. Proxy fights, with shareholders voting for or against changes, provide the means for big investors to exercise their influence.
With proxy contests becoming more frequent as a way to change corporate policies or to take over a company, pension funds and institutional investors are becoming more powerful. They have been sought after in a variety of recent proxy battles designed to change corporate control - but with mixed success.
Coniston Partners, for example, is using a proxy fight to try to unseat the board at the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines. And BTR P.L.C. is engaged in a similar proxy battle at the Norton Company, a Massachusetts-based maker of abrasives, as part of a $1.6 billion bid.
This month, the Torchmark Corporation began a proxy battle to change the board at the American General Corporation, as a prelude to a $6.4 billion takeover of the insurance company. Pension funds were successful in gaining representation on the board of the Lockheed Corporation after backing the corporate raider Harold C. Simmons in a proxy fight in a losing effort to take over the aerospace company. It was the Belzberg proxy assault on Armstrong that spawned the Pennsylvania bill.
The biggest investment institutions, like the $60 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, have grown so large that the number of companies they can invest in is increasingly limited. They face a predicament in that they often cannot sell shares in a particular corporation without losing large amounts of money themselves.
Investment fund managers say their activism should be a force for improving competitiveness.
This position, however, has not stopped some institutions - among them, public pension funds in California, New York, Massachusetts and Florida - from threatening to reassess their Pennsylvania holdings.
''Who would want to put their money in Pennsylvania corporations if their profits could be jeopardized?'' Elizabeth Holtzman, Comptroller of the City of New York, asked. ''This legislation could well backfire.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Fall Sharply; Rates Soar

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates rose yesterday to their highest levels since last May, as prices of Treasury notes and bonds fell for the fourth straight day.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 1/2, down more than 1 1/4 points, or more than $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.83 percent. Late Tuesday the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.70 percent.
Bond traders looked past the best monthly merchandise trade report in more than six years. The trade deficit shrank to $6.49 billion in February, with both imports and exports lower. 
 
Ignored by the Markets
''I thought the trade report was very good,'' said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh. ''But it seems as if the credit markets are ignoring some of the near-term positives and are beginning to focus instead on some longer-term anxieties.''
An array of investors were reported to be selling securities. Traders at several investment firms said domestic investors were big sellers of intermediate-term note issues. And rumors persisted that Japanese accounts continued to unload bonds.
''I have heard rumors that $6 billion worth of bonds were sold in the last week or so,'' said one bond trader at a large Japanese investment bank. ''We have seen some Japanese selling, but nothing of a size that would lead to that sort of a number.''
 
Rising Inflation
Remarks by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, helped fuel the downturn. In an interview in Los Angeles with Reuters, Mr. Parry noted that so far this year inflation was running at a higher rate than in 1989 and said that the Federal Reserve needed to take steps to deal with the problem.
''In my way of thinking, inflation is worse,'' Mr. Parry told the news service. ''The Fed must set an objective to get it down and do it.''
James A. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities, said: ''The market was trying to recover when that story was printed. It had a noticeable negative effect.''
Even with the big rise in market interest rates over the last two days, Mr. Capra said, conditions are still unfavorable.
''Most portfolio investors are already heavily invested and don't have a lot of new cash to commit,'' he said. ''And liquidity on the Street is pretty limited.''
Specifically, worries about the upcoming Treasury refunding auctions are increasing, market participants said. Those concerns have been accentuated by the rumors of widespread sales of bonds by big Japanese institutions.
Prices of Treasury securities fell across the board yesterday, with bonds dropping the most.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 14/32 in late trading, down 15/32, to yield 8.73 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 23/32, down 5/32, to yield 8.65 percent.
The Treasury announced late yesterday that it would sell $10.5 billion of new two-year notes on April 25.
 
Bill Rates Rise
Treasury bill rates rose again. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.74 percent, up 5 basis points. Six-month bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.77 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.76 percent, up 8 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The big rise in interest rates did not dissuade one corporate borrower, Ontario Hydro, from pricing a $600 million offering of five-year notes.
The 9 1/4 percent notes, which mature May 1, 1995, were priced at 100, 50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent five-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead manager for the transaction, which is rated triple A by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Demand for the issue was so strong that it was increased from $500 million.
New issues in the tax-exempt municipal bond market were highlighted by the negotiated sale of $172.72 million of triple tax-exempt bonds from the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Corporation.
The bulk of the issue consists of serial bonds from 1990 to 2007. Coupons on the bonds range from 6 percent in 1990 to 7.40 percent in 2007.
Citicorp Investment Bank acted as lead manager for the underwriting, which is rated AA by Standard & Poor's but is not rated by Moody's.
 
Secondary Market Falls
The selloff in Treasury securities continued to hurt prices in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds.
Dealers said prices of most long-term bonds fell by about 3/4 point. Intermediate-term issues slipped by about 1/2 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most actively traded issues fell by about 1/4 point, market participants said.

HEADLINE: Some Smog in Pledges To Help Environment

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
On the bottom of the paperboard container that McDonald's uses for its hash-brown potatoes is the three-arrow symbol that generally denotes a product made of recycled material, and the words ''Recyclable Paper.'' But McDonald's officials concede that the package is not made of recycled paper, is not being recycled and may not even be capable of being recycled because of a promotional label glued to the back.
''It's a little embarrassing,'' said Shelby Yastrow, McDonald's senior vice president for environmental affairs. ''We're going to take the recycling logo off everything except what we are actually recycling.''
 
Meaningless, False Claims
Such labeling typifies what many environmentalists view as a flood of meaningless, irrelevant or false claims being made by corporations trying to look environmentally sensitive, or green. With the 20th anniversary of Earth Day approaching, and major environmental legislation like the clean air measure nearing passage, the number of such claims has been increasing. 
To be sure, many American companies have made sincere efforts in recent months to improve their environmental record. McDonald's, for example, said this week that it would spend $100 million on recycled construction materials used in building and remodeling its restaurants. Last week, the Star-Kist subsidiary of H. J. Heinz said it would stop buying tuna caught by methods that injure dolphins, and most of the industry quickly followed.
But spokesmen for environmental organizations say other moves have been merely window dressing.
''The nature of American business has not changed,'' said Alan Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''Right now the environment is a marketing trend they have to respond to. Three years from now, they will be doing something else as socioeconomic issues change.''
Examples of claims that are not what they seem to be abound. Some marketers of cosmetics labeled ''cruelty free'' may not have actually tested the ingredients in them on animals for toxicity. But the ingredients are often purchased from companies that did such testing, said Jacquelyn Ottman, a marketing consultant in New York.
Claims that a particular brand of toilet paper is made from recycled paper may be similarly confusing, said researchers at Arthur D. Little Inc., a consulting firm. ''What the consumer may not realize is that almost all toilet paper on the market today is made from recycled fibers,'' the consulting company said in a recent report.
 
An 'Ozone Friendly' Spray
Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, the Attorney General of Minnesota, recently cited the case of a hair-care product, White Rain Styling Mousse, that was labeled ''ozone friendly,'' apparently because it had eliminated ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant. For one thing, such CFC's are banned by Federal regulation from all but a few aerosol products. Worse, he added that the substitute, with volatile organic solvents like butane and propane, was an important contributor to smog closer to earth.
Another product cited by Mr. Humphrey as making misleading claims is Arrid Extra Dry deodorant, for which some cans proclaim, ''Safe for the Ozone Layer.''
Mr. Humphrey and seven other state law enforcement officers, including New York's, recently formed a group to challenge deceptive or misleading environmental claims for products.
Under pressure from the group and the Federal Trade Commission, the Mobil Corporation recently said it would remove the term ''degradable'' from boxes of its Hefty plastic trash bags. The bags contain a chemical agent that promotes degradation in the presence of sunlight, but because the vast majority end up buried in landfills, the claim was misleading, the officials said. First Brands, which makes Glad Bags, took similar action.
Mr. Humphrey said at a recent conference on packaging that unless false or meaningless environmental claims are curbed, ''consumers will grow as disillusioned about the environment as they are about cholesterol.''
''Wrapping a product in a green package is not enough,'' he added.
 
Caution on Claims
The drive to appear green is being fueled by the rising environmental consciousness of American consumers. ''Just as the 80's saw a proliferation of 'light' products designed to meet growing health awareness, the 90's will be the decade of 'green' products,'' said Dorothy MacKenize, head of product development for the Michael Peters Group, a package design firm.
But environmental advocates say claims that products are labeled ''environmentally friendly'' and ''good for the environment'' should be treated with the skepticism reserved for foods said to be ''organic'' or ''cholesterol free.''
''Many of these claims are dubious at best and outright wrong at worst,'' said Jonathan Schorsch, a researcher with the Council on Economic Priorities, a consumer-oriented group.
''Caveat emptor still holds,'' Mr. Schorsch said. ''Just because a polystyrene container is labeled recyclable, it does not mean much if the nearest recycling plant is hundreds of miles away.''
Indeed, when Heinz announced recently that it would introduce a new type of plastic ketchup bottle that will be labeled ''recyclable,'' officials of the National Resources Defense Council said they would challenge the assertion in places where no recycling programs for such plastics are in existence.
David Ruder, Heinz vice president for consumer products, said the company would use the year before the new bottle is introduced to help start recycling programs. And he said the label would help educate customers about how to recycle plastics.
 
Labels Criticized
Many other packaged-products companies are doing things like putting the three-arrows symbol on products and labeling them ''recyclable.'' But environmentalists point out that virtually everything is recyclable with enough time and effort. They say adding labels like ''recyclable'' and ''degradable'' is a cheap way of looking green without getting involved in the hard work of reducing solid waste.
In the case of the McDonald's hash-brown container, Mr. Yastrow said he was unaware until recently that the recycling symbol was on the package. He said that in years past, environmental groups had urged the company to use the symbol to educate customers that paper products could be recycled.
Even companies that do not do business directly with the public are stressing their concern for the environment. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association recently began what it calls its ''responsible care'' program. It includes assurances that the industry will pay more attention to health, safety and the environment.
But even Chemical Week magazine, a trade publication that is hardly hostile to the industry, said that the program might have little practical effect because it ''imposes no timetable or quantitative standards to achieve its goals.''
The conflict between image building and actual practice was highlighted at a recent exhibit in Washington called ''Earth Tech.'' At the exhibit, companies like Du Pont and USX emphasized efforts like the use of bacteria to clean up contaminated waste sites and materials conservation through recycling.
 
Diversion Seen
But some environmentalists said the exhibit was an attempt to divert attention from the pollutants these big industrial companies emit in the course of their operations each year. Peter Bahouth, director of Greenpeace U.S.A., denounced it as ''a slick opportunity for some companies to greenwash their dirt.''
John McAllister, an environmental affairs official for Du Pont, agreed that the company wants to improve its image. ''We want to show technology that now and in the immediate future will contribute to sustainable development.''
Some of the ''green'' assertions being made demonstrate considerable imagination. Speaking for the paper industry, John A. Luke, the chairman of the Westvaco Corporation, acknowledged that the industry pumps 250 million tons of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere each year. But, he said, trees on company-owned land absorb one billion tons of the substance each year, which he described as ''a very favorable 4-to-1 ratio.''
In addition, he said, the trees emit 750 million tons of oxygen a year. These activities, Mr. Luke said, ''are superb environmental contributions which no other industry can claim.''
A Westvaco spokesman had no immediate response to the observation that the trees would have absorbed the carbon dioxide and emitted the oxygen even if not owned by paper companies.
 
Credit Sought
Alan Lucier, a forestry specialist with the paper industry, said the companies deserved some environmental credit for growing trees on worn out farmland and managing them for faster growth.
For consumer products companies, so-called green consumerism is becoming increasingly important as surveys indicate that customers will choose items that appear to be environmentally friendly over those that do not. One, by the Michael Peters Group, found that 78 percent of consumers said they would pay more for a product made of recycled or biodegradable materials and that 53 percent had declined to buy a product because of environmental concerns.
Patrick A. Carson, a vice president of Loblaw's, Canada's largest food store chain, said, ''We are in the early stages of a green revolution'' in which buyers ''will vote at the cash register on ethical, moral and environmental issues.''
He said when the company offered toilet tissue made of recycled paper, it was the chain's ''best launch in history.''

HEADLINE: Seamen's Bank Seized; Chase Buys Its Deposits

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Seamen's Bank for Savings, which was formed in 1839 to encourage thrift among seamen, was put under the control of Federal regulators at the close of business yesterday. All of its deposits were bought by the Chase Manhattan Bank, which will begin operating Seamen's 13 branches today.
The Seamen's Bank fell on hard times in the early 1980's when sharply higher interest rates paid on deposits caused losses at many savings banks. The losses from high interest rates were compounded in 1987 and 1988 when Seamen's invested heavily in new kinds of mortgage-backed securities. The securities failed to protect the company from fluctuating interest rates and, instead, resulted in large losses. In the first nine months of 1989, Seamen's lost $166.8 million. 
The Federal takeover of Seamen's is expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $350 million to $400 million, according to Alan Whitney, a spokesman for the F.D.I.C. The Government insurance fund, with assets of about $14 billion, will sell Seamen's assets, including loans and securities, and use the proceeds to repay creditors other than depositors. The F.D.I.C insurance fund is separate from the reorganized insurance fund created by Congress last year to rescue the savings and loan industry. $5 Million Price Chase, which will rename the branches, plans to combine Seamen's $2.1 billion of deposits and 13 branches with the $13.7 billion of consumer deposits and 185 Chase branches in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County. For the right to buy the deposits, Chase paid $5 million, beating the price offered by another, unidentified bidder. Chase said it planned to honor the interest rates on all Seamen's deposits until they mature.
Chase has set up a phone line at 800-862-4273 for customers with questions about their deposits. Seamen's customers with questions about loans from the bank may call the F.D.I.C. in New York City at 212-428-4560.
''Chase is getting a pretty good franchise,'' said Henry S. Peltz, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm. Like other savings banks in the New York market, Seamen's branches operated with much higher levels of deposits than normal at commercial banks.
Besides the benefits of a larger deposit base, Chase expects to benefit by offering Seamen's customers various other services like credit cards and personal loans.
The collapse of Seamen's comes at a time when a consolidation of savings banks in New York is moving ahead on several fronts.
Mr. Peltz said that even strong savings banks would consider partners because they ''recognize that size and economies of scale are critical to profitability and meeting capital guidelines.''
Among financially strong savings banks, the Manhattan Savings Bank agreed in recent months to be acquired by the Republic New York Corporation, which will merge it with the Williamsburgh Savings Bank. Apple Savings Bank has rejected a $38-a-share bid from Stanley Stahl, a New York developer, for stock he does not already own.
Home Savings Bank, Brooklyn, is discussing a merger with the Bowery Savings Bank, a unit of H. F. Ahmanson & Company. And Crossland Savings of Brooklyn, the largest savings bank on the East Coast, is working on plans to raise new capital after the breakdown of negotiations to obtain a $150 million capital injection from the Coast-to-Coast Financial Corporation of Chicago.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Begin Production Of a Battery-Powered Car

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 18

 BODY:
Responding to concerns about poor air quality, the General Motors Corporation announced today that it would proceed with commercial production of a battery-powered electric car for personal use.
Despite the announcement, the project seemed to remain somewhat speculative. G.M. acknowledged that a number of technical, regulatory and market uncertainties had not been cleared up. Indeed, G.M. cited competitive reasons for declining to answer the most critical questions about when or where it would begin production of the car and what technology would be used. 
G.M. had displayed a battery-powered car called the Impact in January and said it would decide on the commercial feasibility of the vehicle within a few months. The Impact would be the basis for the car that G.M. said it would produce.
 
Timely Announcement
The announcement that the company planned to begin production was made by Roger B. Smith, the chairman of G.M., at the National Press Club in Washington. The announcement came less than a week before Earth Day and at a time when Congress is considering broad clean-air legislation that could force auto makers to put new pollution controls on their vehicles.
A spokesman said later that the company had not established a definite date and place for the start of production.
Mr. Smith said G.M.'s goal was to be ''the first automobile company since the early days of the auto industry to mass-produce an electric car'' that is safe, performs well and that consumers find appealing.
''What that means is that the Impact is suitable for most urban drivers' daily activities,'' he added.
G.M. has said the car will accelerate from standstill to 60 miles an hour in eight seconds and run for 125 miles before its battery needs recharging. The Big Three and some foreign auto makers have also been testing battery-powered vans.
 
Support for Zero Emissions
Mr. Smith said that public and governmental reaction to the Impact has been positive since G.M. began displaying a prototype at auto shows in Los Angeles, Chicago and Geneva. ''People are concerned about the range of the car, but they're also very much impressed by the fact that Impact produces zero emissions,'' he said.
In the late 1970's, at the height of the energy crisis, G.M. said it would be building 100,000 battery-powered cars a year by 1984, a plan that was abandoned for lack of interest by the public, a company spokesman said.
Mr. Smith said the technology had improved, ''so it's possible to do this with a fresh design.''
G.M. is seeking changes in Federal regulations to make production of the car more feasible, Mr. Smith said. Although he was not specific, he said that current safety standards were meant for the size and weight of internal combustion cars.
G.M. will also lobby the Government for electric cars to be counted in the calculation of corporate average fuel economy, he said.
 
The Battery Problem
But the biggest question is about the vehicle's power source, its battery. Scientists who worked on the Impact prototype noted that it used conventional lead-acid batteries, which emit relatively little power and must be replaced each year at considerable expense.
Noting that the battery ''is such an essential piece of the final picture,'' Mr. Smith said developing one for commercial production might require ''a broad-based development effort, one that involves not only the entire domestic auto industry and the Government, but the electric utility industry as well.''

HEADLINE: Media General Has 77.3% Fall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RICHMOND, April 18

 BODY:
Media General Inc. today reported a 77.3 percent decline in its first-quarter profit from the period a year earlier as newspaper earnings contracted because of a downturn in advertising.
The company said income in the first quarter of 1989 had been helped by a one-time gain. 
Excluding that, earnings this year were down 56.3 percent. Total revenue slipped slightly. ''Although 1990 revenue growth is expected, the uncertainty of the economy currently is clouding the earnings outlook,'' said James S. Evans, the company's president and chief executive.
Net income fell to $2.7 million, or 10 cents a share, from $11.9 million, or 46 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1989. Last year's earnings included an after-tax gain of $5.7 million, or 22 cents a share, from the sale of a California newsprint recycling mill.
Revenue declined to $148 million, from $149.3 million in last year's quarter.
Media General is the parent of The Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Richmond News Leader and other daily newspapers as well as several broadcast operations. Broadcast profits rose by 2.5 percent in the period.

HEADLINE: U.S. Assailed Over Trade

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 18

 BODY:
The European Community today accused the United States of undermining world trading rules through what it said was an array of unfair trade practices.
In its annual report, the European Community's Executive Commission criticized unilateral action by Washington against trade partners to force them to change. 
''The practices identified in this report raise doubts whether the United States is sufficiently committed to the multilateral system which provides the main reference point for resolving disputes,'' the report said.
The report is published by the commission each year as a response to Washington's report on trading partners.
A senior commission trade official said the European report ''illustrates that although the United States is in general terms a comparatively open economy, it nevertheless maintains numerous unfair or discriminatory practices and legislative provisions which impede and distort trade and which undermine the multilateral trade regime itself.''
The report, which the commission said was by no means exhaustive, identified nearly 50 tariff and nontariff trade barriers in the United States.
These included discriminatory policies covering public-sector contracts, unreasonable requirements for standards, testing and labeling, excessive customs fees, export subsidies and tax barriers.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Behind the Selloff Of 3 Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
THE publicly traded shares of three major mutual fund companies have been tumbling in recent weeks, as investors reacted to the fear that credit problems in the commercial paper market could affect the companies' immensely popular money market mutual funds.
T. Rowe Price, whose shares traded around $30 each at the end of March, closed yesterday at $24.375. Similarly, Alliance Capital ended yesterday at $15.625, off from roughly $17 three weeks ago. And Dreyfus, which traded at $36 at the end of March, closed at $32.125 yesterday. 
Behind the selloff is the bankruptcy on April 12 of Mortgage and Realty Trust, affecting $150 million in outstanding commercial paper. Half of that paper was owned by a number of money market funds, including those sponsored by T. Rowe Price and Alliance. In each case, the parent companies of the affected funds bought back the defaulted paper. That made the funds whole and prevented any losses to money market investors.
While the default is not large within the vast $540 billion commercial paper market, it has hit a nerve in the mutual fund industry because it underscores what had previously been largely ignored by investors: that money market funds, while considered very safe, are not totally risk-free.
''There is an age-old view,'' said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytic Services, ''that risk and reward are correlated. The reason that these funds pay you a return that is higher than the bank rate is that you're taking some risk.''
Federal regulators, too, have emphasized that investors need to be aware that money market investments are not guaranteed and risk-free. In the aftermath of a default last fall by Integrated Resources, the Securities and Exchange Commission began talking with mutual fund industry executives about the need to diversify their holdings and keep the average maturity of their funds short.
One indication of the level of the mutual fund industry's concern is that the sponsors of every fund affected by recent commercial paper defaults have stepped in to protect investors. While such response cannot be guaranteed in the future, Robert Pozen, general counsel and managing director of Fidelity Investments in Boston, echoed a common industry response when he said that Fidelity ''would make every possible effort'' to insure that its money fund investors were protected from any default losses.
The industry's protective response is even more remarkable given most analysts' worst-case estimate: that the losses the affected money funds were facing would have reduced yields to investors by only about 1 percentage point, shaving perhaps a penny off the traditional $1-a-share asset value.
''People have always viewed these funds as riskless,'' an industry analyst said, ''and the fund managers now are willing to take on the credit exposure that their money market funds have incurred so they can continue to keep that perception around.'' Is the perception valid? Obviously, money market funds are not insulated from any market risk, Mr. Lipper said. ''We spent a decade leveraging the society, and as we un-leverage, there will be accidents,'' he said. ''I don't think they will be too great, and I think the industry can handle it. But if people are concerned, they should diversify into a number of different money market funds, or focus on funds that invest only in U.S. Government securities.''
So far, investors do not seem to be manifesting any serious concern, although tax-paying season typically produces a flow of cash out of money market funds. A survey of big fund sponsors and various money market monitors yesterday showed little sign that investors are shifting funds out of taxable money market funds.
But in contrast to mutual fund investors, stock market players are reacting - some analysts say ''overreacting'' - to the possibility that the money management firms' willingness to bail out their money market funds may hurt shareholder profits in the future. As evidence of panic, one analyst noted that Dreyfus's shares have been battered even though none of its money market funds were affected by the recent default.
''I think it's overdone,'' Mr. Machmany said. ''Given the earnings power these companies have, the actual amount of defaults that could occur just won't be that substantial. These stocks have gone down many times what the actual earnings impact could be.''

HEADLINE: Stock Prices Slide as Dow Tumbles 32.89

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled yesterday in the wake of weak corporate earnings, rumors of rising interest rates in Japan and signs that the American economy is much stronger than many people believed. The latest indication of that strength was the improvement in the nation's trade deficit announced yesterday.
As sentiment spread that a decline in interest rates seemed out of the question for now, bond prices fell and interest rates rose and investors scrambled for higher rates. By the end of the day, as the market continued down, the Dow Jones industrial average had sunk 32.89 points, to 2,732.88 - the biggest decline in almost two months. 
The Dow utilities slid 1.76, to 211.96 - the lowest since July 6, when it stood at 210.32.
Volume continued weak at 147.1 million shares, with 1,056 stocks down and 477 ahead. The day before only 128 million shares changed hands.
William M. LeFevre, market strategist for Advest Inc., said, ''The new low in utilities suggests investors think interest rates are headed higher.''
Richard G. Unruh Jr., chief investment officer for Delaware Investment Advisers, with $16 billion of pension funds under management, said, ''We've been surprised the market has held up as well as it has in view of the increase in interest rates.''
''The decline in earnings momentum,'' he added, ''is far greater than normal and because rates are going up with the economy slowing, we've been in a cautious mode, not bearish but cautious.'' To meet that situation, he said Delaware Investment had ''tried to increase the yield on our portfolio.''
First-quarter earnings reports are beginning to pour in and with some exceptions, investors seemed to be taking their profits.
Despite a strong earnings advance, Philip Morris topped the New York Stock Exchange's active list, falling 3/8, to 42 5/8, on 2.35 million shares, after trading as high as 43 1/2.
Tandem, the third most active, rose 1 1/8, to 24 1/8, on 1.98 million shares, because of strong earnings. I.B.M., which advanced 4 earlier in the week on good earnings, fell 1 1/4 in profit taking, to 109 7/8.
A.T. & T., which reported a 12.5 percent rise in profits, fell 1, to 41. MCI, which said profits rose 20.7 percent, fell 1 5/8, to 35 1/8. Continental Bank fell 1 1/8, to 14 5/8 after it said that nonperforming loans for highly leveraged deals rose sharply.
Coca-Cola, which reported a 9.1 percent rise in profits, fell 1, to 79 1/4. Merrill Lynch, whose profits rose 11 percent, fell 3/4, to 23 1/8, and General Electric, which reported an 11.9 percent rise on Tuesday, fell 3/8, to 66 1/2.
After reporting a 5.9 percent drop in profits, BellSouth fell 1 1/4, to 54 3/4. AMR fell 7/8, to 64 1/2, after reporting a $19.3 million loss.
Merck, whose profits rose 18.6 percent, rose 5/8, to 74 3/8.
The S.& P. 500 fell 3.96, to 340.72; the Nasdaq composite 3.90, to 431.52, and the Amex market-value index 1.50, to 353.22.

 BODY:
United States timber harvests will increase 55 percent in the next 50 years, but industry employment will drop because of modernization, the Government said on Tuesday. The South will feel the biggest effect, losing about 36 percent of its timber jobs, the General Accounting Office told the House Ways and Means Committee. It said timber employment would probably fall 26 percent in the Rocky Mountain region, 23 percent in the North and 13 percent on the West Coast.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops' Big P.R. Blunder

BYLINE: By Eugene Kennedy; Eugene Kennedy, a former Roman Catholic priest, is professor of psychology at Loyola University.

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
America's Roman Catholic bishops have committed a blunder as big as the Ritz in hiring public relations and polling organizations to design campaigns against abortion.
Seeking to bolster their moral authority, the bishops chose a strategy that is manipulative at best and numbingly amoral at worst. Sadly, this leaches away the bishops' spiritual authority, even among Catholics who strongly support them and their pro-life position.
In behaving like corporate C.E.O.'s, the bishops are subverting their admirable pastoral strengths and risking the reputation for integrity they have elevated in the last decade. That new respect has been built upon biblically based pastoral letters - public meditations on the morality of nuclear arms and the ethical foundations of economic policy. 
The bishops apparently don't see the incongruity of placing the pro-life issue - which they define as their deepest present moral concern - in the hands of Hill & Knowlton, which also represents Playboy Enterprises. (The $3 million to $5 million that the bishops will spend, even if privately raised, surely can be put to sounder church uses.) Hill & Knowlton, America's largest public relations firm, numbers among its clients the Warner-Lambert Company, which makes oral contraceptives and condoms, and Baxter International, which makes intrauterine devices. It has shaped the images of defense industries, whose contracts do not read like the Gospels.
Public relations agencies and pollsters have prepared the center ring for the ethical circuses of our age. These include Watergate - the tiny car from which moral clowns still tumble - and the Reagan Presidency's masterly illusions, which still deceive us.
The bishops' failure to anticipate that making friends with Mammon would strike great numbers of Catholics as unseemly suggests they are not as in touch with the world and their own people as they once were.
You call in public relations operatives when the truth won't do. That's why p.r. - the very letters evoke subtle maneuvers and manipulation of opinion - has become, in business as in politics, the substitute for a genuine moral and ethical sense.
The p.r. boys made the contras into freedom fighters just as they have tried to make Exxon's monumental oil spill in Alaska into an ecological triumph. No strategy could be more antithetical to the spiritual and moral tradition that the bishops are required to interpret.
Humans cannot be manipulated into moral convictions. Such convictions have no meaning unless they are freely embraced, without external pressure, no matter how deftly applied. Morality depends on a demanding search through the rubble, the noise, of life for facts and principles from which we may forge wise, enduring judgments.
The bishops have always taught this, just as they have taught that no end, no matter its worthiness, justifies ignoble means. No strategy that so obviously affronts the living can advance the interests of the unborn.
Defending themselves, the bishops argue that large-scale public relations campaigns have been successfully used by foes of their pro-life position. They're right. The masterly shift from being ''pro-abortion'' to being ''pro-choice'' has proved enormously beneficial to critics of the church's stand.
But in the long run, neither Hill & Knowlton nor the politically connected Wirthlin Group, the hired pollsters, can help settle the abortion debate. The implications of this issue are too deep to be handled, like Coke-Pepsi wars, by the glibness and window-dressing techniques that form p.r. agencies' bottom-line morality.
Why aren't the bishops demonstrating enough confidence in what they are really best at - being pastors to all people?
We are genuinely moved when John Cardinal O'Connor of New York brings his priestly consolations to the bedside of the burned, sick and dying.
We are stirred when Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago preaches steadily not only about abortion but also about the seamless web of all moral issues - like capital punishment, tax policy, proper nutrition -that affect life.
We are touched by the sincerity of Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee, who sympathetically listens to the women of his archdiocese speak about abortion.
In such vignettes, we see the bishops as priests responding to the spiritual longings of their people.
It isn't too late for the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities to cancel the public relations and polling contracts. The recovery of their spiritual authority, the success of their pro-life moral crusade, may well depend on doing just that.
Good shepherds do not invite wolves to help them tend flocks.

First Fisherman Casts An Environmental Line

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
When President-elect Bush visited Islamorada in the Florida Keys after his election, he was just ''goin' fishin'.'' When he returns to Islamorada this weekend, he will be ''enjoying the splendors of our great outdoor heritage.''
Sunday is the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, and the White House is eager to court voters concerned about the environment. So the trip had to have a loftier purpose than sportsmanly pursuit of the wily bonefish and tarpon in the land of Key lime pie and Kon Tiki bars. 
In fact, this whole week is chockablock with what are supposed to be environmentally conscious events, culminating on Sunday in the Everglades, where Mr. Bush will cast his line and discuss conservation with Curt Gowdy for an ''American Sportsman'' television special.
''Fishing on Earth Day,'' sniffed Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action. ''That's a real commitment.''
President Bush ordinarily shies away from events designed so baldly for image polishing. But for the environment, one of the few areas where his popularity is slipping, he is making an exception. So, the Administration heads for the Great Outdoors.
On Monday, children streamed out of the White House Easter egg roll carrying Virginia pine seedlings grown from genetically improved seeds and a booklet called ''Fifty Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth,'' like taking shorter showers and refusing plastic foam cups at fast-food restaurants.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Mr. Bush was the host of an 18-nation conference on global warming from pollution. In Florida on Earth Day, he is expected to approve a Coast Guard plan for new shipping lanes to protect the Florida Keys.
But that is not the ''big announcement'' Florida environmentalists want to hear. They have been waiting for a new oil drilling ban long promised by the White House, and are waiting to pounce.
Meanwhile, even the daily ''points of light'' citations honoring volunteers are devoted to spaceship Earth. In his four-day trip in the South, which started today, Mr. Bush will honor Daniel Keith Odell, a marine biologist from Florida's Sea World Stranded Animals Research Facility.
In Islamorada he will honor Reef Relief, a group that takes boys out to view the coral without dropping anchors that could damage the reefs.
Mr. Bush defends his environmental record with his support for a tougher Clean Air Act, for elevating the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet rank and for increased Federal money for climate research.
Environmentalists find him less menacing than his predecessor. This week's global warming conference was supposed to prove he cares.But it turned out to be less than a perfect photo opportunity; Europeans demanded action, not talk.
Michael J. Boskin, the White House economist, parried, saying the Administration had achieved a ''bold and aggressive and financially and intellectually forceful upgrading of the debate.'' Environmentalists like Dan Becker, lobbyist for the Sierra Club, countered that the emphasis on possible economic disruptions from conservation produced a disturbing clash of Greens and green eyeshades.
The local chapter of the Sierra Club did more than talk; it announced it would sue the White House for not following the District of Columbia's office wastepaper recycling laws. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, had trouble keeping a straight face as he invoked national security concerns to explain the lack of compliance.
The week's events, conducted at the President's usual fast pace, have left even Mr. Bush a bit confused and chagrined.
''Look, I'm down there to have fun,'' Mr. Bush said of his fishing trip. ''If we can help by pointing out the sensitivity of the environment there, the ecological balance in the Everglades, I want to do that.''
But he said, ''I want some understanding and sympathy when I'm out fishing, because I work like hell around here.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From High Court Decision That Judges May Order Tax Increase

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision on Wednesday that Federal judges may order local governments to increase taxes to remedy constitutional violations like school segregation. Justice Byron R. White wrote the majority opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy the dissenting opinion.
 
FROM THE OPINION
By Justice White
It is accepted by all the parties, as it was by the courts below, that the imposition of a tax increase by a Federal court was an extraordinary event. In assuming for itself the fundamental and delicate power of taxation, the District Court not only intruded on local authority but circumvented it altogether. Before taking such a drastic step, the District Court was obliged to assure itself that no permissible alternative would have accomplished the required task. 
We have emphasized that although the ''remedial powers of an equity court must be adequate to the task . . . they are not unlimited''. . . and one of the most important considerations governing the exercise of equitable power is a proper respect for the integrity and function of local government institutions. Especially is this true where, as here, those institutions are ready, willing, and - but for the operation of state law curtailing their powers - able to remedy the deprivation of constitutional rights themselves.
The District Court believed that it had no alternative to imposing a tax increase. But there was an alternative, the very one outlined by the Court of Appeals: it could have authorized or required Kansas City, Missouri, School District to levy property taxes at a rate adequate to fund the desegregation remedy, and could have enjoined the operation of state laws that would have prevented K.C.M.S.D. from exercising this power.
The difference between the two approaches is far from than a matter of form. Authorizing and directing local government institutions to devise and implement remedies not only protects the function of those institutions but, to the extent possible, also places the responsibility for solutions to the problems of segregation upon those who have themselves created the problems.
 
Financing Public Schools
As Brown v. Board of Education . . . observed, local authorities have the ''primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving'' the problems of desegregation. . . . This is true as well of the problems of financing desegregation, for no matter has been more consistently placed upon the shoulders of local government than that of financing public schools.
The District Court therefore abused its discretion in imposing the tax itself. The Court of Appeals should not have allowed the tax increase to stand and should have reversed the District Court in this respect. . . . ...
The Court of Appeals held that the District Court in the future should authorize K.C.M.S.D. to submit a levy to the state tax collection authorities adequate to fund its budget, and should enjoin the operation of state laws that would limit or reduce the levy below that amount.
The State argues that the funding ordered by the District Court violates principles of equity and comity because the remedial order itself was excessive. . . . We think this argument aims at the scope of the remedy rather than the manner in which the remedy is to be funded. . . . We accept, without approving or disapproving, the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the District Court's remedy was proper.
We turn to the constitutional issues. The modifications ordered by the Court of Appeals cannot be assailed as invalid under the 10th Amendment. ''The 10th Amendment's reservation of nodelegated powers to the states is not implicated by a Federal court judgment enforcing the express prohibitions of unlawful state conduct enacted by the 14th Amendment.'' Id., at 291. ''The 14th Amendment . . . was avowedly directed against the power of the states,'' Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., . . . and so permits a Federal court to disestablish local government institutions that interfere with its commands. . . .
 
Judicial Power Defined
Finally, the State argues that an order to increase taxes cannot be sustained under the judicial power of Article III. Whatever the merits of this argument when applied to the District Court's own order increasing taxes, a point we have not reached . . . a court order directing a local government body to levy its own taxes is plainly a judicial act within the power of a Federal court.
We held as much in Griffin v. Prince Edward County School Bd., 377 U.S., at 233, where we stated that a district court, faced with a county's attempt to avoid desegregation of the public schools by refusing to operate those schools, could ''require the [county] supervisors to exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate and maintain without racial discrimination a public school system.''
A local government with taxing authority may be ordered to levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there is reason based in the Constitution for not observing the statutory limitation. In Von Hoffman, the limitation was disregarded because of the contract clause. Here the K.C.M.S.D. may be ordered to levy taxes despite the statutory limitations on its authority in order to compel the discharge of an obligation imposed on K.C.M.S.D. by the 14th Amendment.
To hold otherwise would fail to take account of the obligations of local governments, under the supremacy clause, to fulfill the requirements that the Constitution imposes on them.
However wide the discretion of local authorities in fashioning desegregation remedies may be, ''if a state-imposed limitation on a school authority's discretion operates to inhibit or obstruct the operation of a unitary school system or impede the disestablishing of a dual school system, it must fall; state policy must give way when it operates to hinder vindication of Federal constitutional guarantees.'' North Carolina State Bd. of Education v. Swann. . . . Even though a particular remedy may not be required in every case to vindicate constitutional guarantees, where (as here) it has been found that a particular remedy is required, the State cannot hinder the process by preventing a local government from implementing that remedy.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Kennedy
Today's casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured Federal judiciary disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of public institutions. I cannot acquiesce in the majority's statements on this point, and should there arise an actual dispute over the collection of taxes as here contemplated in a case that is not, like this one, premature, we should not confirm the outcome of premises adopted with so little constitutional justification. The Court's statements, in my view, cannot be seen as necessary for its judgment, or as precedent for the future. . . .
The premise of the Court's analysis, I submit, is infirm. Any purported distinction between direct imposition of a tax by the Federal court and an order commanding the school district to impose the tax is but a convenient formalism where the court's action is predicated on elimination of state law limitations on the school district's taxing authority. As the Court describes it, the local K.C.M.S.D. possesses plenary taxing powers, which allow it to impose any tax it chooses if not ''hinder[ed]'' by the Missouri Constitution and state statutes. Ante, at 21.
This puts the conclusion before the premise. Local government bodies in Missouri, as elsewhere, must derive their power from a sovereign, and that sovereign is the State of Missouri. . . . The Missouri Constitution states that ''[p]roperty taxes and other local taxes may not be increased above the limitations specified herein without direct voter approval as provided by this Constitution.''
For this reason, I reject the artificial suggestion that the District Court may by ''prevent[ing] . . . officials from applying state law that would interfere with the willing levy of property taxes by K.C.M.S.D.''State laws, including taxation provisions legitimate and constitutional in themselves, define the power of the K.C.M.S.D.
Taxation by a legislature raises no due process concerns, for the citizens' ''rights are protected in the only way that they can be in a complex society, by their power, immediate or remote, over those who make the rule.'' Bi-Metallic Co. v. Colorado State Bd. of Equalization. . .The citizens who are taxed are given notice and a hearing through their representatives, whose power is a direct manifestation of the citizens' consent.
A true exercise of judicial power provides due process of another sort. Where money is extracted from parties by a court's judgment, the adjudication itself provides the notice and opportunity to be heard that due process demands before a citizen may be deprived of property.
The order here provides neither of these protections. Where a tax is imposed by a governmental body other than the legislature, even an administrative agency to which the legislature has delegated taxing authority, due process requires notice to the citizens to be taxed and some opportunity to be heard. . . .
The citizens whose tax bills would have been doubled under the District Court's direct tax order would not have had these protections. The taxes were imposed by a District Court that was not ''representative'' in any sense, and the individual citizens of the K.C.M.S.D. whose property (they later learned) was at stake were neither served with process nor heard in court.
The method of taxation endorsed by today's dicta suffers the same flaw, for a district court order that overrides the citizens' state law protection against taxation without referendum approval can in no sense provide representational due process. No one suggests the K.C.M.S.D. taxpayers are parties. ...
The confinement of taxation to the legislative branches, both in our Federal and state governments, was not random. It reflected our ideal that the power of taxation must be under the control of those who are taxed. This truth animated all our colonial and revolutionary history. ...
Our Federal judiciary, by design, is not representative or responsible to the people in a political sense; it is independent. Federal judges do not depend on the popular will for their office. They may not even share the burden of taxes they attempt to impose, for they may live outside the jurisdiction their orders affect. And Federal judges have no fear that the competition for scarce public resources could result in a diminution of their salaries.
It is not surprising that imposition of taxes by an authority so insulated from public communication or control can lead to deep feelings of frustration, powerlessness and anger on the part of taxpaying citizens.
The operation of tax systems is among the most difficult aspects of public administration. It is not a function the judiciary as an institution is designed to exercise. Unlike legislative bodies, which may hold hearings on how best to raise revenue, all subject to the views of constituents to whom the legislature is accountable, the judiciary must grope ahead with only the assistance of the parties, or perhaps random amici curiae.
Those hearings would be without principled direction, for there exists no body of juridical axioms by which to guide or review them. On this questionable basis, the Court today would give authority for decisions that affect the life plans of local citizens, the revenue available for competing public needs and the health of the local economy. ...
This case is a stark illustration of the ever-present question whether ends justify means. Few ends are more important that enforcing the guarantee of equal educational opportunity for our nation's children. . . . But courage and skill must be exercised with due regard for the proper and historic role of the courts.
I do not acknowledge the troubling departures in today's majority opinion as either necessary or appropriate to insure full compliance with the equal protection clause and its mandate to eliminate the cause and effects of racial discrimination in the schools. Indeed, while this case happens to arise in the compelling context of school desegregation, the principles involved are not limited to that context.
There is no obvious limit to today's discussion that would prevent judicial taxation in cases involving prisons, hospitals or other public institutions, or indeed to pay a large damages award levied against a municipality. . . . This assertion of judicial power in one of the most sensitive of policy areas, that involving taxation, begins a process that over time could threaten fundamental alteration of the form of government our Constitution embodies.

Oakland: Winning by Losing

 BODY:
The city of Oakland, Calif., is a city of sorrow, burdened with high unemployment, inadequate housing and bankrupt schools. Yet it was prepared to shell out $428 million to lure the Los Angeles Raiders professional football team back to the city where the Raiders played until nine years ago, when they moved south. 
This week, however, Oakland's City Council voted unanimously to withdraw the offer. The vote followed a hostile petition drive that gathered 33,189 signatures.
The decision was as rare as it was sensible. It came at a time when cities are falling all over themselves to attract sports franchises or pamper the teams they already have. Most of Oakland's $428 million guarantee would have underwritten season ticket sales, but a big chunk would have been used to build ''luxury boxes,'' those glassed-in suites that rent for thousands of dollars.
Oakland's message is that luxury boxes built at public expense are obscene amid poverty. To Al Davis, the Raiders' owner, luxury boxes are very important. Oakland will lose the team if Mr. Davis decides to take his wandering franchise elsewhere. But the city will have gained something more important - a sense of priorities, and pride.

HEADLINE: Raising New York Housing Allowance Won't Cut Homelessness

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Despite New York's pressing need to increase welfare benefits, your support of the Court of Appeals ruling requiring the state to set adequate housing allowances for welfare recipients (''The Court Rules for the Homeless,'' editorial, April 6) doesn't take into account hard facts documented by research. There is no evidence that this response to the inadequacies of the low-income housing market will have any impact. Quite the opposite is true. 
A recent New York University study shows that homeless families are no more likely to have paid higher rents than families who do not become homeless. Furthermore, increases in the shelter allowance in 1984 and 1988 did nothing to alleviate homelessness. After several months, public assistance rent levels caught up with shelter allowance maximums. Increasing the shelter allowance merely increased the money in landlords' pockets without affecting the availability of low-income housing.
Further, the number of families living doubled up or in otherwise substandard conditions has not improved. And this is because there is not enough housing at the low end of the market, with vacancy rates running at practically zero.
The cost of raising the shelter allowance to ''adequate'' levels will be about $300 million to $400 million for the city and $400 million to $500 million for the state, but will not be sufficient to encourage creation of new housing for the poor. At the same time, welfare benefits, which have declined in the last decade about 40 percent in real dollars, will increase about 20 percent, but will be quickly absorbed by higher rents and do nothing to decrease dependency.
The first solution is a straightforward policy to create more housing at the low end of the market, primarily for small, young families, where the bulk of the problem is. The second answer is to reform New York's welfare system by doing away with the categories of welfare (basic grant, utility allowance, shelter allowance) and creating a flat grant system tied to poverty levels, with indexing triggers tied to inflation and incentives for those who make real efforts to get off welfare by education, training and employment. This will reduce welfare rolls, encourage family responsibility and provide families on welfare flexibility to adjust their needs to the realities of the marketplace.
If the court's decision thus provides an opportunity to achieve these ends it will be of lasting significance. Otherwise it will be another costly example of judicial activism with little positive impact on the problem it attempts to solve.

HEADLINE: Scrap Immigration Act's Backfiring Sanctions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If the employer sanctions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act were simply a failed effort to combat job discrimination, more education and streamlined paperwork might counter employment discrimination (''Hasty Hysteria on Aliens,'' editorial, April 3). However, the sanctions provisions were designed to conscript all employers as border enforcers; antidiscrimination measures were included only because critics knew the law's consequences could be disastrous for United States minority and eligible foreign workers. The General Accounting Office report, like the New York State study before it, confirms that the antidiscrimination measures aren't working. 
When a Government program is causing discrimination, more than patience and fine tuning is called for. The program leading to new discrimination should be ended.
That the sanctions program isn't delivering on its promise is all the more reason to call it off. The G.A.O. argues in the most tentative terms that the law is reducing the number of immigrants coming to this country. The law, however, was also intended to drive home those undocumented immigrants who didn't qualify for the amnesty program by making it impossible for them to work. The G.A.O. didn't even examine this matter, but all the evidence is that the vast majority of the three million immigrants and refugees who remain undocumented have stayed. They find the prospects of return to warfare, political upheaval and dire poverty that they fled a poorer option than the exploitative underground economy to which they have been driven in the United States.
Finally, Congress promised organized labor that sanctions would ''save American jobs.'' The G.A.O. report ignores this promise. No evidence has demonstrated that the presence of one undocumented worker results in the loss of one native worker's job or that one immigrant turned back saves one job. Indeed, by strengthening the underground economy, employer sanctions have weakened the status of organized labor and undermined conditions for all workers.
If Congress adopts your recommendations of more educational efforts to instruct employers in the law and simplification of paperwork, Government-caused discrimination will continue. Meanwhile the flaws in the sanctions policy will remain untouched. Employer sanctions do not respond to the overwhelming push to immigration in Central America, the Caribbean and Mexico, nor do they affect the demand for cheap labor in the United States that continues to pull immigrants.
An end to war and repression in Central America and imaginative efforts to ease the impact of debt burdens in Mexico, coupled with rigorous implementation of tough labor protection laws at home, offer better and more humane strategies for reducing the numbers of immigrants to the United States.

It will begin with ''Sinbad'' (1970), Zoltan Huszaruk's portrait of love and life in turn-of-the-century Budapest, and continue on April 27 with ''My Way Home'' (1964), Miklos Jancso's film about a schoolboy captured shortly after the Soviets occupied the country in 1945. The last two films will be ''Confidence'' (1979), Istvan Szabo's tale of assumed identity, love and mistrust during World War I, on May 4, and Peter Gothar's ''Time Stands Still'' (1982), a story of two boys who idealize America in post-1956 Budapest, on May 11. Screenings are at 7:30 P.M. Tickets are $6; $5 for students and the elderly. Information: 861-7362 or 879-8893. 
 
RHYTHMIC VARIETY
During a half-century of tap dancing, James (Buster) Brown has played the vaudeville circuit, appeared on stage and screen, and performed with the likes of Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie. Now a member of the Copasetics, Mr. Brown will join the Peggy Spina Tap Company, a nine-year-old ensemble noted for its rhythmic variety, for three performances this weekend at the Dance S. Studio, 115 Prince Street in SoHo. The program, ''Foot Fetishes II,'' will include four solos by Mr. Brown. Ms. Spina's company will present eight other works, including three premieres that she described as a ''duet for African Talking Drum and dancer'' choreographed by Theresa McCleary, and two compositions by Joel Forrester, a ''Baroque jazz fantasy'' and a ''funk groove piece.'' Performances are tonight and tomorrow at 8 and Sunday at 7 P.M. Tickets are $10. Reservations: 674-8885.
 
THE FACES OF POVERTY
The faces and circumstances of poverty in the United States are all too many and varied; one in seven Americans and one in four children live below the officially defined poverty line. This vast swath of America -including urban youths, homeless veterans, Midwestern farmers, unemployed Appala-chian coal miners and Mexican-Americans living in Texas border towns - is the subject of a photographic exhibition that opened yesterday at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, near 77th Street. The show, ''Below the Line: Living Poor in America,'' includes about 60 black-and-white images by Eugene Richards, a photographer who was commissioned in 1986 by Consumers Union to capture the experiences of the country's poorest citizens for a book. The exhibition will be on view Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., through June 29. Admission is $3; $2 for the elderly, and $1 for children. Information: 873-3400.

A NEW ERA AT EASTERN
 
A Federal bankruptcy judge accomplished what organized labor had sought for years. He took control of Eastern Airlines from Frank Lorenzo and appointed an outsider to run the troubled carrier, which had become a symbol of labor strife in the 1980's. The judge's goal is to keep the airline flying at least until it becomes palatable to a buyer. [Page D1.] 
 
Passengers and travel agents were cautiously optimistic, but others are concerned that the naming of a trustee may signal the beginning of liquidation for the airline. [D5.]
 
Martin R. Shugrue's appointment as trustee puts Eastern's operations in experienced hands, but analysts doubt whether he will be able to attract the needed passengers. [D5.]
 
MARKETS
 
The S.E.C. authorized the creation of a new market for stocks and bonds in a move that could increase the dominance of large investment firms in the U.S. financial markets. In the new market, securities can be issued and traded actively, but can be bought only by large institutional investors. [A1.]
 
Stock prices continued to weaken amid computerized selling brought on by inflation fears. The Dow sank 20.94, to 2,711.94. [D8.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities dipped for the fifth straight session in light trading. [D15.]
 
Oil prices rebounded after sinking to a 19-month low on Wednesday. Traders cited technical factors more than a planned OPEC meeting. [D14.] The dollar was mixed, losing ground against a revived yen but rising against other currencies. [D14.]
 
COMPANIES
 
Marshall Field will be sold to Dayton Hudson for $1.04 billion. B.A.T. had said it would sell it to help ward off a takeover. [D1.]
 
American Express reported the worst quarterly results in its history - a loss of $619.8 million in the first quarter. [D1.]
 
Digital Equipment reported profits of $24.9 million, or 20 cents a share. It had said two months ago that it might post a loss for the first time in its 32-year history. [D1.]
 
Three Bell regionals posted moderate growth in earnings and sales, while at a fourth, sales rose slightly and earnings fell. [D4.]
 
BankAmerica's profits rose 1.1 percent. It attributed the gain to steady growth of its consumer banking business. [D17.]
 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Daimler-Benz agreed to conduct aerospace research jointly. [D4.]
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Reforms to combat concealing drug profits in banks and other financial institutions were proposed by the Group of Seven. [D1.]
 
The Bundesbank's president defended proposals for monetary union and lashed out at political leaders for leading East Germans to expect a one-to-one conversion rate. [D2.]
 
THE ECONOMY
 
U.S. lawmakers voiced skepticism about Tokyo's commitments to a new trade agreement. [D2.]
 
Non-C.P.A.'s would be admitted to the accounting institute for the first time, under a committee's proposal. [D15.]

HEADLINE: Marshall Field Deal By Dayton

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, April 19

 BODY:
In a deal announced today, Marshall Field & Company of Chicago, one of the oldest and grandest names in American retailing, is to be sold for $1.04 billion to another venerable retailer, the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis.
At a news conference here, Dayton Hudson said it would pay cash to acquire Marshall Field from Batus Inc., the American arm of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. The British conglomerate said last September that it would sell the 135-year-old Chicago-based chain of 24 stores as part of a move to thwart a possible takeover. B.A.T. also has Saks Fifth Avenue up for sale.
Dayton Hudson's department store division has 37 stores, divided mostly between the Minneapolis and Detroit areas.
 
Price Called Fair
Analysts said the price agreed upon for Marshall Field was fair. In fact, some retailing experts expressed concerns that Dayton Hudson might be overpaying and could find itself in trouble down the road if consumer buying slackened significantly. 
Officials of Dayton Hudson said they were confident about coming up with the money now for the purchase and in the future to pay down its debts. Both chains have been doing well financially, meaning that Dayton Hudson will not have to spend time whipping Marshall Field into shape.
In a grueling auction, Dayton Hudson prevailed over two other prominent retailers, the May Department Stores Company and Dillard Department Stores Inc. It said it planned no big changes in Marshall Field's operations. The stores, which are in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and Texas, will all remain open, keep the Marshall Field name and will continue to carry the great majority of their existing merchandise.
 
Consolidation Expected
Still retailing experts said they expected a significant behind-the-scenes consolidation of the two chains, as Dayton Hudson sought to reap savings by eliminating overlapping functions like purchasing and advertising.
''There is no question that now that Dayton Hudson has started on the road to becoming a multi-market player there will be a lot of people who will lose their jobs at the management, administrative and merchandising levels,'' said George Rosenbaum, a Chicago-based retailing consultant. ''You don't need one plus one to run this organization.''
If, as expected, the deal receives antitrust clearance, the combination of Dayton Hudson and Marshall Field will create one of the nation's largest retailers, with annual department store sales of nearly $3 billion and operating profits of nearly $270 million. If revenues of Dayton Hudson's other two principal subsidiaries, the Target discount stores and the Mervyn's chain of moderately priced department stores, were added, the new entity would have total sales of $14.4 billion and operating profits of $1.07 billion.
 
Advantage Over May Foreseen
Beyond sheer size, however, a takeover of Marshall Field would give Dayton Hudson a leg up over May, with which it has been vying for leadership in retailing in the Middle West and the Great Plains. The acquisition would add 24 stores and Dayton Hudson has planned to open three more by the end of 1992, raising its total number of stores after the acquisition to 64. Together, these stores would make up the core of a retailing empire that would operate from Ohio west to the Dakotas.
''Dayton Hudson is now in a very good position to dominate the Middle West,'' said Catherine Cooper, a retailing analyst for Kemper Financial Services Inc., the big investment concern based here. ''As a result, it will face a lot less markdown pressure. If you own the market, you pretty much control the pricing.''
Indeed, while Dayton Hudson's share price at first fell on the news -finishing today at $69.125, down $1.625 - the initial reaction among Wall Street analysts was largely positive. Most agreed with Ms. Cooper that the merger would increase Dayton Hudson's market share, permitting the chain to accelerate growth of its sales and earnings.
 
Chains' Similarities
Analysts were also heartened by the similarities of the two chains, similarities they said would allow Dayton Hudson to focus on savings in its operating costs. For example, both chains dominate their home markets - Marshall Field in Chicago, where it operates 13 stores and Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis and Detroit, where it operates 17 Dayton's and 20 Hudson's stores, respectively.
Similarly, both chains sell the higher-priced, higher-quality clothing and other items that cater to well-heeled, fashion-conscious shoppers. Both pride themselves on offering shoppers a high level of service.
''Of all the retail properties out there, this is one of the jewels up for sale,'' said L. Wayne Hood, the retailing analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''This is a strong retailer in markets they understand.''
 
Some Perils Remain
But the acquisition of Marshall Field is not without its perils for Dayton Hudson.
For example, it remained unclear today whether Philip B. Miller, Marshall Field's chairman and chief executive, would stay on. Mr. Miller, whose management team also submitted a bid for Marshall Field, is the one most credited with reviving the chain's fortunes in recent years.
There are also some financial risks. At the news conference, Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief executive, said he expected Dayton Hudson's ratio of long-term obligations to total shareholders' equity to rise to 69 percent, from 62 percent, meaning that Dayton Hudson plans to sell bonds to raise at least $400 million of the money needed for the purchase.
''So Dayton Hudson comes out a more highly leveraged company which, in a softer economy, could spell a problem,'' said Monroe H. Greenstein, the retailing analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York.
 
Confidence in Financing Deal
But Dayton Hudson officials seemed unfazed by this prospect. Asked whether he was confident he could obtain money for the deal given the uncertain outlook for department store business, Mr. Macke said, ''We will have absolutely no problem financing this.''
Asked about the suggestions that Dayton Hudson might be paying too much, Mr. Macke said, ''We think we got a value that meets our hurdle rates.''
Most important, perhaps, Marshall Field and Dayton Hudson are both fixtures in their selling areas, which some analysts said should give them an edge over rivals if sales weaken overall.
 
Landmark Chicago Store
With its soaring atrium selling floor that is crowned by a 6,000-square-foot Tiffany dome, with its ornate exterior clock towers and its sweeping, Chicago-style windows, Marshall Field's downtown State Street store is a landmark. The store's darkly paneled Walnut Room restaurant is still a favorite among diners in search of a quiet lunch with gracious service. And Marshall Field's mint-flavored chocolates known as Frango Mints are a popular souvenir for visitors.
The 109-year-old Dayton Hudson chain is equally steeped in tradition. Each Christmas, thousands of children make the pilgrimage to the auditorium of Dayton's downtown Minneapolis store to see the Christmas show. In spring, the auditorium is used for a vast display of tulips and artificial butterflies that shoppers line up for hours to see.
Hudson's downtown Detroit store was shuttered several years ago, replaced by stores in suburban malls.

HEADLINE: Group of 7 Asks Money-Laundering Curbs

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
Representatives of the Group of Seven industrial countries proposed a broad set of regulatory and banking reforms today to combat the growing problem of concealing illegal narcotics profits in banks and other financial institutions.
A study panel set up by the group was joined by eight other nations, including Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg, which are known for bank secrecy. The participation of these three nations was taken as a sign that they would support important modifications of their laws and banking practices, although Bush Administration officials said they did not know if any changes would be imminent.
The proposal calls for the elimination of anonymous bank accounts and accounts held in fictitious names. It also asks for greater international coordination among law enforcement and regulatory authorities. 
Numbered and anonymous accounts have long frustrated investigative efforts to track down drug money and have kept even bankers from knowing the source of funds. In attempting to peel away the layers of anonymity in some European banks and to put pressure on the bankers to change their rules, the recommendations represent a significant step in drug law enforcement.
''It is the single most comprehensive, significant and forceful international declaration on money laundering to date,'' said John E. Robson, Deputy Treasury Secretary, who headed the American delegation. ''It is a clear recognition of the global nature of the problem and acknowledges the need for rapid and tough actions.''
The group also proposed an easing of bank secrecy laws to permit bankers to report suspicious deposits to authorities and called on prosecutors to develop cases against corporations - not just their employees - which engage in money laundering. The committee said bankers should be forbidden to tell customers when they are under investigation.
The report is to be on the agenda at the meeting in Houston in July of the leaders of the Group of Seven - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and West Germany. Several of the eight other nations that participated in the study have long been identified as havens for illegal profits. In addition to Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg, the group includes Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.
Although declarations by the Group of Seven are more often statements of desire and determination than commitments to change, they often lead to, or reinforce, changes in domestic economic policies.
If adopted by the European countries, the proposals could encourage banking by drug traffickers in laundering havens in Latin America and the Caribbean that did not participate in the report.
 
Set Up Last Year
The study panel was set up last July at the annual meeting of the Group of Seven, even though all of the industrial nations have not yet ratified the Vienna Convention of 1988. That convention set out principles for multinational narcotics investigations and provided for treating money laundering as a crime and for extraditing money launderers in nations that signed the convention.
Under the laws of seven of the nations in the study group, including the United States, money laundering is already treated as a crime. Four other nations are considering such legislation. Among the Group of Seven, only West Germany and Japan do not outlaw it.
Congress is expected to strengthen the Federal law this year. The House is scheduled to vote next week on a bill that would set up a procedure for considering the revocation of the license or charter of a bank if it or an employee was convicted of money laundering. The measure is expected to be adopted; a similar proposal has been introduced in the Senate. $85 Billion Laundered Annually The report estimated that each year as much as $85 billion was laundered and reinvested from illegal profits from cocaine, heroin and marijuana.
In recent years, a number of large international prosecutions have illustrated the use by drug traffickers of major banks and other financial institutions to conceal large amounts of illegal money and to repatriate profits abroad. Earlier this week, the Justice Department announced that it had ordered 173 banks in 23 states to produce the records of more than 750 accounts in a case involving the laundering of $1.2 billion through more than a half-dozen foreign countries. The banks were not accused of wrongdoing.
There is also concern among some prosecutors and law enforcement officials that the integration of Europe's markets in 1992 will make it easier to launder money as national regulatory barriers are dropped and trading activity increases.
 
Some Differences Expressed
Several regulatory issues failed to gain unanimous support. For example, the report noted a division over whether banks should be required to report suspicious transactions.
Nor did the report address other important areas, like regulating electronic transfers of money, in the effort to prevent the use of banks to hide narcotics proceeds. With increasing frequency, narcotics traffickers use these transfers to move their profits swiftly between accounts in different countries. Mr. Robson said the Treasury Department expected to complete by summer regulations announced last fall that could require greater record-keeping by banks and clearinghouses of electronic transfers.
The study did not call for member nations to adopt the reporting requirements of American banks; currency reports must be filed for transactions of more than $10,000. That regulation has stirred considerable debate in a number of nations, most recently in Canada where the opposition has criticized the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for failing to adopt a proposal similar to American law.
Rather, the report called upon member nations to ''consider the feasibility and utility'' of a system of reporting large currency transactions to a national central agency.

HEADLINE: Oil Issue: How Much for Reserve?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The oil reserve established by the Government 15 years ago as an insurance policy against supply disruptions is coming under new scrutiny as imports rise and the budget-conscious Bush Administration looks for ways to cut costs.
The chairmen of important committees in the House and Senate have introduced bills calling for the reserve, now at 580 million barrels stored in salt domes on the Gulf Coast, to reach a billion barrels eventually. Supporters say a bigger reserve is needed because American imports are growing - they are now just shy of half of domestic demand, a record.
They point out that the reserve currently represents 81 days of imports, down from 118 days at its peak and below the 90-day level that the United States and other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development each agreed to maintain after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. What is more, experts note, world oil supplies are becoming tight, leading to fears that a war or natural disaster could cause a shortage and a jump in price. 
 
A Novel Approach
But the Bush Administration, citing the cost of filling the reserve and arguing that so much oil is already on hand that additional reserves would probably not be useful, has proposed capping it at 750 million barrels, and filling it at a slow rate, 59,000 barrels a day. At that rate it would take almost eight years to reach that goal.
And to reduce expenses without limiting the reserve even more, the Administration has recommended that Congress authorize a novel way to fill the reserve: Rather than buy oil outright, the United States would lease it from countries like Saudi Arabia. It would be bought only when actually needed. The oil would still be stored in this country, under the control of the Government.
The five-year legislation under which oil is bought for the reserve expired on April 1, but Congress has not decided what long-term action to take and has extended the current law until Aug. 15. The budget for the reserve, known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, is $600 million for the current fiscal year; including that sum, the United States has spent $19.4 billion on the reserve since its inception. The reserve was set up in the Ford Administration after the Arab embargo quadrupled the price of oil and left drivers fuming and cars sputtering.
 
Domestic Output Is Down
The importance of the reserve has increased, proponents say, because of a 17 percent decline in domestic oil production in the last five years.
In the Senate, J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, the chairman of the Energy Committee, has introduced legislation calling for a billion-barrel reserve. He said that by the time the reserve reached the current goal of 750 million barrels, that amount would most likely not equal 90 days of imports; in fact, under some Government forecasts, even one billion barrels may be less than 90 days' worth by 2000.
In the House, Philip R. Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the reserve, has also introduced legislation calling for a billion-barrel reserve, assuming that a system can be found for ''suitable financing,'' presumably leasing.
 
Oil Products Sought, Too
His bill would also establish reserves of oil products like gasoline and heating oil as well as a reserve for crude, and make it easier to release crude oil supplies so the reserve could be used ''in circumstances that are less than an energy apocalypse,'' Representative Sharp said. In testimony before the Senate Energy Committee last month, Robert H. Gentile, Assistant Secretary of Energy for fossil fuel, acknowledged the benefits of the reserve. But he added, ''The question is whether expanding the S.P.R. beyond 750 million barrels is necessary or justified.''
The reserve is already ''one of the largest direct investments by the Federal Government in the energy sector,'' he said. The Administration believes that an oil supply interruption in which more than 750 million barrels would be useful is sufficiently unlikely that the added security would not be worth the expense.
 
New View at OPEC
Experts cite some trends that endorse this idea. Since the 1970's, they say, oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have repeatedly asserted that they see stability of supply and price as being in the interests of sellers as well as buyers. The sudden price increase of 1979 led to development of oil wells in consuming countries that reduced dependence on OPEC. It also led to lower demand, and oil prices plummeted.
But Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, testified that an interagency study on which the Bush Administration based its position had vastly underestimated the potential for price rises.
The reserve is intended to deliver oil at a rate of 3.5 million barrels a day, which is about 40 percent of the level of imports lately, and the plan is to increase the capability to 4.5 million barrels a day. Experts expect that not all imported oil would be cut off and that therefore the reserve would last far longer than the 81 days if it made up for all imports.
 
Two Major Shortfalls
According to the Department of Energy, the oil shock of 1973-74 was caused by a supply shortfall of 1.6 million barrels a day, or 2.75 percent of worldwide consumption, and the shock of 1979, set off by the fall of the Shah of Iran, was caused by a shortfall of 3.7 million barrels a day, or 5.68 percent of consumption.
While the reserve would seem to make up for a shortage, Mr. Verleger said that the market would react sharply in hours or even minutes, while pumping oil out of the reserve would not begin for weeks. To be effective in stabilizing prices and preventing panic, he said, the reserve's oil should be sold to refiners immediately, even while still in the salt domes. Much oil already changes hands this way, he pointed out, in contracts for future delivery.
In fact, the most valuable part of the reserve may be the realization by dealers that its oil could quench demand in the market, proponents say. Representative Bill Green, Republican of Manhattan, described its value as like that of a nuclear missile, with a ''deterrent effect.''
But a new study by Cambridge Energy Research Associates commissioned by the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonprofit study group, suggested another possibility. ''During a real or perceived supply interruption, inventories might be husbanded because of rising price expectations,'' the study said. ''So S.P.R. oil might just go from salt domes into steel tanks.''
 
The Leasing Proposal
Among the alternatives explored by the Cambridge study was leasing oil for the stockpile, rather than buying it. The Energy Secretary, James D. Watkins, has recommended that Congress authorize such leasing, although the details have not been worked out. One possibility is that the Government would pay an annual fee equal to 5 percent of the oil's value, or about $1 a barrel. The oil would be stored on the Gulf Coast and the Government would decide when it would be sold to refiners.
The Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, said at a news conference in New York last month that his country was interested in providing the oil on that basis. The theory behind leasing is that it would mean added revenue for an OPEC member without violating production quotas. The oil would not come under the quota until it was sold, American oil experts say.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
It's 'Slugflation,' Not 'Stagflation'

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IS the United States economy on the verge of stagflation, that baleful mixture of stagnation and inflation from which it suffered in the late 1970's and early 1980's?
The report this week that the Consumer Price Index had jumped by one-half of 1 percent in March, pushing the first-quarter annual rate of increase in retail prices to 8.5 percent, heightened inflationary worries. Bond prices tumbled, the dollar fell and interest rates climbed. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds shot up to 8.83 percent on Wednesday, with the Japanese said to be big sellers of long-term United States bonds. 
At the same time, some reports pointed toward economic stagnation. Sales of domestically built cars, vans and light trucks fell by 11.2 percent from a year ago in the first 10 days of April. Housing starts dropped by 9.3 percent in March, to an annual rate of 1.32 million units, down from 1.57 million units in January. The real estate market looked sick and corporate profits are off.
But analysts should look at all the evidence before deciding that either inflation or stagnation is the order of the day. For instance, business plans for spending on new plant and equipment this year are up by more than 8 percent.
The report on the rise in consumer prices in March was preceded, a week earlier, by a report that producer prices fell in March by two-tenths of 1 percent. Since wholesale prices feed into retail prices, the April report on consumer prices, when it arrives, will probably show a decline from the high first-quarter rate.
And oil prices have been edging down, as OPEC struggles to get its act together; that is in sharp contrast with the oil-price explosion of the 1970's that kicked off the last stagflation. The American economy is still rising, if at a slow rate. Real gross national product rose in the fourth quarter of 1989 at an annual rate of just nine-tenths of 1 percent, but it seems to have picked up to a rate of 2 percent or more in the first quarter of this year. There are no signs that the American economy is about to fall into a recession. Indeed, demand has been strong enough to permit retailers to take a chance on raising prices, in an effort to improve profit margins.
The relative strength of demand also emboldened Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and a majority of the members and the Open Market Committee to resist earlier pressures to bring down interest rates. The pressures came from the White House and Treasury, many manufacturers and home builders, and even from some members of the Fed. Those pushing for an easier monetary policy feared that the buildup of private and public debt in the last decade had been so great that the nation simply could not afford to risk a recession, lest it result in a financial breakdown. The collapse of savings and loans, with an ultimate cost to taxpayers now estimated at $325 billion to $500 billion by the General Accounting Office, even without a recession, dramatized the risks of the enormous debt overhang.
Now the concerns about inflation have caused even those Fed governors who had been pushing for easier money to back off. But there is still enough concern about the economy's sluggishness to stop the anti-inflation hawks from tightening further. The hawks can afford to wait and let the market take on the unpopular job of raising rates.
The retreat of foreign investors from the United States bond market is also bringing down the dollar. This may help to shrink the trade deficit this year, easing protectionist pressures in Congress, although few economists expect that the drop in the trade deficit, to $6.49 billion in February, will continue at so low a rate.
So, in the midst of these conflicting pressures, monetary policy is now on hold, as the Fed waits to see whether the real economy will break out, by next autumn, on the high or low side, and whether the inflation rate holds within the 4 to 4.5 percent rate that nowadays is considered ''normal.'' If consumer prices are really moving up, not to the 8-plus rate reached in the first quarter, which looks highly improbable, but even above 5 percent, the Fed would be bound to tighten, unless the economy was plunging.
Instead, continued slow growth and moderate to slightly higher inflation appear to be in the cards. The majority of private economists polled by Blue Chip Indicators are continuing to predict no recession this year, with the real growth rate moving up from 1.9 percent in 1990 to 2.3 percent in 1991. And the consensus calls for a rise in consumer prices of 4.6 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year.
Some other term than stagflation is needed to describe this state of the American economy combining sluggish growth with sluggishly rising prices. ''Slugflation'' might do it. Or Prof. Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology may come even closer with the title of his new book: ''The Age of Diminished Expectations.''

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Pact Brings Skepticism in Congress

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
In the first public exchange between the Bush Administration and Congress over a new trade agreement with Japan, lawmakers voiced skepticism today about Tokyo's commitments and the extent to which the accord would help American exports.
''My impression is that other agreements with Japan with very specific goals have not worked and have been ignored, and this agreement is kind of soft and fuzzy, which makes it even more difficult to put in effect,'' said Sam Gejdenson, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade.
But Administration officials defended the pact as ''historic and unique'' in its focus on fundamental barriers to market forces, and said that while results might not be felt overnight, it should help insure a healthy and balanced economic relationship between the countries. 
 
Going on Record
''This is the first time the Japanese Government has gone on record as admitting that there are structural impediments in Japan,'' said S. Linn Williams, the deputy United States trade representative. ''This is the first time there is something approaching a comprehensive undertaking to address them.''
In an interim accord announced on April 5 in Washington and Tokyo, the Japanese Government promised to stiffen penalties for antitrust violations, shorten the time needed to open large retail stores, spend more money on public works, alter tax laws to expand land use for residential construction and make other ''structural'' reforms.
Administration officials from five agencies, appearing at a joint hearing before two subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, tried to show how these and other measures would eventually improve the American trade accounts. The agreement is expected to become final in July.
 
Few Specifics
Lawmakers said today that the accord seemed to lack specifics, had few time frames or deadlines and that even if it succeeded in knocking down some barriers provided little assurance that the United States would get the business, rather than the European Community, Australia or other competitors.
Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, citing a comment of The Economist, the British weekly magazine, asked whether the accord was ''fishy.''
Stephen J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, tried to get the Bush officials to predict how much the agreement would actually lift American exports.
The Administration witnesses said that the United States, which accounts for about 23 percent of Japan's total imports, should at least maintain that proportion as Japanese imports increase, but they declined to make specific forecasts.
Charles H. Dallara, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said the relationship between the Structural Impediments Initiative, as the effort to deal with broad obstacles to trade is called, and the exernal accounts was ''so complex that I don't think any model-based figures are going to be worth the time and effort.''
''What we are essentially trying to do is to create a level playing field,'' said Dr. John B. Taylor, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
But at another hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, David C. Mulford, the Under Secretary of the Treasury, citing the recent depreciation of the yen and Japan's closed markets, warned that the American trade deficit might worsen this year.
Congressional criticism of Japan, sometimes known as Japan-bashing, has been a primary force behind Administration initiatives to try to get the Japanese to open their markets. The Congressional criticism is a response to complaints from business constituents about the difficulties of selling in Japan.

HEADLINE: 3 Bell Units Post Gains In Profits

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Three of the seven regional Bell operating companies announced moderate growth in first-quarter earnings and sales yesterday, while a fourth, the Pacific Telesis Group, said its sales rose slightly while earnings fell.
The improvements came despite a national trend of state regulators' agreeing to loosen rules in return for lower local rates. Pactel's earnings fell 17.4 percent, which the company attributed to a rate reduction in California. 
Profit growth at the Bell regionals has been limited because many state regulators are demanding reductions in local rates in exchange for issuing new rules that allow companies to keep more of the gains from cost-cutting measures, said Edward M. Greenberg, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In the last two years, 11 states have introduced regulations that give incentives for cost reductions, said Ward H. White, the vice president for government affairs of the United States Telephone Association, a trade group in Washington.
Another common thread in the first-quarter reports has been rapid growth in the number of cellular phones, said Charles W. Shelkey, an analyst at Smith Barney.
 
Nynex
The Nynex Corporation reported that net income rose 2.8 percent, to $291.4 million, or $1.46 a share, from $283.6 million, or $1.44 a share, for the quarter a year ago. Revenues at the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone grew 2.2 percent, to $3.3 billion, from $3.23 billion.
William C. Ferguson, chairman and chief executive, attributed his company's slow growth in earnings to weakness in the Northeast's economy. Allowing for that, ''I'm not too unhappy with that 2.8 percent, because we got it by controlling our costs,'' he said in a telephone interview.
Jennifer L. Stonestreet, manager of the Fidelity Select Telecommunications Fund, said Nynex's results matched predictions because of cost-cutting, especially efforts to trim the work force to levels prevailing at other Bell regionals. ''Their expense control was excellent,'' she said. Nynex shares lost $1.50 yesterday, closing at $81.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Pacific Telesis
Pactel's earnings fell to $262 million, or 65 cents a share, from $317 million, or 76 cents a share. Revenues crept up 1.3 percent, to $2.37 billion from $2.34 billion.
California introduced new rules on Jan. 1 that increased Pactel's flexibility in price and spending decisions. But the new regulations were tied to an annual rate reduction of $391 million, which cut earnings and revenues at Pactel's main subsidiary, Pacific Bell. The announcement came after the close of trading.
 
Bell Atlantic
The Bell Atlantic Corporation announced a 7.4 percent increase in earnings, to $355.3 million, or 90 cents a share, from $330.8 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago. Revenues increased 9 percent, to $3.02 billion from $2.77 billion.
The nation's largest provider of local telephone service attributed the revenue rise to strong demand for its network services products. These include Caller ID, which had attracted 65,000 customers by the end of the quarter, Bell Atlantic said.
 
U S West
Earnings at U S West Inc. rose 7.4 percent, to $271.9 million, or 73 cents a share, from $249.6 million, or 68 cents a share, for the period last year. Revenues climbed 1.4 percent, to $2.43 billion from $2.39 billion.
The number of subscriber lines served by U S West grew by 3 percent over the last 12 months, to 12.3 million. But reduced rates associated with regulatory change and lower interstate access charges meant that overall telephone revenue was little changed, Jack MacAllister, chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. U S West shares fell 25 cents, to $72.50 on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Trustee Has Experience, And Plenty of Problems

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The appointment of Martin R. Shugrue as the special trustee of Eastern Airlines puts the troubled company in the hands of an experienced airline executive, but analysts doubt that he will be able to attract the thousands of additional passengers that Eastern must have to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent airline.
Former associates at Pan American World Airways described the former Navy pilot, who is 49 years old, as a hard-charging, accessible executive who immerses himself in the details of daily flight schedules and other operations, while leaving broader planning and financial issues to others.
''Marty is a hands-on type of guy,'' said Tom Lambert, president of the Pan American chapter of the Flight Engineers International Association. ''He's got a lot of moxie. He can move in and take care of a problem. He doesn't delegate it.'' 
 
Rose Through the Ranks
The son of a policeman in Providence, R.I., Mr. Shugrue received a bachelor's degree in economics from Providence College in 1962. He rose through the ranks at the Pan Am Corporation, which he had joined in 1968 as a pilot known as a cockpit navigator, to become vice chairman in 1984.
A year later, he added the title of chief of operations. He had previously held senior marketing and personnel posts at the airline. By most accounts, Mr. Shugrue enjoyed favorable relations with Pan American's unions.
Some people in the industry said Mr. Shugrue burdened the company with heavier costs than other large airlines by committing Pan American to large wage and benefit packages for its employees. ''He has a little trouble saying no to somebody he likes,'' Mr. Lambert said.
Pan Am's directors eventually forced Mr. Shugrue and Edward C. Acker, the company's chairman and chief executive, to resign after the two executives sparred over plans to rescue the faltering airline in 1987 while losses mounted.
 
President of Continental
Within months, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of the Texas Air Corporation, parent of both Eastern and Continental Airlines, hired Mr. Shugrue to direct daily operations at Continental as its president.
But Mr. Shugrue quit that post in less than a year after he clashed with D. Joseph Corr, a strong-willed executive whom Mr. Lorenzo had recruited to preside over Continental -and over Mr. Shugrue - as its chairman and chief executive.
''Marty is a capable guy,'' Mr. Lorenzo said yesterday in an interview. He said Texas Air's directors had hired Mr. Corr to work with Mr. Shugrue in changing Continental's strategy and operations to appeal more to business travelers. ''Marty and Joe just didn't hit it off,'' Mr. Lorenzo said.
Industry analysts said Mr. Shugrue's goal at Eastern would be to increase the number of passengers and keep its operations intact through the summer as creditors attempt to find a buyer for the airline.
That could raise more cash for Eastern and enable it to step up payments on its debt, which totals nearly $1 billion. Creditors would be more likely to limit their losses on Eastern if the company were sold.
 
A Grim Alternative
The grimmer outcome for creditors would be a complete shutdown of operations, followed by an auctioning of Eastern's aircraft and gate slots at several airports, including the line's hub at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta.
Raymond E. Neidl, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Company, and Mr. Lambert of the flight engineers' union each said that Mr. Shugrue faced an almost impossible task and that Eastern was not likely to survive the year as an independent carrier.
If Eastern's passenger count and ticket revenues are not stronger through the summer, which is the busiest season for air travel, creditors at Eastern will probably press either for an immediate sale or dismemberment of the airline's opeations, Mr. Neidl said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Yen As It Closes Mostly Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday in domestic currency exchange trading, losing ground against a revived Japanese yen but rising against most other leading currencies.
Analysts said rumors in the markets that the Japanese were about to raise interest rates - placing the yen in a better position against the American currency - put pressure on the dollar.
Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc., said the dollar had not performed as well as might have been expected in recent days, given a surprisingly large improvement in the American trade deficit this week, and an increase in market interest rates in the United States. 
 
Rates May Be Stabilized
Mr. Barbanel said exchange rates might be stabilizing, or foreign currencies may be enjoying a technical ''bounce'' after the dollar's recent rise.
Overseas dealers said the yen's modest recovery after weeks of declines was a result of a range of events, notably a rebound on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and reported comments from United States Treasury officials that they considered the dollar too strong.
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.75 yen, down 2.12 yen from the Wednesday close. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 156.40 yen. In New York, it fell sharply to 157.25 yen, from 158.125 late Wednesday.
The British pound was quoted at $1.6448, up from $1.6347 late Wednesday. In New York the pound fetched $1.6450, up from $1.6400.
 
Late New York Rates
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6787 West German marks, up from 1.6720; 1.4847 Swiss francs, up from 1.4785; 5.6425 French francs, up from 5.6200; 1,233.50 Italian lire, up from 1,228.25, and 1.16225 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16135.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those of late Wednesday, were: 1.6755 West German marks, up from 1.6720; 1.4815 Swiss francs, down from 1.4876; 5.6325 French francs, up from 5.6315; 1.8820 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8855; 1,231.25 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50, and 1.1618 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1640.
In the precious metals market, gold rose $1.20 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $377.20, and was later quoted at a bid price of $377 by the Republic National Bank in New York, up 70 cents from late Wednesday.
Gold traded in London at $376.55 an ounce, up from $375. Silver rose two-tenths of a cent on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $5.067 an ounce.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Decline

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped for the fifth straight session in light trading yesterday, but traders said that after the big losses of the last few days bargain-hunters were creeping back.
The bulk of the declines were recorded during trading in Europe, as dealers there reacted to Wednesday's huge selloff by pushing prices lower. But a recovery of sorts began once activity shifted to the United States.
''The market is oversold,'' one trader in government bonds said. ''All the talk is bearish, but we have had a pretty good adjustment over the last few days and we are starting to see a little bottom-fishing.'' 
 
Notes Only Slightly Lower
Since the start of the week yields on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds have risen by more than 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. But traders said the real bargains were to be found among short-term securities like two-year notes, now trading at only slightly lower yields than those offered on 30-year bonds.
''The long end is still overpriced, particularly relative to two-year paper,'' the trader said.
Late yesterday the 8 1/2 percent Treasury bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 13/32, down 6/32, to yield 8.84 percent. During trading in London yesterday yields on the benchmark issue rose as high as 8.90 percent. Late Wednesday the bond was offered at a price to yield 8.83 percent.
In comparison, the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered in late trading yesterday at 99 17/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.76 percent.
 
Surprise to Analysts
The recent spurt in interest rates, caused in large part by renewed concerns about inflation, has come as a surprise to analysts, who were looking for a moderating trend in prices and the economy.
But others, who say the increase reflects stronger economic growth and heightened inflation expectations, suggested that even higher rates were likely in the months ahead.
''The market is concerned that either the economy and/or inflationary pressures are beginning to rise,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. ''I think that notion is premature.''
Nancy J. Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data, a financial advisory and service firm in Boston, said that ''given the inflation rate we had in the first quarter, we need to see consumer prices rise at 3 percent or less for the remainder of the year to get inflation back to where people were anticipating it would be at the start of the year, at 4.5 to 5 percent.''
 
Near-Term Rally Seen
''I think we will get a near-term rally,'' Ms. Kimelman added, ''but I'm not afraid to say we are going to see bond yields run through 9 percent sometime this year. And you can't rule out even higher rates later on. The rise in rates reflects a readjustment in inflationary expectations.''
Prices were only modestly lower in the secondary market for intermediate-term Treasury notes. And rates on short-term Treasury bills fell.
In the note market, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered late yesterday at 97 23/32, down 3/32, to yield 8.84 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 23/32, down 1/32, to yield 8.80 percent.
 
Bill Rates Down
Meanwhile, three-month Treasury bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.74 percent, down four basis points. And six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 7.82 percent.
Traders in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that selling by large institutional accounts pushed down the prices of most actively traded issues by about half a point.
The investment-grade corporate bond market, hard hit by the recent slide in Treasury prices, stabilized somewhat yesterday. Dealers said that most issues in the secondary market were unchanged on the day.
 
Two Money Gauges Rise
In another development, the Federal Reserve Board reported that the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose sharply during the week ended April 9. The narrowest measure, M-1, fell by $2.4 billion.
The increase in M-2 and M-3 were well above the forecasts of most analysts. But few expressed alarm at the figures.
''The trend in the money supply of late has been weak and sluggish,'' said Ken Kim, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and analysis on developments in the credit and foreign exchange markets. ''I think these figures are an exception to that trend, and are probably due to tax payment preparation.''
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Describes Weak Soviet Economy

 BODY:
The Soviet economy is in such bad shape that a ''single major event,'' like a long strike or new ethnic unrest, could cause economic chaos, Congress was told yesterday. 
Intelligence experts painted an unusually grim picture of rising prices and empty shelves, of policies gone awry and of bureaucratic inertia.
While the Kremlin has said its new policies can revive the economy, one American expert said ''the prospect of even a modest economic recovery appears to be remote at best.''

HEADLINE: Prices of Co-ops Sag in New York About 5 to 10%

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Two years into a real-estate slump that has left the owners of New York City cooperatives and condominiums worrying how far the value of their homes has fallen - and many apartment hunters wondering if now is the time to buy - a review of recent sales suggests that prices have sagged 5 to 10 percent across the city. But there is no evidence of a collapse. In some suburbs in the New York region, home values have plummeted as much as 30 percent, brokers say, and other regions of the nation have suffered even steeper declines. But selling prices appear to have dropped more moderately in most New York City co-op and condominium buildings since the first quarter of 1988.
 
Watching for the Bottom
Powerful economic forces continue to weigh on the city, and no one can be certain that the slow decline has hit bottom. Heavy layoffs on Wall Street have hammered the real-estate market, and the financial problems of sponsors in 200 converted co-op buildings have chilled buyers and lenders alike.
Still, economists and real-estate executives say there is huge backlog of demand in the city that should make itself felt when buyers sense that the market has bottomed out. In a city where finding a better place to live is close to an obsession during real-estate booms, it remains a powerful preoccupation when the market slumps. 
''The first question we are hearing from buyers is whether things will be worse next year,'' said Roberta Faulstick, vice president of the William B. May brokerage in charge of sales in Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope. ''We don't have a crystal ball. We tell them our general sense is that the market is stabilizing.''
Some say the best opportunity to find a bargain may already have passed.
''I was hoping to buy at the bottom, and I'm afraid I've waited too long,'' said Simon Barkagan, a Manhattan physician who has spent the last year scouring the fashionable buildings on the Upper East Side, hoping to find a large three-bedroom at a steep discount. He said he missed a chance in January, because an apartment he wanted, offered at $750,000, was snapped up by someone else who bid more than the asking price.
 
A 'Quality of Life' Purchase
Alan Eisenberg, the owner of a Manhattan film-editing company, said he looked at 50 co-ops and condominiums before signing a contract last month to buy a four-bedroom co-op on West End Avenue at 75th Street.
''The question is whether you are buying for a better quality of life or just as in investment,'' he said. ''If what you want is a place to live, this is a good time in New York City.''
Mr. Eisenberg said his reason for buying now is that he is getting married and needs space for a child. Although he declined to say how much he paid for the co-op, he said the price was reduced more than 25 percent from what the owner had asked in newspaper ads in December.
Assessing the New York City market is difficult because the selling prices of cooperative apartments, which far outnumber condominiums, are not publicly reported. As in the case of the apartment purchased by Mr. Eisenberg, asking prices can be misleading because they are often far higher than what owners are willing to accept.
 
Sales Comparisons
But several brokers and management companies agreed to provide price histories of apartments, in most cases on the condition that addresses not be published. The results provide a rough sampling of a market in which the value of most apartments has declined:
* On Riverside Drive in the 70's, a large one-bedroom co-op on the 14th floor with a balcony and Hudson River view sold for $274,000 in February, $6,000 less than the comparable apartment on the 11th floor had sold for three months earlier.
* At a 29-story co-op in the East 60's, sales of comparable two-bedroom apartments have been frequent enough to show a trend. The apartments sold for $610,000 in 1987, $675,000 in 1988 and $615,000 late last year.
* At 1088 Park Avenue, a richly appointed co-op at the corner of 89th Street, a large three-bedroom on the third floor sold for $1.4 million in June 1988. The comparable fifth-floor apartment went for $1.6 million in July 1989, and the one on the 10th floor is now for sale. The owner listed it at $1.6 million in October, but he has now dropped the asking price to $1.3 million. #30,000 Wall St. Jobs Lost One grim uncertainty is employment on Wall Street, where more than 30,000 jobs have been eliminated since the 1987 stock market collapse, bringing some apartment owners under intense pressure to sell their homes.
Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services, estimated that 17,000 additional Wall Street jobs would be cut this year as investment firms further consolidate their operations.
Another problem weighing on the market is the financial difficulties of sponsors, reported in January by the New York State Attorney General, that threaten the stability of some co-ops converted under noneviction plans from rentals. The problems mainly are in buildings that retain many long-term tenants paying below-market rents.
In these buildings, the state said, sponsors are in a financial squeeze because the income they receive from rents of apartments they own is not covering their monthly expenses for maintenance and upkeep. Although none of these co-ops have defaulted on their underlying mortgages, the Attorney General's office has compiled a ''watch list'' of 200 buildings where sponsors are behind on maintenance charges and payments on loans they have taken out on occupied units.
 
Mortgage Money Tight
For those trying to buy or sell co-op units, the difficulty has extended beyond the buildings being watched by state officials because lenders have become more cautious in extending mortgage loans.
''Things are getting tighter all over,'' said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publishing firm that tracks lending policies in the New York City real-estate market. He said many lenders that had been requiring 20 percent downpayments for apartment purchases are now requiring 25 percent down, and most are reluctant to extend financing at converted buildings that retain many rental apartments.
Real-estate sales people say one significant change in the market has been that the largest, most fashionable apartments, which previously had been holding their value because of high demand from buyers, have now declined slightly in price.
''The larger apartments in the best locations have joined the slump,'' said Barbara Corcoran, president the Corcoran Group, a brokerage in Manhattan that specializes in expensive apartments. In a survey of 2,640 apartment sales in 1989, the most complete analysis of co-op sales available, she said prices had fallen an average of 9.2 percent during the year, following average increases of 8.1 percent in 1988.
 
Price Decline Persists
Ms. Corcoran also tracked sales during the first three months of this year, but confined the analysis to a much smaller number of two-bedroom apartments, and found that prices continued to decline. Although there is no consensus on price trends, other real-estate professionals said they do not dispute her findings, saying the average decline in apartment values had been between 5 and 10 percent since the beginning of 1988.
Like the prices that are paid, the number of apartments sold is difficult to measure in New York City. Brokers regard their sales volume as proprietary information and fear giving away information to competitors. Nevertheless, some will speak of percent changes, among them Douglas Elliman, one of the city's largest brokerages, which reported a 15 percent rise in sales in the first three months of this year against the comparable period in 1989. Another big brokerage, Sulzberger Rolfe, said its 1990 sales were running 28 percent above those of last year.
But in a broader analysis, in which Ms. Corcoran compiled the number of sales contracts recorded at brokerage offices across the city, she said she found a 19 percent dropoff in the number of sales in the first three months of the year. She also said the length of time it takes to sell an apartment is growing, from an average 23 weeks in 1989 to 26 weeks this year.
Despite the sluggish conditions, many apartment hunters and real-estate executives say they are convinced that prices will not go lower. One reason is that New York remains a city of renters, many of them paying almost as much each month in rent as it would cost to own an apartment.
Although rental rates have not been rising as fast as they were in the mid-1980's, and have declined on some of the most expensive apartments, the financial distance between renting and owning appears to have narrowed.
''You hit bottom when the net economic cost of owning an apartment is similar to what it would be for a market rate rental, and I am confident we have reached bottom,'' said John Tyrrel, senior vice president of Sulzberger Rolfe.
Although they are greatly outnumbered by cooperative apartments in New York City, the number of condominiums has been growing rapidly since a surge of new construction in the late 1980's. Because their selling prices are recorded with the city and are available to the public, analysts say they provide a narrow but precise gauge of the market.
In the most comprehensive study of the condominium market, Yale Robbins, a real estate analyst, looked at thousands of sales and calculated selling prices per square foot of space in the apartments. He found that prices reached a peak in early 1988 and then fell swiftly by as much as 10 percent by early 1989. Over the last year, the study found, prices were relatively constant.
Mr. Robbins said two-bedroom condominiums sold for an average of $382 a square foot in February, down from $410 two years earlier. One-bedroom condominiums were also down, selling for $358 a square foot in February, compared to $395 two years earlier. Studio apartments held up slightly better, selling for $355 a square foot in February, down from $385 a square foot two years earlier.

HEADLINE: MERCK IS OFFERING TO CUT DRUG COSTS OF MEDICAID USERS

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Breaking with longtime drug industry resistance, Merck & Company said yesterday that it would offer discounted prices to state Medicaid programs for the poor.
Merck, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, acted as members of Congress and Medicaid officials in several states sought to force drug makers to cut prices. The company, which is based in Rahway, N.J., said its proposal could save the Federal-state programs millions of dollars.
Under the plan, states would get rebates based on Merck's lowest prices, to match what it already offers to the Veterans Affairs Department and a few other large purchasers. 
Merck's best-known products include Vasotec, a blood-pressure and heart drug; Mevacor, a cholesterol-lowering agent, and Pepcid, an ulcer treatment.
 
End of Curbs Sought
Merck's move makes good business sense, analysts said. As part of the deal, the states would have to agree to exempt Merck's patented drugs from restrictions that make it difficult or impossible for doctors in some states to prescribe many of the most expensive drugs for Medicaid patients.
Some state Medicaid plans maintain lists of approved drugs, often requiring the use of low-priced generic aternatives unless a doctor specifically requests the higher-priced drug.
Ronald Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Securities, said the Merck program was ''a very clever program'' and ''it would bring increases in purchases of Merck products.''
Merck, which has a 5 percent share of the worldwide pharmaceutical market, presented its plan to Medicaid officials in 20 states and Congressional committee aides on Thursday. A number of state officials welcomed the proposal as an industry effort to help with prices, but some said a careful analysis would be required.
Securities analysts said they doubted that other drug companies, which do not have as many $100 million-a-year products as Merck, would copy the plan unless forced to do so by new legislation.
In California, officials of the Medi-Cal program for the poor said a draft of a bill in the California Assembly that would apply the Merck program to all drug companies was circulating among legislators. ''Drug company representatives have been asking us for our reaction,'' said Vic Walker, a senior consulting pharmacist with Medi-Cal, who was skeptical about the Merck proposal. ''We're taking it with two or three grains of salt.''
 
'Program Will Make Sense'
Sanford Luger, chief consultant pharmacist with New Jersey's Medicaid program, which covers all drugs, said that ''Merck has again shown its leadership; I believe the program will make sense.''
But John Alquest, the commissioner of medical services in Kansas, said that giving up his state's drug restrictions might ''result in increased cost to us; we're going to have to take a closer look.'' A dozen states restrict Medicaid prescriptions for at least one Merck product.
Other drug companies were reluctant to comment on the proposal. Noting that ''Merck is one of the leading companies in our industry,'' Edward A. West, a spokesman for Eli Lilly & Company, said the plan ''appears interesting, but we don't feel we're in a position to discuss it in depth.''
''It would be premature for us to comment until we study it further,'' said Anthony A. Biesada, a spokesman at Pfizer Inc. Peter Wolf, a spokesman for the Warner-Lambert Company, said, ''It wouldn't be appropriate to comment on another firm's pricing practices or policy.''
The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, a trade group, said its board would discuss the proposal at its next meeting on May 3. 10 Percent of Sales Dr. John L. Zabriskie, president of Merck Sharpe & Dohme, Merck's drug manufacturing unit, said Medicaid purchases amounted to about 10 percent, or $300 million, of the company's $3 billion in annual American pharmaceutical sales.
''Our proposal maintains the physician's prerogative to prescribe what they think best for poorer patients just as they do for the general public,'' he added. ''We don't think governments should be interfering in that decision.''
The nation's Medicaid programs spent $3.3 billion on drugs in 1988. Christopher Jennings, deputy staff director of the Senate Committee on Aging, said that if the Merck plan was widely accepted, it could mean potential savings of $20 million to $30 million, based on the company's current discounts of 7 to 12 percent for bulk buyers.
Senator David Pryor, who is preparing a bill to require drug companies to bid for Medicaid business, said the Merck proposal was ''generally encouraging.'' The Arkansas Democrat added, ''It represents an acknowledgement that it makes no sense for taxpayer-funded poverty programs to keep paying top dollar'' for drugs.
But Mr. Pryor, who is chairman of the Committee on Aging, said that Merck's discounts were much smaller than those of ''most other drug manufacturers,'' which grant price cuts of up to 40 percent to hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
Mr. Nordmann, the analyst, said the plan was ''a viable alternative to the Pryor bill.'' He added that other drug companies, many of which offer deeper discounts, were unlikely to follow Merck's lead unless Senator Pryor's bill attracted strong support.
 
Discounts Much Smaller
California officials said some manufacturers had been charging Medi-Cal patients almost twice as much as the Veterans Affairs Department pays for the same drugs. But Merck's discounts are much smaller, Mr. Walker said. For example, Medi-Cal patients are charged $27.83 for a month's supply of Merck's Pepcid ulcer drug, but the Veterans Affairs Department pays $24.26. Medi-Cal pays $56.97 for a bottle of Vasotec, Merck's blood-pressure drug, which costs the Federal veterans agency $54.03.
Merck said it was addressing ''America's health-care cost problems'' and that it had kept its drug price rises below 5 percent this year and in 1989. Prices charged by the drug industry as a whole have been increasing at about twice the rate of inflation in recent years.
Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, Merck's chairman, had said in November that the company's policy was to raise prices no more than the inflation rate.

U.S. SEES THREATS TO SOVIET ECONOMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
The economy of the Soviet Union is in a ''near crisis'' state, and prospects for improvement are slight, United States intelligence agencies told Congress today.
A ''single major event'' like a prolonged strike or new ethnic unrest could lead to economic chaos, the agencies said.
In their annual report to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency said Moscow had cut military spending by 4 to 5 percent last year, the first such cuts since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev became the Soviet leader in 1985. Further cuts are likely this year and next year, the agencies said. But they said the reductions so far do not meet Mr. Gorbachev's pledge to reduce military spending by 14 percent and weapons production by 19 percent. 
The report is always read closely by students of the Soviet Union, and the data compiled in preparing it are crucial to American policy makers. This year, the intelligence experts painted an unsually grim picture of rising prices and empty shelves, of policies gone awry and of bureaucratic intertia.
 
Strong Medicine or Compromise
The assessment of the Soviet economy last year was not substantially different from Moscow's own. But while officials there have been somewhat optimistic that new policies can turn the economy around, the American experts took a different view.
''The prospect of even a modest economic recovery appears to be remote at best,'' said John L. Helgerson, Deputy Director for Intelligence at the C.I.A. ''The most likely outcome for 1990 is that the Soviet economy will stagnate or decline slightly, that inflationary pressure will remain strong and that widespread shortages will persist.''
Mr. Helgerson was skeptical that Mr. Gorbachev could achieve the bold economic measures he has promised. ''We wonder if this will finally be the strong medicine the economy needs or another compromise,'' he said.
The analysts buttressed their anecdotal snapshots, familiar to most anyone who has been in the Soviet Union, with statistical data, including these:
* Total energy production fell last year for the first time since 1940. Oil output, for example, dropped 2.5 percent.
* A small per capita increase in consumption was due largely to a sharp rise in sales of alcoholic beverages and imported consumer goods. The production of alcoholic beverages increased 20 percent after the Government eased controls on vodka sales.
* The 1.5 percent increase in the Soviet Union's gross national product was illusory. Much of the Soviet output went into warehouses and never reached customers.
* An improvement in agricultural production after a two-year decline was offset by widespread breakdowns in the transportation and distribution networks. Freight shipments fell by 116 million tons, one of the worst annual performances in years.
 
Cuts in Conventional Forces
Assessing military changes in the Soviet Union, Dennis M. Nagy, Acting Deputy Director for Foreign Intelligence at the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the lawmakers that Moscow was well on the way to accomplishing the unilateral troop reductions and conventional arms cuts promised by President Gorbachev.
''The withdrawal of most if not all Soviet forces from Eastern Europe appears to be only a matter of time,'' Mr. Nagy said. He said that tank production had been halved and that production of field artillery, multiple rocket launchers and bombers had also declined.
The decline in military spending, Mr. Nagy said, consisted of a 6 to 7 percent drop in weapons procurement, a 5 percent cut in operations and maintenance and a 4 percent reduction in spending for personnel.
On the other hand, Mr. Nagy said, the modern equipment being withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's eastern and southern borders is not being destroyed but is being stored in the interior of the country. Furthermore, he said, cutbacks in conventional strength are not matched by nuclear forces.
 
Causes of Economic Distress
''The Soviets have continued vigorous and broad-based modernization of both their strategic offensive and defensive forces,'' Mr. Nagy said. He continued, ''The trend toward modernization of a somewhat smaller military force will continue.''
The intelligence agencies said the causes of the economic distress in the Soviet Union included these:
* Some policy decisions had unforeseen consequences. For instance, the decision to allow an increased budget deficit stimulated strong inflationary pressure.
* Central economic planning was abandoned long before market revisions were in place. As a result, although some enterprises were free to produce what they wanted, the lack of competition and market prices often meant that expensive goods were made that nobody wanted.
* The Soviet Union lags far behind the West in the use of computer technology, making modernization of industry difficult if not impossible.
Also, disasters like the earthquake in Armenia in 1988 and the nuclear power disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 squeezed already limited resources.

HEADLINE: For North, Missions That Have One Goal

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
Oliver L. North is still a man with a mission.
In fact, since his conviction last May for involvement in the Iran-contra scandal, the retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps has become a man of many missions.
He is traveling the country, preaching freedom - freedom not only for the Nicaraguan rebels and the peoples of Eastern Europe but also freedom from what he calls an ''imperial Congress,'' freedom for young people trapped in the nation's slums, freedom for the American economy and, well, freedom for Oliver North, felon.
He is also pulling in a lot of money, sometimes as much as $25,000 for a single speech, and, in a departure from the usual political practice, is being paid to make political endorsements.
Many conservatives see Mr. North as the man who can rejuvenate the right - the Barry Goldwater and the Ronald Reagan of the 1990's. He gives every indication that he is willing to be out in front, to walk point, as they put it in the Marine Corps. And he shows no sign that being found guilty of obstructing Congress, destroying Government documents and taking an illegal gift has dampened his zeal for the cause. 
 
Assembling a New Organization
''Ignorance and apathy aren't just problems of the left,'' he says, looking as fit and closely cropped as in the days when he was serving as an aide to the National Security Council, devising ways to sell arms to Iran in return for hostages and enough profit to underwrite the rebels in Nicaragua.
Already, as he awaits the outcome of an appeal of his conviction and three-year suspended sentence, he is assembling a new conservative organization, the Freedom Alliance. In his words, it will seek ''to return America to its first principles'' of traditional morality, free enterprise, close-knit families, sound schools and a strong defense.
Howard Phillips, a veteran of the right who heads a major organization, the Conservative Caucus, said, ''Ollie comes closest these days as a rallying point for true conservatives.''
''He has the potential to be someone like the Goldwater of the 50's and 60's or the Reagan of the 70's and 80's,'' Mr. Phillips added. ''There's a real need for a new focal point because so many of the true conservative positions got subsumed or watered down in the later Reagan years. Ollie North is the most marketable political commodity that I know of in the whole United States.''
 
On the Road and Speaking
The marketing is well under way.
Mr. North is spending 15 to 20 days a month on the road delivering his message about God and country, mainly to civic and business groups. The message is now well honed; the timing of the jokes and digs is trouper perfect.
First there is some Congress bashing and some baiting of news organizations. Next comes a plea for a voter revolution. Then comes a clucking litany about the fallen ''Commie Cronies'' in Eastern Europe.
He does not credit glasnost for this development. Rather, he pins the medal on his old supreme commander, Ronald Reagan, the man who would not testify on his behalf at his trial.
 
'We Must Remain Vigilant'
But always he adds a warning. ''We must remain vigilant,'' he says. ''We must keep our eyes open and our powder dry.''
At some point in most speeches, Mr. North speaks of personal mistakes and of the special hurt he felt when his felony convictions cost him his military pension, his right to vote and his right to serve in Government. But he offers no apologies. Sometimes Mr. North shows up for his speeches in a limousine escorted by the police. He often confronts clusters of noisy protesters and eager autograph seekers. Usually he gets a hefty fee, the charge reportedly being $25,000, although those who hire him and those who arrange his speeches refuse to say how much he receives.
Mr. North is also appearing at fund-raising events and rallies for conservative candidates. Most political stumpers do this kind of work at no charge or for expenses, but he usually requests a fee.
 
Aides Say North Isn't Rich
His aides and friends say the fee is readily paid by candidates. And they said it is justifiable because the money goes to Mr. North's lawyers and to the Freedom Alliance, which pays him an annual salary of $44,000. They put little stock in a contention by the judge in his trial that his notoriety had made him rich.
''Ollie still buys the cheapest beer he can find, and he still takes his garbage to the dump so he can save the $30-a-month collection fee,'' said Ben Hart, the executive director of the Freedom Alliance.
Some months back, Mr. North raised money for a Republican Senate candidate in New Hampshire, Thomas Christo, who supports abortion rights, not the usual conservative stance. Next month, he is scheduled to raise funds for a Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, Clark Durant, who opposes abortions, the more typical conservative approach.
This straddling on a major issue has left some conservatives mumbling, though mostly to themselves so far. On the other hand, the straddling, along with the fee Mr. North charges, led The Ann Arbor News in Michigan to write in an editorial: ''There's something contemptible about this kind of political trafficking. Big-money endorsements don't necessarily cut it with the people, whose votes aren't for sale.''
 
Working With Youngsters
Besides working with conservative candidates, Mr. North is also working with ghetto youngsters, trying to persuade them to stay off drugs and to stay in school.
This work began as court-ordered punishment, which also included two years of probation and a $150,000 fine, along with the suspended three-year sentence. Mr. North was sentenced to 1,200 hours of community service, and he is still serving that with the Alliance to Save America's Future, a Washington group that works with inner-city youngsters in the capital. Mr. North says that what he has witnessed and experienced in the slums of the nation's capital has given him a desire to spend much of his future working to ''save'' American youth and, by extension, America.
Mr. North's close friends go beyond saying he is simply ''imbued'' with a desire to work with youth as a result of his Washington experience. ''He's been radicalized into action by what he's seen,'' said L. Brent Bozell 3d, a conservative advocate who is close to Mr. North. ''He never speaks of his work in the ghetto as being punishment.''
Finally, there is Mr. North's new business venture.
He and an old acquaintance from the Central Intelligence Agency in the Iran-contra days, Joseph Fernandez, have formed a company called Guardian Technologies International that makes body armor for police officers and others in need of such protection. Mr. North, who reportedly was once a target of terrorists and who is frequently accompanied by security guards, says in one company brochure: ''I rely every day on the security of a G.T.I. vest.''
By any measure, Oliver North is a busy man in the aftermath of the Iran-contra scandal.
But in a larger sense, Oliver North is mainly waiting. He is waiting for the outcome of his court appeal, waiting to see if the word ''felon'' will be struck from a life record that he sees as one of steadfast duty, honor and courage.

HEADLINE: Biotechnology Enters Political Race

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MADISON, Wis., April 18

 BODY:
A furious four-year struggle that mixes concern about new farm technology with old-fashioned partisan politics has left Gov. Tommy G. Thompson facing one of the most difficult decisions of his administration.
The 48-year-old Republican Governor, who hopes to be elected to a second term this November, has made attracting and supporting biotechnology businesses a cornerstone of his program to stabilize Wisconsin's struggling rural economy. This state is home to several leading agricultural biotechnology companies.
Now the first economically important farm product of the young biotechnology industry is poised to come to market: a genetically engineered drug intended to increase milk production in cows by 10 to 25 percent. 
Standing in the way is the Wisconsin Legislature, led by Mr. Thompson's Democratic challenger for governor, the Assembly Speaker, Tom Loftus. On March 22, the Legislature approved a temporary ban on the drug.
 
Fear of Economic Disaster
Mr. Loftus, 44, and other critics say the drug is a ruinous application of gene-splicing technology that is being forced on the dairy industry by four big corporations. They fear that it will result in a huge milk surplus and that consumer fears about the health effects of residues in milk might lead some people to stop buying dairy products. They say the result would be an economic disaster for farmers.
The manufacturers, the Monsanto Company, Eli Lilly & Company, the American Cyanamid Company, and the Upjohn Company, have been joined by the Food and Drug Administration in declaring that trace amounts of the drug in milk from cows injected with it are harmless.
The drug, bovine somatotropin (suh-mat-uh-TROPE-in), is a nearly identical artificial copy of a natural protein produced in the pituitary glands of cows that helps to control milk production. The development of genetic engineering, in which genes from one species are incorporated into the chromosomes of another, makes it possible to produce unlimited quantities of the hormone for use as a veterinary drug.
Yet after years of review and predictions by the manufacturers that the drug would be approved this year, the drug agency has not cleared it.
The delay is in part a result of a clash that began in Wisconsin in 1986 and spread across the Midwest, New York, Pennsylvania and New England. Led by Jeremy Rifkin, a critic of biotechnology from Washington, and supported by a Wisconsin State Senator, Russell Feingold, hundreds of dairy farmers held protests focusing on the question of who really benefits from the drug: farmers, consumers or the four corporations racing each other to bring to the product to market. Analysts believe the drug could generate worldwide sales of $500 million to $1 billion a year.
After years of trying to avoid the controversy, Governor Thompson was pushed into the struggle on March 22, when the State Legislature approved a bill that would temporarily bar the use or sale of the drug in Wisconsin. Under the legislation, bovine somatotropin would be barred until July 1, 1991, or until six months after approval by the Food and Drug Administration, whichever comes later. If the Governor does not act by April 27, the legislation automatically becomes law.
Mr. Thompson has now become the first prominent political leader in the country to come face to face with the new politics of biotechnology. In many rural areas, the use of modern technology on the farm is under attack by critics who say that is doing more to damage farmers than to help them. In Wisconsin, where the rural vote is a significant portion of the electorate, Mr. Thompson must decide between barring a product of biotechnology never proved to be hazardous and angering his supporters in the business community or vetoing the bill and upsetting thousands of rural voters.
Republican lawmakers here say that in any other year Mr. Thompson's decision would be easy: he would veto the bill. But this election year the decision is much more of a problem.
Mr. Thompson declined to be interviewed about the issue. His executive assistant, Patrick Osborne, said on Wednesday that Mr. Thompson would accept ''a cooling off period'' and allow the drug to be barred in Wisconsin until July 1991, but that he had reservations about the provision for a six-month delay after Federal approval. Mr. Osborne said the Governor also had questions about other provisions of the bill and had not made up his mind.
''The Governor recognizes there is a lot of uncertainty about the use of the drug among Wisconson's farmers,'' Mr. Osborne said. ''There is confusion also about the health effects. Rightly or wrongly people have concerns about the use of this drug.''
Mr. Loftus, meanwhile, has been meeting with his campaign advisers to develop a strategy to take advantage of the issue. In an interview, he said he viewed the debate over the drug as a rare opportunity to use an agricultural issue to bring out the differences between himself and the Governor.
''If ever there was an unneeded invention, this is it,'' Mr. Loftus said. ''It's only here because Monsanto wants it here. It doesn't make milk any better. And to tell you the truth, there is something weird about a farmer putting on his overalls and grabbing his syringe first thing in the morning.''
The manufacturers, led by Monsanto, say the drug is a triumph of technical ingenuity. They argue that bovine somatotropin makes it possible for cows to produce more milk on less feed, thus lowering costs, increasing profits and making the lives of dairy farmers easier. Monsanto has invested $300 million on research and development of the drug, more than any new product in the company's history.
Laurence J. O'Neill, a Monsanto spokesman in St. Louis, where the company is based, said: ''If a temporary ban is approved, it means more of a hardship for Wisconsin's dairy farmers than for the manufacturers. It still leaves the rest of the United States to buy BST. And we will sell BST.''
A group of Wisconsin executives in the biotechnology industry have also joined the battle by warning the Governor that a state ban on the drug would send a message to investors that would not only seriously hurt the development of genetically altered plants, microbes and other products of agricultural biotechnology, but that would also damage Wisconsin's reputation as a leader in biotechnology development.
Legislators of both parties say a close race could be decided by each candidate's position on BST.
 
MINNESOTA APPROVES BAN
ST. PAUL, April 20 (AP) - The Minnesota Senate today gave final approval, 34 to 23, to a one-year ban on bovine somatotropin.
The Minnesota House approved the ban, 68 to 59, on Thursday.
State Representative Chuck Brown, a leader of the move for the ban, said he had received assurances that Gov. Rudy Perpich would sign the measure into law. The ban would apply to non-medical use of the drug.
Mr. Brown and State Senator Steve Morse urged the ban to provide more time to study the potential effects of the drug on animals and human.

HEADLINE: Nunn Urges Cutting Bush Budget For Military by Up to $18 Billion

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
Senator Sam Nunn today recommended cutting President Bush's 1991 military budget proposal by as much as $18 billion, setting the stage for a battle with the Pentagon as well as House Democrats, who are seeking even deeper cuts.
The remarks by Mr. Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, came in the last of a series of speeches on military strategy and the budget in light of the political upheaval in Eastern Europe and the diminished Soviet threat.
In his speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Nunn proposed that the military budget next year range from $289 billion to $291 billion. The Administration has proposed $307 billion. 
House Democrats, who will take their proposal for the overall Federal budget to the House floor next week, have recommended a $283 billion figure for the Pentagon.
Mr. Nunn's recommendations provided only a general picture of how reducing the budget would affect major Pentagon programs and weapons systems. Specific recommendations will be made later this year when his panel and the House Armed Services Committee begin work on legislation to guide spending.
 
Competition of Services Urged
Mr. Nunn urged the Pentagon to begin what he called ''a constructive competition'' among the military services to see whether various roles and missions that are now handled independently could be combined or eliminated for greater efficiency.
His proposal is significant because he exerts considerable leverage on military issues in Congress. His recommendation will almost certainly be regarded as the ceiling in the Congressional debate over what share of the $1.2 trillion Federal budget should go to the Pentagon in the coming fiscal year.
In brief comments to reporters, Mr. Nunn said he would adhere to his number despite the expected efforts by many in his own party to lower it.
But the White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, predicted that once Congress begins to translate the recommendations for military reductions into cuts in specific weapons programs, there would be opposition from lawmakers whose districts and states will begin to feel the pinch.
He also said that because the economy has been weaker than the Administration expected, larger budget cuts will be necessary to meet the 1991 deficit target set by law.
 
'Range of Responsibility'
On Thursday morning, Mr. Nunn told reporters that an initial version of the House proposal for the military budget was ''in the range of responsibility.'' But that was before liberal House Democrats persuaded their leadership to slice an additional $3 billion from the Pentagon in the final version of the plan approved by the House Budget Committee on Thursday afternoon.
But today the Senator said that the $283 billion military budget envisioned by House Democrats ''is no longer reasonable, too deep and one that cannot be met.'' Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, said he and other Democratic leaders agreed to the additional cut to place themselves in a better bargaining position with Mr. Nunn and the Senate.
The Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to begin drafting its version of the overall budget next week, but it is deeply divided on a number of issues including military cuts. Its chairman, Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, favors sharper military cuts than those proposed by Mr. Nunn and the House budget panel.
One of the key decisions Congress will have to make this year is whether to proceed with both the Mobile MX missile system and the smaller, Midgetman missile system. ''We cannot afford to continue with the two mobile ICBM programs,'' said Mr. Nunn, who has long been a proponent of the single warhead Midgetman.
 
Proposals on Missiles
He stopped short, however, of calling for a halt in the program to build a mobile basing system for the multi-warhead MX missile, suggesting instead that it be slowed while the United States and the Soviet Union continue negotiations on elimination of multi-warhead missiles.
The Midgetman program should continue, he said, with an eye toward initially basing the missiles in existing silos.
Mr. Nunn, who is at odds with a number of his Democratic colleagues in favoring continuation of the Stealth bomber program, said he would wait until a Pentagon review of the radar-evading plane is complete before suggesting just how many planes should be built. But he said both the total price tag for the program and its yearly costs would have to be brought down.

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:
Holocaust and Earth Day It would be hard to miss the arrival of Earth Day on Sunday, a time for reflection on the fragile state of the planet. But it is also a day set aside for a commemoration of another kind. It is Holocaust Memorial Day, known in Hebrew as Yom Hashoah, a time to remember the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis during World War II.
While events marking Earth Day and Yom Hashoah will, for the most part, be separate, a Jewish environmental group outside Philadelphia is suggesting a connection. 
''Jews have a special sensitivity to the preciousness of life,'' said Ellen Bernstein, director of Shomrei Adamah, a project of the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot in Wyncote, Pa. ''Jews have a real understanding on this day in particular to the possibility of disaster when the world sits back and watches and waits.''
Ms. Bernstein will be a speaker at the Earth Fest in Philadelphia's Fairmont Park, where she plans to ask participants to observe a moment of silence for the victims of the Holocaust. She hopes to begin speaking at 2 P.M., just as a Yom Hashoah commemoration will be getting under way at the city's nearby Holocaust memorial.
 
Canterbury Favorite
Just days after the Archbishop of Canterbury announced plans to retire early next year, London bookmakers were picking favorites for a successor. They were offering 2-to-1 odds that Bishop Robin Eames, the Anglican primate of Ireland, would succeed Archbishop Robert Runcie.
With the Canterbury title comes the leadership of the worldwide Anglican communion, which includes the Episcopal Church in the United States. Dr. Runcie, who is 68 years old and has held the post for a decade, is stepping down just short of his 70th birthday, the mandatory retirement age.
As is the custom, the new archbishop will be nominated by the British Prime Minister and appointed by the Queen. If Dr. Eames is chosen, he will be the first non-English bishop to hold the position.
News of the resignation has been the occasion in the British press for speculation not only about a successor but also about the system of appointment and the institution of archbishop itself. The Economist, for example, called the involvement of the government and the monarch ''odd'' and ''crazy,'' concluding, ''The Anglican communion could do perfectly well without a figurehead at all.''
 
New Post for Prelate
Another prelate stepping down after 10 years of service is Archbishop Pio Laghi, who has been Pope John Paul II's representative of to the United States since 1980. Archbishop Laghi, an Italian, will return to Rome in May to head the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education.
One of Archbishop Laghi's primary tasks has been to make recommendations to Rome about new appointments as vacancies in the church hierarchy in the United States have occurred. During his term, some of the staunchest proponents of Roman Catholic orthodoxy have been named, including John Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston.
A successor to Archbishop Laghi will be named by John Paul. The bookmakers haven't a clue.
 
Popeye and the Quakers
Quaker Oats has nothing to do with the Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers. Quaker Oats was formed in 1891 by seven independent millers, some of them Scotch Presbyterians; today it has no religious ties.
But the Religious Quakers have taken umbrage at the company's use of the cantankerous Popeye the Sailor Man in a new campaign to promote instant oatmeal. ''The comics and the commercials featuring this character associate the Quaker name with violence and demeaning images of women,'' Paul Enyart, presiding clerk of the Friends United Meeting wrote to the Chicago headquarters of the corporation. ''Such images are repugnant to foundational Quaker testimonies of peace and equality.''
A corporate spokesman in Chicago said the protest caught Quaker Oats by surprise. ''We had not anticipated that this would create a controversy, and we're certainly sorry if it offended,'' said the spokesman, Ronald Bottrell.
Mr. Bottrell said that one commercial, featuring ''Popeye the Oatmeal Man,'' was immediately withdrawn and that others were permitted to run their course through the ''oatmeal season.'' As for next winter, he said, ''we have not ruled out using Popeye, but we're going to be very sensitive about the concerns raised by the Friends.''
 
Mass Trip to Israel
Some 800 Jews from the New York area will leave for Israel on Wednesday, in what organizers are calling the largest group of New Yorkers ever to visit Israel at one time. The trip, organized by the New York United Jewish Appeal-Federation, is intended to be a show of support at a time when Israel is under attack from both allies and enemies and tourism is lagging.
Organizers had hoped that they could send 2,000 from the New York area, where there are more Jews than in Tel Aviv. They insisted, however, that they were not disappointed with the turnout. ''We see it as more of a commentary on the diversity of the New York Jewish community than on any organizing effort or lack of support for Israel,'' said a spokesman, Steven Matthews.

HEADLINE: Eclipse Ends for a Rising Star

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Nearly 30 years ago, Robert Moskowitz was on the verge of stardom: one of his paintings had been bought by the Museum of Modern Art and his collages were being shown by the dealer Leo Castelli in company with works by Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella. Fifteen years ago, Mr. Moskowitz was driving a taxi in New York and seldom sold a painting.
But now, in another change of luck, the 55-year-old painter earns a comfortable income selling his canvases and has become one of those rare living artists to have his work featured in a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art.
''It's both difficult and educational to see your life in front of you like this,'' Mr. Moskowitz said of the exhibition of 83 paintings, drawings and collages that traces his career from the late 1950's to the present. His works are characterized by playful, dreamlike images that tread a fine line between abstraction and representation. The show, which can be seen through May 1, was organized by Ned Rifkin of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and was exhibited there and at La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art in California last year. 
 
Assessing the Twists and Turns
Mr. Moskowitz lives and works in a 5,000-square-foot loft in TriBeCa with his wife, Hermine Ford, also a painter, and their 23-year-old son, Erik, a painting student at the School of Visual Arts. The other day in his studio, he reflected on the twists and turns in his career.
''Up until your 40's, you're still learning,'' the artist said. ''Most people don't really do mature work until then. I agree with Auden that all you can hope for is good influences up to that point.''
By the time he had turned 40, Mr. Moskowitz's influences included Abstract Expressionist artists like Adolph Gottlieb, his teacher at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, and his father-in-law, Jack Tworkov, a painter; the Surrealist painter Marcel Duchamp; the photographer Walker Evans, with whom Mr. Moscowitz worked; Alfred Hitchcock, and Samuel Beckett. But the paintings he was doing were not finding a receptive audience, and he was devoting much of his energy to work outside his studio.
Mr. Moskowitz was born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and illustrated technical manuals for the Sperry Gyroscope Company during the late 1950's while studying graphic design at night at Pratt. He was derailed from his intended career as a technical illustrator by Mr. Gottlieb, whose painting class at Pratt persuaded him to become an artist.
 
Collages With Window Shades
In the early 1960's, Mr. Moskowitz burst on the New York art scene with a series of collages using window shades that seemed to place him at the heart of the growing Pop Art movement. As the art historian Robert Rosenblum wrote in 1983 of Mr. Moskowitz's early works, ''They seemed to push both the basic language of painting and the fundamentals of image-making to a rock-bottom economy, where suddenly the two worlds were forever fused - a flat painting equaling a flat window shade.''
But this early brush with the limelight was short-lived for Mr. Moskowitz, a man noted for his low-key manner and strong sense of privacy. In 1964 he left the Castelli Gallery because he felt the dealer was no longer interested in his work and he wanted to explore what he called ''a slower kind of painting.''
''It wasn't a good place for me to be because I was learning and experimenting rather than doing resolved paintings,'' he said. ''I was never a Pop Artist. The window shades weren't like the Brillo boxes or Campbell Soup cans. The Pop imagery was jazzier and more specific than mine in drawing from popular culture.''
Mr. Moskowitz spent much of the next decade doing bleak, enigmatic paintings of corners of rooms. ''The corner paintings were considered Minimalism in that there wasn't a lot going on with the canvases,'' he said. ''But I had images, while the Minimalists were abstract. The corners came out of a book on decorating I'd found in a used-book store. I wanted to make them look like rooms you could go into. But I found they became closed and too perfect, so I started to violate the surfaces.'' These violations first took the form of tiny blotches of paint. On later canvases, they became geometric shapes and eventually quirky but more recognizable images, like a smile and a duck's head.
 
'I Needed the Money'
The late 1960's and 1970's, however, were difficult years, Mr. Moskowitz acknowledged. He had only a handful of gallery shows, and they were poorly received. He now feels this was because his paintings were ''different from most work being shown at the time, and they weren't aggressive in grabbing people's attention.'' He made his living driving a taxi three nights a week, while making canvas stretchers for other artists and teaching often uninterested students during the day at the Maryland Institute of Art in Baltimore and the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
''I needed the money,'' he said, ''but it was more visually stimulating and I learned more driving the taxi than teaching. You meet these amazing people, and it's very voyeuristic.''
Mr. Moskowitz's fortunes started to improve in the late 1970's, when his work was exhibited at the Clocktower gallery, an alternative space just down the street from his loft, and in a now-famous group show called ''New Image Painting'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Included in the Whitney show was his diptych of the World Trade Center reminiscent of works by Georgia O'Keeffe or Charles Demuth. It was one of his many paintings of the period of skyscrapers like the Flati=ron and Empire State Buildings in New York and the Wrigley Building in Chicago.
Another stylistic shift occurred around 1982, when Mr. Moskowitz began to experiment with flat, silhouetted images of sculptures like Rodin's ''Thinker,'' Brancusi's ''Bird in Space'' and Giacometti's ''Elongated Figure.'' ''I wanted to see what would happen if you took sculpture and tried to paint it,'' he said.
 
Creating a Sense of Great Space
In much of his work, however, Mr. Moskowitz has attempted to capture a feeling of immensity - either with tiny images in the midst of huge canvases, large subjects like skyscrapers and icebergs, or oversize close-ups of a bowler's arm in motion. ''Scale is definitely an issue for me,'' he said. ''The scale brings you closer or pushes you back from the image.'' Mr. Moskowitz will talk about the ideas behind his work in general terms - he says, for instance, that he uses colors and images as metaphors for people and relationships - but he does not like to discuss the meaning of particular works. ''I make a painting first, and later figure out what it means,'' he said.
Although he has regularly shown his work at the Blum Helman Gallery in recent years, he has avoided contractual ties with any gallery. ''I accumulate a certain amount of work over two or three years, and then think about having a show and trying to sell the work,'' he said. Many of his large canvases line the walls of his spacious studio, which is connected by various passageways to his living area, his wife's studio and his son's studio and apartment.
Throughout the ups and downs of his career, Mr. Moskowitz said, the opinions of critics and the vagaries of celebrity have been unimportant. ''I try not to read criticism of my work,'' he said. ''The good criticism gives me an ego boost I don't need. And the bad criticism I usually just don't agree with, and it can be very destructive. When you're younger, maybe there's something magical about celebrity, but I'm not taken in by it.''

HEADLINE: Why Bankroll Africa's Ceausescu?

 BODY:
Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in Zaire through a military coup in 1965, the same year Nicolae Ceausescu became the Communist boss of Romania. Mr. Mobutu is no Communist. But his methods of rule resemble those of the executed Romanian tyrant. Wholesale repression, corruption and megalomania have deformed Zaire. 
There is a further regrettable resemblance. President Mobutu, like Mr. Ceausescu, has known how to profit from his outspoken opposition to Soviet foreign policy moves. Washington has winked at his disastrous misrule and made his regime the leading African recipient of United States economic assistance.
The end of the cold war removes any possible justification for this taxpayer subsidy to a repellent dictator. Representatives Howard Wolpe of Michigan, Stephen Solarz of New York, David Obey of Wisconsin and Ronald Dellums of California are proposing changes in the aid relationship. Their efforts deserve support.
American aid dollars have not measurably helped Zaire's people. Annual per capita income is about $150; living standards are lower than when Mr. Mobutu took power. His Government has not built a single hospital in its 25 years. Only 3 percent of Zaire's budget goes to health and education while 23 percent goes to the military and 50 percent to ''political institutions.''
Meanwhile Mr. Mobutu's personal fortune has, by some estimates, grown to $6 billion. His holdings include perhaps a dozen French and Belgian chateaus, a Spanish castle and a 32-bedroom Swiss villa. Mr. Mobutu protests that his fortune is a mere $50 million, and that none of it has come out of the pockets of his people. But recent World Bank studies have found hundreds of millions of dollars in mineral revenues unreported in the national budget, and more gold and coffee smuggled out of the country than legally exported.
Mr. Mobutu has supported anti-Communist initiatives of successive U.S. Administrations, especially in Angola. But he has done so for his own reasons, not always in coordination with Washington. For him the U.S. has proved a useful ally. He uses his conspicuous access to American leaders to further discourage dissent.
Mr. Solarz, Mr. Wolpe and Mr. Obey would end military aid to Zaire and channel most economic aid through non-government organizations. Mr. Dellums would go further and press international aid institutions to consider the abuses and corruption in Zaire. Americans have better uses for their tax dollars than reinforcing the Mobutu tyranny.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bush, Lean on the Lithuanians

BYLINE: By John B. Oakes; John B. Oakes is former Editorial Page Editor of The New York Times.

 BODY:
It is all very well for President Bush to warn Mikhail Gorbachev against the use of force in Lithuania. But it would be more to the point right now if he warned the Lithuanians not to push President Gorbachev any further into using it.
If the Lithuanians persist in doing so - and are deceived into thinking that a sympathetic America will continue to support them right down the line - the results could be catastrophic for the Lithuanians, destructive for President Gorbachev and highly dangerous for the United States.
Mr. Bush has repeatedly called for a ''dialogue, discussion and peaceful resolution.'' It won't happen and it won't be helped by yielding to the demands of the extreme right in this country to put all the heat on Mr. Gorbachev and none on the Lithuanians. 
Naturally, Americans sympathize with the demand of the Lithuanian people for freedom. Paradoxically, it is Mr. Gorbachev who is offering them and their two Baltic neighbors the best hope for freedom they have had in many centuries of Russian, Polish, German and Swedish rule. Even in the brief and dubious interlude of nominal independence between the two World Wars, the Baltic states were governed largely by rightist dictatorships; but it was Stalin who finally snuffed out what remained of their freedom in 1940.
Now, thanks to the Gorbachev revolution, the Baltic peoples - Lithuanians, Letts, Estonians - are within reach of that freedom once again. The trick today is not to overreach.
This the Lithuanians are in imminent danger of doing, egged on by such irresponsible tactics as those of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York. His most recent publicity-seeking trip, this time to the Lithuanian border (diverting attention from the Senate investigation into his ethics), gave ultimate proof of his unlimited capacity to trivialize even the most serious foreign policy issues.
The physical presence of a United States Senator on that border, acting almost as agent provocateur, could hardly have failed to rouse false hopes (or claims) on the part of the Lithuanian leadership that they had significant American endorsement of an all-or-nothing stance. This is not helpful to President Bush's plea for a ''peaceful resolution.'' Even Senator D'Amato must realize that no head of a great nation could possibly accept instant and unilateral secession of one of its component parts, however illegally acquired.
But he could negotiate its independence, and this is what Mr. Gorbachev, despite much resistance from his own right wing, is trying to do, revising Soviet law in order to do it.
By refusing to accept the slower but surer legal path toward independence that Mr. Gorbachev is clearly offering, the Lithuanian leadership is inviting not only the economic crackdown that has already begun but the possibility of full-scale military repression.
If that happened, everything that has been gained for human rights and civil liberties in the Baltic states thus far - and a great deal has been gained - would surely be lost.
The repercussions would go far beyond the Baltics. Such a convulsion would inevitably derail Mr. Gorbachev's already too long delayed economic reforms. The probable result of that would be the derailment of Mr. Gorbachev himself.
That is something fervid right-wingers in this country and elsewhere would dearly love to see. They are helping it along by pressing President Bush to take an ever tougher line against Soviet-American economic cooperation.
There is a certain irony here. Until recently, the U.S. was waging total economic warfare and supporting a major military force to bring down the elected Government of a neighboring small country called Nicaragua, where we have even less historic claim to sovereignty - legitimate or illegitimate - than the Russians have in Lithuania.
What the U.S. should be doing in the interest of world peace is just the opposite. A blind policy of retaliation could not possibly help the Lithuanians. It could, however, help destroy Mr. Gorbachev and bring Soviet-American detente to an abrupt and fateful end - a tragedy for us no less than for the Soviets, and a disaster for the world.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Mild Gain in Drive on Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 19

 BODY:
A report by two influential research organizations has concluded that the Government's efforts to seek penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens has been only a modest deterrent to illegal immigration.
The Rand Corporation and the Urban Institute, in what they called the most comprehensive study yet of the impact of employer sanctions on illegal immigration, said the sanctions had reduced illicit border crossings by less than 20 percent.
''If the intent was to generate a large decline in the flow, employer sanctions appear to have been unsuccessful and Congress may wish to weigh the cost of continuing the program against its current level of effectiveness,'' said the study, which was issued Thursday. 
But the study added that if the policy was intended only ''to curb the rate of increase in the flow, the sanctions have probably been successful and Congress may wish to continue with the current law.''
The study was released as Congress debates whether to repeal or revise provisions of the landmark 1986 immigration law that establish civil and criminal penalties for employers who hire illegal aliens. A study released last month by Congress's General Accounting Office found a ''widespread pattern of discrimination'' in employment against people with a ''foreign appearance or accent.''
 
Impact of Finding of Bias
Under the terms of the immigration law, the finding of bias by the accounting office forces Congress to reconsider the legislation's provisions requiring employers to demand from everyone they hire proof of citizenship or the right to work legally in the United States. The report by the accounting office said the law had ''apparently reduced illegal immigration,'' but it made no systematic attempt to reach a firm conclusion about the law's effectiveness in stemming the flow of illegal aliens across the border.
The conclusions offered by Rand, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and the Urban Institute, in Washington, were based on a three-year study of statistics on legal immigration, border arrests of illegal aliens and changes in the pay and labor supply for jobs at car washes and restaurants. The study by the two independent, nonprofit research organizations, was conducted under a grant from the Ford Foundation.
The study found what it called ''clearcut'' evidence that the law was having its intended effect on immigration in 1987, with the flow of illegal immigrants falling by more than 15 percent and requests from farmers for temporary workers from abroad rising 28 percent. But in 1988, the study found, the downward trend in illegal immigration was reversed, and in 1989, labor market analysis suggested only a small decline in illegal immigration.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who was one of the authors of the legislation, said the latest report and the accounting office report ''are a commentary on how the bill is working now, but not on the concept behind the bill or on how it might work if it were taken seriously by the Administration.''
Mr. Schumer said that if the legislation was to be successful, the Government must not try to enforce it on a ''shoestring'' budget.
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said border apprehensions declined from 1.1 million in 1987 to 857,000 last year, although they appeared to be climbing again this year. ''Apprehensions have been down considerably and, in the absence of the law, probably would have increased considerably,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Pentagon's Technology Chief Is Out

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Sparking expressions of outrage from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley, the Defense Department said yesterday that it had removed the director of its agency responsible for developing advanced technologies.
Officials of the agency said the move resulted from a bitter dispute over what the agency's role should be in financing research projects intended to make American high-technology industries more competitive.
Dr. Craig I. Fields, the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, was told yesterday that he was being removed and transferred to the position of deputy director of defense research and engineering for defense management report implementation. He was informed of his transfer by a representative of Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood. The new post would include responsibility for streamlining the general research activities of the Defense Department. 
 
Denial by Pentagon
 The Pentagon said yesterday that Dr. Fields had not been discharged, but several executives of the research agency said he had lost his position because of his advocacy for high-technology initiatives opposed by some high Bush Administration officials. These officials have expressed their opposition to policies that help specific industries.
In a telephone interview last night from his home in Washington, Dr. Fields, 43 years old, said he was weighing his options and had not yet decided what to do. He had no further comment.
White House officials refused to comment on the announcement.
Dr. Fields's transfer follows closely on the heels of a Pentagon decision this month to cut financing for research on high-definition television, a technology for delivering sharper television images that has become a symbol in the debate over how the United States can best compete with Japan.
 
A Lightning Rod
 In recent months, the research agency has served as a lightning rod within the Bush Administration for a policy debate over whether the Government should actively encourage developing advanced commercial technologies like high-definition television and more sophisticated semiconductors and computers.
Dr. Fields has long been the primary champion of such programs within the agency, and he has always justified them as having military as well as commercial applications. But his position has apparently incurred the wrath of Administration officials who oppose the idea that the Government should attempt to pick ''winning'' technologies.
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, are widely reported to oppose extensive Government backing for high-technology research consortiums.
One White House official said yesterday that Mr. Darman believed that the research programs were not as valuable as many supporters have contended and that the programs could have a limited impact on America's industrial base. He has argued that the technologies are better developed with funds from business and industry.
''They think Dr. Fields has done far too much,'' said a Pentagon official yesterday who asked that he not be identified. ''They want to buy technology from the Japanese that he had hoped we could use as a lever to make the United States more competitive.''
 
The Final Straw?
 People close to the Defense Department said yesterday that what might have finally led to Dr. Fields being transferred was a decision the agency made this month to invest $4 million in Gazelle Microcircuits Inc., a Silicon Valley electronics company that is working on high-speed circuits made of gallium arsenide.
Under an experimental program approved by Congress, the agency made its investment much like a venture capitalist, expecting to receive a payback if the company becomes successful. The deal also allowed Gazelle to deflect an investment from a Japanese company, which might have entailed transferring the technology to Japan.
One Defense Department official said yesterday that the deal provoked ''grouchiness'' among high Pentagon officials, who wondered why the Pentagon was investing when another private company, albeit a Japanese one, was willing to put money in.
Defense Department officials apparently discussed the possibility of a new role with Dr. Fields on Tuesday, the Pentagon official said, but he told them he wished to remain head of the agency. Yesterday, several Department officials said, he was presented with paperwork outlining his transfer with no advance warning.
 
Described as Assertive
 Dr. Fields, who is universally described as having a quick mind and as being very assertive, has been almost an institution at the agency. While most of its officials are university or industrial scientists who stay at the agency for a few years, Dr. Fields has been there for 16 years.
His shift yesterday drew cries of outrage from members of Congress and former Government officials who support Government spending for high-technology.
''It's terribly wrong,'' said Robert B. Costello, a former Under Secretary of Defense during the Reagan Administration. ''Darpa, in order to do its job, has to be involved in certain industrial activities.''
 
Debate May Be Settled
 Several members of Congress suggested that Dr. Fields's transfer indicated the Bush Administration was settling its internal debate over whether the Government should support the development of high-technology industries.
''It represents more than the loss of one person's job,'' said Senator Albert Gore Jr., the Tennessee Democrat who has strongly supported high-technology financing by the Government. ''It's the defeat within the Administration of an argument of importance to the future of our country.''
The removal of Dr. Fields was also met with shock in Silicon Valley, where the research agency, with a budget of only $1 billion a year, is known for financing early work in many computer-related technologies.
''It's a tragedy for American competitiveness,'' said L. John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, a leading venture-capital firm in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: RATES JUMP ON NEWS OF BUDGET GAP

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates climbed yesterday as prices of Treasury securities were battered by the report by the Government that it posted its largest monthly budget deficit on record in March.
The $53.34 billion deficit was some $10 billion above the most pessimistic forecasts. The largest previous monthly deficit was $39.4 billion in May 1986, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Before the Treasury Department's deficit report was released in the early afternoon, prices of Treasury securities were narrowly mixed. Dealers said the market's consensus at the time was that the decline in bond prices earlier in the week had led to an oversold situation. 
 
'Excuse to Head Lower'
 ''The consensus was overly optimistic because the Treasury market was looking for an excuse to head lower and the extraordinary March budget deficit provided it,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation.
The Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.5 percent issue maturing in 2020, were being offered late in the session at 95 18/32, down a full point, which is equivalent to a loss of $10 for each $1,000 of face value. This caused the yield on the long bond to soar to 8.93 percent, its highest level since last May, from 8.84 percent the day before and 8.58 percent on April 12. The Treasury debt market was closed on April 13, Good Friday.
Although the March deficit could be an aberration, the $53.34 billion shortfall was a shock when compared with one of $36.4 billion in February and $35.8 billion in March 1989, Mr. Braverman said. ''But the deficit was only the last straw for many traders in a week that saw Japanese holders of Treasury paper continue to be net sellers,'' he added.
 
Estimate on Japanese Sales
 Mr. Braverman estimated that the Japanese sellers, mostly insurance companies, were net sellers of at least $6 billion of Treasury notes and bonds between the start of their fiscal year on April 1 and April 13. ''They probably unloaded more this week,'' he said, ''partly as a currency play and partly to raise funds for bargain-hunting in their sharply depressed stock market.''
As a currency play, the Japanese sellers were counting on a decline in the dollar against the yen. Their sales did contribute to a slight decline in the dollar during the week.
''The Japanese are not turning their backs on our Treasury debt market because of recent signs of a pickup in domestic inflation,'' Mr. Braverman said. ''But they and many other investors in the fixed-income market may be unsettled by the first-quarter gross national product figures due out next Friday.''
''We expect the G.N.P. to be up at least 2.5 percent on an annual basis, compared with the rise of 1.1 percent in the last quarter of 1989,'' he added. ''The first-quarter fixed G.N.P. deflator, a measure of inflation, could be up between 5.5 and 6 percent, compared with a rise of 3.6 percent in the previous quarter.''
 
Vulnerable for Other Reasons
 William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the bond market was also vulnerable for other reasons. As he explained: ''The half-point rise in the March Consumer Price Index showed a pickup in inflation, the bane of any investor in fixed-income debt issues. We also face a $30 billion quarterly refunding. While the terms of the refunding are due out May 2, the Street expects the Treasury to auction $10 billion each of 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds the following week. The Street thinks that a yield of 9 percent on the long bond will be necessary to attract bidders. If 9 percent doesn't represent value, then who knows how high interest rates will have to go until it does.''
As for the surprising March deficit figure, Mr. Sullivan said that the $53.34 billion shortfall ''is either an aberration, or it indicates that the Federal budget deficit is out of control. In either case, it tells the bond market that the Treasury will have to keep issuing more debt.''
 
ABOVE 1990 TARGET
 WASHINGTON, April 20 (AP) -The March gap between spending and revenues pushed the budget deficit for the first six months of the fiscal year past the Gramm-Rudman target for all of the 1990 fiscal year.
The deficit now stands at $150.85 billion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 17.5 percent more than the $128.4 billion imbalance during the first half of 1989 and well above the Gramm-Rudman 1990 target of $100 billion.
The Treasury Department's report said March revenues were down 4.9 percent from March 1989, to $64.82 billion, while spending rose 13.6 percent, to $118.16 billion.
Louis Crandall, an economist with R. H. Wrightson of New York, attributed most of the March deficit to payments by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, spending by the Resolution Trust Corporation to bail out failed savings and loan associations, expedited income tax refunds as a result of electronic filing systems and Federal Reserve losses because of the falling value of the Fed's foreign currency reserves.

Profit Lags at Caterpillar

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 20

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. announced today that it had put into effect a white-collar hiring freeze after the company's profit fell short of last year's performance for the second consecutive quarter.
Despite record sales, Caterpillar earned $99 million, or 97 cents a share, in the first three months of 1990, a 29.8 percent drop from last year, when the first-quarter profit was $141 million, or $1.39 a share. 
Revenue for the Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, was up 9.1 percent, to $2.87 billion for the quarter, the second-best quarter in Caterpillar's 75-year history. The company's revenue was $2.63 billion in the corresponding quarter last year. The all-time high for revenue was $3.04 billion in the second quarter of 1989.
The hiring freeze applies to all management or salaried employees, said Len Kuchan, Caterpillar's treasurer.
He said a company reorganization, which created profit-driven management centers, had resulted in a reduction of middle-management jobs and some salaried workers.
Mr. Kuchan said no layoffs of blue-collar workers is expected in 1990, although they could occur if the nation's economy sinks into a recession.
Mr. Kuchan attributed the low profit level to increased costs resulting from soaring health-care expenses, plant modernization programs, higher material costs and trouble in key markets.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 15.99; Bigger Drop Averted

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices bounced back sharply in late trading yesterday but ended on a weak note amid concern that rising interest rates would continue to depress stock and bond prices.
After plunging as much as 39 points around 2:30 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average recovered more than half that loss to end the session at 2,695.95, down 15.99, putting its loss for the week at 55.85 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange advanced briskly, to 174.3 million shares, from 152.9 million on Thursday. But in a sign of the breadth of the decline, 1,079 issues fell and 96 reached new lows. Only 401 issues advanced. 
 
'It's Been a Tough Week'
 One of the new lows was AAR, an aviation parts company, which fell 2 1/2, to 23, touching a new low of 22 after falling 2 3/8 on Thursday. The company said it expected a modest gain for the fiscal year ending May 31 but had told analysts on Wednesday that it was taking ''a cautionary view'' of its fiscal fourth quarter.
''It's been a tough week,'' said Hugh Johnson, head strategist for the First Albany Corporation. He maintained that much of the stock market's troubles could be attributed to the bond market, where interest rates are now ''an attractive alternative to stocks.''
''Bond prices were collapsing all around us,'' he said, ''almost like a free fall.'' He called it ''very troubling'' that the yield on long-term Treasuries had risen to 8.93 percent - the first time the level has climbed above 8.9 percent in nearly a year.
Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading for Shearson Lehman Hutton, said one big uncertainty - as it always is when the Government raises money - is the level of Japanese buying in the Treasury's $30 billion refinancing next month.
Mr. Johnson of First Albany said there was evidence not only that Japanese investors were big sellers of United States Treasury issues but also that they were not very big players in the last Treasury refinancing. And if the Japanese do not take part in any meaningful way, he argued, interest rates will go up to attract other buyers.
 
Du Pont and Primerica Down
 Among the Dow industrials, declines of a point or more occurred only at Du Pont, off 1 at 36 5/8, and Primerica, down 1 1/4 at 28 1/2. A.T.&T. was unchanged at 40 7/8; General Motors fell 1/8, to 46 3/4; General Electric fell 1/4, to 65 1/2, and I.B.M. rose 1/4, to 109 3/8.
In the Dow transportation stocks, Airborne Freight rose 1, to 48, and UAL 1, to 154. Burlington Northern rose 3/8, to 34 1/4, and Norfolk Southern rose 3/8, to 38. The rest fell less than a point, but enough to clip the Dow transportation index by 5.69 points, to 1,154.87.
Along with the decline in bond prices, insurance companies, many of which are big investors in bonds, also declined. CNA fell 2 3/4, to 73 1/2; General Re fell 2, to 83 1/8, and Chubb fell 1 7/8, to 90.
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the publisher, again headed the Big Board active list, falling 1/4, to 4, in heavy trading. It has declined comment on takeover rumors; some traders said they had not heard the rumors.
Bank stocks weakened because of disappointing earnings. Brent B. Erensel, bank analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that Eastern banks did poorly, except Bankers Trust New York, and that West Coast banks did well. But in the selloff Bankers Trust fell 1/4, to 35 1/2; Wells Fargo fell 1 1/4, to 68 3/4; Security Pacific fell 5/8, to 36 3/8, and BankAmerica stood unchanged at 27 1/2.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly Amid Tensions on Lithuania

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed higher on world currency markets yesterday, as investors sought a safe haven amid heightened tensions over Lithuania.
Traders said the market focused on the Soviet Union's toughened economic embargo against Lithuania. Moscow diverted some shipments of food, metal, wood and industrial parts. 
Earlier this week the Kremlin cut off most of the natural gas and all of the oil it supplies to the Baltic republic, which is trying to secede from the Soviet Union.
Further rocking the currency market was a report that dozens of Red Army soldiers stormed a Lithuanian printing plant and beat at least a dozen people.
As tensions in the Soviet Union intensify, the market is concerned over ''the possibility that either the United States or Europe will be drawn into it,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
 
A Dive, Then a Revival
 Volume was heavy. Shortly after midday, the dollar took a dive as traders turned their sights to weakening United States stock and bond markets, but the currency managed to finish higher.
Earlier in Europe, the dollar rose in modest activity.
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 157.60 yen, down 0.15 yen from Thursday's close. In late trading in London, the dollar rose to 157.90 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 157.50 yen, up from 157.25 yen on Thursday.
The British pound declined to $1.6357 in London, from $1.6448 late Thursday. Later in New York, sterling dipped to $1.6388 from Thursday's $1.6450.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.6872 West German marks, up from 1.6787; 1.4895 Swiss francs, up from 1.4847; 5.6655 French francs, up from 5.6425; 1,238.20 Italian lire, up from 1,233.50, and 1.1628 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1623.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late rates, included: 1.6895 marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4910 Swiss francs, up from 1.4815; 5.6695 French francs, up from 5.6325; 1.8910 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8820; 1,240.00 Italian lire, up from 1,231.25, and 1.1619 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1618.
Gold prices were mostly lower. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion settled at $376.60 a troy ounce, off 60 cents from Thursday.

HEADLINE: How Physicist's Weapons Genius Led Him to Greed and Then Death

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES with JEFF GERTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Gerald V. Bull was a gifted designer of military hardware: at age 22, a doctor of aerophysics; at 32, star of a Pentagon ballistics lab. But when he could not earn a living making guns for the United States, he turned to illicit trade, and at 52 he was in a Federal prison for illegally exporting arms to South Africa.
At 62, Mr. Bull was dead. A month ago, on March 22, he was shot twice in the neck with a silencer-equipped 7.65-millimeter pistol outside his apartment in Brussels. The killer left behind $20,000 in American cash in the victim's pocket.
Who killed him, and why, is a mystery that has consumed the European press. But a growing body of evidence suggests that Mr. Bull was a pivotal figure in a violent subculture, promoting the black-market proliferation of advanced weapons to volatile third-world nations like Iran and Iraq. 
 
Steel Pipes in Britain
European press reports have focused on the British Government's April 11 seizure of steel pipes that Mr. Bull sought to ship to Iraq, apparently for use in launching rocket bombs.
The lethal technology marketed by Mr. Bull was based on work financed and sponsored by the Pentagon in the 1960's and 1970's, when he worked for the Canadian and American Governments.
He was then regarded as so vital to American national security that Congress voted in 1972 to make the Canadian-born scientist retroactively eligible for American citizenship, allowing the Pentagon to upgrade his security clearances to include nuclear secrets.
His relatives said this month that he had received warnings of an attempt on his life by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, which wages a shadow war against Iraq, but that he had dismissed the report.
Israel has denied any role in his death. Others say Iran also had reason to wish Mr. Bull dead. As a supplier of advanced arms, sometimes to foes on both sides of third-world conflicts, Mr. Bull collected enough potential enemies to fill several police blotters with murder suspects, American intelligence officials and others said.
Mr. Bull's death has raised anew questions about whether the United States knew of his business and ignored or tacitly encouraged it.
Although he was jailed for illegal weapons sales to South Africa in 1980, officials in the United States, Europe and Africa later allowed Mr. Bull to license the same technology from his Belgian corporate base for eventual use in much of the developing world, according to Government documents.
 
Congressional Inquiry
Mr. Bull's dealings with South Africa were assisted by a Central Intelligence Agency operative involved in Angola's civil war, a 1982 Congressional inquiry concluded. The C.I.A. denied any knowing involvement.
A former senior Pentagon official who monitored arms proliferation in the Reagan Administration, Frank Gaffney, said Mr. Bull's activities might have been overlooked. ''The truth is the administration of export controls from this country is a sometime thing,'' he said. ''When you talk about policing exports from third countries, it's a very erratic thing.''
But ''there is always the possibility we or other countries were looking the other way,'' he added.
After breaking with the Pentagon in the 1970's, Mr. Bull set up companies and licensing agreements to sell improved versions of the technology he had developed there, according to legal documents and former associates.
 
Long-Range Howitzer
That weaponry includes a highly accurate long-range howitzer, which is a staple of armed forces in Iran, Iraq, Israel and South Africa, and which also may have been used in Beirut's war between Christian and Muslim factions.
It also includes a gigantic cannon -really a mortar with a barrel over 120-feet long - which Mr. Bull developed under Army direction in the 1960's and which he apparently was seeking to build in Iraq when he died.
''He adjusted his administrative capabilities to whatever brought him money,'' one former business associate who requested anonymity said of Mr. Bull this week. ''He sold to the pariahs of the world.''
How a gifted physicist drifted into the amoral supply of black-market armies is not altogether clear. What is widely reported is that Mr. Bull suffered financial difficulties and that he was deeply embittered by failed research ventures with the Americans and Canadians.
 
Seemed Destined for Stardom
Detailed accounts of Mr. Bull's work and his arms dealings are available from public documents and reports published in The Burlington (Vt.) Free Press.
Mr. Bull seemed destined for scientific stardom. The youngest doctoral graduate of the University of Toronto, the Ontario native first worked at Canada's defense institute. His work in artillery technology caught the Pentagon's eye, and in 1955, at 27, Mr. Bull began a liaison with the Defense Department that lasted two decades.
The Army declined comment on Mr. Bull. But documents from 1972, when Senator Barry Goldwater promoted legislation backdating his legal American residency, indicate he worked in the 1950's and 1960's on 16-inch guns that fired rocket-propelled shells to unheard-of heights.
His High Altitude Research Project, or HARP, produced one cannon on the Caribbean island of Barbados which sent a projectile into space, a record 112 miles high. Other Bull cannons were built in Senator Goldwater's home state of Arizona and in Canada.
 
His Venture Waned
But despite Mr. Bull's claims that it was a cheap, low-technology alternative to guided missiles, the HARP venture waned in the late 1960's as the United States committed to conventional rocketry.
With Army financial support, Mr. Bull turned in the early 1970's to designing a long-range 155-millimeter gun and shell on a remote 8,000-acre plot that straddled the Vermont-Canada border. He set up a private company, Space Research Corporation, to make shells and conduct tests.
Using nuclear secrets, Mr. Bull made a 155-millineter nuclear shell for the Army, a former associate said. Israel later bought 5,000 rounds of Mr. Bull's nonnuclear 155-millimeter shell and still uses improved forms of the shell for long-range artillery, he said. The Israeli embassy here declined comment.
But though it developed a system far more accurate than competing howitzers, Space Research fell into financial straits when the Army, which was researching its own long-range artillery, stopped financing Mr. Bull. The company turned in 1974 to South Africa, secretly selling a license for its howitzer technology - and later, a hidden one-fifth stake - to the state-owned munitions conglomerate, Armscor.
Investigators later concluded that Space Research had shipped howitzer prototypes, radar and at least 30,000 shells to South Africa in violation of Federal laws, with the help of Israel and a military consultant who worked for the C.I.A.
 
Marketing Abroad
Mr. Bull spent 4 1/2 months in Federal prison after admitting violations of the Arms Export Control Act and a United Nations arms embargo against South Africa. A spokesman for the South African Embassy had no comment today on the country's ties to Mr. Bull.
A House Foreign Affairs subcommittee stated in a 1982 report that the State Department's Office of Munitions Control ignored ''substantial, if not conclusive,'' evidence that Mr. Bull's howitzer technology was Pentagon-owned and should not have been marketed abroad without consent. The State Department declined comment.
In any case, despite Federal laws barring the unapproved resale of American military technologies, Mr. Bull and South Africa later prospered by selling modified versions of the 155-millimeter artillery system around the world - to Austria, China, Taiwan and Singapore, among others, according to a former associate. Some of those deals were struck by retired Israeli intelligence agents and arms dealers working for commissions, he said.
The details of these sales and the licensing agreements under which Mr. Bull sold his technology remain unclear, but a new criminal case in Austria has shed some light on the subject.
 
A Company in Vienna
Legal documents there contend that a Vienna company, Voest-Alpine, licensed Mr. Bull's howitzer technology about 1979 and began reselling it to third world armies. Mr. Bull dismantled his Vermont operation and moved to Brussels, working with Poudriere Reunie Belge, a huge Belgian munitions company that had acquired a hidden interest in his company in order to make and sell howitzer shells.
Several press accounts in Vienna state that a Voest-Alpine subsidiary contracted in the last decade to sell the 155-millimeter howitzers worldwide, including 72 to Saudi Arabia, 100 to Nigeria, 200 to Iraq and 140 to Iran. The guns are said to have played a bloody role in the Iran-Iraq conflict, where they devastated troop emplacements on both sides of the battle line.
The sales turned Mr. Bull into a wealthy man and a sought-after figure in the third world. Along the way, he became most closely involved with Iraq, which was using profits from its vast oil sales to acquire first-rate arms, scientists and technology. One former associate said that the Iraqis cemented their ties during a 1987 trip to South Africa in which they inspected Mr. Bull's 155-millimeter howitzer.
A son in Canada, Michel Bull, who is an executive of Space Research Corporation, said in a British interview that the company had ''very close contacts in Iraq'' and held defense contracts with that nation. A former associate told The New York Times that the elder Mr. Bull may have helped Iraq develop its own indigenous artillery, including a 210-millimeter gun.
But Michel Bull has denied that his father was designing a gun for Iraq. Michel Bull has gone into hiding since his father's death and could not be reached for comment.
An American official said evidence indicated that Mr. Bull sought last month to ship steel pipes to Iraq similar to the rocket tubes he designed in the 1960's for the HARP project. The pipes are virtually as long, a second Administration official noted on Friday.
British customs officials seized eight sections of pipe on April 11 that were bound for Iraq, and more pipes were confiscated on Friday in Greece and Turkey. British newspapers have reported that they were destined for an Iraqi test site for long-range bombs.
An obscure book on HARP written by Mr. Bull and a military associate and published in 1988 offers some hints about the pipes. The publication, ''The Paris Guns,'' includes charts and drawings suggesting that steel tubes could be used to guide rocket-driven shells to targets up to 3,300 miles away.
''Modern steel characteristics and fabrication techniques made fixed-elevation launch tubes of very large diameter a relatively low-cost proposition,'' the book states. ''One-meter diameter launch tubes'' - the precise size of those seized in Britain this month - ''could be built for well under ten million dollars.''
Both Iraq and the British firm that manufactured the steel tubes have insisted that they were intended for a petrochemical plant. But a second British firm which sold a hydraulics system to Iraq since has said it was duped, and now believes it actually provided a recoil mechanism for a huge gun.

HEADLINE: On Tokyo Runways, Foreign Labels Still Rule

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 21

 BODY:
While Japan's emergence as an economic power has been driven by exported electronics and industrial products, it has been paralleled by a growing obsession at home with fashionable goods that have foreign cachet: clothing and accessories.
In a sense, Japanese retail executives say, there is no place else for the money to go. With land selling for as much as $1 million a square yard in downtown Tokyo, real estate is not an investment within the reach of most Japanese. Though a fleet of high-powered Porsches clog Tokyo's streets, the infamous traffic here makes them a frustrating luxury.
Instead, affluent young people buy clothes. And as they do, they create a surging market for the fashion capitals of the world, which have seen demand elsewhere slacken as economies slowed. 
At a dinner party last week at a restaurant in the Roppongi district, the women, all in their 20's, wore clothes by Romeo Gigli, Christian Dior and Chanel. The men wore Giorgio Armani. Over California wines and French-American food, they shared knowing conversation about labels, licenses and the joys of dressmakers in Seoul who are now producing the best line-for-line copies of high-fashion clothing in the Far East.
To Europe, Japan is the new America. It is a market for luxury goods that expanded throughout the 1980's and still has vast potential, fashion executives say, as demand shifts from clothing produced under license with foreign design houses to the real article.
''Japan is now the No. 1 market for French luxury goods in the world,'' said Christian Blanckaert, the president of the Comite Colbert in Paris, a trade association of 70 French companies, including Christian Dior, Givenchy, Hermes, Nina Ricci, Louis Vuitton and Chanel.
 
Outfitters to the 'Salary Men'
Japan accounts for about 27 percent of his organization's sales, Mr. Blanckaert said, compared with about 18 percent to the United States. ''And the pattern of increase is higher than anywhere else in the world,'' he said.
While there is no comparable American organization keeping track, American brands are also well established in Japan, despite some trade barriers. ''Salary men'' wear Brooks Brothers, Paul Stuart, Polo and Wilkes Bashford suits, purchased at branches of those stores here; ''office ladies'' turn out in Donna Karan and Anne Klein II outfits. Last week, the windows of the Takashimaya department store in the Nihombashi section were dressed with clothing made under a new licensing agreement with Geoffrey Beene, perhaps America's leading designer.
American techniques of specialty retailing and merchandise display are also being imported, as high-fashion stores like New York's Barneys and Charivari open here.
''There is a certain sector of our customers who are very brand-name oriented,'' said Naoki Ueno, the merchandise manager of designer dresses, suits and coats at Isetan, another department store. ''They are crazy about Chanel, DKNY and Armani.''
Some of Isetan's customers are so wild about Giorgio Armani, Mr. Ueno said, that they may dress themselves almost entirely in his clothes, from shoes to scarves. ''From a commercial point of view, this type of customer is good for sales,'' Mr. Ueno said.
 
Amid Riot of Labels, A Few Buds of Style
 The mere purchase of expensive goods, of course, does not in itself constitute style, an elusive quality achieved by a process that might be described as editing. Indeed, Tokyo itself, one of the most fashion-conscious cities in the world, sometimes seems in desperate need of editing. So many labels, signs, shops, sounds and smells assault the senses. But fashion executives in both Tokyo and foreign capitals say Japanese consumers, though still profoundly name-conscious, are becoming more sensible and sophisticated in their fashion choices.
The day after the dinner, two of the guests, Yasuko and Yoko Amau, daughters of a retired Japanese diplomat, went shopping in the fashionable Aoyama area, where many European and Japanese designers have boutiques.
At the boutique of Issey Miyake, Japan's world-class avant-garde designer, Yasuko Amau held up a fan-shaped pleated circle of fabric resembling an origami paper sculpture.
''Someone tell me what to do with this,'' she demanded. With a salesman's help, she looked through a catalogue to see how it was meant to be worn. ''You see, even Japanese women have trouble trying to figure Miyake out,'' her sister said.
In the catalogue, Yasuko Amau saw a version of a dress as it was shown in Paris; it was sexier than the one in the store. The salesman said it was not in production in Japan because most Japanese women would not wear something so revealing.
This traditional reluctance presents an obstacle to Western designers, who shift the revealing emphasis of their clothes up and down the torso almost as often as the seasons change. At the Calvin Klein boutique in the Isetan department store in the Shinjuku district, the problem was obvious.
 
Career Look Seems To Cover It All
 A Sony monitor at the entrance to the Klein boutique played a well-worn and blurry copy of a videotape of Mr. Klein's spring fashion show in New York. Models floated down the runway in styles that included two-piece strap less dresses baring lots of shoulder and slivers of skin below the bodice and in back.
None of those dresses is carried in the boutique, which is almost exclusively devoted to career clothing.
''Too sexy,'' said Mr. Ueno of Isetan. ''Japanese women are rather reluctant to expose their skin.''
Japanese retailers like Isetan have shaped the fashion destiny of their country in a way that exceeds the role of merchants in the development of French or American fashion. Historically, the Japanese retailers have produced the foreign designer collections themselves, under licensing agreements, which makes them fashion houses as well as fashion stores.
Isetan, which holds licenses to make Calvin Klein and Adrienne Vittadini clothing in Japan, was the first Japanese company to set up an American ready-to-wear system, a move that profoundly changed the way Japanese people dress.
Before World War II, there were few garments a Japanese woman could buy and wear out of a store. Kimonos were custom-made. After the war, women who wanted to wear modern styles had them copied from Western fashion magazines by local dressmakers. The best-dressed women wore clothing mail-ordered from the Sears Roebuck catalogue.
In the 1950's Isetan set up a design laboratory to study the ready-to-wear system, learning the technique of sizing that enabled Seventh Avenue fashion houses to translate Paris styles for the masses. By the 1960's and 70's, Isetan and other stores, like Seibu, had licensing agreements with the leading designer names - Balmain, Cardin, Lanvin, Saint Laurent. Their factories had to alter styles to suit the smaller Japanese figure, sometimes until they were barely recognizable. But Japanese women didn't mind. There was still the name, printed in English, on the label.
 
Some Faded Names Are Sparkling Here
 Even today, designer names that have lost their steam in Europe and America have cachet here. Others that have always done relatively small business in America are given large sections of retail space, like Jean-Louis Scherrer, who sold a majority interest in his company to Seibu Department Stores this month. Some smaller American designer names, like Carmelo Pomodoro and Ronaldus Shamask, generate expanding business in Japan.
Takashimaya has opened a Carmelo Pomodoro store on the outskirts of Tokyo. Mr. Pomodoro has no shops in the United States. The clothes are primarily made in Italy, and unlike most licensed lines, are specifically designed by Mr. Pomodoro for the Japanese consumer.
Takashimaya also recently entered into an agreement with Geoffrey Beene to make and sell his lower-priced line, called Mr. Beene.
''In the fashion world, there's a tremendous American influence,'' said Teruhiro Kagamihara, the associate director of the Takashimaya chain. ''It certainly has the leadership in visual merchandising.''
American stores themselves are being licensed, as even small New York specialty retailers have entered into the Japanese consciousness, by way of local fashion magazines like Popeye and Brutus, and, of course, Manhattan shopping sprees. Charivari, a New York store that pioneered in bringing Japanese designers to America, has opened shops selling its own brand merchandise in Tokyo and Yokahama, through a licensing agreement with Taka-Q, a Japanese retailer. Barneys New York is scheduled to open in Tokyo in November.
''It's not so much the name of the retailer that they want,'' said Mike Allen, a retail analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities division of England's Barclays Bank, in Tokyo. ''They need the specialty store know-how. Japanese retailing has been geared to volume merchandising, and it reached a plateau. They want to diversify into other retail formats.''
 
The Licensed Label No Longer Satisfies
 The Japanese fashion industry is entering a new phase, retail executives here say. ''In the 1970's and 80's, the big retailers were eager to put foreign designer names on a label,'' said Nobuyuki Ota, chairman of the Tokyo Council of Fashion Designers. ''There is now a boom in imported merchandise.'
Part of this push comes from the domestic fashion designers, whose daring and quality earned the respect of consumers and made licensed products seem bland. There is also the high cost of manufacturing in Japan. But the overriding reason is a more demanding Japanese consumer.
Christian Dior, which sells licensed products in Japan, opened a shop last month in Osaka that sells only imported styles by Gianfranco Ferre, the company's new designer. The move reflects the philosophy of Beatrice Bongibault, the new managing director of Christian Dior. Ms. Bongibault was formerly a top executive of Chanel, which sells its styles in Japan on a direct-import basis.
''They have become very strict,'' said an executive of Kanebo, the Japanese company that makes Dior's licensed product lines. ''They control the image down to the paper shopping bags. They want everything to be exactly like Paris.''
From the standpoint of price, however, direct imports present a problem, said the Kanebo executive, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Along with the recent precipitous slide of the Tokyo stock market, the value of the Japanese yen has declined about 30 percent with respect to other world currencies, which could force up the price of imported goods.
Others are less concerned. ''The exchange rate will not affect high fashion,'' said Mr. Allen of Barclays. ''One of the reasons for the Tokyo stock crash was a drop in corporate profits due to higher salaries now paid to workers. I don't expect even a small slowdown in consumer spending.''
''If there is a decline in spending, it won't be as great as in America after the stock market crash there,'' said Takuya Mikami, the general manager for merchandise planning at Takashimaya. ''Japanese have risen to a much higher standard of living than ever before. They will not let it go down.''

HEADLINE: When or Whether to Retire: New Ways to Handle Strain

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
It has been three years since Steven August, now 61 years old, lost his job as associate creative director at a New York advertising agency, and although he has patched together some freelance work and teaches two continuing education courses, a terrible sense of displacement is still with him.
''I love what I used to do and I hate being tossed on the scrapheap,'' Mr. August said recently. ''There are times when I feel like I'm not worth anything anymore, when I'll be walking down the street and I'll pick somebody out and think, How can that guy have a job when I don't.''
 
Golden Picture Is Blurred
Statistics showing the average age of retirement dropping every decade suggest a golden picture: people leaving jobs in favor of leisure, a welcome reward after years of labor. But as Mr. August and thousands of others have discovered, the reality can be quite different. A recent study by a philanthropy concerned with the elderly found a surprisingly large number of older people who say they would like to be back at work. 
''Of the older people who are out of the work force, half are satisfied, a quarter can't work because of their health or family situations, and the other quarter are very unhappy about the situation they're in,'' said Thomas W. Moloney, senior vice president of the philanthropy, the Commonwealth Fund. ''That quarter represents about two million people, so it's worth worrying about, especially since we are about to face widespread labor shortages and business will need the contribution these people could be making.''
 
A Boon to Some Employers
The leisure that troubles many older people may become a boon to employers facing an ever-shrinking number of qualified workers as the children born in the baby boom after World War II grow old.
Around the country, a number of companies have started programs to hire retirees for part-time work, to delay retirement by making it possible to move to less demanding jobs, or t allow employees a brief period to try out retirement with the option of returning to work if they do not like it. Others are experimenting with transition programs that help prepare workers for retirement or that train them for volunteer work or second careers. The efforts include these:
* Xerox, in Rochester, has a program that allows older production workers to move into less strenuous jobs. Under a union contract there, people who are 55 or over and have been with the company at least 15 years can move to less demanding jobs that do not involve rotating shifts. About 100 people are in the program, earning an hourly rate between their old pay and the company's normal rate for the less-arduous job.
* Polaroid, in Cambridge, Mass., offers what it calls ''rehearsal retirement'' - one man lasted only three days before returning to work - as well as an unusual program that pays a year's salary and tuition at either Harvard or Lesley College for workers who have been with the company at least 10 years and want to take up new careers teaching elementary or secondary school.
* The Travelers, in Hartford, started what it called a job bank for its retirees in 1981, from which it hires people for temporary jobs. By 1985, the insurance concern's demand for the retirees was so great that the Travelers began recruiting retirees from other companies. But several other local insurance companies have also started hiring retirees, so on a typical day the Travelers has about 120 of its own retirees working but only about 60 from other companies.
Most American men now leave the work force before they turn 63, and with life expectancy increasing, retirement is becoming a longer phase of life for almost everyone.
In 1930, two of every three men 60 and over were in the work force. In 1950, half worked, and by 1980 the figure had dropped to one in three. Even though the average retirement age has stabilized recently, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that by the year 2000 only one in four men 60 and over will be working. And although there has been a surge of women into the work force, most women still leave the work force before they turn 60.
 
Misleading Retirement Answers
To be sure, many early retirees are happier not working, and in several polls and surveys most say they retired voluntarily. But those who study retirement say that may be misleading.
''It's a mistake to talk about voluntary versus involuntary retirement,'' said Joseph F. Quinn, an economics professor at Boston College. ''What do you call it when circumstances change, the pension plan doesn't reward further work and there's a general feeling that you're not valued, so you leave. That would be considered voluntary, but it's not what the person really wanted.''
Surveys by the American Association of Retired Persons have found that from a quarter to a half of older workers and retirees would delay retirement if they could work fewer hours.
''It's clear that it doesn't make sense to set up a system where people go from working all the time to working not at all,'' said Professor Quinn. ''And yet that's how the workplace has been structured. One week you're working 40 hours and the next week you retire and you have no work.''
Part-time jobs are attractive to older workers not just because of waning energies but because, by keeping their earnings low, they can still collect full Social Security benefits. Retirees under 65 receive reduced benefits if they earn more than $6,840 a year. From 65 to 69 the threshold for reduced benefits is $9,360 a year. After 70 there is no earnings test.
Mr. Moloney of the Commonwealth Fund said about 10 million people in manufacturing companies lost their jobs in the 1980's and many never found new work. And he said older workers at large companies were still being offered inducements to leave early because so many younger workers were trying to make their way up the ladder.
''The average male retirement age at firms with over 1,000 employees, places like I.B.M., is down to 59,'' Mr. Moloney said. ''What I tell older workers is to look at the smaller companies.''
 
Potential in Older Workers
Even some large employers see new potential in older workers, given the severe labor shortages in some parts of the country, particularly in the Boston-Washington corridor. There is also increasing concern that with the baby boom generation in the work force, the baby bust generation that followed will not meet the nation's labor demands.
''At our 'Ability Is Ageless' job fair last fall we had 130 employers, up from 100 the year before,''' said Sharon Perkins, director of the New York City Department for the Aging's senior employment division. ''And we would have had more, but there wasn't room. With the traditional labor market shrinking, employers are becoming much more receptive to older people, who often have just the kind of problem-solving skills that are needed in a service economy.''
 
Different Positions Attract
Many older workers take jobs quite different from their career work. Through Travelers' job bank, Dayson DeCourcy, who spent 30 years at the company, first as an insurance agent and later as a public affairs executive, now works 28 hours a week in its litigation department. He reads files and puts stick-on notes on those items he thinks will be important to the case to flag the lawyer's attention.
''I have a purple passion for it,'' said Mr. DeCourcy, 69. ''I like the people, the job is magnificently exciting, I deal with multimillion dollar cases and I'm learning where the bodies are buried.''
While Mr. DeCourcy would not say how much he is paid, he said he earned more an hour than he did just before he retired.
But it is not only money that attracts retirees back to Travelers. Anna Martino, 74, who retired from her job as an accounting supervisor in 1978, came back part time to the personnel department in 1986 after finding that her hobbies, crafts and travel did not keep her busy enough.
''When you're working, you get up, you get dressed, you meet new people,'' she said. ''I have friends who are just home all the time and it seems they're they've gotten into a rut and don't know how to get out.''
 
Jobs With Less Prestige
Many retirees are willing to take jobs with far less prestige than their career work.
''I used to be a purchasing manager for a bank, and then I retired and in six months I'd done everything I'd been planning for the last 30 years, so I wanted to work again,'' said Bill Kramlinger, 67, a courier at the Minnesota Title Company in Minneapolis, where the courier department is staffed entirely with retirees working in pairs. ''I work half the month and I look forward to a few weeks off while my partner works. Then when I'm getting bored, it's time to come back.''
Still, many older workers share a deep certainty that no one is interested in hiring them. Mr. August, the former advertising executive, said there were many subtle ways in which older workers were discouraged from applying for a job.
''You know what they're telling you when someone says the creative director at a certain agency is only 40, and they don't know how he'll feel about talking to you,'' he said. ''Or they'll say it must have been great to be in advertising back when it was fun.''
When Michael A. Leven, the president of Days Inn, began trying to hire retirees as reservation agents, he got no response to newspaper advertisements aimed at older citizens. The reason: Many had been rejected so often that they did not believe the ad.
 
Cutting the Absentee Rate
Mr. Leven was desperate, since his reservation agents at the time had a 30 percent absentee rate and a 180 percent turnover rate. ''I knew they were out there, so we sat down and thought about where seniors gathered and sent people out to put up notices at senior centers,'' Mr. Leven said. ''Then they began to believe that we wanted them.''
About 130 of Days Inn's 600 reservations agents are over 60, absenteeism is down to 3 percent and the average time on the job is up to three years. But some older people remain skeptical.
Mr. Leven said he recently had a call from a woman who had seen an ad but had not believed the company hired older citizens. She said she had called the toll-free reservations number and asked to talk to an older worker. The woman who took the call said she was 78. Still unconvinced, the caller then asked to talk to the supervisor, who told her he was 73.
''She was calling my office,'' Mr. Leven said, ''to say she finally believed us.''

HEADLINE: Earth Day at 20: How Green the Globe? - A special report:
Guarding Environment: A World of Challenges

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Twenty years after the first Earth Day, the Cuyahoga River no longer catches fire on its way through Cleveland, and bald eagles, once threatened by DDT, have increased nearly sevenfold in the continental United States, enough for Government biologists to consider promoting the population to ''threatened'' from ''endangered.''
Around the country there are scores of examples of modest environmental progress, which elected officials and industrial companies will hold up to public view today as thousands of people celebrate Earth Day 1990 and call on society to nurture nature. Everywhere, it seems, the thinking has changed; many corporations have dropped their old arguments pitting pollution against jobs and, sensing competitive advantage, are scrambling instead to demonstrate how ''green'' they are.
But measuring progress is as hard as adding apples and oranges, elephants and ozone.
 
From Streams to Stratosphere
And the targets are shifting. Once concern was centered on narrow problems: the stream in the valley, the dump nearby, tiny snail darters or giant pandas. Increasingly, the issues are problems of the whole earth: industrial gases acting like glass in a greenhouse to trap heat around the earth, the destruction of the protective ozone layer. Scientists have discarded the image of Mother Nature with a black eye for one of Mother Nature stumbling toward a cliff. 
''The ozone hole is the smoking gun,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, who called the thinning of the protective ozone layer ''real proof that humans threaten life on earth.''
One sign of such change is that Earth Day, which began in 1970 as a nationwide event, has evolved at its 20th anniversary into a celebration across 140 countries, honoring Brazilian rain forests, protesting pollution in Eastern Europe and promoting behavior everywhere to preserve stratospheric ozone.
In fact, the near-global agreement in Montreal in January 1989 to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons, which destroy ozone, is cited by many experts as the best example that as a species humans realize there is more to life than being at the top of the food chain.
Around the nation, however, progress on the environment is mixed with frustration. Examples abound:
* Utilities in the United States are burning more than twice as much coal for electricity as they did in 1970, yet they are emitting 15 percent less sulfur dioxide, the coal byproduct that causes acid rain. The consensus, though, is that the reduction is not enough; 4,000 lakes in the United States and 164,000 in Canada are acidified or threatened, by the count of some environmental groups.
* The tailpipes of new cars emit 96 percent less carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and 76 percent less nitrogen oxides than older models. But there are so many more vehicles and so much congestion that half of Americans live in counties that violated Federal clean air standards in 1988.
* Fish have returned to the Cuyahoga River and to Lake Erie, into which it empties, and other Great Lakes. But the flesh of many Great Lakes fish carries toxic chemicals that make them dangerous to eat, and casts doubt on the wisdom of restocking the lakes.
''This is not the way to reconcile people with nature, and the public knows that,'' William K. Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said of the poisonous fish. Mr. Reilly, who carries a business card of brown recycled paper, is himself a symbol of the ascent of environmentalism, if not the environment. A former president of the World Wildlife Fund-United States, he is likely soon to be elevated to the Cabinet.
 
Suddenly, Many Environmentalists
Seventy-six percent of all Americans now call themselves environmentalists, according to a Gallup Poll. But many advocates who used to distinguish themselves by using the label say the environment is worse. And some say attempts to measure real progress are only clouded by the appearance of consensus that comes when everyone from Greenpeace members to chemical company executives marches under the same environmental banner.
The agencies and protective measures that sprang to life after the first Earth Day -among them the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act - have pushed the country to reduce pollution. But global problems that were not even recognized 20 years ago, like thinning ozone and the greenhouse effect, have clearly worsened.
Those pose challenges to society that are different from what came before. In contrast to the dwindling population of eagles, these problems may require solutions before the symptoms are plainly understood. Kenneth H. Keller, a chemical engineer who is a former president of the University of Minnesota, recently wrote: ''Our ability to affect our ecological niche is accompanied by an inability to assess the effects of doing so. In contrast to similar problems in the past, we are faced with the situation that the negative effects may be irreversible if we do not act to correct them, but that forces us to act before we can be sure that we understand them.''
 
Warring Dioxides
And environmental problems are often pitted against each other in a way that makes the whole problem larger than the sum of its parts. For example, acid rain is curbed with scrubbers that remove sulfur dioxide from power plant emissions. But the use of scrubbers requires more coal to be used for each unit of electricity; that raises carbon dioxide emissions, accelerating the buildup of gases that act like panes of glass in a greenhouse to trap the sun's warmth.
Eliminating chlorofluorocarbons to save the ozone layer will make scores of industrial machines less efficient, raising their fuel use and therefore their output of carbon dioxide.
The world is only coming to understand other environmental problems. For example, every year the Federal Government adds 35 to 50 plants, animals and insects to the list protected under the Endangered Species Act, and only 10 have been removed since the list was established in 1973. (Four recovered and six were determined to be extinct.) Species are being lost faster than they can be counted, but the Government list does not reflect that; the length of the list is only a factor of how fast the Fish and Wildlife Service can go through the legal process required to list the endangered species.
 
Choices for the Third World
While experts differ on the extent of progress by the United States, it is clearly ahead of Eastern Europe, where the collapse of the old political and economic order has revealed a history of almost unchecked destruction of natural resources.
The most important choices being made in the coming decades may be in the developing countries, where population and economic activity are growing far faster than in industrial nations. If huge populations attain Western standards of consumption without some corresponding leap in efficiency, nature will reel.
''We need to alter the presumption that increased consumption and economic growth are essential to prosperity,'' said Peter Dykstra, head of the Washington office of Greenpeace.
 
CHANGING VIEWS
Many Shades, All of Them Green
If the physical world is ambiguous, the political world is not, especially since the Exxon Valdez impaled itself on Bligh Reef in March 1989 and the Chernobyl reactor spewed radiation across the Ukraine and much of Europe three years earlier. Concern for nature has claimed hearts and minds around the world. As Yogi Berra might have said, suddenly the environment is all around us.
For example, a New York Times/CBS News Poll asked a random sample of Americans if they agreed that ''protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards cannot be too high, and continuing environmental improvements must be made regardless of cost.''
The question was framed in those provocative terms to identify people who felt strongly about the environment. When it was first asked, in September 1981, 45 percent said yes. This month, 74 percent did. Mr. Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, who was widely respected as an environmentalist before President Bush appointed him, said that if he had been asked the question by a poll taker, he would have answered no, that some steps would be too extreme even for him. And some suspect that the current fever of interest is an unsustainable fad.
 
In the Mainstream
But to be an environmentalist is to be in the mainstream, as demonstrated in a recent speech by none other than Edgar S. Woolard, the chairman of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, which once advertised ''Better Living Through Chemistry.'' Now he argues that survival belongs to the environmentally fit.
''Industrial companies will ignore the environment only at their peril,'' he said. ''Corporations that think they can drag their heels indefinitely on genuine environmental problems should be advised: Society won't tolerate it, and Du Pont and other companies with real sensitivity and environmental commitment will be there to supply your customers after you're gone.''
The idea that the public will reward companies that strike a protective pose toward nature seems demonstrated by the experience of Conoco, a Du Pont subsidiary that is the world's 20th-largest oil company, which recently announced that it was changing the recipe of its gasoline to reduce air pollution. From coast to coast, Conoco said, it received telephone calls from individuals and organizations asking where its gasoline could be bought. Public opposition to fishing methods that trapped dolphins in tuna nets led the biggest tuna canning companies to agree to buy only from fishing boats that use other methods.
Other industrialists have said the public's changing attitude has changed too much. One casualty between this Earth Day and the first one, some companies say, is the credibility of the Federal Government; the model of future environmental regulation, they say, may be Alar, an herbicide that was effectively banned not by the Government, which said there was not enough information to justify the step, but by a report from a nonprofit environmental group widely reported on television and in newspapers.
''Frequently stories of doom and gloom are reported without any scientific counterpoint or peer review,'' complained William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, an industry lobbying group.
Another industry spokesman, Richard M. Morrow, the chairman of Amoco, said environmental politics and bad or incomplete science were leading to poor choices in allocating scarce resources. Speaking of the national effort to clean up thousands of toxic waste sites, he said: ''The Federal Superfund program will spend huge amounts of money and tie up some of the country's top technical people to deal with waste sites that in many cases pose no particular threat to anyone. Yet the country is strapped for funds to deal with such issues as drugs, education and public health.''
 
An 'Environmental Ethic'
The reasons for the shift toward environmentalism are not clear even to those who have fought for it. Some trace it to a merger of two popular concerns: preservation of the wild and fear of cancer. A recurrent theme of environmental decay is the presence of new chemicals, often man-made, that are suspected or confirmed carcinogens.
The global nature of problems like diminishing stratospheric ozone, deforestation and hunger has had its own effect on attitudes, blurring the boundaries between nations, some experts say. The environmentalists' response to the Chernobyl disaster - that a nuclear accident anywhere is an accident everywhere - has parallels that apply to pollution. Political change has also brought nations together; countries in the European Community are now moving as a single unit to impose tailpipe emission standards.
Advocates in the field say they are surprised by the high level of public knowledge around the world about the ozone hole, especially given the confusing nature of ozone. The helpful molecule being destroyed in the stratosphere is the same one that is created by automotive pollution at ground level, where it causes irritation and lung damage.
All this consciousness adds up to an important change for the environment, experts say, perhaps more than any invention, regulation or other development has wrought in the last two decades. What remains to be seen is how long the attitude, which also seemed dominant on previous Earth Days, will endure. But for now longtime environmental advocates are basking.
James Gustave Speth, president of the World Resources Institute in Washington, said the biggest development since the first Earth Day was ''the steady and sometimes spectacular growth of worldwide public concern about environmental degradation, and of citizen action and organization to meet these challenges.'' John C. Sawhill, president of the Nature Conservancy, called it ''the gradual 'mainstreaming' of environmental activism.''
Mr. Dykstra of Greenpeace's Washington office said that in January 1988 his office received 1,000 requests for general information; by February 1990 that figure was 1,000 a day.
Michael Deland, chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality, said an ''environmental ethic'' had emerged nationally and internationally since the first Earth Day.
Where this ethic is leading is less clear. The collective push of the individual choices of Americans often points away from environmentally sound practice. For example, the average gas mileage of new cars declined 4 percent from the model year 1988 to 1990 after rising about 50 percent in the previous decade. Buyers are voting with their feet -specifically, the foot on the gas pedal. Americans still prefer heavier cars with bigger engines and better acceleration, the auto makers say. And the number of miles they drive rises about 2 percent a year, year in and year out.
And garbage, that index of prosperity, is still rising. Discards per person per day, 2.5 pounds in 1960, reached 3.6 pounds by 1986, the most recent year for which the E.P.A. has released figures. Discards are increasing faster than recycling or burning to recover energy.
Nearly every human activity affects the environment. The two pages to print this article in 1.7 million copies of The New York Times required nearly 20 tons of paper, which began as 400 evergreen trees, mostly spruce, that covered about two acres.
While individuals may not always make the choices that help nature most, sometimes regulation forces steps that bring measurable progress. For example, tests showed that concentrations of the pesticide DDT in human tissue fell from an average of 8 parts per million in 1970 to 2 in 1983 as a result of a Federal ban. (Concentrations fell in bald eagles, too, leading to their partial recovery.) Lead concentrations in blood fell 40 percent from 1975 to 1981, and the number of people with more than 1 part per million of cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls declined from about 70 percent of the population in 1972 to about 10 percent in 1983.
The gains are by no means uniform. For example, atmospheric concentrations of two of the most ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons, CFC-11 and CFC-12, increased by 85 percent from 1975 to 1985. The Montreal protocol, which took effect in July, will gradually reduce production of the chemicals.
In the absence of a comprehensive yardstick of environmental progress, perhaps the closest thing is a broad measure of human health: life expectancy. It is now 75 years, up from 70.9 years in 1970, according to the Census Bureau.
 
STAYING INVENTIVE
Living Cleaner, Living Smarter
All these signs of environmental progress and even degradation are actually a result of overall human progress, said Julian Simon, a professor at the University of Maryland business school who espouses the unconventional view that a bigger population is a plus because it means more human creativity and more progress.
''The list of things we can worry about is reasonably short,'' he said. ''We can worry about getting fed, the safety of our children, having a car, things like that. Now we don't worry about our children dying of smallpox; as we successively solve one problem after another, we work our way down the list, and we've worked our way down to the environment.''
For the United States, said Dr. Simon, this began in the 1950's and 60's with rising prosperity. In the third world, ''the super-poor can't pollute at all because they don't have anything to pollute with.'' But with economic progress, he said, ''they will get affluent enough that they want to buy cleanliness.''
Dr. Simon's underlying thesis is that standards of living, the availability of raw materials and life expectancies are all rising because the world is progressively inventing its way out of problems, expanding the pie of materials, goods and services faster than it is adding people to divide the pie.
 
Toward a Solar Future?
The thesis that progress brings environmentalism may be tested soon in Eastern Europe, where the collapse of Communism has exposed environmental exploitation and an aspiration not only for political freedom, but also for clean air and healthy forests, and an end to what Mr. Dykstra of Greenpeace calls ''environmental repression.''
Even less sanguine experts agree that the process of inventing the way out of problems is continuing on some level. With some encouragement from the Government, scientists and engineers are laying the technological foundations for what experts say will be an economy that does not consume scarce resources or continuously add pollution.
The most promising invention of the last 20 years, says Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund, is the photovoltaic cell, which turns sunlight into electricity. The price of such cells is still too high to compete with electricity produced from oil but is falling rapidly; the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., says some utilities may find solar cells cheaper than oil for some power needs by the middle of this decade.
With continued progress, many hope that solar cells, with cheap energy storage systems, will supplant oil, coal and natural gas.
That is in the future. A host of smaller technological advances in the last decade have enabled Americans to use energy more efficiently. And some experts say this could point the way for other countries.
 
Increasing Efficiency
At the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Marc Ledbetter, a spokesman, pointed out that in the last 20 years, the American economy had grown by roughly half while energy use rose only about 10 percent. ''Had this improvement not occurred, we would now be spending an additional $150 billion per year on energy, emitting billions of more tons of carbon dioxide and other air and water pollutants,'' he said.
The increase in efficiency comes from improvements in products that consumers are using. Technology holds out the prospect of continued improvements, of course, but partly because it has advanced much faster than the marketplace.
For example, the average electric water heater in use in 1985 consumed 4,000 kilowatt-hours a year, according to the council, while the average new model bought that year required 3,500. But for years water heaters have been available that used only 1,500 kilowatt-hours a year, and the best expected to be available in the 1990's do the same work for just over 1,000 kilowatt-hours. An economist might find it cost-effective to rip out an old model and replace it with a new one, but few people bother. Even when an old appliance must be replaced because it has broken down, buyers sometimes balk at the higher purchase price of a more efficient model. And the pollution that comes from extra energy consumption is often not calculated in the price.
The difference between the typical 1985 heater and the best 1990's heater, a difference of 3,000 kilowatt-hours a year, is equivalent to about 1.25 tons of coal. Each household that makes such a switch will save an attendant amount of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide from being released into the atmosphere through coal burning.
The challenge for households and policy makers is how to push the American economy toward the 1,000-kilowatt-hour model. The trend toward greater energy efficiency stalled last year, and while it began improving again in late 1989, its future course is not certain.
 
Abstinence Isn't Virtue
The progress is important because the United States, with about 2 percent of the world's population, uses 24 percent of its energy, about twice as much as Western Europe and Japan per unit of economic output. In contrast, China, with about 20 percent of the world's population, uses 9 percent of its energy.
For China, as for all the third world, this is a result not of virtue or voluntary abstinence but of poverty. If China were to achieve the same rate of energy consumption as the United States, that would nearly double world consumption. Much of the increase would probably come from burning more coal, vastly increasing the output of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.
One solution is to encourage the third world to use energy more efficiently that the United States does: in other words, when China puts a water heater in every house to make sure its leaders chose the most efficient one available.
But the developing world seems least likely to make such choices. It seems to be polluting more and enjoying it less. A recent study by the Department of Energy found that in the United States, about 8 percent of the electricity generated is lost in transmission before it reaches the consumer. For Pakistan, the figure is 28 percent. It takes China 37 percent more energy to make a ton of paper than it takes the United States, the study reported.
Some experts say that moving to very efficient practices would help the environment and also help the poor. This stands in contrast to the idea common in past decades that sound environmental practice was in conflict with economic development.
 
'We Have to Take the Lead'
''We've been the world's banker and the world's policeman before,'' said Tom Hayden, a California Assemblyman who has long been an environmentalist. ''Now instead of operating the most wasteful economy in the world, we have to take the lead in showing how environmental protection, human health and economic efficiency go together.''
Some scientists say innovation can eliminate the main source of pollution in a generation. Dr. Oppenheimer, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the United States could end its use of fossil fuels by Earth Day 2030 if Americans switched to 100 mile-per-gallon cars and mass transit, moved closer to work, used lightbulbs drawing 75 percent less current, modernized industry to grow while using less power and moved aggressively to develop renewable energy sources.
Mr. Deland of the White House said, ''A sound and safe environment and a flourishing economy are two sides of the same coin.'' He said environmental improvement would require changes in the way people live their lives, but he added, ''As more and more people realize that changes in lifestyle do not result in less enjoyment or less leisure, but in cleaner air and water and better health, we will realize remarkable progress over the next 20 years.''
 
ENDURING GROWTH
More Mouths, Less Land
Many experts say technological invention and economic progress will reach its limits in the face of rising population, which is now 5.3 billion and will probably be 1 billion higher by the turn of the century.
That population appears to be putting more and more pressure on the planet. In the first chapter of the Bible, God gives Adam and Eve ''every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,'' and Dr. Peter M. Vitousek, a Stanford biologist, said humans had taken a huge chunk of the gift. Of the total amount of energy captured by green plants worldwide, he calculated, nearly 40 percent is controlled or consumed by humans. The figure includes trees cut for lumber or paper, and grain harvested as animal feed.
''That's an enormous fraction for one species to have control of,'' he said. ''It says that as the population continues to increase, we can't keep using things in a business-as-usual way.'' Dr. Vitousek's calculation also implies less and less for the other species.
A growing population could be accommodated by developing plants that put more of their product into food and less into roots and leaves, he said. But right now, he went on, farmers are pumping well water for irrigation faster than it can be replenished, poisoning water with fertilizer and carrying out other steps that cannot be sustained for long. ''Our present mix of technology and population is too high,'' he said.
 
Grains, People and Topsoil
Some damaging practices are already taking their toll. Researchers at the Worldwatch Institute say world grain output, while racing ahead, is no longer racing as fast as population is. The reasons are erosion, over-irrigation and other practices that ruin farmland. The loss of protective ozone allows the entry of radiation that stunts plants as well as hurting animals. According to Worldwatch, grain output per person rose 26 percent in the 70's, but fell 2 percent in the 80's and will fall 7 percent more in the 90's.
Cropland is literally disappearing, running down the rivers and blowing away with the wind, so much so that atmospheric scientists in Hawaii can tell when the spring plowing begins in China. Yet with 24 billion fewer tons of topsoil each year, the world's farmers now try to feed 86 million more people each year. That is about the amount of topsoil in Australia's wheatland. ''Those two trends cannot both continue,'' Lester R. Brown of Worldwatch said.
The area under cultivation has fallen 7 percent since 1981 after rising 24 percent in the preceding three decades. The decline results partly from public policy in the United States, where farmers are paid not to grow, and partly from conversion of cropland to nonagricultural uses like housing and industry. But more of it is from erosion.
The Soviet Union has abandoned 13 percent of the land on which it formerly grew grain. By 1980, India listed more than one-third of its land area as degraded, by wind, water, salt or other problems. The desert is advancing across Africa, and Latin America shows severe signs of stress. Crop yields in Africa are down 27 percent per person from their peak, and in Latin America 13 percent.
 
The Press for Greater Output
Food and development pressures do not stop at the shore. Despite numerous treaties, environmentalists say that the world still needs an effective international agreement to stop overfishing and that the lack of one has degraded oceans.
The world can compensate for loss of cropland if the remaining land is more productive. Mr. Brown sees limits, however. In parts of Tamil Nadu state in India, the water table fell almost 100 feet during the 1970's; the increased agricultural production that irrigation allowed seems unlikely to be sustained.
And the most productive places are in the middle and northern latitudes, where the greenhouse effect is postulated to be the strongest. And drought, like the one that hit the American plains in 1988, can result from greater heat as well as from lower rainfall.
The solution may lie in finding new ways to put food on the table, or in strategies to have to set fewer plates.
''The best technologies in the world,'' said Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, ''will not save us if there are too many mouths to feed.''
 
INVENTING CLEAN AIR: THE PACE OF PROGRESS
 
Catalytic Converter
In widespread use for a decade, the device has greatly reduced two types of pollutants emitted by tailpipes. It burns hydrocarbon molecules that did not fully combust as they passed through gasoline engines. It also splits apart nitrogen oxide that formed in gasoline combustion. A catalytic converter adds more than $400 to the cost of a car and cuts carbon monoxide emissions 76 percent and nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon emissions 96 percent.
 
Indutrial Scrubber
Coal is cheap and abundant, but may include 3.5 sulfur. when burned, this makes sulfur dioxide, a major ingredient of acid rain. Scrubbers run smoke through lime or limestone, usually mixed with water, to bind it chemically. After two decades of improvements, the scrubbers can remove 95 percent of sulfur dioxide, but produce hundreds of thousands ot tons of waste a year at each plant. Scrubbers consume 5 percent of the energy produced by burning the coal, thereby raising total coal consumption.
 
Photovoltaic Cell
Photovoltaic cells make electricity directly from sunlight. Energy in the form of light hits the silicon of the cell and shakes loose an electron, which creates electric current. Scientists are pregressively raising the amount of energy that the cells capture, and lowering their costs; the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility consortium, says that later this decade solar cells will become cheaper than conventional power sources in the sunny Southwes
 
AN ENVIRONMENTAL PARABLE
Americans have lamps. Americans heat their water with electricity. Americans have refrigerators. These things are rare in countries like China. One American now uses as much electricity as 200 people in China. China's leaders want their people to have refrigerators. They hope to distribute billions of light bulbs. There are big plans for hot-water heaters.
Progress brings choices. Life in China is improving so quickly for so many that the choices China makes will make a big difference around the world. And there are more countries like China: with big or fast-growing populations, and with enough resources to make big leaps in the amount of electricity used.
The more electricity used, the more coal burned. The more coal burned, the more pollution in the air. The more pollution, the more gasses in the air to trap heat.
Some light bulbs (and water heaters) use a lot of electricity. Some do not. Good bulbs needs a fifth the electricity of bad bulbs. Good heaters need a quarter the electricity of bad heaters.
A China with living standards raised to America's could avoid spewing more than 20 billion tons a year of carbon pollution into the air if it choses efficient appliances instead of inefficient appliances.
Would that make a difference? That amount of pollution is more than triple the total carbon pollution now sent into the air each year by industry and other fuel users around the world.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Moves to Expel Top Kashmir Separatist

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
Increasingly concerned about Hindu-Muslim violence in the disputed territory of Kashmir, at the border between India and Pakistan, the State Department has moved to expel the leader of a Kashmiri separatist group visiting the United States.
Responding to a request from India, the United States on Friday revoked the visa of the leader, Amanullah Khan, chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, which is labeled a terrorist organization by the State Department. Mr. Khan described himself at a news conference here as a freedom fighter seeking independence for Jammu and Kashmir, the only state with a Muslim majority in predominantly Hindu India.
India says that his group is responsible for many bombings, killings and kidnappings, and that the number of such attacks has increased in the last few months as the Government tries to contain the movement for independence led by Kashmiri insurgents.
Alarmed by the possibility that India and Pakistan could go to war for a third time over Kashmir, Washington is prodding New Delhi and Islamabad to avoid violence and provocative acts, to shun inflammatory language and to improve communications. 
After a briefing on Thursday by officials from the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency, Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia, said: ''I don't think either India or Pakistan is planning to wage war. But the situation could very easily escalate out of control, and there is a real possibility that it could lead to a full-scale war between two countries with a nuclear capacity.''
Robert M. Kimmitt, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said there was ''a growing risk of miscalculation'' as Pakistan and India put troops on alert near the border.
Accordingly, he said, the Administration is urging India and Pakistan to ''take immediate steps to reduce the level of tension, by lowering rhetoric and avoiding provocative troop deployments.''
After nearly four decades, the United States has changed its position and is no longer urging a plebiscite in Kashmir, saying the dispute should be settled through direct negotiations between India and Pakistan. The United States might at some point consider a role as mediator, but India resents advice on how to manage what it sees as its internal affairs.
The Bush Administration has urged India to ''seek a political dialogue'' with the Kashmiris, to address their ''legitimate political and economic needs'' and to ''restrain its security forces from using deadly force against unarmed people.''
Ratakonda R. Dayakara, a spokesman for the Indian Embassy, said that such advice was unnecessary. ''We do not accept anybody telling us to talk to the people of Kashmir, which is an integral part of India,'' he said. ''A foreign government should not tell us to talk to our own people. As a matter of fact, we are already talking to them.''
Pakistan welcomes American interest in the dispute. A Pakistani diplomat said: ''The United States, as a superpower and a member of the United Nations Security Council, should use its influence to persuade Delhi to talk to us.''
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is scheduled to meet next month in Moscow with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Mr. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat, said they should invite the Foreign Ministers of India and Pakistan to join them for a discussion on Kashmir.
India asserts that Pakistan provides weapons and military training to Islamic insurgents in Kashmir. Pakistani officials openly provide moral and political support to the Kashmiris, but deny that the Pakistani Government supplies arms.
American officials say a war over Kashmir would undermine the democratically elected Government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan. At least one opposition politician in Pakistan, Sheik Rasheed Ahmed, was quoted recently in the press there as saying that he intended to continue running a training camp for Kashmiri militants, even though Ms. Bhutto has asked him to dismantle it.

HEADLINE: Estimate Board Votes a Survey for Rent Increases

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
The New York City Board of Estimate has gone along with Mayor David N. Dinkins and approved a city contract for the annual cost survey used to help determine rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments.
An important but consistently controversial feature of the city's rent-stabilization program, the annual survey is intended to provide an index of the costs of supplies and services -like fuel, insurance and labor - required to operate a building.
It will be used by the city's Rent Guidelines Board to help set rent increases for about 600,000 rent-stabilized apartments where leases will be renewed this year. There are about 950,000 rent-stabilized apartments in the city. 
Until shortly before the vote was taken on Wednesday it appeared that the board would reject the item. That would have given Mr. Dinkins his first such public rebuff since he took office on Jan. 1.
The estimate board had rebuked Mayor Edward I. Koch on the same issue in 1987. At that time, Mr. Dinkins, then the Manhattan Borough President, had voted against the contract.
But this time, with Barbara J. Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, heading up the administration's effort to obtain support, the measure was approved by a vote of 7 to 4. The $174,858 contract went to Speedwell Inc., an economic consulting concern in Duxbury, Mass.
 
Four Vote Against It
Those who voted for the contract, through their representatives, were the Mayor, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, City Council President Andrew J. Stein - each of whom have two votes - and Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island. The four other borough presidents - Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, Howard Golden of Brooklyn, Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and Claire Shulman of Queens - voted against it.
Mrs. Fife said the Mayor recognized that there were shortcomings in the way the price index was devised. Critics of the survey, including the New York State Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, have long contended that it is one-sided because it looks only at the estimated operating costs of landlords and not at their rental income and profits.
 
A More Accurate Measure
But Mrs. Fife said steps had been taken to compensate for those shortcomings and to move toward a more accurate measure in the future. In line with this, she said, the city would press for legislation in Albany to give the rent board power to review a representative sampling of the books and records of landlords.
Without the contract to Speedwell, she said, the rent board would have had to make a price survey on its own, thereby overburdening its staff.
The crucial vote for the contract came from Comptroller Holtzman, said those familiar with the behind-the-scenes maneuverings that preceded the board's action.
A spokesman for the Comptroller, Glenn Goldberg, said on Friday that Ms. Holtzman had agreed to vote for the contract after the Mayor had agreed to call for the repeal of the supplemental rent increase that affects tenants who pay less than $200 a month in rent. Mr. Goldberg said that Ms. Holtzman had felt that the supplemental increase imposed a hardship on low-income tenants.
Mr. Goldberg also said that Ms. Holtzman would have an active role in bringing about needed changes in rent regulation.
After the estimate board meeting, Stanley Panesoff, a member of the board of the statewide Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, said, ''The vote by David Dinkins, Liz Holtzman and Andy Stein to continue the price-index study perpetuates the unfair, dishonest system of setting rents that guarantees annual across-the-board rent hikes whether they are needed or not.''

HEADLINE: EDUCATORS CHEER ENROLLMENT GAINS

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Education experts say they are heartened by Census Bureau statistics indicating that the percentage of high school graduates who go on to college jumped almost 10 points in the past decade.
While some experts said the data collected in a survey late last year show that recent education reform efforts are taking hold, several raised questions about precisely what the numbers mean and what segment of the population they represent. To a large extent, the increase may be attributable to students over the usual college age.
''I do think it's an encouraging figure,'' said Nan Keohane, president of Wellesley College. ''It must mean that some of these people are turned on to education, are excited about what it's doing for them and that they don't want to stop.'' 
''That, of course, is the best news in the world for us,'' Dr. Keohane added.
 
Goals Identified
The Secretary of Education, Lauro F. Cavazos, said he was encouraged by the Census Bureau numbers. ''Our own Department of Education figures confirm that many more high school graduates have identified career goals that can only be realized through college studies,'' he said.
Paul Siegel, chief of the education branch of the United States Census Bureau, said 58.9 percent of 16- to 34-year-olds who said they obtained a high school diploma in 1988 reported that they enrolled in a two-year or a four-year college. In 1978, the figure was 49.6 percent. ''There's this undeniable trend,'' Mr. Siegel said.
While the number of high school graduates has dropped in the last 10 years, a higher percentage are going on to college. Mr. Siegel noted that 58.9 percent represented about 1,575,000 of the 2,673,000 students who received a diploma in 1988, the latest year for which statistics have been tabulated. In 1978, 1.6 million of the nation's 3.2 million graduates enrolled in college.
The jump in enrollment is part of a trend in which comparatively untapped segments of the population -divorced women, veterans, older people and members of minority groups -are returning to school. That return has countered the effects on enrollment of the end of the baby boom.
 
Large Group of Dropouts
''There is a very large group of students who drop out and then, through one means or another, have opportunities to return,'' said John I. Goodlad, director of the Center for Education Renewal at the University of Washington. Of the students now entering college, 10 to 12 percent are beyond the usual age of high school graduates, he said. Total enrollment in American colleges increased to 13 million in 1988, from 12 million in 1980.
Craig Sautter of Evanston, Ill., who publishes College Bound, a newsletter for admissions officers and guidance counselors, said the new statistics indicated that ''the school reform movement of the last decade is making an impact on kids' minds.'' He added, ''They realize that the real economic world now requires something after high school.''
Dr. Keohane concurred. ''It is becoming clearer that our educational system is predicated on people having some training past high school to be able to take up the complicated jobs which are increasingly central to our economy,'' she said. Who Are These People? While conceding that the numbers ''probably make sense,'' Robin Etter Zuniga, senior staff associate at the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, said: ''Some of those census figures are so aggregated that it's hard to understand what they mean. The number intrigues me because I don't know who these people are.''
Ms. Zuniga questioned how many were traditional high school graduates and how many hold graduate equivalency diplomas. ''I'd want to know how many of them are going to two-year junior colleges and how many are at four-year institutions,'' she said. The census survey did not give such breakdowns.
Frank Burtnett, director of the National Association of College Admissions Officers, said he was not surprised by the increase because it relates in part to a rise in the percentage of students earning high school diplomas. In 1979, 71.4 percent of people aged 17 in the country graduated from high school - a national low. Since then, Mr. Burtnett said, the figure has risen to about 74 percent.
Mr. Burtnett raised another question about the census figures, pointing out that the respondents were merely asked whether they had enrolled in college. ''That could mean that they've signed up for just one class,'' he said.
Even so, Mr. Burtnett added, ''any experience that the individual has on a college campus is like a magnet.''
 
Most Applications Ever
The record levels of college applications in recent years, despite the end of the baby boom, has surprised college admissions officers, Mr. Sautter said.
Besides the increase in college-bound graduates, he said, intense marketing by the nation's universities and colleges - with some institutions spending as much as $2,000 on recruiting for every enrolled student - prompted the rise of what he called ''multiple applications.''
''Students knew it was a buyer's market and were out there with 10, 15 applications,'' Mr. Sautter said. ''You get a letter from DePaul inviting you to apply. Why not apply? In the past, a person would apply to five or six schools.''
The multiple-application phenomenon seems to be abating, Mr. Sautter said. Many colleges complained that they could no longer forecast how many of the applicants accepted would enroll, he said, and high school guidance counselors, sensitive to those complaints, began advising students against the practice.

 BODY:
Have you noticed any eyes prying into your life this week? Perhaps they belong to one of the 5,000 members of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, more commonly known as ASMP.
''Ten Thousand Eyes'' is an ASMP project intended to celebrate photography's 150 years by recording 150 hours in the life of the United States. That's slightly longer than the 24 hours of the bestselling ''A Day in the Life of America,'' but in logistical terms its duration may be an advantage. The 10,000 eyes of the project's title come from multiplying the ASMP's national membership times two. 
The impetus for the project came from the AMSP chapter in South Florida and each of the organization's 33 regional chapters has been charged with organizing its own events during the period of April 23 to 29. Besides documenting their own regions, members will participate in workshops, lectures and other consciousness-raising sessions meant to lift the medium's self-esteem.
The New York chapter, for example, hopes to get Mayor David Dinkins to shoot a few pictures. The branches in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio are teaming up Lone-Star fashion to focus on ''The Eyes of Texas.'' San Francisco photographers will concentrate on the theme ''Sung and Unsung Heroes.'' In addition, there will be a 10-kilometer running race, beach cleanups and seemingly endless efforts at publicity.
To record the ASMP's photo opportunity in permanent form, a book and exhibition are planned. Members will submit the pictures they have taken during the week to be judged and edited; the expected 250 chosen images will go on tour and be published in book form in the fall of 1991.
The Eastman Kodak Company is aiding this ambitious promotional gambit by serving as national sponsor. Kodak is contributing 25,000 rolls of film and will produce the book. Various processing labs are also chipping in to develop the film free of charge.
What does this all mean? In terms of the art of photography, probably not much. But ''Ten Thousand Eyes'' may give the members of ASMP a much-needed shot in the arm. Since the decline of big picture magazines like Life and Look and the ascendancy of the current television culture, magazine photographers have struggled to maintain their morale. So has the ASMP itself. Long a leader in such matters as decent pay scales for picture reproduction and photographers' rights to control their work, the organization has had its ups and downs.
At one point it went so far as to change its name to the Society for Photographers in Communications. But that went over like a lead balloon, so now it's back to ASMP, thank goodness. More recently, the traditional New York power base of the national organization has been eroded by the growing strength of its regional chapters. As the genesis of ''Ten Thousand Eyes'' suggests, New York is no longer the be-all and end-all of magazine photography.
The ASMP membership is no longer snooty about the label ''commercial photography,'' either. The one-time purity of ''editorial'' photographers (they usually called themselves photojournalists) has disappeared due to simple economics. To survive these days, photographers need to do advertising work as well as illustrations for a magazine's articles.
Photographer Dennis Cody, national chairman of ''Ten Thousand Eyes,'' put it this way in an article in Photo District News: ''All of the historical stuff done on the 150-year celebration has primarily focused on the early and middle years of photography. We want to show the commercial contribution that ASMP photographers have made to our society and culture over the past few decades.''
The ''commercial contribution'' Mr. Cody cites may have a dark and tawdry side as well as a bright one, but if ''Ten Thousand Eyes'' is able to make that contribution clear, then it will accomplish something all the museum shows in honor of photography haven't.
Meanwhile, let's hope the ASMP goes on fighting the good fight in terms of insuring that photographers get a fair shake in the world. Most recently, that has meant lobbying for revisions in the newly revised copyright law, which gave photographers' clients de facto ownership of work ''done for hire.'' For helping in that battle alone, the ASMP deserves the thanks of all photographers, commercial, amateur and otherwise.

HEADLINE: ART;
400 YEARS OF STAGE DESIGN, ON PAPER

BYLINE: By JOHN RUSSELL

 BODY:
This critic has been a member almost since infancy of one of the more harmless among secret societies. It has no dues, no meetings, no coded signs of recognition, no oath of loyalty and no meetings. Its membership consists, worldwide, of men and women who would be delighted, any time, any place, to be locked up all day in a theater museum.
In New York, they hole up like termites in the Lincoln Center branch of the Public Library. True phantoms of the opera, they haunt the Musee de l'Opera in Paris, the display of vintage stage models in Bayreuth, the Museo della Scala in Milan, the Institut fur Theaterwissenschaften in Berlin. On leaving the theater museums in Moscow and Leningrad, more than one of our members has fainted dead away from excitement and had to be revived with a glass of kvass. 
It was therefore in high spirits that this critic headed for the exhibition called ''Theater on Paper'' that can be seen through June 21 at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street. Drawn entirely from the collections of the London Theater Museum in Covent Garden, it was chosen and catalogued by Alexander Schouvaloff, who had nurtured the museum through fair weather and foul before overseeing its inauguration in 1987. That he should last year have been relieved of his post in summary style is one of the many reasons for which posterity will lay a curse on the present regime at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Ranging over nearly 400 years - from 1608 to 1987 - the 91 items in the show dance back and forth in place, time and ambition. There is a design for an entertainment in Florence, in 1608, in which the audience was shown - history notwithstanding - how Amerigo Vespucci discovered America. There is a program design by the English cartoonist Ronald Searle for an entertainment that was put on by undiscouraged British servicemen in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in Singapore in 1944.
There is a design by Edward Gordon Craig for the ghost of Hamlet's father in Craig's landmark production of the play in Moscow in the winter of 1911-12. And there is a wonderful sense of silhouette in the design for a man's costume by Alexandra Exter, the Russian Constructivist painter and stage designer. Though done late in her career (1929), and for a theater in Germany, this has something of the ferocious economy with which Exter could command the stage.
On a lighter, less intrusive level, there is a drawing for the wonderfully apt and by now immensely nostalgic setting that was designed by Gladys Calthrop for the first production, in 1930, of Noel Coward's ''Private Lives.'' (To see that design is to imagine how perfectly it must have offset one of the best casts in the history of the London theater - Noel Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Laurence Olivier and Adrienne Allen.) There are drawings that both intensify legend and correct it. One of the great irrecoverables of ballet history has always been ''Le Spectre de la Rose,'' in which in 1911 Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina had so great a success. Anyone who has sat in boredom and disbelief through recent ''revivals'' of ''Le Spectre'' may well have decided that its lyrical charm was too fragile for recapture.
But at the Drawing Center there is a drawing by Leon Bakst for some of the accessories that were essential to the poetical (as distinct from the athletic) effect. There is the armchair with nonmatching cushion in which the young girl sits, midway between deep sleep and waking. There is the harp (Bakst specifies ''rosewood and gold, in the style of 1820-30''). There is the rod from which curtains hung (''but can be pulled in one direction only''). And there is the half-hidden single bed with its lacy pillows, its silk sheets and its silk blanket.
Bakst held fast to all these things, even if he was persuaded just before the rise of the curtain on opening night to discard the bird cage and the stuffed canary that would have got in the way of Nijinsky's celebrated exit through the open window. Looking at this drawing, we realize to what an extent he was an equal partner in the delicate enterprise.
In the domain of stage design, few men have cast as long a shadow as Diaghilev, and it is a virtue of the present show that it reminds us of one of the odder echoes of the enthusiasm with which Diaghilev and his company were received in London from 1911 onward. This was an entertainment by J. M. Barrie, the author of ''Peter Pan,'' called ''The Truth About the Russian Dancers.''
In the course of it, Tamara Karsavina appeared in a ''golfing costume'' by the young English painter Paul Nash. Though not quite the thing for a competitor in the United States Open - it consisted of a coat and billowing skirt, beneath which a pair of checked pantaloons ended just above the ankle - we can have no doubt of its effect on the stage.
Elsewhere in the show, we are reminded of the ensemble quality of entertainments now unjustly forgotten. For instance there is a design by George W. Harris (1878-1929) for the production in London in 1923 of James Elroy Flecker's poetic play ''Hassan.'' This had incidental music by Frederick Delius, choreography by Michel Fokine and a cast that could have been made in heaven for Flecker's high-flown text.
Was George W. Harris outclassed? Not at all. A seasoned professional, up to every benign trick of his trade, he could summon up the glorious East with a design for a confectioner's shop that began in darkness and progressed through high echoing spaces to an even brighter light in the far right corner. Every rug, every pot and pan, every roofbeam and every tumbledown chair worked toward a final effect so subtle that the audience was seduced and delighted but was never quite sure why or how.
The older sections of the show have surprises that are well worth seeking out. One of them is the set of three designs for Shakespeare's ''Richard III'' that were made by Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg and rediscovered only a few years ago. Apparently made for David Garrick, greatest of English actors in the late 18th century, they include the first bridge that was built on the stage, rather than painted, and signal a new sense of naturalism in English stage design.
And, just in case we think that the Theater Museum concerns itself only with high art, there is a design by Basil Crage for a late Victorian vaudeville show in which a very pretty young woman was dressed up as that invaluable novelty, the one-penny postage stamp. From the first years of the 17th century onwards we never lose sight for long of the fact that theater is by its nature ribald, provocative, outrageous and gaudy. There are good jokes, but there are terrible jokes, too, just as there are jokes that long ago lost their savor.
When we stand back and think about the final effect of the show, we realize that it is not, and could not have been, a concise history of stage design, worldwide. The Theater Museum has always depended very largely upon gifts and bequests.
Nor is it the case that major names are necessarily seen at their best. The costume designs by Juan Gris and Giorgio de Chirico add nothing to their stature. No one could tell from the little sketch by Christian Berard that before and after World War II he had no rival in Paris as an inventor of stage pictures.
The tiny drawings by Picasso for the Chinese Conjuror in ''Parade'' (1917) are indispensable to the specialist, but they give no idea of his stature on the rare occasions when he gave his whole self to the theater. It has also to be said that the show is rather too kind to one or two truly appalling designers of the period since World War II. History cannot be all victories, as we know, but there are defeats of which no one likes to be reminded.
Nonetheless, everyone who is interested in theater or dance, or both together, will have a good time. (Opera plays almost no part.) And we should be properly grateful to Mr. Schouvaloff, and to the the many other enthusiasts who made the London Theater Museum possible.
The sponsors of the Design Center exhibition include the Howard Gilman and Samuel I. Newhouse foundations. The catalogue costs $30.

Milken Settlement Reported
 
The Milken criminal case might be near a conclusion. Michael R. Milken reached an agreement in principle on Friday to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay $600 million in fines, according to people who had been briefed on the settlement. Mr. Milken transformed corporate takeovers through his use of high-yield ''junk bonds'' at the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The tentative decision by Mr. Milken would end an inquiry begun in 1986 when Ivan F. Boesky, a former stock speculator, settled insider trading charges by paying a $100 million fine and agreeing to cooperate with the government. Federal prosecutors threatened to file additional charges unless Mr. Milken agreed to a guilty plea by Friday. He was indicted in March 1989 on 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud and other charges. His fine would be the largest ever levied on an individual under the securities laws. He would still be left with substantial wealth, but he would also be subject to civil suits by investors and penalties by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
I.B.M. Rebounds at Home
 
The International Business Machines Corporation's domestic operations just might be catching up with its profitability internationally. I.B.M.'s report last week that its first-quarter profits rose 9.2 percent to $1.04 billion gave many analysts a pleasant surprise. Carol Muratore, who follows I.B.M. for Morgan Stanley, said that in recent years the company has earned more abroad than at home. Other countries, less automated, offer more sales opportunities, she said. And as demand in the United States slackened, I.B.M. was stuck with too many employees and a policy of avoiding layoffs. She said that domestic profits have probably rebounded as the company pruned its office staff and sent more sales people into the field.
 
 
Banking's Mixed Quarter
 
Real estate loan troubles have wounded some big New York banks but hardly nicked some strong super-regionals. Citicorp and Chase Manhattan announced lower first-quarter profits last week, citing losses on commercial real estate. J. P. Morgan had lower income from corporate finance but higher net earnings due to an accounting change. Wells Fargo and NCNB, despite heavy real estate loans, improved their earnings. Wells Fargo had the benefit of a healthy California economy; NCNB profited from a major acquisition in Texas.
 
 
Amex's Counterintuition
 
Just as the magazine business staggers and slumps, the American Express Company wants to march in. American Express bought Dallas's D Magazine last week, in a campaign to buy or start magazines in the nation's top 20 markets. The company acquired New York Woman in 1986, L.A. Style in 1988 and Atlanta magazine in 1989. Last year, it started free magazines for college students and small business owners who hold American Express cards. The magazines are more than a contrarian bet. They are a way to take advantage of a data base that might put the United States Census to shame: records on how 34.1 million card holders spend $100 billion a year, and where they work, eat, travel and shop. Magazines, articles and advertising can be targeted with accuracy that other publishers are likely to envy.

Meanwhile, on Wall Street, American Express took a beating. A $915 million loss in the first quarter at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. left the parent company with its worst quarterly results in history, a loss of $619.8 million.
 
 
Merck Medicaid Discounts
 
Merck & Company said last week that it would discount its drugs for state Medicaid programs that serve the poor. The pharmaceutical industry has strongly resisted state and Federal pressure for lower prices.
 
 
Dayton Hudson Takes a Risk
 
Who said the day of the grand department store has passed? Certainly not anyone at the Dayton Hudson Corporation, which announced an agreement on Thursday to pay $1.04 billion for Marshall Field & Company. Most analysts cheered the combination of Dayton Hudson's stores, concentrated around Minneapolis and Detroit, with the similarly upscale Marshall Field stores, based in Chicago. But Dayton Hudson's stock fell $1.625, to $69.125, on Thursday as some traders questioned whether the company was overpaying. Dayton Hudson will have to borrow more, raising its debt-to-equity ratio from 62 to 69 percent - riskier, but still not nearly as perilous as the debts that plunged Robert Campeau's American retailing empire into bankruptcy.

When Good News Is Perhaps Bad
 
Seldom has such a glowing trade report brought so little cheer to financial markets and economists. February's trade deficit, announced on Wednesday, fell to $6.49 billion, the narrowest gap since December 1983. Reduced imports accounted for all the improvement from the $9.32 billion deficit in January, and then some: Exports were actually down. ''It's an encouraging report,'' said Lawrence Chimerine of the WEFA Group. ''But I don't think it means our competitiveness is improving.''
 
 
The Baltic Blockade's Fallout
 
Moscow's economic blockade of Lithuania is likely to cause the Baltic nation to suffer in the short run, it may make the Soviet Union suffer in the longer run. The Kremlin cut off oil supplies and curtailed natural gas last week to force the Lithuanians to rescind their declaration of independence. The republic responded with strict plans to economize. ''They're going to thrive on their martyrdom for a while,'' said Ed A. Hewett, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. But he says that the ''hypermonopolized'' structure of the Soviet economy, with many products made at only one factory, means that stifling Lithuanian industry could deprive the rest of the nation of some foods and consumer goods. In Mr. Hewett's view, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ''clearly applying the hammer to one of his toes.''

Last Chance for Eastern?
 
Labor unions, creditors and Judge Burton R. Lifland have all had it with Frank Lorenzo. On Wednesday, Judge Lifland, a Federal bankruptcy judge, took control of Eastern Airlines from Mr. Lorenzo and gave it to Martin R. Shugrue. As the court's trustee, Mr. Shugrue inherits an airline with striking unions, reluctant passengers and overwhelming losses. To gain the cooperation of employees, Mr. Shugrue can boast that he once belonged to the Air Line Pilots Association, and that he, too, was forced out of a job by Mr. Lorenzo. Mr. Shugrue resigned 14 months ago as president of the Texas Air Corporation, Eastern's parent, where Mr. Lorenzo remains chairman. Now Mr. Shugrue faces pressure from creditors to turn Eastern around. As Thomas Longman, an airline analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company said, ''He's got a window of opportunity of not more than six months.''
 
 
Turning the Tables in Atlanta
 
Just about a century ago, Henry W. Grady, editor of The Atlanta Constitution, came to New York to promote the New South. Ever since, Southerners have come to recruit business and industry from the North. Last Tuesday, the Mayor of New York, David N. Dinkins, ordered grits for breakfast in Atlanta and asked local executives to expand up North. ''We did not come here to take business away from Atlanta,'' he assured them. ''We want your surplus.'' No apologies needed, said Dan Sweat, a past president of the Central Atlanta Progress business association. ''We've been trying to rip off New York all these years,'' he said. ''They might as well try to get some business back.''
 
 
Those Inflatin Jitters
 
Inflation for the first quarter of 1990 was the worst in eight years. A five-tenths of 1 percent rise in consumer prices during March, reported last Tuesday, made the annual inflation rate 8.5 percent for the quarter. The core inflation rate, excluding food and energy, rose even faster last month, by seven-tenths of 1 percent, with higher housing and apparel prices chiefly responsible. ''The C.P.I., on the surface, looked terrible,'' said Richard S. Peterson, chief economist at the Continental Bank Corporation. ''When you went into detail, it looked worse. A sell-off in the credit markets last week was compounded by Friday's report of a unexpectedly high, $53 billon Federal budget deficit for March. The long-term interest rates rose to their highest levels in almost a year. Stocks were stricken as well, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing as 2,695.95, down 55.85 for the week.
 
 
Manhattan's Telephone Hogs
 
The New York state of mind: By 1993, only eight years after grabbing a second area code, New York City will need a third. So said New York Telephone Company officials last week. Of course, New Yorkers are spending more time than ever chatting and faxing, beeping and transmitting, and cellularly speaking. But the real hogs are said to be companies that stockpile lines so they can expand their telephone systems without having to jump into other exchanges. The New York Public Service Commission has the thankless task of deciding how to split Manhattan into two area codes. Who could ever explain to one bunch of status-hungry Manhattanites why they were lumped in with the Bronx while the other side of town got its own code?

Mike Milken And Market Perversity

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
Ah, the perversity of Wall Street.
Take last week, for example. For years, Michael Milken of ''junk bond'' fame has protested his innocence of securities fraud charges leveled against him by Federal prosecutors. But late Friday, he agreed in principle to settle the case by pleading guilty to six felony charges and paying a fine of $600 million, according to people who had been briefed on the talks. (They cautioned, of course, that a last-minute change of heart on either side could not be ruled out.) Then there was the worldwide tumble in oil prices. For consumers, the decline might conjure up visions of lower gas prices and utility bills. Corporations might benefit from cheaper petrochemical supplies, and lower transport bills. Just the tonic for the sluggish economy that Wall Street has worried about for months, right? The market promptly went into a panic over the possibility of rekindled inflation. 
To be fair, it wasn't a totally mindless reaction. On Tuesday, the government reported that the consumer price index for March rose five tenths of 1 percent, the largest quarterly jump in almost eight years.
Some inflation-watchers shrugged off the news. ''Look, there was an inflation scare at the beginning of last year,'' said Edward Yardeni, director of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ''Then things moderated quite a bit the rest of the year. I think the same pattern will play out here.''
Other economists, however, rang the alarm. Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, was downright militant. ''I view the March C.P.I. number as potentially a watershed figure,'' Mr. Roach said. ''We've had a minority view for some time that the risks to the United States economy were shifting away from recession and toward inflation.''
Mr. Roach's view wasn't in the minority for long. As traders sold off the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond in anticipation of higher interest rates, the bond's price tumbled to levels that produced the highest yields since last May. The stock market, which started the week strongly, succumbed to sympathy pains; the Dow Jones industrial average closed the week at 2695.95, down 56.08 points for the week.
The prospect of more expensive credit is not only bad for bonds, it's also a drag for utility stocks, which typically act like bonds in their responses to interest rate trends. When interest rates seem likely to climb, utility stocks fall. Last week, the Dow Jones utilities index hit its lowest point since last July.
And not too long ago, it was a widely accepted truism that the credit markets would be greatly reassured if the trade gap would just narrow a little. Well, last week brought the news that the February trade gap hit its lowest level in more than six years. But the credit markets utterly ignored the news. Analysts have been certain for months that headlines about Mr. Milken's case would be bad news for the junk bond market. The latest news hit after traders had closed their books for the week. But a cynic, looking at recent experience, might be tempted to look for a rally.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
In the first quarter of this year, country funds traded in the United States raised more than $2 billion to invest in stock markets outside the country - a record and almost four times the amount raised in any previous year.
About $1.78 billion, or 87 percent, of the $2.03 billion is for funds investing in Europe, and of that, $810 billion was for three funds investing in West Germany and one in Austria.
The figures for these closed-end mutual funds, which raised money from both Americans and foreigners, are another sign of the quick shift in capital toward Europe that followed the opening of Eastern Europe. This money flow has helped push the West German, Austrian, French and Norwegian markets to new highs and may now give a boost to Spain and Italy, where analysts are pointing their latest recommendations. 
Americans have joined wholeheartedly in this trend of buying abroad and show signs of finally breaking out of their long-term reluctance to buy anywhere but Wall Street.
In 1989, investors from the United States increased their purchases of foreign stocks to a record $13.7 billion, according to the Securities Industry Association. This was three and a half times greater than the previous record in 1985, and the $13.7 billion was more than half of the $25 billion in total foreign stock purchases by Americans in the last 10 years.
''All signs are pointing to the trend continuing,'' said David Strongin, the director of international finance at the S.I.A.
Michael T. Porter, the country fund analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said that in addition to the $2 billion boom in the first quarter, there is a long line of new country funds getting ready to raise more money for investment abroad. As many as 10 new funds have indicated that they want to raise about $828 million.
But because of the first-quarter glut, he is not as sure these funds will do as well. By the time the third new Germany fund this year - the Emerging Germany Fund - began trading at the end of March, the market was overloaded. It fell to $11.625 on its first day and closed Friday at $10.375, below its initial offering price of $12 per share.
The Japanese stock market found a little life last week. And there are signs that the end of the slump could be near, if not precisely at hand.
Even with a sharp 750.74 decline on Monday, Tokyo finished the week up 662.52 points, or 2.13 percent, at 29,835.44, and some Tokyo brokers spoke of a positive mood.
Analysts, who had advised getting out at the beginning of this year, are now saying it is time to get in again. More important, there is a feeling that the yen, whose decline was a major factor in the stock market's 28 percent plunge, may be stabilizing.
Several pieces of data support this view. For one, the figures for the first 10 days of April show that Japanese inflation may be moderating. The report for all of April will be watched closely because it is the first month that does not include the one-time impact of the 3 percent consumption tax the Japanese Government imposed last year.
The preliminary figures for the first ten days of April show overall inflation at 2.6 percent over the previous 12 months, compared with the 12-month increase of 3.9 percent through March. And price increases excluding imports (which have gone up sharply because of the declining yen) have fallen even more, to seven-tenths of 1 percent, from 2.5 percent in March.
In addition, the March report for the Japanese trade surplus indicates that it may be beginning to grow again, another change that would support the yen. In fiscal year 1989, Japan's surplus with its trading partners fell to $47 billion, from $78 billion in 1988.
A third factor is that the Bank of Japan has allowed interest rates to creep up slightly as the new fiscal year began in April while not moving its official discount rate again.
Last week the yen-to-dollar exchange rate weakened to the key 160 level, but then bounced back to fall under 157. It ended the week at 157.45.
Nicholas Sargen, director of international bond market research at Salomon Brothers, said these factors mean a sharper fall of the yen, to the 170 level, which had seemed possible, is now very unlikely. ''There is a more balanced sentiment in the market now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Now It's Red Poling's Turn at Ford

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich.

 BODY:
Red Poling, the Ford Motor Company's new chief executive, keeps a model of a 1948 Jaguar XK-120 on his desk, symbolic of Ford's acquisition of the British car maker this year. No doubt the toy is less a plaything than a reminder of the $2.5 billion paid for Jaguar and the hundreds of millions more Ford must invest to refurbish the ailing company.
The willingness of Ford's top management to pay five times Jaguar's book value was controversial because the investment is unlikely to return a dividend for several years, if at all. With competition in Europe and at home as keen as it has ever been, the world's No. 2 auto maker can ill afford a world-class stumble. But neither can Ford afford a defensive strategy that would attempt merely to shelter its gains. The Jaguar acquisition and other ventures suggest that Ford management - with Mr. Poling at the helm - will be aggressive in protecting the company's prestige and profitability. 
Indeed, Ford's sterling performance in the American market over the last decade, during which it went from near failure to become the strongest of the Big Three auto makers, clearly has raised expectations among investors, analysts and business experts. At a time when much of domestic manufacturing seemed bogged down by bureaucracy, Ford proved that an American company could reinvent itself. Lately, however, its share of the domestic automotive market has slipped, to 23.7 percent for the latest quarter, compared with a 10-year peak of 24.5 percent last year; profit in 1989 was down 27.6 percent from a year earlier. Ford recently put its aerospace and farm equipment units up for sale to help pay for the new engines, transmissions and body styles under development.
 
Matching the Japanese
 Ford's profit and market share problems could be temporary, but they may signal an awakening at the General Motors Corporation, whose Geo franchise has begun to steal Ford's small-car sales, as well as the seemingly unstoppable march of the Japanese auto makers in this country. An issue much larger and more critical than short-term profit, however, is whether Mr. Poling has what it takes to hone and sharpen Ford into the kind of organization that finally can match Japanese quality and productivity.
''I'm convinced we'll get there,'' said Mr. Poling, using as evidence a string of new cars and trucks, like the Ford Explorer four-door utility vehicle. The Explorer is particularly significant since it also will be sold as the Mazda Navajo. It is the first vehicle produced by one of the Big Three that a Japanese auto maker has judged good enough to sell under its name. ''We have plans in place that will enable us to reach the Japanese competition. We're as good as some of the Japanese auto makers already, but not as good as the best,'' which American auto executives universally acknowledge is Toyota.
The only way American auto makers can catch the Japanese, say many experts, is simply to continue to replace and improve vehicle models until they match Japanese quality and productivity. But with capital scarce and the cost of developing a new vehicle from scratch often surpassing a billion dollars, Ford and its rivals will have to find ways to stretch their money.
To do this, Ford has allocated engineering responsibility for new vehicles to different regions of its worldwide organization. Previously, Ford would develop one vehicle for Europe and a separate but similar-sized model for the United States. This policy was necessitated by a host of engineering issues that Ford says have been resolved. Now, Ford's European engineers are designing the replacement for the Tempo/Topaz compacts, a version of which will be sold in Europe as the Sierra; its U.S. engineers are designing a Taurus/Sable replacement, to be sold as the Scorpio in Europe. Japanese engineers working for Mazda, which is 25 percent owned by Ford, did most of the work on the new Escort, which began production in Wayne, Mich., in February and is now in showrooms.
Mr. Poling's biggest challenge, say analysts and other experts, will be coordinating responsibility among the engineers so costs are cut and the new vehicles appear on time. But it is unclear whether successful coordination will address another problem Ford concedes it has: the top Japanese auto makers bring out new models every 3 to 5 years while Ford takes about 10 years.
Another way to reduce capital costs has been the formation of joint ventures. Ford is building Probe sports coupes in partnership with Mazda and will bring out a luxury minivan model with Nissan at a Ford plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, in 1992. As joint ventures proliferate, they may begin to test the limits of antitrust law. G.M. and Chrysler recently announced that they have Justice Department permission to jointly produce four-wheel-drive transmissions. Mr. Poling sees the trend toward joint ventures as a healthy one and declined to rule out a production venture with a Big Three rival.
''The domestic industry has shown it can join together for a joint clean-air study with the petroleum companies,'' said Mr. Poling. Japanese industry has proved that competitors can cooperate to everyone's advantage, he said. ''Why shouldn't we?''
To remain successful, James Womack, research director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's international vehicle project, said, ''Ford must continue to introduce striking products'' like the Taurus. Unveiled in late 1984, the Taurus received much attention because of its unusual styling.
 
High-End Competition
 The decision to buy the established name of Jaguar, however, was an alternative to creating a new high-luxury model Ford needs to compete with Japanese and European models. While Ford's Lincoln luxury cars have been successful, they appeal to older, less affluent buyers than the target audience for Jaguar.
Some auto experts have criticized the Jaguar acquisition, saying that by taking the safer course of buying an established line, Ford loses the chance to stress its strengths as it did with Taurus. Ford risks diluting Jaguar's strong image by interfering and by its promise to boost production, but executives vow they will only aid Jaguar financially, provide some managers and help with suppliers.
With the unexpected promotion of Harold Arthur Poling, 64 years old, to a three-year term as chief executive in November, some conventional wisdom was challenged. At a moment when Ford was facing the need for aggressive spending, it was choosing a man who had earned his reputation as a cost-cutter. Mr. Poling, who was paid $2.1 million in 1989 as vice chairman and chief operating officer, got the top spot when his predecessor, Donald E. Petersen, 63, decided to take early retirement, citing weariness of the job. Some Ford executives believed Mr. Poling, an accountant by training, balanced Mr. Petersen's background as a product engineer. Mr. Petersen tended to give engineers and designers more freedom to spend on new vehicles; Mr. Poling used his experience as a financial controller to set limits.
American auto executives often are categorized as ''product guys,'' engineers like Mr. Petersen and G.M's chairman-elect, Robert Stempel; ''marketing guys,'' like Lee Iacocca, or ''finance guys,'' like G.M.'s outgoing chairman, Roger B. Smith, and Mr. Poling. In the 1950's, corporate power shifted from engineers and entrepreneurs like Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan of G.M. to a coterie of financial executives, epitomized by G.M. chairman Frederic Donner and his acolyte, Mr. Smith.
Numerous Ford officials have tried to head off speculation that Mr. Poling will be little more than a number cruncher by insisting that he understands auto-making from top to bottom. Moreover, they point out, he belongs to a management team that has boosted Ford's capital expenditures to an all-time high.
A growing number of industry experts now wonder whether a chief executive's credentials from early in his career are determinative of future behavior. Moreover, the picture of narrowly focused accountants, engineers and sales executives balancing one another at the top of American auto companies may be outdated. ''Fifteen years ago this might have been an apt way to look at Ford, but top management really has got religion in terms of getting a broader perspective,'' said David Cole, who heads the University of Michigan's center for transportation studies. ''I can assure you Red shares that breadth of view with Don Petersen.''
 
Not a 'Bean Counter'
 David E. Davis, publisher of Automobile magazine, said, ''Red's very soft-spoken affability camouflages a really tough guy. He is constantly described as a bean counter, but a more accurate description would be a tough administrator who really believes in goals, budgets and timetables that must be met.''
Mr. Poling also downplays the importance of his pedigree: ''I've been out of the financial end for more than 15 years. How long do you have to be away from it before you can be considered a general manager?''
A qualification whose importance is beyond dispute is Mr. Poling's cordial rapport with members of the Ford family, said one family member who requested anonymity. The heirs of the late Henry Ford still control ownership of the auto maker through a separate class of stock and were not happy last year when Mr. Petersen resisted promoting William C. Ford Jr. and Edsel Ford to important committees of the board of directors. (Mr. Petersen subsequently relented.) Mr. Poling graduated from Monmouth (Ill.) College and Indiana University, where he earned a master's degree in accounting. He took a job in Ford's steel division as a trainee in 1951. After a number of financial management jobs, he caught the eye of J. Edward Lundy, Ford's legendary chief financial officer. Mr. Lundy recommended him as vice president of finance for Ford's European subsidiary. ''Henry Ford II believed all top managers needed to get tuned in Europe,'' said Mr. Davis, noting that a tough but quiet demeanor was what pleased Mr. Ford.
Based in Great Britain, Mr. Poling rose to president and then, in 1977, chairman of Ford of Europe. Already an excellent golfer, Mr. Poling took advantage of a court on the roof of Ford headquarters to learn squash. ''He's very competitive by instinct,'' said Paul Tippett, the former chairman of the American Motors Corporation who worked with Mr. Poling at Ford's European subsidiary and once required five stitches to close a gash on his face caused by Mr. Poling's errant squash racquet.
 
A Stubborn Streak
 Unlike some corporate chieftains, Mr. Poling maintains a calm exterior. But that covers a stubborn and tenacious streak, say his colleagues. ''If you say you're going to reach a certain level of sales or hit a certain target, Red expects you to do it,'' said a senior Ford official.
As Mr. Poling put it: ''If you set objectives, they should be met.''
On weekends, Mr. Poling brings his 8-stroke handicap to Bloomfield Hills Country Club, a bastion of Big Three auto executives, where he plays with friends and his wife, Marian, whom he met at Ford's steel division. His red hair, now close-cropped and flecked with gray, gave him his childhood nickname. Only his siblings still call him Harold, he said.
In 1979 Ford brought Mr. Poling back to America to become executive vice president and he was elected a director. In 1980 he took over as head of North American automotive operations and was faced with too much plant capacity and too few sales.
''Our products were not being well received,'' recalled Philip Caldwell, a senior managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton and former Ford chairman. ''The decision was not being made to cut capacity, and the consequences of this inaction were becoming critical, so I sent Red.'' Although the decision would severely hurt profits, Mr. Poling recommended that production capacity be closed.
''Those days are indelibly seared in my mind,'' said Mr. Poling, referring to layoffs and cutbacks. ''I run scared because I don't ever want that to happen again.''
With Mr. Petersen, Mr. Caldwell and other top executives, Mr. Poling was in the vanguard of Ford's push to change its corporate culture in the early 80's. Ford had a typical business autocracy: more often than not, one listened to the boss to discover what to think. The recession of 1980, competition and regulatory costs had driven Ford into perilous financial condition. As head of North American automotive operations, Mr. Poling was influential in supporting an openminded approach to new ideas. The consensus technique had been used successfully by Japanese rivals.
''Early in my career I felt the company was too militaristic and authoritarian,'' Mr. Poling said. ''All my life I believed it was important to get people involved.''
At the same time, slavishly copying Japanese workplace customs is not appropriate either, he said. ''Mazda managers couldn't understand why American workers insisted on taking their vacations'' when Mazda was scurrying to complete its assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich. ''I can understand it. You have to learn the most efficient way to tackle a problem, and I think the Japanese are learning from us in some areas.''
 
THE CRITICAL EUROPEAN CONNECTION
With seven years at the Ford of Europe headquarters near London, Red Poling comes to the top position with more firsthand international experience than any prior Ford chief executive, a reflection of the immense - and growing - importance of Ford's overseas markets, particularly in Europe.
Profit from European operations accounted for 34 percent of Ford's $3.8 billion net income in 1989; Ford sold about a third of its 6.4 million vehicles in Europe. With the planned reduction of European trade barriers in 1992 and the expected growth in Eastern Europe, Ford executives are predicting that Europe soon could surpass North America as the biggest automotive market.
The Jaguar acquisition holds potential for both markets, Ford executives say, even though Jaguar cars will not be sold in the same large volumes as other Ford models.
At $40,000 and up, Jaguar is an expensive, virtually hand-built luxury car. Its well-known brand name has long had a reputation for traditional elegance, but the car has been known for mediocre quality. Profit had slipped in recent years, limiting capital for development of new models.
William Hayden, a veteran Ford of Europe manufacturing executive who replaced Sir John Egan as Jaguar's chief executive, has said he wants to boost the company's production capacity to 200,000 cars annually within 15 years, up from the current 50,000. This could mean a new assembly plant. Ford will introduce its manufacturing methods and try to use its clout with suppliers to increase quality, productivity and reliability. Ford already has discovered that Jaguar was paying 38 pounds sterling for a set of door handles that it can buy for 4 pounds.
 
FINANCIAL SERVICES, TOO
Though the name Ford instantly denotes the business of cars and trucks, the company also is a rapidly growing player in financial services with $115 billion in assets. In this country, only Citicorp, American Express and Salomon Brothers are larger financial services companies.
Last year Ford bought the Associates, the nation's third-largest finance company, for $3.4 billion, to add to its Ford Motor Credit car financing unit, First Nationwide Financial Corporation savings and loan unit and U.S. Leasing International unit. Ford has disclosed that it is negotiating to buy Marine Midland Bank's automotive lending business.
Profit from financial services was down 4 percent in 1989, providing 17 percent of Ford's total earnings for the year as the group felt the effects of lower net interest margins, increased loan losses and unfavorable exchange rates. Ford executives hope financial services eventually will provide a third of the corporation's profit.
Ford Motor Land and Development owns a number of real estate properties and is developing one that is of special interest to Mr. Poling: a golf club adjacent to Ford headquarters in Dearborn that will host a PGA Seniors golf tournament next year.
The company last year fullfilled a longstanding desire to dispose of Rouge Steel for an undisclosed price; but Ford suffered a $424.3 million net loss on the transaction. Ford will will own 20 percent of the surviving company, which was bought by the Marico Acquisition Corporation.

Earth Day Isn't Getting Any Easier

 BODY:
The 20th anniversary of Earth Day is being marked around the world. Here are four views on its significance.
 
Peter D. Moore
Mr. Moore is managing partner in Inferential Focus, a market research and forecasting firm in New York.
On the surface, Earth Day is about clean air, clean water and a safer environment. But underneath, the motivation for this effort comes from a fundamental shift in society's values from short-term, leveraged exploitation to long-term control and protection. This shift is driven by people who have been disillusioned by the ineffectiveness of big government and big business in dealing with the problems confronting society. Their new mood is evidenced by a desire for participation, not delegation, effective action, not talk, and a willingness to accept responsibility for what is happening to our environment now. 
This new mood recently energized Harlem residents, led by local clergy, to paint over billboards with messages they felt exploited the youth in their community. Again it was seen in Tacoma, Wash., where a judge refused to accept a settlement between the city and the Pennwalt Corporation over a 75,000-gallon chemical leak into Puget Sound until the chief executive himself appeared in court. The judge said: ''I think the public is entitled to know who is responsible.''
Environmentalists have been active ever since Earth Day 1970, but only recently has their message gained popular momentum. They have not changed; the listeners have changed, and the listeners' new perspective gives shape to the new ''environment'' in which business and political leaders must act.
 
Edward L. Hennessy
Mr. Hennessy is chairman of Allied-Signal.
America's environment has improved markedly in the 20 years since the first Earth Day. Spurred by the growth in environmental concerns during the 1970's, government and industry made major strides in improving air and water quality, controlling hazardous wastes and addressing the most visible ecological abuses.
Still, many environmental problems remain unsolved. And we face new, more pervasive concerns. The connection between ozone depletion and chlorofluorocarbons, for example, was not discovered until 1974, and the thinning of the ozone layer over the Antarctic was not observed until 1985. Allied-Signal Inc. and other CFC manufacturers have responded by phasing out CFC's and by spending hundreds of millions on research and development of safe substitutes. In the next 20 years, however, we must do more than just respond to clear and present dangers. We must create a generation of environmentally knowledgeable leaders who understand that all of our actions have environmental consequences.
How can we do this? Tufts University has taken an innovative first step. Financed by Allied-Signal, the Tufts Environmental Literacy Institute will help faculties across the country integrate environmental issues into courses ranging from the liberal arts to engineering science.
Equipped with a broader understanding of environmental problems, our future leaders will be better prepared to strike a balance between preserving the earth's resources and extending the benefits of new technology to the world.
 
Julian Simon
Mr. Simon is professor of business administration at the University of Maryland and author of ''The Economic Consequences of Immigration.''
Earth Day is a costly fraud and not a trivial one at that. All these doomsayers are wasting a terrible amount of our resources and it is very bad for everyone's morale. Young people are being told that they cannot flex their muscles, that they cannot do great things because it might hurt someone else.
But the scientific data compiled by the government show that the quality of the environment has been steadily improving. The air is more breathable, the water more drinkable, and we don't have the scarcities doomsayers predicted.
There are many biologists who say that social scientists like myself just do not understand science. But the fact is these scientists ignore all of the evidence of history that says that things are getting better. They ignore the fact that there is more abundance, less starvation and that people are living longer. But when these scientists are confronted with these facts, they say this time the future will be different and things will get worse.
Some environmentalists say affluence causes the deterioration of the environment. And, while it is true that very poor people do not produce much trash, affluence is what cleans up the environment. This is true in part because the affluent can afford better services, but also because waste and pollution present opportunities. Economists like myself think that the economic system is responsive: every shortage is an opportunity for someone to fill a need.
 
Lester R. Brown
Mr. Brown is president of Worldwatch Institute, an environmental policy and research group.
Each year in our ''State of the World'' report we - in effect - give the earth an annual physical. The results are not reassuring. Each year the earth's forests shrink, the deserts expand, cropland loses precious topsoil and the protective ozone layer thins. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues to rise and the number of plant and animal species diminishes.
The challenge facing humanity in the 90's is to reverse the environmental degradation of the planet before it leads to economic decline of the sort seen in parts of Africa. Meeting this challenge requires more than fine-tuning; it will take a fundamental restructuring of the global economy.
Stabilizing climate means phasing out fossil fuels, replacing them with renewable sources of energy like hydropower, geothermal generating plants, solar-thermal power plants, wind-electric turbines and photovoltaic cells. It means designing a transport system that will be powered largely by solar-generated electricity, and perhaps hydrogen fuel, rather than gasoline. It means replacing garbage collection with recycling industries. Most of all, it requires greatly increased efficiency.
Enterprising corporations will look at the blueprint of an environmentally sustainable global economy and design a corporate plan that helps make it a reality. Some farsighted corporations will move rapidly and capitalize on the new needs. Others will resist change and lose out. Corporate environmentalism is more than good public relations. It is a matter of economic survival.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
WHY MEXICO NEEDS A FREE TRADE PACT

BYLINE: By SIDNEY WEINTRAUB; Sidney Weintraub, distinguished visiting scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, is author of ''A Marriage of Convenience: Relations Between Mexico and the United States.''

 BODY:
During the 1980's, Mexico embarked upon what can properly be called its second revolution. This revolution, which relies upon exports for economic growth, recognizes that the majority of Mexico's trade is with the United States and that this trade is in what are called intermediate goods - the engine and not necessarily the automobile, semi-conductors and not always computers. This trade takes place largely within the same industry, even within the same company, between a parent and an affiliate. Partly because of this trade, Mexico has relaxed restrictions on foreign direct investment.. The two countries are thus suppliers to each other's production facilities, with around 90 percent of Mexico's exports of manufactured goods going to the United States. 
The question arises of whether this mutual industrial reliance is healthy, particularly for Mexico. It makes Mexico vulnerable to an American economic downturn or to American protectionism. With respect to the latter, Mexico has one assurance against widespread American import restrictions: the close alliances that now exist between large companies operating in both countries. Mexican concerns over excessive reliance on the United States market can be dissipated only as Mexican industry increases its competitiveness.
The logical next question is whether this integration is best secured by a more formal agreement between the two countries. Mexican leaders have decided that it is and they have suggested starting the process for free-trade negotiations. Canada also made the decision to enter into a free-trade agreement with the United States to more thoroughly secure access to the American market. By allocating production for a vastly larger combined market, Canada is able to increase its industrial productivity and, thereby, its global competitive position.
The decision to enter into a free-trade agreement with the United States was controversial in Canada out of concern for its national political and cultural identity. It will be sensitive in Mexico as well, out of fear of the loss of national sovereignty. However, if Mexico is to become a developed country, it will have to compete on first-world terms. Mexico cannot do that based on the size of its domestic market alone. That is the logic behind Mexico's suggestion that negotiations for a free- trade agreement begin.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania's Message to Investors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is indeed ironic that just as so many socialist and Communist nations are taking bold steps toward a capitalist economy, the Pennsylvania Legislature has seen fit to pass a law that can only be seen as socialist in its primary thrust (''A Paradoxical Anti-takeover Law,'' April 8). While this law does not actually remove private capital from the hands of investors, it makes the status of that ownership nominal at best, removing the last vestiges of any influence or control shareholders have had over the people actually running the firms they own. Moreover, it clearly allows boards of directors to favor the interests of ''stakeholders'' - like employees or communities - over those of stockholders.
Much of this was done in the name of encouraging stability. Yet free-enterprise capitalism has never been and never will be ''stable.'' Indeed, it is Joseph Schumpeter's ''creative destruction'' that typifies the very heart of capitalism and which has provided, over all, its generous bounty. We might all ponder what those seeking ''stability'' might have wrought had they thwarted the advent of the automobile 90 years ago, in the name of protecting the horse, buggy and harness industries from economic disruption and job losses.
Pennsylvania has sent a very clear message to investors, whose only logical response is to avoid the securities of Pennsylvania-based corporations, perhaps their products and services too.

HEADLINE: TOUGH CALL;
Why the U.S. Has a Case of The Mumbles On Lithuania

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE situation in Lithuania has become a test of whether the cold war is really over. The way President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev handle the explosive questions raised by Lithuania's drive for independence will demonstrate whether they are truly willing to treat one another more as allies than adversaries.
Consider a few of the delicate issues posed by the evolving situation in Lithuania, where the Kremlin has expanded its economic embargo even as officials in Moscow and Vilnius are making conciliatory noises.
* Mr. Gorbachev has already proven to the United States that he is not Stalin. But for Washington to go on expanding relations with him, must he now prove that he is Woodrow Wilson and immediately set Lithuania free? 
* Mr. Gorbachev lives in a tough neighborhood - a teeming multi-ethnic empire bursting with conservatives and rabid nationalists. But does that mean the United States should tolerate his doing nasty things in the short run, so he will do kinder things in the long run?
* If the United States never actively insisted that Brezhnev or Khrushchev set Lithuania free, should it now punish Mr. Gorbachev for not doing so on the terms Lithuanians want - particularly when it was precisely his reforms that made the Lithuanian independence movement possible?
 
Caution and Anger
The Bush Administration initially confronted these questions by urging both sides to enter into a peaceful dialogue. But as events in Lithuania have deteriorated, the Administration, while doing its best to postpone taking any action, has grown privately angry with both parties. While they would not say so publicly, officials believe that the Lithuanians have behaved foolishly by simply declaring their independence in defiance of Moscow without any tactical plan as to how to achieve it. It is not enough for small, weak states to be right; they also have to be smart.
At heart, there is much more sympathy in the Administration for Mr. Gorbachev and his dilemma than there is for the Lithuanians' demand for immediate independence. The democratic reforms Mr. Gorbachev has initiated, and the arms control agreements he is prepared to enter into, could better the lives of millions of Americans and Russians. If, to preserve that process, three million Lithuanians might have to delay independence a few years, then, American officials say privately, so be it.
 
Making an Example
At the same time, Administration officials are beginning to fear that Mr. Gorbachev may have decided to make such an example of Lithuania - so no other Soviet republic would even think about secession - that he will exceed what the White House considers tolerable levels of pressure. If Mr. Gorbachev goes too far - and ''we will know it when we see it,'' said one Administration official - the United States will punish him by reducing some trade or commercial ties that benefit him much more than Washington. But the White House, under the guise of consulting with the allies, is trying to postpone even that moment of reckoning as long as it can. Barring a massacre, the United States does not intend to allow Lithuania to upset arms control negotiations or other mutually advantageous aspects of the relationship.
While this is the policy, one would hardly know it from Administration public statements. On the subject of Lithuania, President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have engaged in the diplomatic equivalent of mumbling. After Mr. Baker last week delivered, in testimony to Congress, the most explicit statement yet by the Administration on its Lithuania policy, Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas, remarked to him: ''I join with my colleagues in commending you for a good statement. At the same time, Mr. Secretary, I've tried to read through it hurriedly, and I've listened to you, and I keep asking myself 'Now what did he say?' ''
To some extent this mumbling is deliberate. By keeping its red lines vague, the White House hopes to maintain maximum flexibility and maximum deterrence by constantly forcing Mr. Gorbachev to wonder whether the next move will be the one that goes too far. At the same time, the Bush team is also speaking in muted voices because it is afraid of criticism from the Republican right. Or, as Richard N. Perle, a former senior Pentagon official in the Reagan Administration, put it: ''Were it not for the Republican right, what we would be seeing in Lithuania today is an unvarnished American sellout rather than a glossed-over one.'' But to a great extent the Administration's mumbling on Lithuania is part of an oft-repeated pattern - an inability to articulate its foreign policy so that the average American can understand and identify with it.
The situation in Lithuania is a wake-up call saying that change in the Soviet Union is going to be a long, bumpy, nasty, occasionally violent process that will not be supervised by Mother Teresa. At every bump in the road the Administration is going to find its policies toward the Soviet Union challenged by voices from the right, left and center. Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker seem to believe that by saying little they will maximize their room to maneuver. But perhaps only by stating frankly the competing considerations in Lithuania will the Administration build the confidence with the public and Congress that allows real maneuverability.
Michael J. Sandel, a Harvard University political theorist, said: ''I don't see why they can't say in simple language: 'Frankly, we are confronted here with a dilemma between our committment to the principle of national self-determination on one hand and our fervent desire that Gorbachev succeed in bringing political and economic reform to the Soviet Union as a whole on the other. Therefore our interests in his political survival and success have to temper, but not extinquish, our support for Lithuanian independence.' ''
By not clearly articulating the competing principles at stake and acknowledging the tension between them, said Mr. Sandel, the Administration fails to do justice to either and runs the risk that both principles will eventually become blurred or distorted in the public's mind.
Such are the challenges posed by Lithuania. Mr. Bush's and Mr. Gorbachev's ability to meet them in creative ways, argued Michael Mandelbaum, an expert on East-West relations at the Council on Foreign Relations, will determine whether Lithuania ''is the latest cold war crisis or the first post-cold war crisis.'' He added, ''If it is just another cold war crisis, then what Gorbachev has done would demand harsh condemnation and a halt to real progress in the relationship.''
If it is a post-cold war crisis, he said, ''then it is just a bump in a road in which the United States gives Gorbachev some leeway and Gorbachev eventually strikes a deal with Lithuania that allows him to save face, but gives the Lithuanians the promise of fulfilling all or most of their aspirations in the long run.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
States Are Finding Pension Funds Can Be a Bonanza Hard to Resist

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
LEGISLATORS here and in other state capitals use words like ''adjustment'' or ''revision'' when they change the formula that determines how much money will be set aside for state workers' retirement. But in virtually all cases in recent years, these changes have gone in one direction, decreasing the amount the states paid to the funds. Now, the people whose pensions are at stake are starting to use other words, like ''robbery'' and ''raiding,'' to describe the changes.
In New York, the latest skirmish over pension funds is being fought between State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the trustee of the state pension system, and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and leaders of the Legislature, who are still struggling - three weeks after the legal deadline - to reach agreement on a new state budget. 
The Governor and legislative leaders, contending that the state pension system has more than enough assets to meet projected obligations, are proposing what would be the second major reduction in two years in the state's contribution to the funds.
 
Saving $200 Million
The Comptroller is resisting, maintaining that another round of cuts on top of the $325 million reduction he reluctantly agreed to last year could eventually threaten the state's ability to honor its obligations to all its pensioners. The changes sought this year would save the state at least $200 million more.
With so many states under such severe pressure to balance their budgets, there is no mystery in why politicians find the pension funds, which are worth more than $700 billion nationally, such attractive targets. Reducing the amount a state gives to the funds is likely to generate less protest from the voters than raising taxes.
Moreover, the basic question that surrounds such reductions - do they threaten the long-term stability of the pension funds? - is literally as difficult to answer as it is to predict the course of the stock market. Even those most alarmed by the cuts concede that any problems may not become obvious for a decade or more. Then, they say, lawmakers will be forced to impose new taxes to restore the pension funds to a sound footing, or simply find ways to reduce the pensioners' benefits.
 
'This Is Robbery'
''This is robbery, pure and simple,'' said Joe McDermott, president of New York State's Civil Service Employees Association, which represents about 260,000 current and former public employees. ''They're using the pension funds as a piggy bank that they can turn over and shake when they get into a jam.''
Nearly two-thirds of the states have taken steps in the last five years to ease their short-term budget problems by reducing the amount of money they set aside for pensions, state fiscal experts say.
The most common method is to simply change what is known as the ''interest rate assumption,'' or the rate of return that a state supposes a retirement fund will earn on its investments, said Cathie G. Eitelberg, chief pension lobbyist for the Government Finance Officers Association, a Washington-based group of state and local finance officials. The higher a projected rate of return, the less a state will have to pay to insure that the fund can meet the fixed costs of its pensioners, she said.
Last year Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Mr. Regan, a Republican, negotiated a change in the assumed rate of return for the state pension system, which controls $45 billion in pension funds for 850,000 current and retired public employees, from 8 percent annually to 8.75 percent. That, combined with a downward revision of the expected inflation rate, enabled the state to reduce its pension payments by $325 million.
But the problem with such projections, some experts say, is that no one knows how accurate they will prove to be. The difficulty in forecasting is illustrated by the wild swings in the rate of return that the New York system, known as the Common Retirement Fund, has actually received in recent years. For 1988 it was 13.9 percent, but for 1987, the year the stock market collapsed, it was just 1.6 percent. Back in 1982, the fund reaped a 21.4 percent return; the year before, it was 3.4 percent, according to the Comptroller's office. Much of the fund is invested in stocks so the return is measured by the market value of the stocks at a given moment.
Over the last 10 years, the total return by the New York fund has averaged about 12 percent annually, a figure that would indicate that even the changes made last year were well within the bound of prudence. But the national average for such funds over the last 30 years is only about 5 percent, said Ms. Eitelberg of the finance officers association.
This year Mr. Cuomo is advocating another change in accounting methods under which the annual state contribution to meet the ultimate projected cost of a worker's pension, rather than remaining constant as it is now, would gradually increase as the worker grows older and his salary increases. The immediate effect would be to lower the state's required payments by at least $200 million by most estimates. Critics say the state would be forced to raise contributions in later years.
Any change would have to be approved by the Legislature. The Governor contends that the pensions are so overfunded that the shift would be harmless. The state has, in the words of Gary G. Fryer, the Governor's spokesman, ''a Rolls-Royce pension system and a Chevy budget.'' But groups representing public employees describe the proposed revision as a dangerous step that will haunt somebody - either the employees or all taxpayers - later on. This change ''simply puts off today's payment until tomorrow,'' said Mr. McDermott. ''When tomorrow comes, it will create a crisis for state and local governments.''

HEADLINE: A Monumental Day

 BODY:
On Earth Day 1970, Americans rose up against what they had done to foul the environment. That wave of dismay drove Congress to decree a substantial cleanup of air and water. Twenty years later, on Earth Day 1990, public concern about the environment is again at a peak. And this time the wave washes far beyond American shores. Whether the issue is global warming or ozone depletion, what happens in Eastern Europe or China matters as much as what happens here. 
If, for example, global warming is confirmed, global burning of coal, oil and wood must be sharply reduced. That will be hard for America, traumatic for developing countries. Yet the lesson of the last 20 years is that even the most painful readjustments can be made.
Cars rolling off Detroit's assembly lines emit 96 percent less carbon dioxide and 75 percent less nitrogen oxides than those of 1970. The Great Lakes have been restored to life and the Hudson now teems with fish. Congress has raised $6 billion to help clean abandoned toxic waste dumps, and $60 billion for building sewage treatment plants. And it's about to rewrite the Clean Air Act, finally tackling the divisive issue of acid rain.
Some countries cannot afford such expensive solutions. But global threats like ozone-layer depletion and climate change knit all predicaments together. At some point, each country's waste becomes the world's business, whether it be America's profligate use of energy, Brazil's wanton destruction of forests or the miserable pall of Stalinist filth that blights Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
The ruination of nature now apparent in East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia shows what environmental indifference can do. Communist central planners faced no public pressure to heed the consequences of pollution. Unchecked, heavy industry spewed poisons into air and water.
The results were disastrous. Half of Poland's rivers are now too toxic even for industrial use. Acidic industrial fallout has eaten away the faces of Cracow's medieval statues. In Katowice, poisonous gases and toxic dust are so severe that people sleep in salt mines just to breathe clean air.
And even though East bloc governments have long suppressed health statistics, their savage disregard of the environment seems certain to have taken a heavy toll.
 
The contrast between West and
East makes clear the value of relentless pressure from environmentalists in the U.S., including the organizers of Earth Days past and present.
At times, their acknowledgment of past accomplishments seems grudging, their warning of future perils excessive, their exhortations to change life styles intrusive. Commute by bus, they cry; don't use disposable diapers, and be sure to separate recyclable materials in the garbage.
Those are not trivial ways to raise consciousness. But what will count most are economic incentives to save energy and curb pollution, research into new energy-saving technologies, and a reasoned effort to set priorities among threats of widely different risk.
An America humming on solar cells and wind turbines . . . A Brazil that has at last achieved sanctuary for its irreplaceable rain forests . . . An Eastern Europe on the way to restoring its environment along with its freedoms: these are fitting goals for today's outpouring of concern and tomorrow's work.

To the Editor:
It's in America's interest - and that of our Western allies - to help the ravaged economies of Eastern Europe shift from socialism to capitalism. But pouring in billions of dollars in financial aid won't solve East Europe's economic crises (''Rethinking Foreign Aid,'' editorial, April 9). New loans and credits will only add to their staggering debt burdens. 
History suggests that incentive-based policies, not foreign aid, are the source of economic growth and rising living standards. The low-tax, free-market economies of South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong have enjoyed economic success without development aid. In contrast, massive loans to Mexico, Brazil and Argentina have subsidized economic failure.
The proposed Eastern European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is no way to help East Europe.
I don't think we should be part of an effort to subsidize Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Let him pay for perestroika himself by cutting the one-fifth of Soviet gross national product that goes to his military. Also, this bank will be dominated by Western Europeans who favor quasi-socialist economic policy emphasizing central planning - the opposite of the economic system East Europe needs.
The United States should recall the proud heritage of the Marshall Plan. We provided the pro-capitalist leadership that rebuilt Europe after the nightmare of Nazi Germany; let us show the same leadership in rescuing East Europe from the nightmare of socialist economics. Here are measures we can take to lead East Europe down the road to prosperity:
* Encourage private investment. We should reform and simplify foreign tax laws that burden United States business investments abroad. We could issue bonds to private Americans of East European descent to finance small business start-ups in East Europe.
* Expand opportunities for United States exporters. We have to reform our export control restrictions for East Europe and overhaul our outdated licensing process. The United States should also grant most favored nation status to Eastern European countries to expand overseas trade.
* Support institutions and organizations essential to a free market economy. United States financial aid should go to private-sector enterprises in which residuals are owned by individuals, not government. Public-sector loans must be conditioned on progress in market-oriented reforms, like securing private property rights and deregulating the economy.
Individual Americans have a big role to play. John Malcheski and Daman Szymanski, Wisconsin farmers who are part of an overseas volunteer assistance group, recently told me that Polish farmers are in desperate need of technical and managerial assistance in running a dairy farm -how to dig a modern well, how to meet a payroll, how to introduce incentives into their farm economy.
During Vaclav Havel's recent visit to the West, the Czechoslovak President said, ''we value your advice and moral support far more than your money.'' This is the kind of help the Eastern Europeans need - old-fashioned Yankee know-how, not an endlessly flowing fountain of foreign aid.

The New Horsemen

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Rethinking Foreign Aid'' (editorial, April 9) is on target in calling for revitalization of United States development assistance policies in the face of radically changed international circumstances. But the alternative you suggest is only half a program.
The principal rationale you put forth for new development assistance initiatives is promoting America's own economic well-being and political security. That's undeniably important, but it is an incomplete justification that would lead to a seriously deficient program. 
The Four Horsemen of the modern age have been the ascendancy of militarism and the vast armadas it has spawned; the authoritarian suppression of human rights; the widespread poverty and hunger afflicting one-fifth of humanity, and the unrelenting assault on the environment and the natural systems. Here, on the cusp of the 1990's, as the cold war seems winding down and democracy rising, America should commit itself to encouraging these geopolitical developments and to starting a new era of action against world poverty and environmental deterioration, with particular focus on helping those who need it most.
In the developing world, the foremost challenges are mass poverty and environmental decay, with excessive population growth contributing to each. The United States should make these the primary focus for cooperation and assistance in the third world. Our goal should be to promote sustainable, nondestructive livelihoods for the rural and urban poor. And to promote environmental protection that conserves the resource base for long-term production; protects public health, and establishes a sound basis for international environmental cooperation. None of the great environmental challenges of the 1990's - global warming, ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, soil and water deterioration - can be met without increasing North-South cooperation.
Americans have shown they want this country to stand for more than short-term political and economic self-interest. The time is ripe for a new United States mission internationally, one based on the concept of cooperative action to sustain the earth and its people.

To the Editor:
We at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation couldn't agree more with ''Rethinking Foreign Aid'' (editorial, April 9). But we would like to point out that the Bush Administration has been putting some of your recommendations into action. 
I refer specifically to your point ''to attract private capital into risky new marketplaces, investment insurance, loan guarantees and preferential credit programs need to be enlarged.'' The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is a self-sustaining Government agency designed to accomplish exactly what you advocate.
President Bush announced last year that the United States would extend OPIC programs to Poland and Hungary, and this year the Administration proposed legislation to authorize our programs in the rest of Eastern Europe. The services are producing investment in more than 100 countries, including Eastern Europe and Central America, but unfortunately, our agency remains obscure.
Thanks to growing recognition of a global investment strategy as the best way for the United States to meet economic challenges in a changing world, OPIC won't be obscure much longer. In this fiscal year, some 100 United States corporations have registered for our investment insurance or loan guarantees for Eastern Europe. These ventures represent potential investments of almost $2 billion.

HEADLINE: FUTURE TRADING: DOES CHICAGO RUN WALL STREET?

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle; Louis Uchitelle covers economics for The New York Times.

 BODY:
AS IF FRANTICALLY TRYING TO PLACE A BET ON THE outcome of a cockfight, Thomas M. Hunter Jr. signals wildly with his hands and arms from the top tier of a small amphitheater at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He is 40 years old, a husky, bearded 6-footer. His nickname, Turk, abbreviated for identification purposes to TRK, is emblazoned on a button on his lapel, and the gold bracelets he wears career on his wrist as he waves.
Turk is betting big at the moment, but not on battling roosters or some thrilling miniature chariot race taking place in the central pit of this strange arena. The action that so excites Turk and the other gamblers jammed onto the arena's octagonal tiers is far away, at the New York Stock Exchange, where the shares of American corporations are bought and sold. Turk and his colleagues, participants in the ritual known as futures trading, are, in essence, wagering on whether the prices of these shares will rise or fall. 
On this particular morning, Feb. 12, Lincoln's Birthday, Turk is betting that stock prices will fall. More precisely, he is acting as agent for a big Wall Street firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton, which is gambling on a sell-off. Rumors are circulating that a major brokerage house, the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., is about to declare bankruptcy (it will, the next day), and Shearson figures the rumors will drive down stock prices for a while.
Acting on this hunch, Shearson has enlisted Turk to place its bets, which he does in the grand style of the Chicago futures trader. Signaling his wager, and screaming it out at the same time, Turk bangs three fingers against his forehead. Each finger represents 10 betting tickets. Quickly, he pumps his arms forward, palms out. And others on the tiers scream back, waggle a finger or two and pull their outstretched arms toward them, palms inward. Each is taking a part of Turk's bet.
Over the next 15 minutes, Turk repeats the signals and slowly builds up the bets for Shearson to nearly $69 million worth of stock. Technically, he is selling ''futures contracts,'' but each contract is in fact a wager that the stocks named in the contract will fall in price. If they do, then Shearson is entitled to collect the amount of the fall.
As the betting mounts in Chicago, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the great gauge of American stock prices, plunges 10 points in just minutes in New York and keeps falling. Within an hour the Dow is down 26 points; then it levels off and begins to rise as Turk and other gamblers perched on the arena's tiers begin to cash in their bets and end their wager. Before lunch, Shearson is ahead more than $200,000.
Clearly, the gambling on stock prices in Chicago, a practice that began only eight years ago, has become intertwined with the trading of real stocks in New York, a relationship that many link with a new, dangerous age on Wall Street. After the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, few people believed that so shattering an event, with the Dow Jones average falling 508 points, could recur more than once in a lifetime. Only now, in the aftermath of last Oct. 13, when the Dow fell 190 points in just 90 minutes, is there finally open acknowledgement that a nightmarish trait has crept into the American system for trading stocks: the periodic, unheralded, panicky one-day crash. Many efforts are being made to identify the reasons for these crashes. The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing a soon-to-be-released account of exactly what happened on Oct. 13. The New York Stock Exchange has appointed a blue-ribbon panel, headed by Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors, to pinpoint causes and recommend remedies. The Bush Administration has a high-level panel reviewing all the data and reporting to Congress.
But in all the discussions, one theme stands out. Nearly every expert places some blame on futures trading in stocks. And nearly everyone agrees that when the Dow Jones average is declining for other reasons - for example, a Government report that unemployment has risen - then the gambling in Chicago can, without warning, accelerate a bad day on Wall Street into a disaster. Richard Ketchum, the director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a succinct description of the role of futures trading. ''Why hold stocks,'' he says, ''if the futures market tells you that prices are going down?''
WHATEVER THE CAUSES OF THE NEW ONE-DAY CRASHES, the transformation from an earlier time is striking. Since the late 1930's, few events have triggered the sort of decline that occurred last Oct. 13, when the Dow average lost 6.9 percent of its value. The German advance across Europe and the fall of France and Holland produced two such days in May 1940, with the Dow falling by 6.8 percent each time. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's heart attack on Sept. 26, 1955, made the Dow go down 6.5 percent. But on no other day - not the Monday after Pearl Harbor nor the day President John F. Kennedy was shot - did the Dow average's loss even crack 6 percent. When sharp sell-offs did come, as in the early 1960's and mid-70's, they were drawn out over days or weeks.
Then the one-day sell-offs began to appear, each one reducing the Dow average by roughly 7 percent - not so shattering as the Great Crashes of Oct. 29, 1929 (a 12.8 percent drop) and Oct. 19, 1987 (22.6 percent), but very severe by post-Depression standards. Each became an unnerving event for an American public accustomed to a more predictable stock market. The first episode, on Oct. 26, 1987, was written off as an aftershock from the devastating crash that had occurred just seven days before. The next one, on Jan. 8, 1988, was harder to explain, coming as it did out of nowhere on a snowy, uneventful Friday, at the end of a week in which stock prices had been rising briskly. Much of the 6.9 percent decline in the Dow average that day was in the final hour or so of trading, and it was out of all proportion to the events of the day. The only major news, in fact, was bullish. The Federal Government said the unemployment rate had declined in the previous month, the sort of report that often makes stock prices rise. Similarly, in the view of the S.E.C.'s Ketchum, the news that preceded the late-afternoon minicrash last Oct. 13 would not, in another age, have triggered such a plunge. A group trying to buy United Airlines announced that it could not get bank loans for the deal. Speculators in United's stock and in the stocks of other takeover targets got worried and began to sell. But these ''small, aggressive'' traders who rushed to sell were only a handful of people, Ketchum says. Their selling, by itself, should not have precipitated the panic that ensued. And that is where suspicion of futures trading comes in.
TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE FUTURES market in a minicrash, one needs first to know a little about the evolution on Wall Street in the 1980's. The New York Stock Exchange remains the premier marketplace for the trading of shares in American corporations. These shares now have a value of $3.5 trillion, and three-quarters of this value is in stocks listed on the exchange at 11 Wall Street. What happens in its trading rooms sets the price levels of American stocks wherever they are traded, and influences stock markets throughout the world. But in the last decade, several new forces have transformed the exchange into an easily triggered, hard-to-control selling machine.
One obvious change is the concentration of trading in the hands of the mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds that accumulate huge amounts of cash and invest big chunks of it in stocks. Measured in dollar value, these institutions, as they are called, own or control 45 percent of all shares in American companies, about double what it was in 1970. And they do approximately 50 percent of the trading in the 1,741 stocks listed on the New York exchange, also double the 1970 level, according to the Securities Industry Association.
When a sell-off gets rolling, institutions often pull away from the market, neither buying nor selling until the trouble passes. Two of the biggest, Prudential Insurance Company and the Dreyfus Corporation, did exactly that last Oct. 13. And when such big players stop buying, it does not take many of Ketchum's small, aggressive sellers to produce a ruinous day on Wall Street. Compounding the problem is the burgeoning trading technique known as basket trading. Rather than trade only in individual companies - say 200,000 shares of J.C. Penney or one million shares of General Electric - the biggest players buy and sell ''baskets'' of stock in a single trade; that is, thousands of shares in dozens of companies. Basket trading now represents roughly 10 percent of all the buying and selling on the New York Stock Exchange.
Basket trading (also known as (Continued on Page 82) program trading because computers are programmed to execute the complex orders) reflects a huge change in attitude toward the stock market, one that makes a virtue of restlessly trading stocks rather than holding them as long-term investments.
Many money managers now design their holdings to reflect a cross-section of the nation's publicly traded companies. They own, in effect, the shares of selected companies in nearly every industry represented on the stock exchange. Each basket, in turn, is a miniature of this cross-section, a way for the institutions to trade without changing the mix in their holdings. The minimum goal is to be able to tell corporate clients that the pension money, say, they have entrusted to the institution to invest in stocks is performing at least as well as the overall market, rising and falling in value with the Dow Jones average of 30 major corporations or with Standard & Poor's 500 representative stocks, another popular yardstick. To keep their clients happy, however, they need to do better than that, which they try to accomplish through relentless trading, a lot of it in baskets. The side effects of all this have proved not so benign. On a down day, the selling of so many stocks simultaneously will naturally accelerate a decline, as it did during the minicrash last Oct. 13. Basket trading that afternoon accounted for nearly 30 percent of all transactions, according to the S.E.C.
NO ONE WAS ANTICIPATING such severe sell-offs in 1982, however, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange instituted what is now the most popular forum for futures trading in stocks. The practice was intended, in fact, to protect institutional traders against the occasional daily losses that result from restless trading.
The contracts wagered in Chicago are, essentially, imaginary baskets, each representing the 500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's cross-section. Because this cross-section is also the most popular mix among the big institutions, money managers turn to the Chicago futures pit when they are reluctant to sell the stocks in their portfolios but fear prices might soon decline.
In other words, the money manager ends up eating his cake and having it, too. He has ''hedged,'' as Wall Street calls it, losing money on his portfolio of real stocks in New York, but making back the loss by gambling on those same stocks in Chicago. Specifically, the big money manager calls his broker, perhaps Shearson or Salomon Brothers, or he gets word directly to a Turk Hunter, standing on the top tier of the trading pit, and asks him to sell a specified number of futures contracts. The stocks in each contract are valued today at roughly $170,000, but in Chicago, Hunter isn't dealing in real stocks.
What he does, when he bangs one finger against his forehead and pushes his arms forward, palms out, is to create 10 baskets of imaginary shares and offer them for sale at the prevailing price. If stock prices decline in New York, then the value of the real stocks in the money manager's portfolio declines. That's bad news. But so does the value of the imaginary stocks, which Hunter might have sold for $170,000 per contract. One hour later, each of these baskets might be worth only $169,000, and that's good news. Hunter and his client have, in effect, had the foresight to get rid of 10 baskets of stocks before they lost $10,000 of their value. No matter that the stocks don't exist; Hunter has bet correctly on the direction of the market. By the rules of the Mercantile Exchange, his client can demand from the purchaser the $10,000 spread and the purchaser must pay this amount.
Plainly, the futures market does play a useful role for the big money managers whose trading so dominates the stock market today. For those critics who argue for its dissolution, the reply often comes back that high-volume institutional trading required it; without the futures market, institutions could never achieve the hefty returns that constant trading made possible in the 80's. ''You and I know, and the world knows, that when there is a strong enough need, the necessary instruments are created to meet that need,'' says Leo Melamed, chairman of the executive committee of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ''Futures trading gives people the ability to enter and exit the market easily.''
Melamed has a point, but as the practice has evolved sometimes the entry and exit has been haphazard and panicky, having little to do with the hedging requirements of the institutions. That was the case last Oct. 13, when the late-afternoon announcement about United Airlines' lack of financing triggered a minicrash that vividly demonstrated the Chicago-New York interplay. Some 62,500 futures contracts were traded that day, way up from last year's daily average of 42,000, and the price plummeted from $179,000 a contract to $164,525. Arthur D. Cashin Jr., director of floor operations for Paine Webber Inc., describes what happened:
''United was one of the more spectacular takeover stocks, and the speculators who owned it began to sell and, oops, suddenly there are so many sell orders that trading in the stock is halted in New York. The same happens to American Airlines, also then a takeover target. ''So the guy trying to sell airlines can't, and he begins to sell whatever he owns to raise cash, to protect himself against losses in airlines. And other people holding takeover stocks get scared and sell, too. Maybe someone owns 35 different stocks, but he can't remember how many shares he has of each, and prices are falling. To save time, he turns to Chicago and starts to sell futures contracts. The price of the S.& P. 500 contract sinks, and everyone sees this on their computer screens and they get scared and they sell -in New York and Chicago.'' That is why futures trading plays a major role in triggering sell-offs, says Robert R. Glauber, an under secretary of the Treasury who directed the Brady Commission report on the 1987 crash. ''The futures market acts as a billboard,'' he says. ''Falling prices in Chicago get wired back into the stock market in New York.''
TO A VISITOR, THE impact of a decade of change on the stately New York Stock Exchange isn't immediately apparent. The crowds of brokers and clerks still move restlessly about, just as they seem to be doing in the dark photos of early days on the exchange. As if shopping, the brokers still stop at the booths of the specialists, each one a sort of auctioneer assigned by the exchange to orchestrate the trading of shares in three or four companies.
But then the old imagery breaks down. The exchange has installed a superfast computer system that instantly routes buy and sell orders from any brokerage office in the country to the trading floor in New York. The goal of the new system was to keep up with the rising trading volume, which has grown to an average of 165.5 million shares a day, from only 11.6 million in 1970. But one result was to make basket trading easy to carry out: institutions and brokerage houses that deal in baskets no longer have to telephone simultaneous sell orders for the 500 different S.& P. (Continued on Page 94) stocks, as they did in the early 1980's, the pioneer days of basket trading. And the floor brokers no longer have to walk these orders to the specialists' stalls and negotiate a trade.
Today, a computer network brings to the floor 80 percent of all buy and sell orders, of whatever nature. They pop up - bang bang bang -in yellow numbers on the black screens of the small computers on the counters at each specialist's booth. During a down day in the stock market, the yellow sell orders stack up alarmingly in a long column down the right side of the screens. Many represent basket sales. They appear far more quickly and in far greater volume than the buy orders forming another column on the left side. When this happens, prices fall rapidly in the hope that buyers will be attracted and more yellow numbers will pop up in the buy column. The speed of it all, and the cold technology, resonate with the people who man the booths.
''It affects you differently than trading face to face with a broker,'' says Jay A. Mahoney, a specialist whose firm manages the stocks of the Marriott Corporation and Con Edison of New York, among others. ''You wonder what is going on out there, and you get scared.''
WHAT IS GOING ON OUT there is futures trading, the principal forum being the huge main room at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. More than 450 traders, most of them men in their 30's and 40's, crowd the four tiers of this miniature Roman amphitheater and spill over onto the stage. Futures traders have their hierarchy. At the pinnacle stand Turk Hunter and about 100 others who represent the big money managers and the Wall Street brokerage houses and earn most of their income from commissions. Fittingly, they occupy the top tier, encircled by clerks in yellow smocks who pass them the orders to buy or sell futures contracts that flow in by phone from New York and elsewhere. Increasingly, these 100 brokers wager among themselves. Some 60 percent of the trading in futures contracts today never gets below the top tier, the reason being that only a Shearson or a Dreyfus, acting through a top-step broker, have the wherewithal to pay off a gambling loss that might come to $100,000 or more.
But that doesn't dampen the enthusiasm of the ''locals,'' the traders who occupy the lower tiers and wager their own money. When Hunter sells futures contracts, the locals take some of the bet. They are people like Ronald S. Sheldon, a 47-year-old former labor lawyer who gave up his practice in 1982 and purchased a place in the futures pit for $60,000.
With a week or two of training at the Mercantile Exchange - lessons include how to shout from the diaphragm - Sheldon donned a blue smock, took his place two tiers down from Hunter and began gambling for a living - trading futures.
So far, Sheldon's profits have been greater than his losses. He rarely gambles more than several hundred dollars at a time. Indeed, most of the locals are cautious traders, taking their cues from the brokers on the top tier, as they did on the morning of Lincoln's Birthday, when Turk Hunter began to sell 400 contracts for Shearson.
Turk's clients rarely tell him the reasons for their trades. Shearson might have been acting as a broker for an institution, or simply trading for its own account, seeking a quick profit for itself. ''Stock prices were down in London and the rumors of the Drexel bankruptcy were circulating,'' Turk explains. ''Shearson, or anyone else, might have felt that if it put selling pressure on the futures market at the opening, there would be a break in prices from which it could profit.''
The break came. Others in the pit, watching Hunter and knowing whom he represented, sold too. As they did, the S.& P. 500 futures contract fell slowly, from $167,050 near the opening to $166,475 an hour later, and the Dow declined more than 25 points in the same period. The profit for Shearson, at that point, was $230,000, and maybe Shearson did quickly collect its bets from the purchasers of its contracts. The mechanism for doing this is to buy the same number of contracts that had been sold.
Or maybe Shearson bought back some contracts and kept other bets open. Turk did not say. Most positions are closed out in minutes or hours, but the most commonly traded contracts can, under the exchange's trading rules, remain open for three months.
Whatever Shearson's goals, the traders in the pit taking Hunter's lead march to a different tune. On Feb. 12, for example, Sheldon followed Hunter's lead and also sold, creating two S.& P. futures contracts with his hand signals, and unloading them for about $167,000. But minutes later, with the price still declining, he ended his gamble by purchasing two contracts at $166,950. His profit on the trade: $100.
While Hunter and Sheldon were selling, others in the pit were buying, gambling that the S.& P. futures price would soon rise, which it did shortly before lunch. (Futures trading is also capable of driving stock prices up, of course. But such episodes are relatively undramatic. In the 1980's, the Dow never rose by as much as 190 points in a single day.) Whether selling or buying, few locals deal in more than five contracts at a time, or hold a trading position for more than a minute or two, closing it out if a loss gets to $400. ''Five minutes would be a lifetime,'' Sheldon says. ''A minute or 30 seconds is more the norm.'' The final hour of trading on Lincoln's Birthday produced another sell-off in Chicago. Brokers in the top tier started offering several hundred contracts for sale and the locals joined the selling frenzy. The futures contract fell in an hour from $166,750 to $165,750, and the Dow Jones average followed suit, plunging 12 points in the final hour and closing down 29 points for the day.
BACK IN NEW YORK on Lincoln's Birthday, Robert W. Seijas watched the S.& P. 500 futures price fall. Seijas, a partner at Lasker, Stone & Stern, a specialist firm, runs the stall where Cooper Industries, a machinery manufacturer, and the Sysco Corporation, a food distributor, are traded. That day, as always, he kept watch on the boxy computer screen dangling from a robotic arm that juts out from his booth. Every specialist stall at the exchange has these computer screens, and the clusters of stalls look like giant bugs with stubby, cut off legs.
Seijas programs his terminal to give him various bits of helpful data: selected stocks, bond prices, news headlines. But on his screen, and every other across the floor, two numbers are tracked religiously. One is the ever-changing price of the S.& P. futures contract in Chicago and the other is the parallel, very slightly lower value of the real 500 S.& P. stocks in New York. When the Chicago price falls faster than the one in New York, as it often does, and the two lines begin to converge, the crowds on the exchange floor brace for selling.
The same numbers are tracked, with the same tense reaction, in the trading rooms of Salomon Brothers, Merrill Lynch and other major brokerage firms. These are the rooms where the institutions arrange to trade huge blocs of stock, usually to one another or to the brokerage house itself, if a Dreyfus can't get a Prudential to trade right away.
But when the S.& P. futures price falls and the spread narrows, a trader about to purchase, say, 700,000 shares of Unisys, pulls back, figuring that if he waits a few minutes the price might go lower. And in another trading room, the sale of 100,000 shares of J.C. Penney, for example, is hastened before the stock's price is caught in the impending slide. Both trades - the postponed purchase and the rushed sale - accelerate a price decline.
On Lincoln's Birthday, as the spread narrowed between the futures price of the 500 S.& P. stocks and their current, minute-by-minute value, the sell orders mounted on the computer at Seijas's booth. There were 18 in all for Cooper and Sysco, many of them bunched in the late afternoon - nearly all placed by Morgan Stanley, either for itself or as broker for a big client.
Seijas wasn't sure, but most likely they were part of a much larger basket trade. Cooper and Sysco are both among the S.& P. 500 companies and each of Morgan's sell orders - invariably 400 shares of Cooper and 300 of Sysco - is roughly a multiple of the shares assigned to these companies in the S.& P. index.
Sometimes the price of the futures contracts falls so low that owning the imaginary shares in the S.& P. 500 companies suddenly becomes less costly than owning their real counterparts in New York. That was the case late in the day on Lincoln's Birthday. And when it happens institutions and brokerage houses sometimes sell the real shares, purchase the imaginary ones and pocket the difference. Morgan's trades undoubtedly included some of this index arbitrage. The upshot of this selling is often a downward twist in stock prices. Index arbitrage accounted for about 12 percent of the late-afternoon sell-off last Oct. 13.
NOT SURPRISINGLY , a movement is gaining steam to treat Chicago's futures trading as if it were part and parcel of a single national stock market, whose flagship is the New York Stock Exchange.
This would be achieved by expanding the domain of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates stock trading. Under a proposal before Congress, the S.E.C. would also be given authority over stock futures trading in Chicago, now the responsibility of a separate agency. Such a proposal emerged from the 1987 crash, but then was forgotten - until the minicrash last October.
Until late March, a White House task force, called the Working Group on Financial Markets, had been evenly split on the regulation issue. The Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, and the S.E.C. chairman, Richard C. Breeden, had favored giving overall authority to the S.E.C. The two other members, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Wendy L. Gramm, chairman of the Chicago Futures Trading Commission, which now regulates the futures markets, balked at making such a change. But then Greenspan seemed to switch sides, telling a Senate committee that he was ''very slightly'' in favor of switching some jurisdiction to the S.E.C. - a signal that the Administration was prepared to revamp stock-market regulation.
A more powerful S.E.C. would probably enact rules that halt trading in stocks and futures contracts, in some coordinated fashion, whenever prices plunge too rapidly. ''We should not do away with the futures market, but put through rules that make the stock and futures markets work with each other, instead of against each other,'' says Treasury under secretary Glauber.
Already, the S.E.C. is considering new proposals to slow down stock trading whenever the Dow Jones industrial average falls too far. It has been asked by the New York Stock Exchange, for example, to authorize additional limits on trading when the Dow declines 50 points within a day. Among other things, some huge sell orders would be prohibited. If the Dow kept falling, more restrictions would kick in at around 100 points, and at 250 points trading would stop altogether. Currently, the 250-point rule is in effect, adopted after the 1987 crash.
Whatever the reforms, it is very possible that the Federal Government will have made no changes at all before the stock market's next frightening sell-off. The Bush Administration might be ready to act, but Congress is not of one mind on the issue of expanding the S.E.C's authority.
When the next sell-off comes, Richard Breeden will be among those scrambling to restore confidence and get stock prices to bounce back quickly, as they have so far since the 1987 crash.
''If necessary, I'll go on television to correct inaccurate perceptions about the market,'' Breeden says. ''I don't want people, for the wrong perceptions, to lose confidence in the stock market as a safe place to save. That would be a terrible mistake.''

HEADLINE: WHEN LEGAL TITANS CLASH

BYLINE: By Ken Emerson: Ken Emerson is a former editor of this magazine.

 BODY:
YOU PEOPLE ARE NOT A RANDOM, TYPICAL sample of the U.S. population,'' deadpans the new dean of Harvard Law School to appreciative laughter. After all, the hundred-odd students gathered to hear Robert C. Clark's talk on ''Laws, Markets and Morals'' are investing nearly $75,000 in their Juris Doctor degrees. Although you'd never guess from their backpacks and corduroys, many of them will earn more than their money back the very first year they graduate to briefcases and gray flannel.
But appearances can be deceiving at America's most prestigious law school. Although almost everyone agrees that Harvard has left behind the factional acrimony that soured its reputation in the 1980's, the school has not quite returned to business as usual. Beneath a surface ''civility'' - an oft-heard word in Cambridge these days - roil currents of dispute that are potentially broader and deeper than the left-right infighting of the last decade.
The argument is over the nature of the law. It's a text, all agree, but how freely can it be interpreted? Is it elastic enough to impel social reform - or at least to twang spitballs at the establishment? Or is the law sufficiently fixed in its meaning to aspire to the condition of science? 
Even more important, the argument is over the role of the law school in the legal profession. Is it Harvard's function to feed the mammoth law firms and keep the wheels of commerce turning, or to resist market forces and provide alternative careers for attorneys? Is the American lawyer a man with a mission, a crusader on the ramparts of the public interest? Or is she (42 percent of Harvard Law students are now women) a highly paid janitor in the basement of society, as more than one Harvard professor has suggested?
Doubtless the same issues are being debated at many of the other 175 law schools in the United States. But the arguments at Harvard Law School assume undue importance because Harvard Law assumes an unduely important role in America. At the moment, for example, 10 of its graduates are serving in the Senate, three in the Cabinet, and four on the Supreme Court, and it has usually been thus. So it's only a slight exaggeration when Prof. Alan Dershowitz insists, with all the indignation he is mustering for the defense of Leona Helmsley, that the struggle at his law school is nothing less than a battle ''for the future of the profession and potentially for the future of the country.''
BACK IN THE LECTURE HALL, CLARK IS EXPOUNDING on the themes of a book he says was ''rudely interrupted'' by his appointment last spring as dean of Harvard's bitterly divided law school. It's an ambitious talk, ranging from Kant to cognitive psychology, from economics to animal behavior, laced with dry asides. Why can't corporate law, muses Clark, the author of a highly regarded textbook on the subject, be derived from a Summa Theologica or the Talmud? A candidate for the Catholic priesthood who lost his faith after reading too much philosophy, he answers his own question: because you can't get the Occupational Safety and Health Act out of a sacred text.
The lecture is sponsored by the law school's chapter of the Federalist Society, a national association of conservative lawyers and law students. You can pick the Feds out of the crowd because they're the only ones wearing suits other than Clark, their erstwhile faculty adviser.
Bob Clark's appointment by Harvard President Derek Bok, himself the dean of the law school from 1968 to 1971, provoked yawps of outrage from the left. ''The worst possible choice,'' one law professor told the press; ''a bad and divisive appointment,'' charged another; ''I was shocked,'' said a third. All three naysayers were aligned with a radical movement among legal scholars, known as Critical Legal Studies, that is stubbornly rooted at Harvard. One of the Crits' founders, Duncan Kennedy, once described them as a ''ragtag band of leftover 60's people and young people with nostalgia for the events of 15 years ago.''
Kennedy made his remark back in 1985, during a heated session sponsored by the Federalist Society at the Harvard Club in New York. Much of the heat was provided by a young Bob Clark (even now he's only 46), who likened the Crits to Huns rather than hippies and denounced the movement's ''generalized antipathy toward many major institutions and practices of the modern 'western' world.''
The year before, at another symposium sponsored by the Feds, Clark had delivered a paper entitled ''The Return of Langdell,'' in homage to Christopher Columbus Langdell. Dean of Harvard Law School after the Civil War, Langdell devised the doctrinal or case-study method of legal instruction that put the law on a quasi-scientific footing. Clark's talk, which deplored contemporary students' ignorance ''of how one goes about proving something,'' was as literary as it was scientific. It began with Yeats's ''The Second Coming'' (''The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity'') and concluded with a free adaptation of the poem's conclusion: ''What new Langdell, his or her hour come round at last, /Slouches toward Cambridge or Chicago to be born?''
Bob Clark looks more like a teddy bear than the ''rough beast'' Yeats imagined. Wary of being misquoted, he places his own tape recorder alongside mine in his office the morning after his lecture. There's reason for caution: Harvard may no longer be ''the Beirut of legal education,'' as one Crit denied tenure charged, but it's still full of land mines. During our conversation, he repeatedly tugs on his beard, as if reining himself in. ''I don't want to say what I'm thinking,'' he says at one point, ''it'll come out too strong.''
We have been talking about his address last September to incoming students. ''Do not let anyone convince you that you are 'selling out' in whatever career you choose,'' he reassured them. Among those careers he emphatically included corporate law, which he defined grandiloquently as ''helping the wheels of commerce turn and helping business produce the goods and services needed by society.''
So he doesn't agree with Alan Dershowitz's line - ''It's as if all the medical doctors in America were performing elective cosmetic surgery while the emergency wards of our hospitals had no doctors'' - about corporate law?
''That's a bad analogy,'' says Clark, who began his deanship by eliminating the position of adviser to students considering careers in public-interest law. ''It might be a sign of ill health in the country if people needed lawyers more. An ordinary person, I guess, uses a lawyer for a will, a divorce, buying a house and so on, and even those things ought to be more routinized.''
Having minimized the need of ordinary people for lawyers, Clark then compares lawyers to, well, ordinary people: carpenters, electricans and plumbers. ''They aren't usually thought of as doing public-interest work,'' he says, ''but if in fact you look back at the total amount of good they do, and at the total benefit to human welfare, it's enormous.'' To draw ''an ideological dichotomy between altruistic, doing-good work'' and more mundane human labor, he insists, is ''a fundamental mistake.''
Corporate law, Clark continues, ''is intensely moral, you know.'' The challenge is ''to devise optimal controls on managerial discretion, the behavior of people who are responsible for large organizations. You have to give them adequate discretion to make all sorts of decisions - otherwise the system won't work - at the same time you have to have constraints on abuse of power. So it's a kind of generic problem which is, to my mind, a real-world, most significant ethical problem.''
Given his omnivorous interests in (Continued on Page 53) religion, philosophy, sociology, and economics, it's not surprising that one of Clark's intellectual model's is the German sociologist Max Weber, or that he already envisions an end to his deanship. How else could he finish his book? ''Ten years is what was contemplated by Bok,'' he says of his appointment. ''If I get fed up with it, I might stop after five. So far, I like it a lot.''
He must be doing something right. Alumni contributions are way up after a ''sharp dip'' at the height of the Crit controversy, and Clark is launching a new fund-raising campaign with the astonishing goal of $150 million.
''I wonder,'' he says facetiously as I prepare to leave, ''what we're going to do when Leona Helmsley, in gratitude, offers us something.''
'' MISS ----, WHY ARE YOU in the back row?'' ''I brought a friend to class.'' ''As long as it isn't the other explanation,'' booms Phillip E. Areeda, referring to the unthinkable: that a student would come to his first-year course on contracts unprepared.
If Bob Clark is awaiting the return of Langdell, Areeda teaches as if he had never left, using the wham-bam Socratic method still popularly associated with Harvard Law School. Yet as he roams the classroom's raked semicircle, Areeda seems as up-to-date as that other Phil: Donahue. Recognizing raised hands and singling out victims with a ballpoint he waves like a baton, he reels off one ''hypothetical'' after another. He sells his house, knowing full well that termites are gnawing away at its foundations. Is there a duty to disclose? He's a composer, contracted to write an opera, ''The Rose of Abalone,'' for the opening of the new Bastille opera house. He expires with his masterpiece uncompleted. Is his estate liable?
Every ''hypo'' spawns a swarm of variations; each question begets another. ''I'm not sure whether I'm basing this on the canons of human decency,'' a student confesses. Pressed, he folds: ''Sounds dumb, doesn't it?''
''I'm a relic,'' laughs Areeda, a blunt, bullet-shaped man of 60, as we enter his office, where everything (Continued on Page 63) but the fax machine is burnished with a brown patina of cigar smoke and time. His life's work is bound in leather and gilt: eight volumes, plus annual supplements, of a treatise on antitrust law. ''I hope to be done by volume 12,'' he says.
Areeda's sentences are as elaborate and self-assured as his hypos. He expresses optimism about the future of the law school, and relief that the faculty now realizes ''uncivil discourse doesn't further any cause.'' Yet when asked what common convictions unite the law school, what if anything it stands for, he grinds to an uncustomary halt and, after a long pause, lurches. ''That's a hard question to answer. . . . Twenty years ago I would have said that . . . we all thought we had a common mission. And the common mission was to - and now to use a terrible cliche, but it also has meaning . . . would have had meaning 20 years ago . . . our common mission was to teach law in the grand manner.''
It's not just those subversive Crits who have chipped away at the grand manner, the Harvard tradition of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter. Nor is it simply the competitive pressure to make big bucks. What tongue-ties Areeda may be in part Dean Clark's rationalizations, and his own.
''My image of the ideal lawyer,'' Areeda says, ''is the exalted image of the lawyer as ethicist, as the person of high moral values, the lawyer as someone with a kind of religious insight into the character of society. I find that image both appealing and entirely consistent with greasing the wheels of commerce. Because, of course, the very point of the exalted image is that the wheels of commerce ought to be greased in the right way, in the way that keeps dealings consistent with the highest principles of fidelity, and with law and duty. So when one uses the image of greasing the wheels of commerce, there are better and worse greases. . . .''
When the grand manner is reduced to a finer grade of grease, Harvard Law School is in trouble.
IF PHIL AREEDA SAID 'DO that,' you'd do it,'' jokes Derrick Bell as he brings to order his class on constitutional law. ''There are some losses in entering the new age.''
Harvard Law School's first black tenured professor (now there are two more) does not yearn for the ways things used to be - not that he's particularly enamored of the way they are now. Derrick A. Bell Jr., 59, spent much of the 60's as an ''outside agitator,'' desegregating Southern schools as a staff attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. At Harvard, where he's taught since 1969, taking time out to serve as dean of the University of Oregon Law School, he's been an inside agitator. ''Derek Bok hired me,'' he says, ''and we have disappointed each other ever since. I have not been grateful, which is about the most serious thing a black person can do to a white person.''
Bell has lobbied indefatigably for more minority students and faculty, not only at the law school but university-wide. In 1988, for example, he issued a report in the form of an ''allegory'' suggesting that Harvard's record on affirmative action might improve if a bomb blast killed all of its 198 black professors and administrators and Derek Bok! The year before, during commencement, he staged a four-day sit-in in his office to protest the denial of tenure to two professors (both white) in the Crits' camp. Bob Clark, not yet dean, was reported to have said (he disputes the exact wording), ''This is a university, not a lunch counter in the Deep South.'' Today, Bell says that Clark, ''given his druthers, would like to go back to the law school of 1960.''
Professor Bell tries to instill the same defiance in his students. Earlier this month, he actively encouraged students who occupied Dean Clark's office, demanding, among other things, that a black woman be granted a tenured professorship by September. ''You are now lawyers,'' he says to graduates, ''and you don't have to be kissing people's behinds.'' Today Bell is concerned that his constitutional law class hasn't been defiant enough. He's divided it into teams to try a hypothetical case in which the Lettuce Growers Association of State A is suing State C for banning the importation and transportation across its borders of lettuce harvested with the notoriously backbreaking short-handled hoe. To his dismay, the students playing the role of Federal District Court judges have sided, 6 to 1, with the lettuce growers, insisting that whatever the suffering of migrant farmworkers, no state can be allowed to interfere with interstate commerce.
Bell seems to regard the law with a mixture of impatience and resignation. His most recent book, ''And We Are Not Saved: The Elusive Quest for Racial Justice,'' asks whether civil-rights litigation is ''a freedom train that has run out of steam.'' As if to underline his disillusionment with the law, he does not frame his arguments in academic legalese but instead employs fables, often with a sci-fi tinge, that he calls ''chronicles.''
Bell is quick to cite violence and ''direct action'' as more effective means than the law of provoking social change. One such direct action, his sit-in on the Crits' behalf, was a solo performance. ''What they didn't realize was that reform requires confrontation, he says. ''It can't be intellectualized. At some point somebody's (Continued on Page 66) got to stand up in the fire and say, 'Goddamnit, no!' . . . . The lack of hard experience manifests itself in their writing and their theories. It's all theory. . . . But give Crits good credit for opening up legal scholarship.''
I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU AN hour, so don't leave your missiles in your silos.'' It is time to visit the Crits' corner, where Duncan Kennedy admits to feeling ''gun-shy and paranoid.'' He is also pressed for time, because he is bound for Poland, along with 10 other members of the Critical Legal Studies movement, to discuss rights at the University of Warsaw. Why the Crits? asks a colleague. ''I guess they probably took an objective look at the most valid work that's been done in the area and decided that, without regard to friendship, political ideology or anything else, they ought to allocate the boondoggle to the people with the most merit.''
That's the way Duncan Kennedy talks: volubly, sarcastically, mischievously peppering his speech with ironic quotation marks.
This is how Duncan Kennedy dresses: dirty bucks, black jeans, tieless shirt, an old corduroy jacket. Overlook the lines in his face and the gray in his beard, and Duncan Kennedy, 48, is the spitting image of a grad student circa 1968.
Critical Legal Studies reared its head in the late 1970's when Kennedy and two other Harvard Law professors, Morton Horwitz and Roberto Unger, plus a few kindred spirits elsewhere, notably at the University of Wisconsin Law School, rebelled against what Kennedy would later decry as ''the substantive inanity of what we teach.'' The law, they argued, far from being written in stone, is characterized by a high degree of elasticity; it is not an autonomous field of objective expertise. ''There is never a 'correct legal solution' that is other than the correct ethical and political solution to that legal problem,'' wrote Kennedy. And the politically, ethically, legally correct solution was radical social transformation.
In 1983, Kennedy published a pamphlet, bound in red, called ''Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy: A Polemic Against the System.'' Its preface urged readers to ''Resist!'' (Practicing what he preaches, Kennedy refused to pose for a photograph to accompany this article ''as a gesture of resistance.'') Warning that ''wherever you are situated, the system of hierarchy maims you,'' Kennedy wrote, ''it is not only possible but also meaningful to resist anywhere and at any time - at upper-middle-class dinner parties and at the bank, as well as in law-school classrooms, faculty meetings, on the assembly line and in welfare offices.''
In order to transform the law school into a ''counterhegemonic enclave,'' Kennedy recommended such measures as admitting by lottery students who had passed a basic skills test, and either giving tenure to every professor or abolishing it altogether. After all, ''the ideology of the legal hierarchy is no more than a specialized application of the general meritocratic ideology of American society.'' Harvard, of course, takes considerable pride in its ''meritocratic ideology,'' and Harvard took offense.
Students waving copies of Kennedy's little red book didn't provoke a Cultural Revolution, but Critical Legal Studies did raise important questions about the political nature of the law. It gradually generated enough sympathy and antipathy among the faculty to polarize the school and make tenure decisions increasingly rancorous. James Vorenberg, the liberal dean of the law school from 1981 to 1989, was caught in the middle. Eventually Derek Bok intervened, first by reversing the law school's decisions to grant tenure to two professors in the Critical Legal Studies camp, and then by appointing the outspokenly conservative Clark when Vorenburg stepped down as dean and returned to teaching.
There's a hall-of-mirrors aspect to the argument between the Crits and the conservatives, with both sides enlisting similar imagery for opposite purposes. Is it fine and dandy to help the wheels of commerce turn, as Dean Clark holds, or to grease them as Professor Areeda maintains? ''Most of what corporate lawyers do is just 'greasing the wheels of the system,' '' Kennedy has written.
The lawyer as janitor metaphor seems to intrigue both left and right. Kennedy has written that he does not believe ''we'd lose anything at all in terms of social product if lawyers, law professors, secretaries, paralegals and law-firm janitors were all paid exactly the same amount.'' Subsequently, his colleague and ideological opponent, Charles Fried, who served as Solicitor General under President Reagan (and is now faculty adviser to the Federalist Society), proposed that we regard lawyers ''not as the architects of society but as its janitors.'' The legal profession made a big mistake, he wrote, when it ''tried to get out of the basement.''
''Do you think our rhetoric has influenced them?'' Kennedy asks. ''There's a kind of complicated reversal. . . . This is the megalomaniac, grandiose fantasy, that it will be snuck into their, infiltrating their, very rhetoric.''
Kennedy's own rhetoric remains unapologetically countercultural. ''The slogan should not be '68, the failed revolutionary moment,' '' he wrote in the journal Rethinking Marxism a couple of years ago, ''but 'the 60's,' a diffuse cultural rebellion with a thousand specific implications for daily life in the '90s.' ''
TODAY'S LAW STUDENTS ARE different, Charles Fried is saying. They know that they're going to have to make a living in a world that ''is sick and tired of the 60's.'' So is the former Solicitor General.
The Carter Professor of General Jurisprudence is a tall, gangly man with permanently arched eyebrows. His English accent sometimes arches, too, into a near falsetto. On his desk is a flag bearing the ''Smile'' insignia of Czechoslovakia's Civic Forum movement. Fried, 55, who fled Prague with his family in 1939, says he was moved to tears by Vaclav Havel's Congressional address. I wonder if he has read the papers that morning. Havel, who visited Columbia University in 1968, said that the spirit of the 60's had helped inspire his ''velvet'' revolution.
Fried's revolution was Ronald Reagan's. Co-chairman of Law Professors for Reagan-Bush in 1984, he declared that since lawyers were ''the handmaidens of regulation,'' he looked forward to ''a reform that will simply reduce the number of lawyers and the number of law students.'' Reducing the number of law professors by one, Fried eventually became Solicitor General, in which capacity he argued vigorously against affirmative action and a constitutional right to abortion.
He also gave a high literary gloss to the Administration's emphasis on a strict interpretation of the Constitution. In ''Sonnet LXV and the 'Black Ink' of the Framers' Intention,'' an essay originally delivered at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington in 1986, Fried argued eloquently that words, be they Shakespeare's or the Constitution's, can communicate over time and thus achieve a kind of permanence. ''At the very core of the rule of law is the conviction - perhaps it is only a hope - that legal texts have meaning.''
Professor Fried's positions as Solicitor General were consistent with those he staked out in his 1978 book ''Right and Wrong.'' Preoccupied with the ''limits to our responsibility for the world's good and ill,'' the book is intended as a corrective to bleeding-heart liberalism. But it often sounds like a smug defense of do-nothing indifference: ''Indeed, a good lawyer is a good man, and the fact that he chooses his clients among those who can pay the most or whose cases involve travel and excitement does not vitiate that conclusion.''
The Solicitor General's stance bothered Laurence Tribe. Fried's colleague and frequent adversary at the law school used Fried's arguments, and rulings by the Supreme Court, to illustrate the differences between what he calls Newtonian and post-Newtonian legal thought in a recent, dizzying essay, ''The Curvature of Constitutional Space: What Lawyers Can Learn From Modern Physics.'' Tribe criticized the Court's ''stilted premodern paradigm,'' in which ''there is no hint that the hand of the observing state may itself have played a major role in shaping the world it observes.'' How much more dynamic, Tribe contended, to consider the state and the law as Einstein's general theory of relativity views space - as curved and warped by the mass and energy within it, so that space is not a neutral stage but an actor in the play of the universe.
Tribe's approach, Fried says, ''makes me a little nervous. I think it's a little too malleable.'' He cites last year's debate in Congress, after the Supreme Court struck down a Texas flag-burning statute, about legislation to prohibit desecration of Old Glory. Democrats eager to demonstrate their patriotism after Michael Dukakis's Pledge of Allegiance debacle were calling for such a bill, and Tribe obliged by testifying that a constitutionally acceptable one could be drafted. Fried, on the other hand, defended the Court's unpopular decision and the exercise of free speech, winning ''three cheers'' from Tom Wicker, the liberal columnist for The New York Times -''the first time Tom Wicker ever said a good thing about me,'' Fried laughs.
If Tribe is Fried's opposite, is Duncan Kennedy his doppelganger? Each stakes out extreme positions and defends them with a rhetorical relish that is deliberately provocative. I raise the question tentatively and Fried chortles, displaying a framed photograph taken when both of them had longer hair and taught a course together.
''I'm with Duncan, if you like,'' he says. ''I think janitors are terribly important.''
OF LAWE THERE CAN BE NO lesse acknowledged than that her seate is the bosome of God,'' declares the only inscription ringing the rafters of the main reading room of Langdell Library that is not in Latin. But many of the professors at Harvard Law School no longer seem to share that conviction. Where is the grand manner of Holmes, Brandeis, Frankfurter, that faith of yesteryear in the lofty mission of the law?
An unlikely place to seek it would seem to be beyond a door festooned with a singed Israeli flag and xeroxed hate mail bearing sign-offs like ''Die, Jew - Adolf Hitler.'' In his office, Alan M. Dershowitz is holding forth.
''Did he say that? That's shocking!'' he exclaims when I relate Dean Clark's skeptical comments about the ordinary person's need for lawyers. ''Anyone who thinks that the crack users don't need a lawyer to get themselves into programs. . . . My God! I get calls like this every day. I got a call just before you came in from a woman in a law firm who was a paralegal who was fired, she said, because she was told to destroy documents in a pending lawsuit. How can I not help a woman like that out?''
While, as Dean Clark proudly notes, there are more media stars at Harvard than at any other law school, no one seems to revel more unabashedly in his celebrity than Alan Dershowitz. Clients like Claus von Bulow and Leona Helmsley, that monthly column in Penthouse - it's undignified, embarrassing, and some professors politely but pointedly distance themselves from Dershowitz. Tribe, for example, says, ''There are a lot of cases he has taken that I have refused.''
The problem is that Dershowitz's choice of cases sometimes seems dictated more by passion than by principle, by personal identification rather than by legal significance. His first scholarly book, which he co-authored in 1967, was ''Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry, and the Law.'' It doesn't take a shrink to figure out why he defended, for example, a Jewish Defense League terrorist from his boyhood neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn. But Leona Helmsley?
''I definitely have an identification with her,'' he says. ''This is a gutsy, somewhat crass woman from Brooklyn who made it to the top, clawing at every point and a lot of people clawing at her, too. . . . I would not conduct my life that way, because money's not important to me, but. . . .''
It should not be forgotten, however, that Dershowitz devotes much of the 20 percent of his time that Harvard Law professors are allowed to spend on outside work to pro bono cases. And Dershowitz, the outsider from Borough Park who will never seem at home on Brattle Street, at least has a vision of the law that is more exalted than wheel greasing.
There are at least 15 law schools at Harvard, Dershowitz says, and in many respects he runs his own. ''The tragedy is that the students come here wanting to go to my law school,'' he says. ''They come because they want to do public-interest work. They come because they want to work on the environment. They come because they want to help poor people. And they left here, before Bob Clark's speech, guilt-ridden, knowing that they were going to have to go to work for the big law firms. After Clark's speech, they leave here without any guilt. I want them at least to have some guilt, so maybe they can change those big law firms and help increase the ammount of public-interest law that's being done.''
WHEREAS DERSHOWITZ'S DIATRIBES are ME, ME, ME!, Laurence H. Tribe speaks with detached intensity, considering even himself as an object to be rotated in space. It's as if he had never abandoned for the law his undergraduate specialization in algebraic topology.
''I occasionally will read some newspaper account saying, 'Tribe craves publicity,' '' Tribe says. ''And I will ask myself, in my quiet moments, 'Is that true of Tribe? Does Tribe crave publicity, or does he just not mind it?' And the honest answer is, I probably used to crave it. But I've become a bit more mature now, and I just don't care as much one way or the other.''
''For me, it's instinctive,'' Tribe says when I remark that by the time his class in constitutional law had ended, the blackboard was covered with axes and helixes. ''I see things geometrically, in terms of patterns and structural relationships. When I taught evidence, I taught about triangulating hearsay. I get much more insight per cubic inch if I don't insist on moving in a linear direction.''
Tribe's cases have made as many headlines as Dershowitz's, though perhaps not in the tabloids. The Rev. Sung Myung Moon was a client. He defended Pennzoil against Texaco in the battle for Getty Oil. He's consulting on constitutional issues in the defense of the junk-bond maestro Michael Milken and believes the R.I.C.O. statute under which Milken was indicted is unconstitutional - ''a blank check for the prosecution.''
Last month, the Supreme Court decided in his favor a case in which he represented, like students in Derrick Bell's class, migrant farm workers. So far, he's won 11 of the 16 cases he's argued before the Court.
Like Dershowitz, Tribe is a centrist where Harvard Law School is concerned. That's one of the reasons he headed the faculty's advisory search committee for the new dean. The faculty elected two members on the right, two on the left and, in the middle, David Shapiro and Tribe. At the outset, Tribe and Shapiro declared themselves out of the running for the deanship. Some of the others, including Bob Clark, a representative of the right, did not. ''It was awkward,'' acknowledges Tribe, who said, when President Bok's final decision was announced, that ''there were other candidates of whom I had a more favorable impression.''
Today, Tribe is a diplomatic supporter of Clark. As a longtime defender of affirmative action, however, he regrets that ''there's likely to be a more conscious effort to pay less attention to the cultural, racial and ethnic diversity of the people we add to the faculty.'' He also foresees potential polarization in ''choices of emphasis on public or private law,'' conceding that ''there was at least initially some prospect of that when Dean Clark decided to eliminate the public-interest office.''
As a matter of fact, almost two-thirds of the students signed a petition of protest. Although Clark subsequently added more money to the fund forgiving the student loans of graduates who take public-interest jobs, and announced a $1 million gift by Judge Irving R. Kaufman to endow public interest fellowships, many faculty as well as students remain suspicious.
Tribe had concluded his class with a series of questions. If the area of activity or expression protected by a legal right is a penumbra, what casts the light? What difference does it make to think in terms of the ''foundation'' or the ''roots'' or the ''well-springs'' of a right?
What effect, I asked, does the imagery of wheel-greasing and broom-pushing have on the law?
''This is where some people in the middle . . .disagree dramatically with both the right and the left,'' says Tribe. ''I do have a much higher aspiration for the legal profession.
''The graduates this school has thought most highly of - Brandeis, Frankfurter - were not just wheel-greasers. . . . They were willing to engage in substantive discussion about the good society. I don't believe it's defensible for the place to become simply a technocratic training ground for the janitors of the legal order.''
AFTER A LONG DAY READING law-journal articles in the stacks of Langdell Library, I emerged blurry-eyed one evening into a dank mist. Holmes Field, named after the Justice, was alive with bounding shapes that were hard to make out in the filmy dark. It took a moment before I realized they were dogs - German shepherds, collies, beagles, mutts - running about without leashes or discernible masters.
It was Dean Clark who quoted Yeats: ''Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.'' And it is his task to reimpose order on an unruly law school. But if the Critical Legal Studies movement deconstructed the law, the conservatives who now hold sway are not articulating an especially inspiring vision of how to restore it.
Some arguments are healthy. If everyone agreed on how strictly or freely the law should be interpreted, there would be no need for law schools or even courts. We could adjudicate by computer. But the differences over the role of the law school and its relation to the world are more virulent.
One wonders if Dean Clark's reaction - his corporate boosterism, his emphasis on ivory-tower excellence, his less than impassioned commitment to the public interest, broadly defined - may not create divisions within the law school that are deeper than the Critical Legal Studies rift. The danger is that the fault line at Harvard Law School may shift rightward, isolating its administration and leaving those professors in the middle on the same side of the chasm as the Crits.
It was de Tocqueville who wrote that, in America, ''the spirit of the law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually penetrates beyond their walls to the bosom of society.'' Be it the bosom of God or of society, the law has traditionally enjoyed an exalted position. It remains to be seen how Harvard will retrieve it from the basement.

HEADLINE: ALMODOVAR ON THE VERGE

BYLINE: By David Leavitt: David Leavitt was the visiting foreign writer at the Institute of Catalan Letters, in Barcelona, Spain, last fall and winter. His new collection of stories, ''A Place I've Never Been,'' will be published next September.

 BODY:
WALL OR NO WALL, FEBRUARY IN BERLIN means Film Festival. In front of the Zoo Palast Theater, near the center of the western part of the city, a giant cube has been erected, thrusting 30 feet into the air and painted on all four sides with scenes from ''Atame!'' (in English, ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''), the official Spanish entry in the festival competition and the eighth film by the director Pedro Almodovar. Though billboards advertising movies abound this week in Berlin, nothing approaches the cube for massiveness or provocation. On one side a gargantuan masked bodybuilder wearing a leather doublet stares out in challenge; on another a battered young man holds his hand over the mouth of a bewildered young woman; on still another the same young woman, dressed in a slight, clingy shift, poses sensuously, catlike, on all fours. 
This bright, chilly afternoon, Pedro Almodovar is on his way to see the Berlin wall. Victoria Abril and Antonio Banderas, the actors whose magnified faces stare out from one side of the cube, accompany him, as does his brother Agustin, the producer of ''Atame!'' and a clutch of enthusiastic German autograph-seekers. As he signs autographs, Almodovar's jovial, moon-shaped face radiates calm and good humor. Only the cigarette he perpetually lifts to his mouth suggests any hint of anxiety he might be feeling about the following afternoon's premiere. He seems a model of the longtime star, the man of the world for whom throngs of fans are a fixture of everyday life. Yet when he arrives at the cube, his expression changes. He laughs, and points, like a child who has just been given an amazing toy.
While Agustin Almodovar takes pictures, Antonio Banderas and Victoria Abril hoist themselves up onto the cube to pose by their portraits; soon their director joins them. The three stand arm in arm, smiling and mugging. The pleasure Almodovar seems to be taking in the cube surprises me. Less than a month earlier, at the Madrid premiere of ''Atame!'', I'd watched him make his way through a shoving horde of photographers with the seasoned ennui of someone to whom the rituals of spectacular fame have become banal. Today he seems younger, less inured. It's as if, outside the heated spotlight of Madrid media attention, he has had a rare chance to contemplate just how extraordinary his professional ascent has been.
In only 10 years, Pedro Almodovar has gone from working for the Spanish telephone company and making underground Super 8 millimeter shorts to being hailed as the most important director in Spain, regularly compared with Luis Bunuel and occasionally with the painter Velazquez. At 38, Almodovar is Spain's undisputed cinematic darling; he is a star the way few American directors are stars - only Steven Spielberg comes to mind. The epitome of La Movida - the creative explosion that started in Madrid with the death of Franco, and has yet to slow down - he is routinely called upon to pose for magazine covers. It's a far cry from the days when he made movies on a shoestring and got decked out in black leather semi-drag to sing rock-and-roll songs with his friend Fabio, better known as Fanny McNamara.
Three years ago, ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' an effervescent comedy with a plot as difficult to map as the route chosen by a Madrid taxi driver, established his reputation on an international scale, becoming the biggest box-office hit in Spanish history and earning a sackful of prizes worldwide, including an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. Though somewhat more stylish than his earlier movies, ''Women on the Verge . . .'' exemplified the classic Almodovarean technique of blending kitsch, melodrama, fantasy and salacious humor into a nimble and assured exploration of human feeling: Gabriel Garcia Marquez crossed with John Waters crossed with Virginia Woolf. Almodovar knows how to create female characters that are finely nuanced and surprisingly complex. Like Hitchcock, he is also a master at depicting the life of objects: typewriters, blenders, answering machines. And then there are touches that show no influence, that belong only to Almodovar, such as the moment in which one of the ''Women on the Verge'' turns on the television news and finds it being read not, as usual, by a perky young woman, but by Almodovar's elderly mother, Francisca Caballero.
''Atame!'', which opens on May 4 in New York, may be his most controversial film yet. The story of a mental-hospital patient who kidnaps a porno- and horror-film actress in order to persuade her to fall in love with him, it begins as a hostage melodrama, then, after a series of thoroughly unpredictable turns, unfolds into a bizarre kind of love story. From the Hitchcockian opening to the Capraesque finale, the film never stops surprising, moving with fluid momentum toward a tear-jerker ending that verges on the comic but - at least the night I saw it - left most viewers in tears.
For Almodovar, ''Atame!'' represents the climax of what has been a decidedly unconventional career. Often scatological and sexually graphic, his early films were underground hits, popular with students and the denizens of after-hours clubs. It wasn't until the early 1980's that they began to attract the attention of the film-festival crowd, both at home and abroad. (His 1985 film ''What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' arrived in New York courtesy of the New Directors/New Films Festival, and was an instant word-of-mouth success.) With ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' Almodovar hit pay dirt. Suddenly the bad boy of the Movida was his country's most profitable cultural export.
PEDRO ALMODOVAR GREWJU up in a small village in La Mancha, that famous plain of Don Quixote's windmills. As a teen-ager, he moved to Madrid, where for 10 years he made his living working for the telephone company. It was a time of extraordinary cultural upheaval in Madrid, and Almodovar (pronounced ahl-moh-DOH-vahr) was at the center of it all, writing X-rated comics and ''foto-novelas,'' and singing. His involvement with the theater group Los Goliardos led him into film - Super-8 shorts that in 1980 gave way to his first feature, ''Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap.'' It was an appropriately underground film - Almodovar proudly calls it ''my dirtiest movie'' - more reminiscent of Warhol than of Hitchcock. He followed it two years later with ''Labyrinth of Passion,'' an intricately plotted comic book of a movie that featured among its characters the son and ex-wife of someone very much like the Shah of Iran, and a Laundromat owner who routinely rapes his daughter in the mistaken belief that she is his wife. The first Almodovar film I ever saw was his fourth, ''What Have I Done to Deserve This?'', about a speed-addicted Madrid cleaning woman who sells her son to a lecherous dentist and helps out her neighbor, a bubbly prostitute, when she needs to borrow a whip. Absurdism, yes; but Gloria, as played by Carmen Maura, is also a bewildered human voice calling out in frustration from the huge and depressing housing projects that circle Madrid. I remember feeling, as I left the theater, an exhilarated sense of discovery. Almodovar, it seemed to me, was the genius not just of Madrid, but of every large city.
''Even though I invent the stories I tell,'' he says, ''I put in a lot of details that belong to everyday life, which is why you could always argue that Madrid is one of the key elements in my films. I'm fascinated by the human fauna, by the life of the city, in which there is so much which is so modern, and at the same time lives are being lived as if it were still the 1950's, and things that look like they belong in the post-nuclear world.''
Almodovar is a burly, heavyset man with thick, black hair. He has a distinct fondness for Western American string ties. Like most Spaniards, he smokes a lot and waves his cigarette around in rhythm with his conversation. What surprises me the most when I meet him in Madrid just before the premiere of ''Atame!'', is how much less outrageous he is than his films. Even the setting of our interview - the expansive cafe at the Circulo de Bellas Artes, with its battered leather sofas and marble floors - seems designed to cast the director in a new light: not Almodovar the risque denizen of after-hours, but Almodovar the cultural figure, the intellectual, the artist. There is nothing remotely hortera about this cafe. Hortera is a Spanish word often used in connection with Almodovar's films; a cousin to ''kitsch,'' it's more easily exemplified than defined. (A good example is Placido Domingo and Julio Iglesias singing pop songs together.) It is the hortera side of life that his movies often celebrate; yet particularly in his later work, the most hortera details often carry the heaviest emotional weight - in the final scene of ''Atame!'', for instance, where an obscure, middlebrow Spanish song called ''Resistire'' (''I Will Survive'') provokes an intense emotional response.
In an essay about ''Atame!'', Almodovar explained the genesis of the film as coming out of dual impulses: on the one hand, the practical need to re-use the very expensive set he'd built for ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown''; and on the other a persistent affection, shared with his brother Agustin, for women-in-prison genre movies - movies with titles like ''Caged Heat,'' made with ''a good portion of meat, large doses of humor and not very much money.'' Always fascinated by the intentional artificiality of movie sets, he originally conceived a film in which three psychopaths, having escaped from prison, set up residence on the set of a ''grade Z terror movie'' that has just finished filming; to their surprise, the cast and crew return for a party, and the psychopaths are obliged to take the entire movie hostage. ''I love genre movies,'' says Almodovar, ''but at the same time I can't respect the rules of genre, so I often change genres in my own way. Normally I begin with something very kitsch, but as I develop my ideas they tend to take on more gravity. If you can see through that kitsch story of the movie set held hostage, you can see 'Atame!' '' For Almodovar, ''Atame!'' is a story about ''passion with conscience, passion digested with intelligence, which seems like a contradiction.'' The film's heroine, Marina (played with incandescent warmth by Victoria Abril), is a former prostitute and recovering heroin addict who has finally managed to make the leap from porno videos into just the sort of movie Almodovar and his brother wanted to parody. She is kidnapped by Ricky (Antonio Banderas), a patient in a mental hospital who, during a brief escape, once paid her for sex, and has been obsessed with her ever since. As the film progresses, kidnapper and hostage enact a bizarre parody of marriage - breakfasts in bed, arguments in the bathroom, a trip to the doctor (handcuffed, and with Ricky flashing a knife). When Marina tries to escape, Ricky ties her up, though tenderly. (He shops for the softest rope he can find.) ''The moment when Marina says 'tie me up,' '' says Almodovar, is ''the moment when she realizes she cannot live without love; at the same time she sees that she's accepting with love a whole lot of things she doesn't desire - the knowledge that Ricky's a little crazy and that the world they're going to live in together is a hostile one - but that are insolubly united with her passion for him. She cannot live without this passion, but at the same time she has to accept everything that goes with it. She doesn't say 'I love you'; she says, 'tie me up.' ''
Almodovar is an inveterate explainer; ferociously perfectionistic, he allows for no loose ends in his films, and is quick to offer a rationale for even the tiniest of details. The casting of his elderly mother as a newscaster in ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' for instance, was not for him merely a joke about the tendency of newscasters to be young and pretty, but was rather part of an elaborate scheme to create, for the film, a sort of idealized Madrid, ''a city in which even an old lady from a tiny village can end up getting a job as a newscaster.'' Such eloquent explanations usually make me suspicious of an artist, because they go so much against the grain of spontaneity, which is at the heart of creation; in Almodovar's case, however, one senses that the actual process by which he writes and films is less orchestrated and more accidental than his rationales might suggest.
Take, for example, the scene in his eloquent 1985 comedy ''What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' in which the heroine goes into a pharmacy to ask for No-Doz. The pharmacist, an enormous walrus of a woman with peroxided blond hair and huge, slitlike eyes, was in fact an actual pharmacist whom Almodovar happened upon while scouting locations. ''As soon as I saw her,'' Almodovar says, ''I knew I had to have her play the role.'' No wonder the chilly contempt with which she refuses to give Gloria the pills seems so real: it is real.
''Intuition'' is a word Almodovar uses a lot when describing what the film-making process is like for him. ''If I speak about the lives of psychiatrists or soldiers - not lives I know - I inform myself, and then create the fiction around what I've learned. Through intuition you can get in touch with all the elements of other human beings. The only unique things that we have are our own experiences, our own lives, which we live in ways that no other can be lived; but seen from outside, people are the same all over the world.''
Almodovar's special intuitive gift for seeing into the lives of women is ''a grace which God gave me,'' and something few male directors share. (He mentions Bergman.) Scenes in which women try on clothes together, put on make-up together, cook together abound in his films, and are usually marked by an affectionate tenderness that his contrasting tendency toward bawdy humor only throws into relief. When I ask him about George Cukor's famous comedy ''The Women,'' however, in which the men are literally absent, he hesitates to make too immediate a comparison. ''I love 'The Women,' and I love Cukor, but for me it's a film that has a very gay sensibility, a gay style. When I speak of women, I don't feel there's any gay sensibility implied. This isn't to say that I'm not gay, or that I don't think 'The Women' is a wonderful film, only that I take a different approach.''
For Almodovar, the notion that gay men have a greater capacity to see into the lives of women than straight men is ''ridiculous.'' Any artist can portray a life different from his own, he says, if he simply ''treats the subject naturally, and has enough documentation.'' Though he makes no bones about his own homosexuality, moreover, he has made only one film, ''Law of Desire,'' that deals directly with homosexual love relationships, and while the jealous triangle in which its three male protagonists find themselves locked is as compellingly and erotically portrayed as anything else in his work, one never has the sense that the characters' homosexuality in and of itself is the main subject. The only ''law'' that concerns the film's hero and his two lovers is desire itself.
Perhaps this is because the characters in the film live, like Almodovar himself, in an atmosphere in which homosexuality is so taken for granted that the choice between making a film with homosexual or heterosexual protagonists becomes a purely artistic one. A few days' stay in Almodovar's Madrid is remarkable for the sheer variety of people one encounters. At the opening-night party for ''Atame!'' the Princess of Lichtenstein is there, as are painters, government ministers and famous drag queens. Some are gay and some are straight; as in ''Law of Desire,'' no one seems to care much one way or the other.
THE LIVES OF WOMEN REMAIN ALMODOVAR'S artistic obsession, even on the occasions when he chooses to bend the rules of gender as well as genre. He himself appears in semi-drag with Fanny McNamara in ''Labyrinth of Passion.'' Carmen Maura, in ''Law of Desire,'' portrays a male-to-female transsexual who, having had the operation at the bequest of her lover/father and then been abandoned by him, swears off men and devotes herself to raising the child of a woman friend, played by a real-life transsexual (and Spanish television star), Bibi Andersen. Being a woman, in Almodovar's movies, is more a state of mind than a state of chromosomes.
To play all the women he invents, Almodovar draws on a loosely shaped company of actors, many of whom reappear throughout his films in radically different roles. The cubist-faced Rossy de Palma, for instance, is cast in ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' as a kind of innocent who loses her virginity in a dream, and in ''Atame!'' she is a Vespa-riding drug dealer who gives Antonio Banderas - her wide-eyed fiance in the earlier film - a savage beating. Then there is Carmen Maura, the most famous of what the Spanish press calls ''the Almodovar girls.'' Until 1989, Almodovar and Maura were an inseparable team. There was a feud, and a parting of the ways. For months their professional ''divorce'' obsessed the Spanish tabloids. No one was surprised, when he announced plans for ''Atame!'' that he had cast another actress in the lead role - the already highly regarded Victoria Abril, who had long professed her desire to work with him.
It is clear that Almodovar loves his actresses. The mention of each of their names brings a smile to his face and, characteristically, he has explanations for the appeal of each at his finger tips. I ask him who he considers the greatest actress in the world. ''Carmen Maura, of course, was a kind of perfect actress for me,'' he says. His face clouds over, as if in sorrowful contemplation of the break with Maura. What American actresses would he most like to direct? ''Diane Venora, Frances McDormand, Holly Hunter,'' he answers -a list as eclectic as it is interesting. Glenda Jackson is also mentioned as someone ''I would very much enjoy working with,'' as is Robert De Niro. He professes a passion for English and American novels: Jane Bowles's ''Two Serious Ladies'' repeatedly comes up in our conversations. Can it really be so long, then, until he makes a film in English? Well, there is talk of a television short on environmentalism, with Madonna in the role of a siren, as well as an adaptation of the British mystery writer Ruth Rendell's novel ''Live Flesh,'' to be co-written with Christopher Hampton (the adapter of ''Liaisons Dangereuses'').
But nothing is definite. Almodovar is being cautious, after years of struggle, even though he has at his finger tips the money and resources to make pretty much any film he likes. He has no studio executives to answer to; his brother, Agustin, produces his films through El Deseo, the company the two of them own and run together. He often uses his family in his movies: in ''Atame!'' his mother plays Marina's mother. Many people in Spain wonder why Almodovar has resisted the siren call of Hollywood for so long, and while he concedes he'd like very much to make a film in America, he tried but failed to get the rights to Fay Weldon's ''Life and Loves of a She-Devil,'' which ended up being made by Susan Seidelman with less than stellar results -he's also adamant about the necessity of waiting until he finds the right story and the right writer.
Through most of his career, Almodovar says, ''economic constraints have stimulated my creativity. That's part of the game, and one of the most exciting parts: adapting your reality, even money, to be able to create. When you shoot film, almost everything is full of life; the problems are full of life; the things that you can and cannot do are full of life. Far from placing limits on me, they are what excite me.''
For the moment, Almodovar seems content to rely on his own intuition in deciding what his next film will be, and where he'll make it. ''Film,'' he says, ''when it hits you, places you in a relationship with the future and the past. Even though you may be thinking about your own experiences, the inspiration of the scriptwriter combined with your experience leads you, without realizing it, to discover aspects of the future. Not that the film maker's a fortune teller, but for me writing and making films is a way of learning what I'll do next. In 'Atame!', Marina does a scene in the terror film she's making which predicts what will happen to her. It's not just a rehearsal; it's as if she were going to college to learn what was in store for her. And after 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,' a film about breakdown and abandonment and throwing things out the window, I found myself in the same situation in my personal life that I'd described in the film. Fiction for me supposes a period of learning - maybe it's learning how to suffer. Or maybe it's something as simple as learning about yourself.''
THERE IS NOTHINGJU in a writer's life that quite equals what a director has to endure at a film festival. At the news conference after the first Berlin screening of ''Atame!'' I try to imagine myself in the situation Almodovar has just lived through: standing around a lobby concession stand while, next door, in a giant auditorium, critics and publishers from all over the world read my book at the same time. Is it possible not to study the faces of those who walk out early? How terrible the last moments must be, waiting to hear whether the audience will applaud or - heaven forbid - boo. Things have not gone well for Almodovar today. First, technical problems halted the screening of ''Atame!'' midway through, and the audience had to wait a full five minutes before the movie got going again. Then there was the news conference, marred by inadequate and bad translation. Almodovar, flanked by Agustin, Abril, and Banderas, looked dazed by the barrage of criticism being fired at him; he didn't expect his film would make people angry. Some of the objections the critics have voiced are as ludicrous as they are vociferous - one complained that the film has too much ''homosexual imagery'' for a story of heterosexual love; then, when pressed for an example of ''homosexual imagery,'' noted that the hero wears tight jeans. Another asked if a television parody sequence about Germans retiring in Spain had been put in to please the audience in Berlin - a charge that both offended and baffled Almodovar.
After the news conference, Almodovar smokes on the windy sidewalks of Budapester Strasse. He seems annoyed and surprised by what he has heard. Not far off stands the cube, illuminated now, a reflection of how much the Spanish film industry has invested in Almodovar's success. I think of the glitzy gala that followed the Madrid opening: the fur coats and the jazz band and the pieces of ''Atame!'' jewelry on sale in the lobby (among them a heart-shaped pendant stuck with pins). Has Almodovar, I wonder, been overpromoted? Is the cube too big? If he'd made another ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' critics would probably have complained that he was resting on his laurels, that he wasn't challenging expectations enough.
Everything Almodovar has achieved, however, he has achieved through risk-taking; he has never been timid or shy. A few weeks later, word trickles back to me in America of ''what Almodovar did at the Goyas,'' Spain's equivalent of the Academy Awards. Carmen Maura, it seems, was the hostess, and Almodovar was presenting an award. They had neither seen nor spoken to each other in over a year. And right there, in front of millions of Spanish television viewers, Almodovar walked up to Maura and handed her a box. So many supposedly indestructible barriers have come down lately, he said, ''I wonder why the barrier between us can't come down.'' Inside the box was a piece of the Berlin wall.

BYLINE: By Michelle Vaughen

 BODY:
FOR MANY REMODELING veterans, Tom Hanks said it all in ''The Money Pit.'' ''Did you hear about that guy up in the Bronx?'' he asked in the film. ''Went crazy, thought he was a pigeon - they found him in the park throwing bread crumbs at himself. And he was just putting in a guest bathroom.''
As any survivor will tell you, even the smallest remodeling project can sorely test your sanity - and your solvency. Last year, while the average American house doddered toward its fourth decade, homeowners spent over $100 billion to spruce up their homes. Meanwhile, the rage for remodeling shows no sign of abating.
''We see the trend continuing at a three to five percent rate of growth,'' says Bryan Patchan, the executive director of the Remodelers' Council of the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. As the ranks of remodelers swell, cost has become a universal concern. ''Everyone cares. They all want to know what their choices are,'' confirms Alan Wanzenberg, an architect. Betty Sherrill, an interior designer, agrees. ''I don't think anybody just wants to throw money around.'' 
But how can a homeowner keep more of it in his own pocket? We asked the experts - 10 interior designers and architects in New York City whose tools of the trade are ingenious ideas. The advice that follows ranges from specific design solutions to general words of wisdom, all intended to help the remodeler skillfully skirt the money pit.
 
PETER PENNOYER
There's no denying the elegance of a marble floor - or the expense. But the architect Peter Pennoyer, of Pennoyer Turino Architects, has come up with an alternative, which he discovered in a building by Charles Platt, an American architect who worked from the 1890's through the 1920's. ''It's essentially a solid vinyl tile - say, in black - with inlaid aluminum, steel or brass squares,'' he explains. ''It's incredibly simple and very elegant.'' Installation will be easier if the tiles are bought ''corner key cut,'' and will cost about $20 a square foot. A marble-tiled floor runs about $40 a square foot; a slab marble one, about $70. (All prices listed include labor.) Since substantial door frames are hard to come by, Pennoyer suggests creating your own - from stock ceiling moldings. ''They make more impressive, sculptural door frames than the puny things being sold,'' he says. And they are cheaper than having something custom designed and carved.''
To cure the too-tall syndrome of many a Manhattan hallway, consider a picture rail, says Pennoyer. Instead of dropping the ceilings to improve the look, a simple molding can be added at an eight-foot height and the walls above it painted a different color. ''This gives you a lower reference point without going through the expense [about $10 a square foot, including construction] of lowering the ceiling,'' he explains.
 
BUNNY WILLIAMS
Kitchens can take quite a bite out of any remodeler's budget. When your sights are set on Corian, a tough, high-quality synthetic composite that resembles marble, the counter top dilemma alone can be daunting. Bunny Williams suggests a compromise. ''Around the sink and other wet areas, I use Corian; for the rest of the counter tops I use a hardwood like maple or walnut,'' the designer says. ''It's a wonderful look, it's easy to install and less expensive than doing the whole thing in stone.'' She estimates that this solution can cut a third off the cost of the all-Corian alternative, which would run about $4,000 to $5,000.
Cabinets are another big-ticket item. When dealing with a kitchen cabinet shop, custom cabinetry can easily run over $10,000. Before settling for stock cabinets, however, Williams recommends speaking to an independent carpenter. ''In my house in the country in Connecticut, it was cheaper for me to have my cabinets made by a carpenter I knew than to buy the top-of-the-line stock ones,'' she says. The key is simplicity: Hers have a straight front door with a simple stock molding around the edge. The total cost for the kitchen was about $4,000.
''Any time you're in a budget situation,'' she advises, ''take the time to understand what every single thing is going to cost - before construction starts. Then set your priorities. Is a big new window going to make the living room perfect? If so, then maybe you can live with tile instead of marble in the bathroom.''
 
ROBERT BRAY
Before casting out a cast-iron bathtub, take a second look: It might merit a new finish, advises Robert Bray of Bray-Schaible. The designer points out that the best new resurfacing materials often resist dripping-water stains better than the original porcelain. Today's nonabrasive cleansers have also lengthened the life of the redone tub. The project will cost about $400; to buy and install a new bathtub can run up to $1,500 or more.
Rather than putting in elaborate recessed lighting to brighten a room, Bray suggests a simpler solution: the lamp. ''We went through a period where people hated freestanding lamps; now that's not an issue anymore,'' he says. Sidestepping major electrical work can translate into considerable savings.
In general, says Bray, keep in mind the high cost of labor, which he stresses can amount to 70 percent of a remodeling budget. ''When you pick a less expensive material - ceramic tile rather than marble, for example - you need to look at the cost of installing it. You might not be saving anything.''
He suggests having a general contractor do a detailed budget with a cost breakdown of all the materials and the labor by trades. ''Get pricing on all your ideas, even if you think you'd like to do some rooms later on,'' he adds. ''It might turn out to be more economical to do the things that fall within a particular trade all at once.''
 
VICTORIA HAGAN
Enlarging a small, dark dining room is the kind of project that seems destined to become a financial drain. To open up a ceiling and knock down walls in order to expand the room, for instance, can run up to $50,000 or more. Consider, instead, putting in french doors and a patio, as Victoria Hagan of Feldman Hagan Interiors did in a client's home. ''The french doors brought a great deal more light into the dining room, and the patio extended the entertaining area,'' says the designer. The cost for the project came to $10,000.
Rather than replacing crusty old moldings with ornate plaster ones -a proposition that can wind up costing up to $10,000, even in the smallest apartment - she suggests having them antiqued. ''I hired a special-effects artist to do the gilding, which cost about $2,500, and gave the moldings a lot of character.''
Hagan also advises taking a careful look at any prewar bathroom before bringing in the demolition team. Something can often be salvaged - a pedestal sink, for example, or vintage wall tiles that just need to be regrouted. And in every remodeling project, she cautions, don't be tempted to compromise on craftsmanship. ''In the long run, people are very unhappy with shoddy workmanship.''
 
LEE MINDEL
To shed light on a living room, Lee Mindel of Shelton, Mindel & Associates prefers uplights or sconces to track lighting, which can ''look tacky in an old house.'' But if you are already installing new moldings in the room and want to avoid the expensive rewiring work for the lights, he suggests simply tucking the wires under the new moldings nearby: ''Moldings can hide a multitude of sins.''
So can burlap. He recommends applying either that fabric or linen to walls that are not in great shape, then painting over it. ''It hides the bumps and gives the room a nice texture,'' he says. And it saves the cost of having the walls scraped and replastered.
In the kitchen, it may not be necessary to replace all the cabinets, says Mindel. ''You can face a kitchen with new cabinet doors, instead of ripping out the whole cabinet, and it will look like new.'' His source for inexpensive doors: IKEA, a Swedish store with four branches in the United States, including one in suburban Philadelphia. ''Their cabinet doors are very Scandinavian in feeling: nice, clean, generic.''
In Mindel's opinion, keeping everything as generic as possible is generally a good way to go when remodeling on a budget. ''Don't try to make something look too designed-up,'' he says. ''It will only appear fake and pretentious.''
 
SAM BLOUNT
In the cover-up category of remodeling, ''tenting'' a room stands out as the ultimate example. The idea, explains Sam Blount of Irvine & Fleming, is to drape floor-length panels of fabric from a rod that runs around the perimeter of a room at ceiling height. The fabric is then pulled back like curtains at doorways and windows, or left hanging in front of closets to substitute for doors. ''Obviously, that cuts the costs of buying curtains or repairing walls,'' says the designer. ''It's one of those things that can be interesting, if it's applicable to your space.''
When adding on appears to be the only option, perhaps it isn't, he notes. ''Make sure you evaluate your existing space properly,'' says Blount. ''An attic, for example, can be the most interesting space in the house.'' And the cheapest to remodel. Finishing an attic can cost as little as $8,000.
According to Blount, the very best savings may come from the money spent up front on good advice. ''It would be better to spend $10,000 to get the right advice from an architect or designer,'' he says, ''even if that meant spending $10,000 less on the project itself.''
 
ALAN WANZENBERG
Rather than renovate an attic during the course of a remodeling, remove it, suggests the architect Alan Wanzenberg of Jed Johnson, Alan Wanzenberg & Associates. ''By opening up a ceiling and eliminating the attic,'' he says, ''you can capture a lot of space.'' New bracing materials allow rafters to be placed farther apart, which can give cathedral-type ceilings an even airier look. Then, instead of drywalling, leave the walls and beams exposed. Wanzenberg redid one house this way at a cost of about $8,000. (He cautions, however, that structural research is required to make sure this type of construction is feasible for your home.) For a more decorative change, Wanzenberg recommends a new breed of top-of-the-line wallpaper, which makes that classic alternative to replastering and painting more affordable. Historically, the best wallpapers were hand-blocked or painted in England or France, and they were also the most expensive. ''Now, there are some really great machine-made wallpapers that simulate hand-blocked prints,'' he reports. His to-the-trade sources in New York City: Arthur Sanderson & Sons and Cole & Sons, through Clarence House.
Still, the most effective way to circumvent a cost crisis, says the architect, is to work out all remodeling ideas in the early stages - first in drawings and then a three-dimensional model. After all, he says, ''It's far cheaper to make changes on paper than in the field.''
 
VICENTE WOLF
Clever techniques that trick the eye can also shrink the budget. Take a small, flat door at the end of a hallway: To turn it into a grander entrance, the costly solution might be to extend the doorway up to the ceiling. Instead, says the designer Vicente Wolf, simply mirror the door, the frame and the wall above and around it. This makes the door appear larger, at minimal cost (about $500 to $700).
Similarly, when the idea of a marble floor is appealing but the price isn't, he suggests having a wooden floor painted. ''With this trompe l'oeil technique, you can avoid the expense of tearing out the old floor and laying in a new marble one,'' he says, ''but you still achieve the look.'' An artist's services run about $15 a square foot, not including preparation of the floor. Wolf's recommendation: Serpentine Studio in Manhattan.
A sure cure for a dark room on the top story is to put in a skylight, but the cost of cutting through the ceiling (about $3,500) may rule it out. Another idea, says Wolf, is to create an interior window between the dark room and a brighter adjoining one. Light from the second room will filter through the glass, which can either be set high in the wall or frosted for privacy. The proposition will cost about $1,200.
 
BETTY SHERRILL
Big, beautiful windows often rank high on a remodeler's priority list - until he prices them. In the larger sizes, custom windows are costly and stock ones can be scarce. Betty Sherrill of McMillen, Inc. has found a way around this dilemma. ''I have wonderful 8-foot-tall windows in my house, which are actually sliding doors,'' says the designer. ''They saved a lot of money.'' Her 4-foot-by-8-foot glass doors, including a track, cost about $170 each.
To give a room a little extra space - when only a little extra is needed - Sherrill recommends a bay window. ''One of my clients had a medium-sized combined dining and living room,'' she explains. ''For dinner parties, she wanted to be able to seat two tables of eight, but couldn't quite do it.'' Instead of adding another room - which can easily run up to $100 to $200 a square foot - the designer's solution was to knock out a wall and put in a bay window. ''It did the trick,'' she says. The cost of the project: about $6,000. Using a stock bay window, which can be found in various styles and sizes, is even less expensive.
 
JOHN SALADINO
When it comes time to liberate walls from a particularly offensive wallpaper, think twice before repapering them, says the designer John Saladino. ''Once you get down to the original plaster that's been discolored by the glue, just leave it,'' he suggests. ''That kind of corroded surface can be extremely beautiful.'' He recommends lightly sanding and washing the walls, then covering the woodwork with a high-gloss paint that picks up on the background shade of the old plaster. Other than the labor, the cost is negligible.
To disguise an ugly radiator, Saladino suggests an inexpensive solution: creating a folding screen out of stock shutters. They can be bought from a lumber yard for about $15 each and painted. Or, for those suffering from paint phobia, he recommends finishing with Minwax Antique Oil, a sealer with a stain.
As far as window treatments go, Saladino's suggestion is the cheapest yet: ''If you don't like your draperies, throw them out. It's wonderful to live with windows that are open and exposed.''

HEADLINE: A MORE PERFECT UNION

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger

 BODY:
THE VERY IDEA OF a face lift goes against the grain of most architects' thinking. Their instincts lean much more toward all-out plastic surgery, reshaping the body to take on a whole different cast. That is, if they are willing to keep the old body at all. Throwing it out and starting from scratch probably gets closer to their way of doing things.
Architects, so the common wisdom goes, want to remake the world, or at least as much of it as they can get their hands on. It's been true enough in the past, but has become less and less so in the last decade, as the architectural profession has been forced to face twin realities: the growing preference in our society both for preserving older buildings and for renovating what we have, rather than starting over again. Renovation is usually, though not always, cheaper than new construction, which makes it especially appealing in an age of monetary constraints. So it is partly a matter of esthetics, partly economics and partly common sense that have brought us here. But we are clearly at a moment when few architects dare to treat a renovation project as if it were a blank slate. 
A generation ago, architects were taught that their mission was to leave a mark, and often, the stronger the better. New buildings were designed to stand out from their surroundings; renovations of older ones were done so that no one could fail to see the difference between the original and the addition. Even architects whose careers began relatively recently tended to operate this way. Think, for example, of Michael Graves, the Princeton, N.J.-based architect who in the late 1960's and early 70's first came into public view through the striking modernist additions he put onto older houses (which led some colleagues to dub him the ''Cubist kitchen king''). The very point of Graves's additions was to stand apart from the houses to which they were attached. They were highly abstract objects, possessed of far more sophistication than the original houses, and their aloofness was part of the architectural message. ''You are common, but I am something much more special,'' the additions seemed to sneer at the houses.
The attitude of Graves's early years was hardly his alone. At the beginning of the 70's, the New York City firm of Mayers & Schiff designed an addition to an old clapboard farmhouse in Connecticut in the form of a two-story-high cedar and glass box. Lest there be any mistake about the transition from new to old, the box was set at a diagonal from the original house and wrapped around one of its corners, the new literally encasing the old.
Even Robert A. M. Stern, an architect whose career has soared in the last decade, largely due to his success in reproducing traditional architectural styles, nonetheless felt that he could not afford to let his own work disappear beside that of another architect. At least that is what one major addition he completed in 1981 would suggest. The house is a huge Georgian-style mansion in Llewelyn Park, N.J.; the addition, which contains an indoor pool, is best described as something of an English Baroque pleasure pavilion with a greenhouse roof. And while it picks up a few details from the original house, no one could say it blends in softly.
IT IS TEMPTING TO think of the whole issue in terms of ego, given how much, even today, our image of the architect is shaped by such fictitious characters as Howard Roark in the Ayn Rand novel ''The Fountainhead.'' Her architect-hero stands defiantly against bourgeois taste, and would sooner burn his T-square than design a building that took its cues from anyone else's. But for all we might want to see the architect as a romantic hero - for all architects might want to see themselves as such - the truth is that most architecture is shaped by the prevailing taste of an age.
As a matter of fact, ego has relatively little to do with it. Indeed, in recent years some of the biggest egos in architecture have begun to do some of the most restrained work. Kevin Roche, who gave us the monumental additions to The Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 70's - wings whose glass and limestone forms contrast sharply with the classical, older sections of the Met - recently designed an addition to the Jewish Museum on Fifth Avenue that is simply an exact reproduction of the museum's original French Gothic mansion. The addition, which will go into construction later this year, is conceived as if to blend new and old into a seamless whole.
Similarly, Romaldo Giurgola, a winner of the American Institute of Architects' highest award, has proposed adding to Louis I. Kahn's Kimbell Museum of Art in Fort Worth by literally extending its design at each end. That project hasn't been received as well as the Roche plan, largely because the Kimbell, unlike the Jewish Museum, is considered to be one of the great works of American architecture. Tampering with it at all, even by replicating the original, has been viewed by many critics as akin to adding a few strokes to a Caravaggio.
These two examples are extreme ones, of course. Precisely duplicating what has come before is hardly the only mode of the hour, particularly for public buildings. But it is being done more and more. And the fact that architects of Giurgola's stature, or Roche's, would consider replicating sections of older buildings tells us how much architectural values have changed.
In the last few years, there has been less hubris in architectural design, less of the arrogant certainty that we can do much better than the architects of earlier generations, and much less of the patronizing attitude toward tradition that for many architects was the motivation for breaking away from the old style when designing a renovation or addition. The original building was there first - a simple fact, but one that today has come to earn it a certain degree of respect. We do not condescend to Georgian or Tudor or Shingle Style houses the way we once did. And we are much more likely now to understand how good the average, traditionally styled American house built before 1940 really is. Architects today know better than to treat it with scorn.
MORE THAN INSISTENT originality, we seek a kind of wholeness now, a sense that a building is part of a larger continuity. And if that means the architect is going to be able to express his or her own design sensibility slightly less, we seem to feel that it is a fair trade-off. By the same token, an expanded or renovated house need not look merely like a bigger version of what was there before. But it should take its cues from the original building. Sometimes those cues can be interpreted literally; in other circumstances, it makes more sense to let the original building set a tone, a direction to which the second architect can respond. If architecture can be thought of as a conversation, the new architect entering the house doesn't need to repeat the words of the first architect - but he or she at least ought to be speaking the same language.
A couple of recent examples: In Larchmont, N.Y., in 1987, the architects Karen Bausman and Leslie Gill of Bausman-Gill Associates completed a two-story modernist addition to a tiny one-story stucco cottage. To have the extra space they wanted yet still preserve several valued trees on the small plot, the addition had to be two stories tall. Had it imitated the Arts and Crafts style of the cottage, it would have risked overwhelming the original building. But the finished addition appears neither to dominate the cottage nor to be incompatible with it. Bausman-Gill used the same material, stucco, as in the original building and similar steel casement windows, allowing the cottage to initiate the conversation, so to speak. The result is a deft marriage of old and new, the whole being both comfortable and visually richer than either section could be on its own.
Similarly, the San Francisco architect Mark Mack took a less literal direction in his addition to a rough-concrete modern house of the 60's, set high in the hills of Berkeley, Calif. Mack's own work has a blunt, almost primitive quality to it, which created a certain compatibility at the outset. But the addition, completed in 1988, stands out sharply from the original building: Its stucco walls are painted a rusty red with indigo-blue trim, and it reads as a powerful sculptural presence on its own. Still, it was not built to stand alone, and doesn't. The addition and the original house strengthen each other, forming a complex and vivid whole. (Mack considered a scheme that was more literally derived from the original house, and left it up to the clients to decide how assertive they wanted him to be. He was pleased with their decision; the other scheme, he felt, was too accommodating.) While the version that was built is hardly indifferent to the original building, it strikes out independently - yet in a way that relates continually to the original, engaging it in a vibrant architectural dialogue.
The conversation is quieter on Long Island, where David Hannaford Mitchell transformed a huge white clapboard farmhouse in Remsenburg into a rambling but vastly more genteel house. The changes Mitchell made are quite dramatic. He took a bland building and refined it, adding shutters, multipaned windows, a cornice and decks framed in subtly detailed latticework. Inside, the rooms were reorganized to flow gracefully into one another. The result, which was finished in 1987, is a lively and energetic composition that manages not to be overrefined or precious. The basic strength of the big old farmhouse is still there: It has been dressed up on the outside and opened up inside to just the right degree to bring out its architectural potential.
And so it is with all of the best renovations. They do not defy or sneer at the buildings to which they are appended, but support them. Sometimes buildings are supported best simply by being continued or extended, sometimes by being altered quite dramatically. The point is that whatever is done, it is the original building that sets the tone.

Boycott A.T.&T. Donate your old tires to a playground. Buy shares in a recycling company. Save your used cans to hold nails. Boycott General Electric. Dose up on vitamins. Take a vacation in your own town. Boycott Weyerhaeuser. Don't buy hair spray, make your own from a boiled lemon.
These prescriptions have a common purpose. Not, as you might suppose, to save pennies for your piggy bank, but to save the world from ecological disaster. They are culled from the parade of books with which the publishing industry is giving its lock-step salutation to April 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
The prescriptions are of course quite dotty. Even if we all gummed up our hair with lemon juice spray, helped turn our local playground into a used-tire dump and took our vacations around it, leaving our nails at home in used tin cans, while praying for our recycling company to escape Chapter 11, but forbearing to call our broker on A.T.&T., these hair-shirt exertions would leave the environment little better off. Still, one must admire the spirit that drives the recommendations for such complicated life styles.
Earth Day 1970 marked the emergence of the environmental movement as a potent force in American politics. A cascade of landmark laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, were soon passed. Earth, air and water are far cleaner as a result, even if still far from pristine. Any who doubt their deep debt to the environmental movement have only to travel to Eastern Europe, where for the past 40 years the environment has yielded to the production norms of central planners. The Danube is a sewer, the Vistula's waters too polluted even for industrial use, and a pall of choking soot and sulfur dioxide eats away at leaves and lungs from Saxony to Silesia. The United States once risked these excesses too, but then an open political system responded to citizens' protests.
The environmental movement in the United States is broadly based and covers a wide political spectrum. Most of the works under review are handbooks for citizen action. They are written more to exhort the troops to battle than to offer dispassionate analysis. The general formula is to establish quickly that everyone is in imminent peril - from toxic waste dumps, indoor pollution, electromagnetic waves, the greenhouse effect or pesticides - then proceed to list possible remedies.
The general fault is a lack of perspective. The writers give little or no space to the considerable improvements already made or under way.
None attempt to establish priorities, grade the risks or compare them with accepted hazards in everyday life. The gloom and doom are surely self-defeating because most readers will soon be overwhelmed by the dangers on all sides and throw up their hands.
Jon Naar, the author of DESIGN FOR A LIVABLE PLANET: HOW YOU CAN HELP CLEAN UP THE ENVIRONMENT (Harper & Row, cloth, $25.95; paper, $12.95), presents his case clearly, with well-devised tables. He usefully lists ways to reduce energy use in the home. But he sometimes lapses into relentless exaggeration. In ''virtually any urban area you live in, the air you take in every five seconds almost certainly does not meet federal standards,'' proclaims the chapter on air pollution. It's true that 135 million Americans live in areas that fail one or more of the six Federal air quality standards. But the book doesn't mention that an area fails the smog standard if even one of its air quality monitors shows an excess pollutant for four hours per year. Obviously that does not mean, as the author seems to think, that every breath you take is polluted.
FIGHTING TOXICS: A MANUAL FOR PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY, COMMUNITY, AND WORKPLACE, edited by Gary Cohen and John O'Connor (Island Press, cloth, $31.95; paper, $19.95), may be useful if you live near a toxic dump, as many people do. It has clear chapters on environmental law and citizens' rights. It is not so clear on quantifying the risk from toxic dumps. Given the witch's brew of poisonous chemicals contained in many dumps, the health of the surrounding populations is surprisingly untouched, at least on present evidence. But from the first sentence onward - ''uncontrolled toxic chemicals and wastes have reached crisis proportions'' - this book aims to alarm, not assuage.
CLEARER, CLEANER, SAFER, GREENER: A BLUEPRINT FOR DETOXIFYING YOUR ENVIRONMENT by Gary Null (Villard, $18.95) deals with everything from the greenhouse effect to electromagnetic radiation. There's a lot of information, but essentially the book offers a ride through a house of horrors. ''American agriculture is teetering on the brink of disaster and getting more vulnerable every day. This is not meant to be an alarmist statement,'' Mr. Null remarks, ''but it is intended to get your attention.'' Now we are attending, what is the solution to all these daunting problems? Well, the environment of course is almost beyond saving, so the best you can do, Mr. Null explains, is to safeguard your own health - by eating more vitamins.
SAVING THE EARTH: A CITIZEN'S GUIDE TO ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION by Will Steger and Jon Bowermaster (Knopf, paper, $19.95) is perhaps the best in this category. It is carefully written, with reasoned suggestions for action and informative diagrams. The authors prefer to build a case for their views rather than bludgeon the reader into submission. They even welcome economic growth: ''The key to saving the rain forests rests in helping Third World nations achieve sustainable development.''
A large amount of mostly practical advice on pesticides, recycling, drinking water, and actions to avert ozone layer thinning and climate change is to be found in EARTHRIGHT by H. Patricia Hynes (Prima, cloth, $24.95; paper, $12.95).
Those prepared to accept full responsibility for the earth's plight will learn in THE GREEN LIFESTYLE HANDBOOK, edited by Jeremy Rifkin (Holt, paper, $10.95), how their personal choices in everyday life impinge on the planet. Indeed, the authors write, every dollar spent in the supermarket ''is a vote for or against the environment.'' Correct living requires using cold water in the kitchen whenever possible, starting a compost heap and watering the lawn only at night. Consumption, the economists' measure of success, is this handbook's bugaboo, despite its focus on middle-class living. All of our raw materials - food, wood, minerals - it warns, ''are either grown on mechanized, chemical-intensive 'farms' or extracted from the earth by oil-guzzling machines. The result is irreversible topsoil erosion, deforestation, water pollution, and the release of billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.'' So should we abandon mining and farming? The authors of the handbook put up no resistance to the logical thrust of their principles - that humankind would do best to revert to the cave, or maybe the monastery.
There is little analysis in CALL TO ACTION: HANDBOOK FOR ECOLOGY, PEACE, AND JUSTICE (Sierra Club, paper, $14.95). The editor, Brad Erickson, believes that a corporate conspiracy controls the Government and exploits both the environment and the poor so that the elite may grow rich. Naturally, ''we cannot trust politicians or lobbyists to halt the destruction of the Earth for us.'' Strangely, this book is sponsored by the Sierra Club, which maintains a powerful and effective lobbying arm.
In a more serious category is THE GREENHOUSE TRAP: WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND HOW WE CAN SLOW GLOBAL WARMING by Francesca Lyman with Irving Mintzer, Kathleen Courrier and James MacKenzie (Beacon, cloth, $21.95; paper, $9.95), which offers a detailed but approachable analysis of a single issue. But is the globe really warming? Most climatologists believe there is utterly inadequate evidence that greenhouse-induced warming has yet begun - a point that might have received more emphasis in a book of this quality. The authors, from the World Resources Institute, also equivocate in discussing nuclear power, which, since it produces no greenhouse gases, should be considered by any serious prophet of greenhouse warming.
All the books under review are earnest attempts to get people involved in protecting the environment. They therefore contribute to a noble and necessary cause. Even if some of their recommendations seem quixotic, there is surely value in getting people to think about how their patterns of consumption affect the environment.
The danger of these books is their lack of discrimination. In portraying all environmental threats as equally and utterly hazardous, they overstate the case and, worse, fail to set priorities. The public is thus encouraged to waste money in abating catchy-sounding but lesser evils, such as toxic dumps or offshore sludge dumping, while ignoring more serious pollutants, such as radon in homes and chemical runoff from farms.
Earth Day 1970 was the harbinger of stirring victories for cleaner air and water. These books offer little guide to the far more complex issues that lie beyond Earth Day 1990.

HEADLINE: NOTES FROM MY BED OF GLOOM: OR, WHY THE JOKING HAD TO STOP

BYLINE: By KURT VONNEGUT; Kurt Vonnegut is a novelist who has lived and worked in New York City since 1970; his most recent novel is ''Bluebeard.''

 BODY:
For whatever reason, American humorists or satirists or whatever you want to call them, those who choose to laugh rather than weep about demoralizing information, become intolerably unfunny pessimists if they live past a certain age. If Lloyds of London offered policies promising to compensate comical writers for losses of senses of humor, its actuaries could count on such a loss occurring, on average, at age 63 for men, and for women at 29, say.
My generalization is happily or unhappily confirmed by scholarship: in a book called ''Punchlines'' (Paragon House, 1990) by William Keough of the English department of Fitchburg State College in Massachusetts. The subtitle is ''The Violence of American Humor.'' Mr. Keough, by means of essays on Mark Twain, Ring Lardner, Ambrose Bierce, myself, comedians in the movies (both silents and talkies) and radio and TV and nightclub comics right up to the present, persuades me that the most memorable jokes by Americans are responses to the economic and physical violence of this society. ''How often does it seem that the American humorist, having set out daringly and lightly as an amused observer of the American spectacle of violence and corruption, ends up mouthing sardonic fables in a bed of gloom,'' he writes. 
So guess what: my next novel, ''Hocus Pocus,'' to be published next September, is a sardonic fable in a bed of gloom. Inevitable. ''Violence, the inspiration of much American humor, outlives it,'' says Mr. Keough. ''When the jokes grow cold, the guns - unfortunately -are still hot.''
Mark Twain finally stopped laughing at his own agony and that of those around him. He denounced life on this planet as a crock. He died. He hadn't lived long enough to hear about nuclear weapons. He was dead as a doornail before he could even hear about World War I. Jokes work this way: the jokester frightens the listener just a little bit, by mentioning something challenging, such as sex or physical danger, or suggesting that the listener is having his or her intelligence tested or whatever. Step two: the jokester makes clear that no intelligent response is required of the listener. This leaves the listener stuck with useless fight-or-flee chemicals in his or her bloodstream, which must be got rid of somehow, unless he or she wants to slug the jokester or do jumping jacks or whatever.
What he or she most likely will do is expel those chemicals through the lungs with quick expansions and contractions of the chest cavity, accompanied by grotesque facial expressions and barking sounds.
Intelligence test: ''Why did the chicken cross the road?'' Sex: ''A traveling salesman's car broke down on a country road on a stormy night. He knocked on a farmer's door, and the farmer said, 'You can spend the night, but you'll have to sleep with my daughter.' '' Physical danger: ''A man fell off a cliff. Halfway down he grabbed a sapling. So there he was, hanging by his hands, with certain death a thousand feet below him.''
But jokesters are all through when they find themselves talking about challenges so real and immediate and appalling to their listeners that no amount of laughter can make the listeners feel safe and perfectly well again. I found myself doing that on a speaking tour of campuses in the spring of 1989, and canceled all future engagements. That wasn't at all what I enjoyed doing to audiences, and yet there I was doing it. I wondered out loud onstage, for instance, what I and my brother and sister and our parents might have done if we had been German citizens when Hitler came to power. Any reply would be moot, but almost certainly depressing. And then I said that the whole world faced a problem far worse than the rise of another Hitler, which was our destruction of the planet as a life-supporting apparatus of delicate and beautiful complexity.
I said that one day fairly soon we would all go belly up like guppies in a neglected fishbowl. I suggested an epitaph for the whole planet, which was: ''We could have saved it, but we were too darn cheap and lazy.'' It really was time to quit. My Lord, I think I even said - in fact I know I said - that humanity itself had become an unstoppable glacier made of hot meat, which ate up everything in sight and then made love, and then doubled in size again. I topped that off with a stage aside to the effect that the Pope in Rome was sure of no help when it came to slowing down the meat. Enough! It seemed possible to me, though, that I might still be amusing on paper, hooking people with little barbless hooks, and then letting them off again. Writing a book, after all, is a slow and deliberate activity, like making flowered wallpaper for a ballroom by hand. Since I knew how jokes worked, hooking and releasing, I could still make them, even though I no longer felt like making them. I remembered that my father got sick of being an architect, when he was about 10 years younger than I am, actually, but he went on doing architecture.
As a good friend pointed out to me one time, my ideas have everything but originality. That was my fate. So I came up with the wholly unoriginal idea of writing a ''Don Quixote'' set in modern times. There might be a certain amount of freshness to my tale, I hoped, if I gave an affectionate razzing to what had long been my dream of an ideal citizen. Although Mr. Keough doesn't say so, I think all American humorists, when saying how flawed American citizens really are, would not be interested in doing that if they did not have clear images in their heads of what American citizens ought to be. Dreams of ideal citizens are as essential to our humorists, in my opinion, as they were to Karl Marx and Thomas Jefferson.
But it didn't come out very funny. There wasn't any way to let readers off the hook, off the Montauk Umbrella of modern times.
A Montauk umbrella is a fishing rig favored by sports fishermen putting out to sea in motor yachts from the easternmost town on the South Fork of Long Island. It is like the spread ribs of an umbrella stripped of its cloth and handle. At the tip of each rib is a steel wire leader. At the end of each leader is a counterfeit squid made of off-white surgical tubing. Sticking out through a slit in each tube is a hook with a barb so big and sharp that any bluefish or bass that strikes at it or any other lure in the fast-moving galaxy of seeming tasty tidbits can never get off again.
There is no contemporary equivalent to the unhooking device Mark Twain was able to use with success before World War I and World War II and all the rest of it, at the end of possibly the blackest of all well-known American comic novels, ''Huckleberry Finn.'' This, of course, was the unhooking: Huck, resourceful and tough and adorable, and with most of his life still ahead of him, says he is going to ''light out for the Territory.''
Rocky Flats, Colo., maybe? Or how about Hanford, Wash., or the shores of Prince William Sound in Alaska? Or how about lighting out for Twain's own intended destination when he himself lit out from Hannibal - the virgin wilderness of the Amazon?

THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA
Origins and Development of National Policy, 1960-1972.
By Hugh Davis Graham.
578 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press.
$29.95.
Among the many millions of Americans for whom the dramas of Little Rock and Selma tell the rarest tales of heroism, only a handful have ever heard of Executive Order 10925 or Revised Order No. 4. 
It is Hugh Davis Graham's claim in ''The Civil Rights Era'' that such little-known rulings - the first, a 1961 order from President John F. Kennedy that introduced the term ''affirmative action''; the second, a 1971 order requiring affirmative action goals and timetables for women - lie at the heart of the true civil rights revolution. In Mr. Graham's account, the real heroes of that revolution are the mandarins of the executive agencies who turn the dreams of the charismatic leaders into the boilerplate of policy.
The enduring significance of civil rights policy making in the 1960's, the focus of Mr. Graham's account, has been pointedly questioned by contemporary historians. It was easy enough to secure formal legal equality for blacks, these revisionists argue, since that left whites unthreatened, but real change meant giving blacks more than the vote and a seat at the lunch counter. It meant securing political and economic power for blacks, guaranteeing them places in schools and factories and executive suites, even - necessarily - at the expense of whites.
At that, however, the people and the politicians balked. What about ''innocent'' whites, Representative Peter Rodino asked James Farmer, then head of the Congress of Racial Equality, in a colloquy about preferential treatment during hearings on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. ''You see,'' Mr. Farmer replied, ''none of us are really innocent.'' Countless times since, versions of this dialogue have been replayed, but Mr. Farmer's reply has never won popular acceptance. In 1964, some lawmakers unsuccessfully tried to write affirmative action out of the legislation. And while in the 1970's the bureaucrats slipped it in through the back door of administrative regulation, the Reagan Administration and recently the United States Supreme Court have overturned rules that define racial justice by the numbers.
The revisionists recite this recent history to show that the landmark events of the 1960's were merely symbolic. Not so, argues Mr. Graham, a professor of history and policy sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ''In normally stable, centrist America, the civil rights movement stands out from the continuities of workaday government as a rare and stunning achievement of liberation.''
The almost-forgotten stories from this second Reconstruction bolster Mr. Graham's argument. It seems more like a millennium than only a generation ago that a Congressman could worry aloud, as did Howard W. Smith of Virginia in 1964, about the plight of a podiatrist obliged to work on black feet as well as white feet: ''If I were cutting corns, I would want to know whose feet I would have to be monkeying around with. I would want to know whether they smelled good or bad.'' And it is startling that, in 1962, one of President Kennedy's chief civil rights enforcers could throw a banquet to honor segregation-minded Senator Richard Russell, gathering 1,300 guests, all of them white, in a segregated Atlanta hotel.
These events are worth recalling, even if Mr. Graham's narcotizing prose scarcely does them justice. And the painstaking detail of the narrative, while breaking no new intellectual ground, should reacquaint a new generation with forgotten truths.
Usefully, ''The Civil Rights Era'' links together Federal efforts to secure equal treatment for the races and for the sexes. Statutory provisions guaranteeing women fair treatment translated into jobs for those who discovered the personal and legal power of liberation. Mr. Graham records the plaintive query of an airlines executive: ''What are we going to do now when a gal walks into our office, demands a job as an airline pilot and has the credentials to qualify? Or what will we do when some guy comes in and wants to be a stewardess?'' Soon enough, of course, American business learned the answer.
Instructive, too, is Mr. Graham's assessment of Presidential leadership. Cautious and calculating, John F. Kennedy was far from being a civil rights crusader; his famous telephone call, in the midst of the 1960 campaign, to Coretta King when Martin Luther King Jr. was imprisoned in Georgia won him critical votes, but as President he ran from the issue. When Kennedy's promise to end discrimination in Federally subsidized housing ''with the stroke of a pen'' went unmet, gleeful Republicans turned ''pens for Jack'' into a symbol of Presidential opportunism. Richard Nixon engaged in quota bashing in the 1968 and 1972 Presidential elections. With much less fanfare, however, he presided over wholesale civil rights advances in job opportunities, including goals and timetables for all companies doing business with the Government, as well as the dismantling of dual school systems throughout the South.
However, in his eagerness to rescue the bureaucrats from obscurity, Mr. Graham underestimates the force of civil rights as a social movement. His book delivers a ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' version of the epoch, perversely managing to rank President Kennedy's assassination below the minutiae of Congressional deal making in explaining how long-stalled civil rights legislation suddenly became law. The assassination of King in 1968 rates barely a mention - because, one half-suspects, King did not run the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
For one fine moment racial justice was truly the nation's cause, and the accomplishments of that time permanently changed the political landscape. But the third Reconstruction, the economic one - that ''next and more profound stage of civil rights'' that President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke of in his remarkable Howard University speech in 1965, with ''not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and as a result'' - remains the merest promise.

THE CATHOLIC MYTH
The Behavior and Beliefs of American Catholics.
By Andrew M. Greeley.
322 pp. New York:
Charles Scribner's Sons. $21.95.
Armed with social survey data and state-of-the-art software, Andrew M. Greeley, sociologist, priest, novelist and self-styled maverick, battles two myths about Roman Catholics, cherished by two different constituencies. One - a secular stereotype he has met in Democratic Presidential campaigns - holds that American Catholics are blue-collar reactionaries whom it is hopeless to court for liberal political coalitions. The other, perversely comforting to the episcopate, says that those Catholics who are educated and middle-class have wised up and left the church. 
In fact, claims Father Greeley, American Catholics are better educated and more affluent than Protestants and more liberal on virtually every political issue. They still vote for Democratic members of Congress, and they cling to their Catholic birthright. But the moralism of the George McGoverns and the Walter Mondales sets their teeth on edge, and the church's neglect of their spiritual needs makes them angry. So the Democrats lose elections, and the church, according to his calculations, loses $7 billion per year in offerings.
The findings on Catholic educational and occupational achievement are well known to sociologists (attributable largely to Father Greeley's earlier efforts), as are those on political attitudes: Catholics tend to be liberal on economic policy and more conservative on family matters, and have become practically indistinguishable from white Protestants on attitudes toward abortion. Although Father Greeley does not make enough of the diversity among Protestants and the decline of their old elite as factors in this story, Catholics caught up long ago.
Father Greeley's theory of Catholic loyalty is indebted to Will Herberg, the journalist and theologian of the 1950's. In spite of the policies of their bishops (the utterly ineffectual ban on birth control and the neglect of parish life in favor of pronouncements on foreign policy), 85 percent of those raised Catholic remain Catholic, because in a society where religion serves to mark social identity, it makes good sense for them to do so. They are proud to be called Catholic.
Newer is the theory of the Catholic imagination, the myth of the Catholic people themselves. Inspired by the theologian David Tracy (to whom the book is dedicated), Father Greeley distinguishes the ''sacramental'' imagination, which sees the world filled with God, from the ''dialectical'' imagination, for which the world, including society, is Godforsaken. Using his intuitive grasp of these concepts as well as questionnaire items on images of God, Father Greeley successfully predicts an astonishing range of Catholic (sacramental) versus Protestant (dialectical) behavior and belief. Some results accord with stereotype: Protestants are more likely to read the Bible than Catholics are; Catholics are more likely to visit their relatives than Protestants are. But others are confounding: Catholics are more feminist than Protestants and more accepting of science. Father Greeley challenges skeptics to reanalyze the data (which are available in the National Opinion Research Center's general social surveys) or gather their own.
The sacramental imagination explains the independence of lay Catholics from the follies of their leaders. Narrative and poetry form the infrastructure of religious life, persevering through ''a millennium and a half of confrontation'' with dogma and structure. Father Greeley's view is that even if the Pope does not understand the importance of sexual love in marriage, lay people embrace God in the beloved. Father Greeley intricately reasons from survey items on respondents' upbringing, images of God, experience with clergy and marital satisfaction to argue that married Catholic women are happier when they can talk with celibate priest confidants.
Lest the structure of this argument seem too abstract, Father Greeley fleshes it out with a seven-page scene from one of his novels -always more didactic than ribald - wherein an attractive parishioner learns from her own effect on a masculine Irish priest how her husband must both fear and love her. Women should have the right of ordination, Father Greeley insists, so that male parishioners might enjoy the same privilege in the rectory. Their wives would benefit, for men who think of God as female make better partners.
By the time readers get this far, they will know why the author told them at the outset that his story was ''fascinating, wonderful, and slightly daffy,'' and it must be said that he expects the sacramental-imagination construct to do more work than the sociologist, wanting to inspect the tables, or the general reader, looking for imagery from other Catholic novelists, can easily accept. ''Sacramental imagination'' becomes a deus ex machina.
There are also loose ends and lacunas. Father Greeley shows that a quarter of Hispanic Americans are Protestants, but he can only guess why. He tells us nothing about charismatics or gay Catholics, and offers only a footnote about the disastrous decline in the number of women who are entering religious orders. But what is in ''The Catholic Myth'' is worthwhile.
And it would be a mistake to relegate Father Greeley to the margins he seems almost too eager to occupy. Other theologians, Protestant as well as Catholic, are turning from doctrine to narrative. Other sociologists, working with survey data, are reaching broadly congruent conclusions about Catholics and Protestants, and evidence is accumulating that Americans' images of the deity are becoming more androgynous and nurturing. Ethnographers and historians are showing that Americans routinely run their churches in ways that defy denominational structures. American religion is not a relic of the past but a response to the present. Andrew Greeley is a well-trained, abundantly energetic and imaginatively gifted sociologist of religion, but he is not alone.
 
 
 
WHO'S MORE HOSTILE TO SCIENCE?
 One's ''picture'' of God is in fact a metaphorical narrative of God's relationship with the world and the self as part of the world. . . .
 [The theologian David] Tracy argues that two approaches to human society of the respective traditions are shaped by these imaginative pictures. The Catholic tends to see society as a ''sacrament'' of God, a set of ordered relationships, governed by both justice and love, that reveal, however imperfectly, the presence of God. . . . The Protestant . . . tends to see human society as ''God-forsaken'' and therefore unnatural and oppressive. The individual stands over against society and not integrated into it. . . . Catholics are more likely than Protestants to see God as an intimate other - lover, friend, spouse, and mother - and the world and human nature as basically good. . . . Catholics are more likely to emphasize the presence of God. Protestants are more likely to emphasize reading the Bible and being born again. Catholics are less likely to be morally rigid and are also less likely than Protestants to rely on the Bible and on authority for moral decisions. Protestants are less likely to have doubts or to be angry at God. . . . Catholics are less hostile to science than Protestants.

PACIFIC DESTINY
Inside Asia Today.
By Robert Elegant.
533 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers.
$24.95.
Fans of Robert Elegant's Asia potboilers will find his latest book slow going. A regional survey patterned after the old John Gunther series (''Inside Europe,'' ''Inside Africa'' and others), ''Pacific Destiny'' contains nary a swelling breast nor a steamy seduction. Neither is it loaded with facts and figures despite Mr. Elegant's declared audience - ''the men and women who must strive to restore the competitiveness of the West.'' 
Mr. Elegant, a former foreign correspondent and the author of a dozen Asia books evenly divided between pseudohistorical best sellers such as ''Dynasty'' and less commercial nonfiction, writes that his intention is to help Western businessmen and planners by explaining the human qualities behind the extraordinary development of most Asian nations since World War II. The longest sections of his book are devoted to Japan and China. Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines and Indochina (Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia, with little Laos omitted) get briefer treatment, while Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Hong Kong are allotted one chapter each.
Such surveys are bound to be superficial, and ''Pacific Destiny'' is no exception. It may be useful as an introduction for first-time travelers to Asia. But original insights are few and most of the book reads like an assignment, not a labor of love.
It is best where Mr. Elegant dips into his notebooks of 40 years ago, when he was first posted to Asia as a young correspondent, and reminds us how far most Asian nations have had to come to reach the gleaming reality of today. Of Taiwan in 1951, he writes:
''Taipei, the capital, was dusty, grimy, and stench-ridden, and its atmosphere medieval. Military police prodded deserters, wearing manacles and leg-irons, across the broken cobblestones. . . . The ponderous red-brick edifices built by the Japanese . . . loomed over ramshackle hovels. . . . The open-fronted shops offered few goods beyond bamboo pails, iron dishpans, and coarse blue coolie clothing. . . . The first skyscraper . . . occupied by the American economic aid mission . . . was five stories high.''
Today, Mr. Elegant notes, Taipei boasts the biggest trade center in Asia if not the world. Taiwan's per capita gross national product has increased more than one hundredfold since the war and its foreign exchange reserves are an incredible $75 billion, second only to Japan.
There are other interesting contrasts, such as a description of Nikita Khrushchev's visit to Indonesia in 1960 and the clash of dictatorial styles between the Russian leader, sweaty and clumsy in the unaccustomed tropical and political climate, and Indonesia's sinuous Sukarno.
There are some good lines: ''When they are not overachieving, many Singaporeans are bored stiff.'' ''The overwhelming pride that has made for China's survival as a nation is today the single greatest obstacle to China's modernization.'' The Japanese are a tense people who are ''not much liked by outsiders because they do not much like themselves.''
But Mr. Elegant's analysis of Japanese economic single-mindedness - based partly, he explains, on fear of a return to postwar poverty - is familiar. So is his discussion of the pluses and minuses of Asia's Confucian traditions: a willingness to submit to authority, work hard and sacrifice for future generations, marred by bureaucracy, nepotism and corruption.
While he asks the right questions, he comes up with few new answers. To resolve United States trade frictions with Japan, for example, he suggests: ''We must both do what comes unnaturally: for us, contraction in our living standard; for them, expansion of their domestic economy and really joining the outside world.'' He repeats the standard advice that American industry, academia, government and finance must work better together and that executives must look beyond short-term gain. And he seems to make an argument for greater protectionism, noting favorably that ''West European nations do not bow down to free trade as to a holy icon.''
Through no fault of the author, the book suffers from being somewhat outdated, given the momentous events that have occurred in Europe and elsewhere over the past few months. Mr. Elegant has inserted a discussion of last June's Tiananmen massacre into his China section, but it was not possible for him to analyze how snowballing democracy movements and ethnic nationalism in East Europe might affect Asia. For example, who could have predicted last year that the two Germanies would be on the verge of reuniting - and speculated about what implications that development might have for ending World War II's other division, of the Korean peninsula?
''Pacific Destiny'' concludes tamely that ''only change is inevitable, not its direction.'' It is hard to imagine that this will come as news to a single one of Mr. Elegant's readers.

HEADLINE: Baseball Fans Must Fight Back

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor: rrThe major league owners and the players' union have earned, indeed invited, both Federal regulation and a public boycott for their contemptuous behavior during the 32-day lockout (''Baseball Negotiators Cleaning Up Loose Ends,'' The Times, March 20). Congress should mandate Federal regulation (overriding the Supreme Court's longstanding antitrust exemption) of professional baseball in view of the abuse of monopoly power and the callous disregard for basic Economics 101 principles of supply and demand in depriving the public of a historic and valued national product and depriving the local economies of spring training sites of essential revenues. 
Public disapproval is easily registered and, in theory, should be easier to achieve than Congressional action. Fans can select one or more of the following options to register their outrage:
* Reduction in games attended.
* Reduction of games viewed or listened to on the broadcast media.
* Reduction in the purchase of baseball-sponsored equipment and other paraphernalia.
* Boycott of companies advertising products during games.
 The likelihood that a partial or complete boycott would attract sufficient fan participation to have a material effect on the future conduct of the owners or the players union seems to be marginal, at best.
Until the owners and the players realize, however, that the demand for their product is truly elastic, or that their game will be regulated, it seems even more unlikely that we will experience an end to outrageous ticket prices, skyrocketing salaries, huge profits and unnecessary and tragic lockouts, walkouts and the like. In the interim, America's youth - including my otherwise avid baseball-playing sons -will continue to become more and more disenchanted with the ''business of baseball,'' thereby jeopardizing the future of the professional game.

HEADLINE: Builders Feel Pinch of New S & L Act

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
FOR more than 20 years, the Cardinal Federal Savings and Loan bank in Owensboro, Ky., financed the land acquisition and construction costs of Tommy Thompson's house-building business, and Mr. Thompson hardly expected that relationship to change when he recently took an option on another piece of developable land.
But despite Mr. Thompson's two decades of credit worthiness, Cardinal turned him down, citing new Federal rules governing the country's problem-plagued thrift industry. The rules, enacted last August as the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act - ''Firrea,'' as it has come to be known - are intended to avoid another savings and loan crisis by curtailing the share of its assets that a savings association may lend to a single borrower.
Under the regulations, real estate development loans, the source of most of the problems that troubled thrifts have gotten into around the country, have been assigned the highest risk factor, compared to other loans like home mortgages and Treasury notes. That means these lenders must now have more capital in reserve for such real estate acquisition, development and construction loans - ADC loans, for short - than the safer forms of debt. 
Many developers believe that, as a result, many of the thrifts will simply refuse to make the loans for them to acquire land and build housing.
''It seems to me that unless you have a long-term relationship with a bank, they're really not interested in any new business,'' said Josh Weiner, the head of Weiner Homes Corporation of Neptune, N.J., a medium-sized developer. ''The banks have become more and more conservative and more and more frightened about what the regulators are going to do.''
Barbara Alexander, managing director of the Construction and Building Products Group for Salomon Brothers, the investment bankers, said that the country could lose 100,000 new housing starts a year for the next five years because of the credit crunch the new regulations are creating for residential builders.
She echoed the view of housing industry officials that Federal limits on the amounts that may be lent to a single builder will drive housing prices up, either by raising the builders' costs or reducing the supply of new housing.
The value of all ADC loans from the major housing construction lenders ''likely will slide by 10 to 15 percent in 1990, and then fall considerably more in 1991,'' Ms. Alexander said in a speech at the National Association of Home Builders convention in January. ''In addition, with few incentives - and a plethora of disincentives - for such lending, the likelihood of a quick revival by such lenders is remote.''
The thrift institutions also lament the crimp the new Federal rules put on their ability to lend to developers. But secretly, some analysts say, they may be pleased to have a valid reason for turning down their old customers in a sluggish and - in many regions - an overbuilt market.
Home buyers feel the pinch, too, when builders whose credit has been stopped by a lender are unable to complete all the planned phases and amenities in a housing development. In some New Jersey projects where early buyers have invested their money and moved in, roads have been left unpaved, sewage hookups have not been made and half-built houses have been left abandoned.
Mr. Thompson, the Kentucky builder, has not just thrown in the towel. He has begun talking with a commercial bank, which will lend him less and charge him more than he used to pay at Cardinal Federal. A result, the builder said, will be a smaller project with fewer houses.
''Not only was it frustrating to have to find another source of acquisition and development loans,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''but we couldn't hire the people we were planning to employ, and in the meantime, another developer came in and started a project that will compete with ours.''
THE new regulations - the response of the Administration and Congress to fraud, loose lending practices and huge losses by the savings-and-loan industry - require these institutions to adopt the same underwriting standards as commercial banks. From the builders' perspective, the most important new requirements are that thrifts have more capital on hand as a proportion of real estate loans and that they not lend more than the equivalent of 15 percent of their stockholder's equity or core capital to any one borrower.
Cardinal Federal's core capital amounts to about $22 million, said its president, Bill Spurrier, and Mr. Thompson's company's current debt with the bank, at about $3 million, is close to the 15 percent limit.
Before the act was adopted, thrifts could lend up to 100 percent of their core capital to one borrower.
''Some lent 100 percent, and some got in trouble for it,'' said Jim Grohl, vice president of the U.S. League for Savings Institutions, a thrift industry trade group.
The league and the National Association of Home Builders want Congress to phase in the changes enacted last year over several years to give developers time to forge new relationships with other lenders and the thrifts time to develop the loan-sharing network that commercial banks use when they parcel out major loans. In that common practice, each commercial bank takes a share of the debt and the fees.
But in seeking the phase-in period, the bankers and builders have run up against the wall of political fear surrounding the S & L crisis. It is a wall that members of Congress have built around themselves as protection against the political scandals that have touched some of their less fortunate or less careful colleagues.
The cost to taxpayers of covering federally insured savings and loans losses may reach $500 billion, according to a recent General Accounting Office report. Several builders and bank assocation members agreed that this, plus the charges against five Senators of protecting a foundering savings and loan institution in return for big campaign contributions from its owner, Charles Keating, have made Congress wary of any changes that seem to reduce the regulatory burden on a savings and loan.
''There's just tremendous sensitivity about this,'' said Martin Perlman, a Houston residential developer who is president of the National Association of Home Builders. ''On the House side it's an election year and the representatives are very concerned about getting tagged with the cost of the thrift bail-out to the taxpayer. On the Senate side you have the Keating five and how all that will play with the voters. So nobody really wants to stick his neck out on this.''
According to Mr. Grohl of the U.S. League, the impact of the so-called ''loans to one borrower'' rule strikes hardest at builders and bankers outside the major urban areas, where banks and savings institutions are smaller and often tend to carve up the local market by specializing in different segments of the market - one thrift association focusing on mortgages, another on acquisition and development loans to builders and commercial banks focusing on loans to retailers and manufacturers.
In those markets, developers and bankers are going to have to develop new relationships and understandings of each other's business, Mr. Perlman said, and that will take time.
MR. THOMPSON, meanwhile, has found himself explaining the housing industry to commercial bankers, who are more used to lending money for inventory or expansion of existing retailers and manufacturers than to developers who often have few assets beyond their reputations as reliable businessmen.
''Ever since we were turned down by our regular bank, we've been involved in an education process with commercial banks,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''So when we started to talk to them about a land acquisition and development loan of maybe two or three years, they didn't have much of an appetite for it, and they said, 'What do you mean, release schedule and marginal releases and percentage of buildout value?' They just weren't familiar with those terms and that kind of loan.''
Marginal release, Mr. Thompson explained, is the common practice of a bank's releasing its lien on a completed house, allowing it to be sold, while retaining the loan lien on the unfinished and unsold properties.
Patrick O'Keefe, executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders Association, said that in the present regulatory climate even commercial banks that are well on the right side of the rules may shy away from making ADC loans.
''There's a phenomenon I call Firrea-fallout that is definitely affecting the business decisions that banks are making,'' he said. ''Commercial bank managers seem right now to fear the possibility of a regulator taking action against them more than they do the stockholders. They figure they won't be fired for being unprofitable but they could be fired if a regulator comes in and second-guesses some loan they made.''
Last January, Mr. O'Keefe's group did a quick survey of just over 100 of its members in which 85 percent said they were having more trouble getting ADC loans than a year earlier, 56 percent said they had encountered problems getting an extension of current loans and 70 percent of those experiencing difficulty getting loans cited Firrea or ''bank examiners'' as the source of their problems with the banks. Mr. O'Keefe said his members are loath to go public with their problems, for fear of further undermining their relations with lenders and suppliers. But the stories, he said, keep coming in.
''I have heard any number of instances where an individual has a performing loan, they are meeting the schedule for home sales and repayments and they have simply been told by the thrift or the bank that their line of credit will be terminated, and a lot of people don't understand that terminating a line of credit is the same as terminating a construction job, even if you're still in the middle of it.''
THE problem has been compounded by an ''overreaction'' to the current slowdown in real estate development in the Northeast, Mr. O'Keefe went on.
''We have a national policy that fails to take into account the cyclical nature of our business,'' he said, ''and so it is taking what is a normal market correction in the Northeast and transforming it into a severe real estate recession that could take the rest of the economy with it.''
Mr. O'Keefe predicted that the the one-two punch of tightened lending regulations and a softening market will soon be felt in the rest of the country, too.
''Right now Firrea is a hot topic in the Northeast, and soon it will hit Washington, because that market is softening, and then it will be felt in Southern California,'' he predicted. ''And at that point these very strict regulations will begin to strangle our sector of the economy.''
Edward L. Yingling, director of government relations for the American Bankers Association, the commercial banking group, downplayed the fears of some developers that his member banks would not be available for development loans.
''They'll be interested in those loans and they are already making them,'' he said. ''To the extent that the S & L's will pull back from them, I think the banks will move in and pick up the slack. Banks are already taking up the slack on mortgages when the S & L's pulled back on them.''
As for reopening Firrea to create a phase-in period for the new loans-to-one-borrower rule, Mr. Yingling was as warm as a hard-nosed bank examiner going over an overdue loan.
''Our basic feeling is that the new rule is the correct rule and that the old system where the S & L could effectively lend up to 100 percent of their capital was a bad rule,'' he said. ''But if there is going to be some very limited transition to the new rule, we won't get in the way. As long as it's very limited.''
Ms. Alexander of Salomon Brothers doubts the usefulness of stretching out the phase-in of the loans-to-one-borrower rule, however. If a bank has to have its loan portfolio in a certain shape by a certain date, she said, chances are it will get its loans in compliance as soon as possible and not put the changes off until the last moment. But, she added, what else can the builder do but ask for more time?
''THE National Association of Home Builders is a politically sensitive organization and they know Firrea is not going to be repealed in the short term - there are too many people out there screaming for blood,'' she said. ''So if it isn't going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it, what's the best you can hope for? That it won't take effect as fast.''
The savings-and-loan associations are supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision, a bureau of the Treasury Department, where lawyers are currently studying the Firrea legislation to see whether Congress gave the office the power to delay the effect of the lender rules without new legislation, said Paul H. Lockwood, a spokesman for the office.
Mr. O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association worries that the legal review could take too long.
''They say they need to review the empirical data,'' he said, adding:
''My concern is that by the time the empirical data comes in, my members will all be out of business.''

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Called by Cuomo;
Parley's Agenda: Low-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
Innovative strategies to produce more low-cost housing will be discussed by 350 New York State leaders, including Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, at a daylong conference Thursday at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.
Under Secretary Alfred A. DelliBovi of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development; Karney Hodge, director of the California Housing Finance Agency, and John Sidor, executive director of the Council of State Community Affairs Agencies, a nonprofit housing advocacy group in Washington, are among the experts from other sections of the country who will attend. 
Called by Mr. Cuomo, who also is to be the luncheon speaker, the conference will revolve around six three-hour panels, three in the morning and three in the afternoon. The meeting was assembled at Mr. Cuomo's direction by the State Housing Finance Agency, the State Mortgage Authority and the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
''Affordable housing,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''is the backbone of every community. It is more than just bricks and concrete - it means a place to call home. The conference will mobilize private developers and not-for-profit groups to work together to increase the availability and affordability of housing through the 1990's.''
Among the larger issues to be discussed are housing for the homeless, new construction methods to reduce building costs, creative financing to increase investment funds and innovative roles that government agencies might be able to play.
Registration is at 8:30 A.M. The $110 fee includes lunch, dinner and a reception. For more information, telephone 686-9700, extension 206.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES: Modular Housing;
Widening the Role of Factory-Built Units

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
A CRANE swings and a section of house is fitted into place at a development called Aqueduct Homes. It happened last week in the University Heights section of the West Bronx. It is also happening in the Hunts Point section, at a development called Villa Maria.
Modular housing - with fully outfitted components built in a factory and trucked to the site - is a growing factor in home construction in New York City. In particular it has become a growing part of affordable-housing efforts in the city, which are bringing home ownership to farflung neighborhoods.
Modular housing now accounts for 30 percent of the housing produced through the New York City Partnership, a nonprofit organization that has a housing affiliate to help builders produce for-sale units, mainly two-family houses, that are affordable to moderate- to middle-income buyers. 
Now a new factor has been introduced: A second major producer has entered the New York City market. The developer of Aqueduct Homes is one of New Jersey's largest home builders, the Kaplan Organization of Edison, which has built 20,000 houses in New Jersey, mainly by conventional methods, since the early 50's. Heretofore only DeLuxe Homes of Pa., based in Berwick, has been a significant factor in modular development in the city.
The acceptance of modular housing by construction unions and home buyers suggests that in many inner-city places where home builders might hesitate to venture, new houses for a moderate-income market may be built. It also gives a lift to the 10-year, $5.1 billion housing plan begun by former Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1986. And it suggests a need for closer attention to site planning in large-scale affordable-housing developments.
In some developments the excessive use of pad parking - whether in modular or conventionally built development - seems to be inviting unsightly street environments in the long run.
Modular construction lowers risk and cost for the builder by drastically shortening the time of on-site work and the time between contract-signing by the buyer and closing. Even more important than the dollar saving may be the fact that potential loss from theft and vandalism during construction are sharply reduced.
This means that builders ready to use it can venture more easily into lower-income areas that have concentrations of rental housing and a long-term drop in middle-income populations. Used in places like Hunts Point, it can help to promote economic integration by bringing in working families with incomes of $25,000 to $53,000, or keeping in the communities those with such incomes who might otherwise move out when they are ready to find better housing.
The Aqueduct Homes project is a case in point. It is going on a site that was devastated by housing abandonment.
''IN four days from the time of delivery we can have 12 buildings standing,'' said Morris Kaplan, president of the Kaplan Organization and head of its modular operations, which are in Pine Grove and Tower City, both in Pennsylvania. ''In 30 to 45 days people can move in. Conventionally, it would take us five months to build on the site.'' Cost savings in interest on construction loans amount to about $4,000 a house.
Aqueduct Homes consists of 110 two-family houses on a group of vacant lots near Jerome Avenue and West 181st Street. Occupancy is to begin in May. The three-level houses have an unadorned brickface facade. Despite their front stoops, they are architecturally undistinctive, mainly because of their flat facades and roofs. But inside there is a generous-sized three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath duplex unit of 1,600 square feet for the owner, and a two-bedroom rental of 780 square feet for the renter. There is a parking pad for two cars in front. The house is 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.
The price to the buyer is about $150,000. Public assistance makes up the additional cost of $40,000 for each two-family house.
Kaplan has also has been awarded a site in the southeast Bronx - off Intervale Avenue, Kelly Street and West 163d Street - for 125 two-family houses. Construction there will begin in the fall.
LIKE DeLuxe Homes, the Kaplan Organization will seek to sell its products to other home builders. These builders would buy the land, provide the foundations and handle the sales. When the Partnership is involved and the land is acquired from the city, a subsidy of as much as $20,000 a unit may be available, depending on the strength of the market where the houses are sold. A community sponsor normally assists the Partnership in the sales.
At the Villa Maria site, at Prospect Avenue and Beck Streets in Hunts Point, DeLuxe has a house with greater design features. The facades are of both aluminum siding and brickface, and there are pitched roofs with dormer windows. Stone stoops lead to a covered front porch. Most of the houses have pad parking in front, but there will also be some clustering of cars. The developer is DeLuxe's development arm, DeLuxe Development of New York, in collaboration with a community sponsor, Hunts Point Multi-Service Center.
DeLuxe has already shipped 1,500 house units to New York City, said Donald E. Meske, president. The current products come in five basic types: two-story one-families; two-story two-families; three-story two-families; three-story three-families (usually sold as three condominiums per building); and three- and four-story two-families, as at Shorehaven.
Also active in the city as a factory builder is Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, which does multifamily housing and plans to use its product in Arverne, Queens.
New for-sale construction constitutes a major part of the 10-year plan, which Mayor David N. Dinkins is continuing. It comes to 37,000 units, or 44 percent of the 84,000 newly created units envisioned in the plan. The rest are apartments in vacant tax-foreclosed buildings that are being renovated.
Mr. Koch used the figure 252,000 units when he began the plan. But 168,000 of these are in occupied rental buildings that get rehabilitation financing wholly or partially from city or state funds. The ownership may be private, nonprofit or public. The for-sale new-construction phase of the plan includes 23,000 units to be developed through the New York City Partnership; 5,000 through the Nehemiah Plan, the low-cost moderate-income one-family approach begun by churches in East Brooklyn, and 9,000 under miscellaneous programs.
Seven years ago the Partnership invited modular builders from all over the country to come to New York City and was turned down by all except DeLuxe. They uniformally feared the city's bureaucracy and were uncertain about the marketability of the houses, said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership.
There also has been uncertainty about the acceptability of modular construction to the construction unions. Agreements with the national unions of carpenters, plumbers and electricians oblige both DeLuxe and Kaplan to use 100 percent unionized contractors. Local unions typically honor these agreements.
''The quality of the modulars has improved dramatically since the first project in 1983,'' Ms. Wyle said. ''Initially, the techniques were not up to New York City standards either for marketability or durability.''
In Brooklyn, the Hudson Companies, a development company based in Carroll Gardens, is planning to use DeLuxe modules for 21 two-family houses called Antioch Place, on Lexington Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant, with the Antioch Baptist Church as community sponsor.
The Hudson Companies is one building organization that is trying to steer clear of pad parking. Alan R. Bell, a principal, said that the company would provide the parking at the rear, off a looped drive, to avoid the unsightly appearance of pad parking spaces, which he said the company deplores. ''It costs more - for the asphalt, the lighting and car bumpers - and the buyers sometimes complain about it,'' he said. ''We also lose one house. We could have had 21.''
It is perhaps unlikely that the ambitious numerical goals of the 10-year plan will be fully achieved. Many of the gut-rehabilitation units are on sites so scattered and in buildings so small and decrepit that the required public subsidy per unit is far out of line with the housing benefit obtainable. And an effort to use major contractors to rehabilitate old buildings in large bidding ''packages'' of hundreds of apartments has already backfired in huge cost overruns in Harlem.
But the for-sale elements in the program may have a long-term vitality. People like to own a home. Given a fairly moderate subsidy per unit, and a low-cost method of delivering the home, sale programs have a good future.

HEADLINE: IN THE REGION: Connecticut and Westchester;
A Shopping Mall Opens East of Hartford

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
THE malling of Connecticut in the last 20 years has produced 19 enclosed regional shopping centers. Danbury Fair Mall, with 1.2 million square feet, is the largest, and some are as small as 160,000 square feet. Half a dozen new ones are proposed but their developers have been unable to find anchor stores or get zoning approval.
Nevertheless, the Pavilions at Buckland Hills, a 900,000-square-foot mall, opened last month in Manchester, eight miles east of Hartford off the Buckland Street exit of I-84, and while malls often generate hostility, this one seems to serve a need. Many shoppers who were starved for retail outlets east of Hartford love the Pavilions. 
''It's delightful,'' said Evelyn Lyons of South Windsor. ''It used to take me over half an hour to get to Westfarms Mall through Hartford traffic. This is five minutes from my house.''
Sales at the Pavilions, which serves a population of 275,000 east of the Connecticut River and centered on Manchester, are exceeding expectations, said Stephen Qualkinbush, director of the project for the Homart Development Company of Chicago. Homart is a member of the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group and managing partner in the joint venture with Melvin Simon & Associates of Indianapolis and Bronson & Hutensky of Hartford.
Some attendant decline in business is expected at Westfarms Mall in West Hartford, the Crystal Mall in Waterford and the Enfield Mall near Massachusetts, and the already diminished retail presence in downtown Hartford is expected to decline further.
''The issue of downtowns is one of obsolescence,'' Mr. Qualkinbush said. ''If the populations were there and their needs were met, regional malls would not be so successful.''
The $150 million project on 115 acres has 150 small shops, all but 10 percent of them occupied. Anchor department stores are Sage-Allen and G. Fox of Hartford and D & L of New Britain, Steiger's of Springfield, Mass., and Sears, Roebuck & Company. J. C. Penney, whose two-million-square-foot distribution center is across Buckland Street, is a likely candidate for one of two additional anchor spaces.
Among the clothing shops are Anderson-Little, Ann Taylor, Eddie Bauer, the Gap, Lane Bryant, the Limited and Victoria's Secret. Bostonian, Florsheim and 9 West are among theshoes shops; Haagen-Dazs, McDonald's, Taco Bell, Sbarro and Ruby Tuesday's among the food stores and restaurants; Sam Goody, Waldenbooks, Brentano's and Radio Shack for books, records and electronics; Brookstone, CVS Drugstore, CPI Photo, a Disney Store, and stores with pet products, children's apparel, toys, housewares and jewelry. Rents average $30 a square foot.
''Homart did not want to compete with Westfarms' upscale character, which is correctly keyed to the affluent suburbs west of Hartford,'' said Mary Ellen Brigham, who will teach a new course called Shopping Center and Mall Management and Marketing at the University of Connecticut next fall. ''East of Hartford is more of a moderate income area. Homart went for that. Older people with expensive tastes will still go to Laura Ashley and Polo at Westfarms; teen-agers and young families will like Buckland Hills.''
Judy Coady, a professor of sociology at the university who did a nationwide study of malls in 1986, said: ''The future of malls may depend on just that kind of specialization. California and Texas have malls for college students, kids, older people and singles. It minimizes the threat of competition for developers.''
James O. Rogers, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, said the Pavilions ''hits the saturation point.'' He added: ''I think with the economy the way it is that shopping center development is going to stand still for awhile. Store owners will only go into a certain number of malls.''
The area around the Pavilion site is a swirling beehive of current and potential development, including a 932-unit rental apartment complex by Trammell Crow, the developer based in Dallas. It opened on Jan. 15 opposite the mall.
One hundred fifty units are occupied, 150 more are leased and 500 will be completed by July, with rents from $690 for one-bedroom to $970 for a three-bedrooms with two baths.
''WE haven't yet figured out where all these people are coming from,'' said Charles Berman, head of the Trammell Crow regional office in New Canaan.
Projected for a 270-acre site between the mall and Buckland Street is a town-approved 250,000-square-foot shopping center. There are preliminary plans for a 150-room hotel-convention center and 395,000 square feet of office space. ''John Finguerra of New York City assembled the land,'' said Mark Pellegrini, Manchester's planning director, ''but there is not much of a market now, so he has not sought final approvals.''
The Cambridge Seven of Cambridge, Mass., designed the Pavilions with an informal, contemporary air, accented with blue and red exposed support pipes against white walls. Its 1,100-foot length is interrupted by five skylighted atriums that provide floor space for special events and define the entrances to department stores. Three of the courts have escalators to the second level and two have elevators partly enclosed by matching abstract steel sculptures created by George Sugarman and painted in sprightly colors repeated in free-form benches.
Roofs covering the second-level shopping corridors between the atriums are made of Sheerfill, a Teflon-coated fiberglass fabric manufactured by O. C. Birdair in Buffalo. The translucent white fabric is stretched tent-style over steel rods and casts a soft natural light.
All the anchor stores except D & L bought their land at low cost from Homart and built their own stores. Philip Davidson, chairman of the 89-year-old D & L chain of 114 stores in 14 states, said, ''We decided that we want maximum flexibility and a landlord's participation.''
D & L has stores at Manchester's Parkade shopping center, in Hartford, in Vernon's Tri-City Plaza six miles from the Pavilions and in 28 other places in Connecticut.
''There is new retailing afoot,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''We are not smart enough to know in advance what the transference will be. We will wait and see.''

HEADLINE: ABOUT NEW JERSEY

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma

 BODY:
AT the edge of the city, near its beginning and end, John O'Rourke sits, asking the time. It's just after noon of a blustery midweek that does not feel anything like spring.
A retired meat cutter with tours of duty in a dozen supermarkets, Mr. O'Rourke, 72 years old, knows Newark. He remembers when important people from Hahne's and Bamberger's used to take rooms at the Executive House on Saybrook Place, the crooked street that runs from Military Park downtown to Newark's border at the Passaic River. He remembers when the Newark Athletic Club used to run the Military Park Hotel, around the corner on Park Place. He remembers. 
''It used to be a beautiful neighborhood,'' he said, sitting in his light jacket and frayed baseball cap in a little unnamed park that celebrates Newark's beginning, marking the spot where Puritans climbed out of their boats 324 years ago to find heaven on earth. ''It used to be nice. But now? Now it's run down. Now there's nothing here anymore.''
Perhaps, but someday, if this old city's will prevails, Mr. O'Rourke's observation post above the river may end up being somewhere near center stage of a 3,000-seat world-class multi-use theater and performance hall, one part of an opulent dream known as the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts.
Mr. O'Rourke, who lives nearby, has heard about the plan, and he approves. ''It'll build things up around here, bring in a lot of people,'' he said. ''Yeah, it'll be good.''
To look around from the vantage point of Mr. O'Rourke's tired knoll, it is hard to imagine anything good. Trucks blast down McCarter Highway, and everything for blocks and blocks looks tired, worn and old. But the proof of what could happen was there in front of Mr. O'Rourke, in the persons of M. John Richard and Tom Lussenhop.
Mr. Richard is vice president of development and Mr. Lussenhop, executive assistant, of the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts. They came that day to tour the 12 grimy acres of urban refuse that could someday be New Jersey's Lincoln Center. Of late they have been helping to hammer out details of the plans to purchase the land, move the streets and then start building a place from which will be staged the masterpieces of world music, dance and theater. In Newark!
They walked slowly, careful to step over the broken glass without getting impaled on the barbed-wire fences. There, on the corner of Saybrook and Park Place, where the hollowed-out remains of the Military Park Hotel disintegrate, will be an 2,500-seat concert hall. There, next to the Quality Inn, where the parking lot and Boy Scout headquarters are, another hall, of 1,800 seats.
''What's this? Parsley,'' Mr. Lussenhop said, stepping on a lush bed of weeds sprouting from what had once been a sidewalk on Saybrook Place, alongside the parking lot that could one day be the site of a monumental multi-use theater palace or maybe a hotel. Then, dodging traffic to cross Central Avenue to the well-fed lawns around the buildings now owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, he pointed to where a theater for dance and drama, seating 600, might be built.
''It's a heck of a challenge,'' said Mr. Lussenhop, who came from Minneapolis by way of Princeton and who believes that Newark can be bright and strong in a way it was before despair took over. ''What we're hoping to do in the design of the center,'' he said, ''is make a statement: this is an important place.''
Important for a lot of reasons and to a lot of people. Recently, the consulting firm of Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Alschuler, which estimated the economic impacts of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York and the roaming MX missile somewhere out west, determined that building the performing arts center would stir up $1 billion of new economic activity for New Jersey.
According to the study, the theaters and concert halls would generate 10,400 construction jobs and draw an annual audience of 650,000 people to downtown Newark by the year 2003. The impact of the large investment - more than $220 million for just the first two phases - could be multiplied further by timing. ''Given the slowdown coming over the next six or seven years, this could be absolutely critical to the future of the city,'' said James Alschuler, the consultant.
But for many, the economic impact, great as it is expected to be, is incidental to how the center could raise the psyche of the city and put an end to the myth that cities serve only to take society's waste, a reservation of sewage plants, incinerators, prisons and dumps. They believe that a center of uncompromised quality will give back to this city and to others the dignity that extends beyond usefulness and into the intangible called community.
Lawrence P. Goldman, the man who directed the development of Lincoln Center and now is maestro of the Newark project, said it would be far easier to build an arts center in the Meadowlands than in Newark, but it wouldn't produce the same benefits for so many people. ''What will come from this is how Newarkers and New Jerseyans come to think of themselves and the place in which they live,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''This will provide a strong physical representation of excellence.''
Gov. Jim Florio was in Newark not long ago to restate his support for the center in spite of the harrowing budget problems he inherited. The state is kicking in $20 million in low-interest bonds to be used to buy land, negotiations already nearing completion.
Mr. Florio spoke forthrightly. ''I regard what we're doing here as an investment in the future,'' he said. ''This is a celebration of the spirit upon which Newark was founded.''
The very spot on which Newark was founded, the bare-boned knoll on Saybrook Place where Mr. O'Rourke usually sits watching traffic, appears to be a fitting site for the new performing arts center. ''On this slope,'' reads the inscription on a sandstone monolith there, a fountain on one side now filled with green stagnant water, ''from the river came the founders on a day late in May 1666 to plant their settlement on the plain above.''
On a similar day not long from now, they may return.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY OPINION;
A State Budget Plan That Breaks the Rules

BYLINE: By Norman J. Glickman; Norman J. Glickman, an economist, is the director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University.

 BODY:
POLITICIANS who think about the long-term interests of their constituents have a choice, according to today's cynics. They can commit political suicide by proposing complicated solutions to hard problems. Or they can go for short-term, superficial fixes that don't really do the job.
In Washington, most politicians have taken the second route. This has resulted in governmental paralysis over nearly all issues of importance, from reducing the national debt to controlling health care costs. 
Here in New Jersey, Gov. Jim Florio has proposed a complex tax and budget plan that may not play well on the evening news. He has taken a politically risky road toward reducing the $1.4 billion budget deficit he inherited. He's trying to cut spending, freeze hiring and raise taxes. He's got many people mad at him, including state workers, college students and suburban mayors.
We should all remember that the Governor's choice was not about whether to raise taxes and cut spending, but how. Since the state constitution requires a balanced budget, he had to do something. The real question is: Did he ask for the right mix of cuts and taxes? The debate in New Jersey is over that question.
Mr. Florio has broken several political rules. He's broken Bush's Rule of Political Expediency by saying, in effect, ''Read my lips: higher taxes.'' He's broken Koch's Re-election Rule by failing to resort to accounting gimmicks to balance the budget. Significantly, he has also broken Reagan's Rule of Trickle Up Economics. Instead of raising the taxes of lower-income people, as President Reagan did, he's raising taxes for those who can afford it most. This is particularly true of the income tax, where people making over $100,000 will pay much more. Average working people will pay a smaller share of state taxes. This is a populist approach. The increased income taxes will be used to cut the property taxes of those with incomes below $65,000 (most of us) and to reduce what localities will have to pay for welfare and social services. This will help reduce the terrible pressure that local governments face in financing much-needed services, particularly in our blighted cities. This is a step toward meaningful property tax relief that homeowners have been demanding. Under the plan, moderate-income households will most likely get higher property tax rebates than under the existing law. Although next year will be hard on localities because of the 1990 cuts, the long-run situation might improve.
The Governor's plan also begins to redress the imbalances in state aid to school districts. Down the road, we may see the gap in state aid per pupil between rich and poor school districts reduced. In the meantime, the Governor has taken a principled stand in favor of minorities and the cities in anticipating the State Supreme Court school finance decision.
Mr. Florio's changes ought to bring a more equitable system than the one in place. They also help make the system of financing public services more efficient. And they should reduce overreliance on local property taxes to finance lots of services, including education.
The Governor's plan could help us because it puts the state in a more stable fiscal footing - especially given the recent threat of a downgrading of New Jersey's bond ratings by a financial house because of the budget imbalance. The program should provide businesses with better roads, a more educated labor force and other public services they need.
There are potential problems with the package that should be watched. For instance, the sales tax increase could be regressive since the poor tend to pay a higher proportion of their incomes to sales taxes than do the nonpoor. But if the sales tax isn't charged on basic necessities like food, clothing and medicine, the tax will most likely be proportional - all of us pay the same percentage of our incomes. Fortunately, the Florio plan leaves these necessities tax-exempt. Although the Governor says this plan will not hurt economic growth, experts have raised troubling questions. Will higher income taxes mean that fewer new companies will locate in New Jersey? Will the wealthy move out of the state? Will the higher 7 percent sales taxes drive our consumers to Pennsylvania, where it is 6 percent? It will take some time to answer those questions. They must be answered satisfactorily.
Not everyone will agree with the details of Mr. Florio's program. For example, even some fellow Democrats want to make sure that the current homestead rebate continues until Mr. Florio's clicks in.
Clearly, the administration and the Legislature must still enact a detailed program. But it is hard to deny that Mr. Florio has made a strong political statement about his priorities for taxes and spending. He has come out in a populist and progressive way. He has shown leadership when few politicians are willing to be out front on anything controversial.
This plan will not be well received in affluent suburbs like Bedminster or Saddle River. It may not even be appreciated immediately in some of our poorer cities. But how it plays in middle-class towns like Edison or Cedar Grove will determine how the plan, with the Governor's populist message, plays in New Jersey.

HEADLINE: Auto Insurance 'Reform' Really Isn't

 BODY:
The present New Jersey auto insurance reform act demonstrates the inherent weakness of political solutions to economic issues. Such solutions are based on lack of experience in the field and on emotion.
Jim Florio's attempt at rate leveling shifts the burden of high risk to those presenting little or no risk at all. Good drivers pay for bad drivers. Suburban and rural drivers pay for urban drivers. 
The abrupt termination of the J.U.A. will lead to chaos as J.U.A. brokers go out of business and there's no immediate substitute coverage for the 1.6 million drivers in the program. Attempt to pay off the $3.1 billion J.U.A. debt in a short time could lead to bankruptcy or abandonment of New Jersey by some insurers. It will further force up medical and legal costs and other costs as commercial drivers, along with other drivers, have to pay more for registration.
The limitation on P.I.P. coverage is asinine. That means higher costs in additional premiums. Resort to medical insurance will, of course, force up the cost of medical insurance to the point where not even Fortune 500 employers would afford the coverage. So where's the savings?
A fairer approach would involve rate determination by the following factors: (1) accident-violations-criminal record; (2) driving experience; (3) total assets, investments and returns of carrier (to curb excessive ''management fees'' charged against state branch offices); (4) make and model of car; (5) home address.
A long-term approach involves the following: (1) close cooperation between the insurer, the state and the insured in monitoring medical and legal expenses; (2) a crackdown on excessive litigation, and responsible deliberation as jurors in claim cases, (3) continual review and upgrading of the D.M.V. and stricter compliance with traffic laws.
The last and most important element involves getting at the root problem of insurance costs; road congestion. This means getting economic development under control. On a state and local level, let's tighten up on elected officials who owe their election to campaign contributions from developers or who approve builders' applications indiscriminately. In the end, we may pay higher local taxes but reap some nice savings in insurance costs.

HEADLINE: Sorting the Garbage: How Well Is It Working?

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
IN the two decades since the first Earth Day, county residents have learned a thing or two. They are still planting trees and cleaning up local parks, but they are also sorting through their garbage.
''There's a growing perception that what is required is changes in life style, that our affluence and conspicuous consumption must be contained,'' said Paul L. Steineck, professor of earth science at the State University of New York at Purchase. And nowhere are such changes more easily measured than in the disposal of solid waste.
No longer satisfied that the Federal and state laws enacted since the first Earth Day will protect the environment, volunteers are helping to monitor the water quality in the Hudson, measure oxygen depletion in Long Island Sound or create land trusts and clustered housing to preserve green spaces. But garbage provides a common denominator, a front line that includes everyone. 
Not every resident has a boat whose sewage needs to be monitored or even a lawn on which to reduce the use of pesticides. But apartment dwellers and homeowners all produce garbage, much of which can be recycled.
''We have been so wasteful that minor adjustments, as in recycling, can have tremendous impact,'' Professor Steineck said. ''People are realizing we all have a part to play.''
 
The Landfills Close
During the 20 years since Earth Day 1970, the Croton Point landfill has closed down; its estimated one billion pounds of toxic waste remain a concern to environmentalists because of the potential for leaching into the Hudson River. The county's four municipal incinerators have been closed as well, along with the two landfills that once took construction debris.
Taking their place is the six-year-old, $237 million Charles Point Resource Recovery Plant in Peekskill, now the county's only disposal site. But it is already too small by a third to handle the nearly one million tons of garbage that Westchester will throw away this year. The space allocated to the 36 participating communities leaves little capacity for the private carters, who haul waste from the county's commercial sector and from its seven northern towns to increasingly distant landfills.
In response, recycling has emerged as the option of choice. Both economic and environmental considerations argue against building a second plant, say county officials, who believe the waste stream could be reduced sufficiently if the public cooperated in recycling. State laws now require municipalities to have recycling programs in place by September l992 and to recycle 40 percent of the state's solid waste by l997.
''Twenty years ago, all people wanted from their garbage was for it to go away,'' said Prof. Richard Knabel, who teaches environmental science at Westchester Community College in Valhalla and is vice president of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester. ''Now there is a tremendous willingness to be involved in the process.''
But he added a caution: ''Seventy-five percent of the students in my class consider themselves environmentalists, but only one-third think they are part of the problem.''
 
The County Role
 
Carrots Now, The Stick Later
 Recycling has gained a measurable foothold in Westchester. In the two years since County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke announced an 11-point comprehensive recycling plan, there has been a fivefold increase in programs, with 205 diverse ones now in place or planned to start shortly and involving all of the county's 43 municipalities.
But the 8.6 percent reduction in residential waste that Westchester municipalities achieved last year is far below the 40 percent reduction the state will require by 1997. County officials say that meeting that goal is also required to avoid building a second waste-to-energy incinerator or expanding the existing one.
The recycling program has worked well enough that six months ago the county withdrew its request to the state Department of Environmental Conservation to increase its capacity to burn at the Charles Point plant, which produces power for Consolidated Edison. ''We pulled back so as not to discourage people from recycling,'' said Charles Miles, assistant commissioner for environmental projects in the Department of Public Works. ''Besides, this mental attitude is catching on.''
Despite population increases, the volume of residential solid waste incinerated at the plant declined 1 percent last year for the second consecutive year; it had steadily increased during the plant's first three years of operation. Participating communities diverted 48,000 tons of solid waste from Charles Point last year, twice the 1988 total.
An incentive is the county's direct payment of $17 for each ton a municipality does not send to the plant, compared to the amount it delivered the previous year.
The Charles Point plant processes 571,000 tons of residential waste yearly and the balance of its permitted capacity of 657,000 tons is sold to private carters.
 
$10,000 Grants Are Offered
The most popular incentive offered by the county, said James J. Hogan, director of resource management in the Solid Waste Division of the county Department of Public Works, is the $10,000 available to each community for composting sites, curbside collection containers, depots to store recyclables until they can be marketed and collection trucks.
Within the next 18 months, a $10 million plant in Yonkers is expected to open, providing a single disposal site where municipalities can deliver mixed recyclable garbage (except newsprint). Known as a ''Murf'' (derived from materials recovery facility), the plant is where recyclable material will be sorted and packaged into marketable products.
Finding reliable markets remains the greatest obstacle to the program's success, Mr. Hogan said, and newspapers present the greatest difficulty. Pulp processors have not been able to count on a consistent, reliable supply, but he suggested that requiring newspapers to be recycled should stabilize the market.
 
Composting, but Where?
Yard waste is another problem. Although 15 municipalities now have composting space, finding sites is difficult, especially in southern Westchester, where open land is scarce. Because of laws prohibiting the use of parkland for non-park purposes, the county has been unable to provide a regional site of its own.
Pending legislation that would provide an exception to the law is opposed by local environmental groups, which favor case-by-case consideration. Additional pressure to resolve the issue is expected from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, which has proposed legislation to ban the incineration of compost.
The county is considering mandating recycling even before state regulations take effect in l992, Mr. Hogan said. A proposal is under review by the law department, he said, and could be enacted to coincide with the opening of the materials-recovery plant.
It would include the business community, which contributes nearly one-third of the county's waste stream, an estimated 371,000 tons each year.
There are no real figures on how much recycling is carried out by business. ''I suspect it has a long way to go,'' Mr. Hogan said. Two-thirds of commercial waste is believed to consist of corrugated cardboard and office paper, material that is recyclable and marketable.
With a $650,000 state grant, the county is conducting a comprehensive solid-waste-management study to measure the impact of local recycling efforts and alternatives. A decision about a second site for a resource-recovery plant, Mr. Miles said, ''will depend on whether we are optimistic or pessimistic about recycling.''
 
Municipal Efforts
 
What Works? Finding the Market
If coordinators in each of the county's municipalities could recycle all the newpaper and compost all the yard waste their residents produce, the county's waste volume would be cut in half. But there are too few markets for the one, and too little land for the other.
With few mandatory programs in place, some communities are struggling to persuade residents to ''source separate,'' causing homes and apartments to overflow with plastic bags, bottles and cans. Other areas allow the commingling of materials, which then overflow municipal depots while harried public-works employees try to sort and package the recyclables for other markets.
Scarsdale recycled 36 percent of its solid waste last year, the highest percentage of any municipality in the county and an amount equal to 750 pounds per resident. The village succeeded without curbside pickups, and the lines of residents waiting to deposit at the community recycling depot get longer each day.
The 20-year-old program, one of the oldest in the county, appears to have captured the attention of a majority of residents.
The village has ''positive'' (paying) markets for almost all its recyclable material, even its newpapers, said James E. Rice, its recycling consultant. Scarsdale has been selling newsprint for 20 years, Mr. Rice said, and guarantees dealers that each bundle will be ''clean,'' or free of colored stock.
Other communities can do the same, he insisted: ''When you go to someone and they want a blue suit, don't go home and start making them a brown suit.''
Mr. Rice and Lowell J. Tooley, the Scarsdale Village Manager, said that there was little more the village could do to encourage recycling but that the county could do much more. Additional financial incentives for already vigorous programs like the one in Scarsdale should be provided, they said, including higher bonuses to keep recyclable waste out of the Charles Point plant.
''We believe the county should pay municipalities what it is really saving,'' Mr. Rice said.
 
Imagination in Yorktown
Although Yorktown recycles only 13 percent of its waste, under the direction of Patrick J. Lofaro Jr., superintendent of the Department of Environmental Conservation, it has developed one of the county's most energetic and creative recycling programs - from public education developed in cooperation with Teatown Reservation to recycling one ton of automotive batteries last year.
Yorktown sells biodegradable leaf bags at cost; when filled, the town picks them up, mixes them with sludge from its sewage treatment plant, composts it and then gives the finished product away to residents, the town's beautification committee and the local highway department for soil conditioning. Last year, Yorktown disposed of 3,000 tons of organic yard waste and sludge in this fashion.
At Lakeland High School there, students under the direction of Ellen Purcigliotti started the county's only plastics-recycling program, in cooperation with Jenpac, an upstate recycling company owned by a consortium of oil companies.
Students deposit their lunch trays and containers into special stacking stations; they are sent to the company for resale as plastic pellets to be used in combs, insulation and other products. The program costs the school nothing. It has already been adopted at neighboring Yorktown High School.
Between state grants, tipping-fee savings and the sale of materials, Yorktown gained $74,224 last year for its recycling efforts. ''Whoever thought,'' Mr. Lofaro said, ''that we would make money on garbage.''
 
The Grass Roots
 
Convenience Wins Converts
There are the grumpy residents, still in the majority, who will voluntarily recycle their cans, plastics and bottles only if it is convenient, and that means frequent curbside pickup from municipally supplied containers.
When Yorktown residents were asked how a recycling program could be made more convenient, nearly half asked for a container and almost as many asked for same-day collection. The same response came in a recent survey of New Castle residents.
In order to work, municipal coordinators agree, new recycling programs must be made easy for residents, volumes must be large enough to attract markets, and the collection process must be manageable for local public works departments.
The village of Elmsford currently has no recycling programs, but now it has a new Trustee, Robert Williams, manager of the scrap-metal department at the Brookfield Metal Company of Elmsford, as its recycling coordinator. His vote plurality was the highest in recent Elmsford electoral history.
''Homelessness is not the major issue in Elmsford,'' Mr. Williams said. ''When I rang doorbells, all they wanted to know was what I would do to help them recycle. People got mad after they bundled newsprint and watched public works guys just dump it into the trucks with the other garbage.''
 
A 'Limitless' Market
The company buys bulk metals from every Westchester community and from locations as far away as Canada, reselling the material to steel mills. His business, Mr. Williams said, has doubled in the last two years.
Brookfield has a ''limitless'' market for metals, said Mr. Williams, who believes that markets for other recyclables are there, as well. He has negotiated an agreement to sell Elmsford's newspapers for $10 a ton.
''People are ecology minded because they realize the earth is getting full,'' he said, and Elmsford residents are ready ''to recycle 100 percent so long as I don't make it difficult for them.''
Other recycling officials, though less sanguine than Mr. Williams, agree that recycling is here to stay and say that if adults haven't all got the message yet, their children have.
His own 8-year-old son, Christopher, has kept him in line, Mr. Lofaro said, in Yorktown. ''The plumber was in my house recently and threw away a can of soda. Christopher came to me immediately and said, 'Daddy, what is a can of Pepsi doing in our garbage?' I was immediately defensive. And I don't even drink Pepsi.''

HEADLINE: FOCUS;
Gas Station Design Contest Pulls Nearly 400 Entries

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: PORTLAND, ME.

 BODY:
When Theo Holtwijk, a landscape architect and planner, approached the officers of C. N. Brown Company last September with the idea of sponsoring a national design competition to elicit fresh ideas for the company's newest gas station, he thought they would promptly turn him away. After all, he reasoned, more often than not, when a gas station is built these days, the design reflects a prototype chosen by whatever major oil company supplies the fuel.
But C. N. Brown, which owns or services some 200 gas stations throughout New England, welcomed the idea, and architects and others from as far away as Hawaii have responded enthusiastically. Nearly 400 companies and individuals have paid the $25 application fee to receive the packet of guidelines. The actual designs are due tomorrow and the winner - chosen by a panel of independent judges - will be announced May 9.
Even before the entries were officially received it became clear that Brown would have some unusual plans to consider. 
The contest is believed to be the first gas station design competition in 40 years. The interest shown reflects an ongoing debate between architects and corporate marketing agents about whether they need to build virtually the same building in every place coast-to-coast.
''The day of just plopping any old box down is gone,'' said John Kane, whose company, Architekton, in Tempe, Ariz., specializes in gas station design and is preparing an entry for the Portland competition. ''The cities just won't allow it any longer.'' That was the case here in Portland.
C. N. Brown had hoped to tear down a 40-year-old station it owns at one of the primary routes to downtown Portland. The company wanted to build a version of Mobil Oil Corporation's standard Pegasus 21 design, featuring a large white, brightly lighted canopy and blue fascia above the pumps.
But Portland city planners rejected the plan, primarily because the Brown company wanted to retain the same number of curb cuts as the old station had.
''It was a stalemate,'' said Mr. Holtwijk. ''C. N. Brown threw up its hands and said, 'O.K., we won't do anything.' ''
Portland revitalization groups, among them Uptown & Company, which Mr. Holtwijk serves as president, saw the situation as a chance to generate interest in improving that section of the city. The area has many historic properties, including the city's main post office and its largest park, both of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Also, historically significant buildings, some in disrepair, surround the site, Mr. Holtwijk said.
''This gives a back-door impression to what should be the front door,'' said Mr. Holtwijk. ''It's a dilapidated station that probably hasn't had a coat of paint since the 1950's and the Portland peninsula is interesting because it has very few gas stations. We would like to encourage the owner to do some broader thinking.''
Thomas Collins, a spokesman for Mobil, said his company has been pleased to participate in the contest, but noted that the company's marketing needs must be considered in any station design.
''Our brand of service station, logo, look of the location is an integral part of our business,'' said Mr. Collins. ''Competition among service stations is incredibly intense'' in the country generally ''and we want our service stations to look a certain way and be a certain way.'' Mobil has spent millions of dollars rebuilding its 3,800 stations in the Pegasus 21 image. To get the 10,000 independent dealers who sell Mobil products to do likewise it offers them financial inducements - although it will not disclose what those inducements are.
Mr. Collins said that it costs about $2 million to rebuild a service station and that the standard designs can be modified so they are right for every site and, often, quite striking in appearance. He cited as an example a new station Mobil built recently in Fairfax County, Va., about five miles from the company's United States' headquarters.
''It's a magnificent setting with trees, a car wash, electronic payment at the pump,'' he said.
Gas station architecture has gone through phases since the first pumps were installed outside the nation's general stores in the early 1900's, according to Daniel Vieyra, an architect and director of the historic preservation graduate program at Kent State University. In ''Fill 'er Up,'' a book on the architectural history of gas stations (MacMillan Publishing Company, 1979, $7.95), Mr. Vieyra identifies the various types of stations that had been built, from ''the fantastic,'' which included buildings fashioned after airplanes, lighthouses, shells and castles, to ''the respectable,'' which included buildings that looked more like colonial homes or classical pavilions than a place to fuel a car. A Van Nuys, Calif., station built in 1935, was a reproduction of the elegant Los Angeles City Hall tower.
Also, some world-famous architects have designed gas stations. Among them were Frank Lloyd Wright, who believed the gas station would one day serve as a community gathering place, and Mies van der Rohe. Eliot Noyes, a New Canaan, Conn., architect who specialized in industrial design, created a prototype gas station for Mobil in 1964 featuring round canopies and round gas pumps that was used until the Pegasus 21 design came about in 1985.
Standardization of gas station design has been around as long as stations themselves have been, but it really caught on in the 1950's when large scale construction of interstate highways began, Mr. Vieyra said.
''Oil companies have to convince motorists who are in their own little worlds to stop,'' he said. ''When traveling was an adventure, the romantic, interesting shaped buildings werethe way to do it. But then it got easy to get from one end of the country to another and motorists traveled many more miles at much faster speeds. The last thing they want is a surprise, and you communicate that with a simpler building that says it's the same as it is back home.'' The look-alike buildings erected by restaurants and hotels as well as oil companies have been detrimental to the look and feel of America's landscape, some architects and planners said.
Said Mr. Kane: ''You get a series of independent buildings with no sense of context, continuum. That's what's lacking in our towns today. In successful cities, those things are not allowed.''
But Mr. Kane added that the major oil companies choose to build the same basic building everywhere because it has worked for years. His company, which has been in business about a year, hopes to convince them that a little variety in design can benefit both the community and the company.
Joan Fowler Smith, a vice president of the Portland School of Art and a member of Uptown & Company, said other national companies have met success when they have veered away from their standard designs. She noted that McDonald's Corporation, at the bidding of the Freeport, Me., Town Council, renovated a historic house instead of razing it. Tourists to the town - which is home to L.L. Bean and scores of factory outlet stores - are so taken with the building that frequently they are seen snapping pictures of it.
Said Mr. Vieyra: ''I think standardization is a passing thing. It's certainly peaked. Perhaps the competition will encourage more diversity.''
That is certainly Mr. Holtwijk's desire. But it will be up to the C. N. Brown Company to make the idea reality. Under the contest rules, the company has no obligation to build the winning design or any other design submitted.
Jinger Duryea, the advertising manager for C. N. Brown Company, said the company would like to see the station blend in with the surrounding buildings. ''As long as it's not the Taj Mahal,'' he said, ''we would be able to spend the extra money needed to do that.''

HEADLINE: FOCUS: Gas Station Design;
Nearly 400 Enter Contest in Portland

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

DATELINE: PORTLAND, ME.

 BODY:
WHEN Theo Holtwijk, a landscape architect and planner, approached the officers of C. N. Brown Company last September with the idea of sponsoring a national design competition to elicit fresh ideas for the company's newest gas station, he thought they would promptly turn him away. After all, he reasoned, more often than not, when a gas station is built these days, the design reflects a prototype chosen by whatever major oil company supplies the fuel.
But C. N. Brown, which owns or services some 200 gas stations throughout New England, welcomed the idea, and architects and others from as far away as Hawaii have responded enthusiastically. Nearly 400 companies and individuals have paid the $25 application fee to receive the packet of guidelines. The actual designs are due tomorrow and the winner - chosen by a panel of independent judges - will be announced May 9.
Even before the entries were officially received it became clear that Brown would have some unusual plans to consider. 
The contest is believed to be the first gas station design competition in 40 years. The interest shown reflects an ongoing debate between architects and corporate marketing agents about whether they need to build virtually the same building in every place coast-to-coast.
''The day of just plopping any old box down is gone,'' said John Kane, whose company, Architekton, in Tempe, Ariz., specializes in gas station design and is preparing an entry for the Portland competition. ''The cities just won't allow it any longer.'' That was the case here in Portland.
C. N. Brown had hoped to tear down a 40-year-old station it owns at one of the primary routes to downtown Portland. The company wanted to build a version of Mobil Oil Corporation's standard Pegasus 21 design, featuring a large white, brightly lighted canopy and blue fascia above the pumps.
But Portland city planners rejected the plan, primarily because the Brown company wanted to retain the same number of curb cuts as the old station had.
''It was a stalemate,'' said Mr. Holtwijk. ''C. N. Brown threw up its hands and said, 'O.K., we won't do anything.' ''
Portland revitalization groups, among them Uptown & Company, which Mr. Holtwijk serves as president, saw the situation as a chance to generate interest in improving that section of the city. The area has many historic properties, including the city's main post office and its largest park, both of which are on the National Register of Historic Places. Also, historically significant buildings, some in disrepair, surround the site, Mr. Holtwijk said.
''This gives a back-door impression to what should be the front door,'' said Mr. Holtwijk. ''It's a dilapidated station that probably hasn't had a coat of paint since the 1950's and the Portland peninsula is interesting because it has very few gas stations. We would like to encourage the owner to do some broader thinking.''
Thomas Collins, a spokesman for Mobil, said his company has been pleased to participate in the contest, but noted that the company's marketing needs must be considered in any station design.
''Our brand of service station, logo, look of the location is an integral part of our business,'' said Mr. Collins. ''Competition among service stations is incredibly intense'' in the country generally ''and we want our service stations to look a certain way and be a certain way.''
Mobil has spent millions of dollars rebuilding its 3,800 stations in the Pegasus 21 image. To get the 10,000 independent dealers who sell Mobil products to do likewise it offers them financial inducements - although it will not disclose what those inducements are.
MR. COLLINS said that it costs about $2 million to rebuild a service station and that the standard designs can be modified so they are right for every site and, often, quite striking in appearance. He cited as an example a new station Mobil built recently in Fairfax County, Va., about five miles from the company's United States' headquarters.
''It's a magnificent setting with trees, a car wash, electronic payment at the pump,'' he said.
Gas station architecture has gone through phases since the first pumps were installed outside the nation's general stores in the early 1900's, according to Daniel Vieyra, an architect and director of the historic preservation graduate program at Kent State University.
In ''Fill 'er Up,'' a book on the architectural history of gas stations (MacMillan Publishing Company, 1979, $7.95), Mr. Vieyra identifies the various types of stations that had been built, from ''the fantastic,'' which included buildings fashioned after airplanes, lighthouses, shells and castles, to ''the respectable,'' which included buildings that looked more like colonial homes or classical pavilions than a place to fuel a car. A Van Nuys, Calif., station built in 1935, was a reproduction of the elegant Los Angeles City Hall tower.
Also, some world-famous architects have designed gas stations. Among them were Frank Lloyd Wright, who believed the gas station would one day serve as a community gathering place, and Mies van der Rohe. Eliot Noyes, a New Canaan, Conn., architect who specialized in industrial design, created a prototype gas station for Mobil in 1964 featuring round canopies and round gas pumps that was used until the Pegasus 21 design came about in 1985.
Standardization of gas station design has been around as long as stations themselves have been, but it really caught on in the 1950's when large scale construction of interstate highways began, Mr. Vieyra said.
''Oil companies have to convince motorists who are in their own little worlds to stop,'' he said. ''When traveling was an adventure, the romantic, interesting shaped buildings were the way to do it. But then it got easy to get from one end of the country to another and motorists traveled many more miles at much faster speeds. The last thing they want is a surprise, and you communicate that with a simpler building that says it's the same as it is back home.''
The look-alike buildings erected by restaurants and hotels as well as oil companies have been detrimental to the look and feel of America's landscape, some architects and planners said. Said Mr. Kane: ''You get a series of independent buildings with no sense of context, continuum. That's what's lacking in our towns today. In successful cities, those things are not allowed.''
But Mr. Kane added that the major oil companies choose to build the same basic building everywhere because it has worked for years. His company, which has been in business about a year, hopes to convince them that variety in design can benefit both the community and the company.
Joan Fowler Smith, a vice president of the Portland School of Art and a member of Uptown & Company, said other national companies have met success when they have veered away from their standard designs. She noted that McDonald's Corporation, at the bidding of the Freeport, Me., Town Council, renovated a historic house instead of razing it. Tourists to the town - which is home to L.L. Bean and scores of factory outlet stores - are so taken with the building that frequently they are seen snapping pictures of it.
Said Mr. Vieyra: ''I think standardization is a passing thing. It's certainly peaked. Perhaps the competition will encourage more diversity.''
That is certainly Mr. Holtwijk's desire. But it will be up to the C. N. Brown Company to make the idea reality. Under the contest rules, the company has no obligation to build the winning design or any other design submitted.
Jinger Duryea, the advertising manager for C. N. Brown Company, said the company would like to see the station blend in with the surrounding buildings. ''As long as it's not the Taj Mahal,'' he said, ''we would be able to spend the extra money needed to do that.''

HEADLINE: Evicted By an Act of Congress

BYLINE: By ANDI RIERDEN

 BODY:
IN the five-room ranch house in Fairfield dotted with braided rugs and quilted pillows, Janet O'Donnell stands over the stove, turning pork chops, while her 3-year-old son, Patrick, curls up on the couch with his puppy. The plaque above the pantry door says, ''Home Sweet Home.'' Mrs. O'Donnell and her family moved into the house just three months ago, and now they are being evicted. Their landlord is the Pentagon.
The house is one of 28 in a cluster of military housing off Reef Road, and Mrs. O'Donnell, her husband, Thomas, a first boatsman for the Coast Guard, and their two children, along with the 27 other families that live there, must leave.
''It's enough of a struggle as it is,'' said Mrs. O'Donnell, who spoke with the soft drawl of her native North Carolina. ''What are we supposed to do? We certainly can't live in this area on what we make. But I guess they didn't think of that.'' On Wassell Lane in Westport, where 15 other military families are being forced out, a group of residents sat around Cheryl and Charles Cherico's kitchen table sipping coffee and wondering about their futures. After a long pause, Heather Israel, a 16-year-old junior at Staples High School, combed her fingers through her hair and let out a sigh. 
''My dad has given 19 1/2 years of his life to this country,'' said Heather, who, as the daughter of a military officer, has attended 14 different schools in the United States and Europe and hoped to graduate next year from Staples in Westport. ''And now the Government turns around and kicks us in the face.''
 
'Absolutely Floored'
Last month, the Army announced its plan to close and sell military-housing developments in several states, including 12 in Connecticut, this year. Residents of the two Fairfield County complexes say they remain shocked that they are being forced into one of the most expensive rental markets in the country on annual base salaries that average from $15,000 to $20,000.
''We were absolutely floored when we saw how much rents were in this area,'' said Joann Israel, Heather's mother. Mrs. Israel's husband, Steven, an Army sergeant major, earns around $1,600 a month as an R.O.T.C. instructor at the University of Bridgeport.
The family moved to Connecticut last year from El Paso, Tex., where they rented a house for $525 a month, Mrs. Israel said. In Westport, two-bedroom condominiums rent for $1,200 a month and up, said Patricia Abbott, the head of the town's Housing Authority.
In addition to the Fairfield County housing, the Army said it will sell the other houses it owns in the state. The action affects 239 families in Connecticut and another 165 in other parts of New England.
In addition to those in Fairfield and Westport, the affected families in Connecticut include 16 in Ansonia, 16 in Milford, 16 in Shelton, 16 in New Britain, 16 in East Windsor, 32 in Plainville, 16 in Middletown, 15 in Portland, 20 in Orange and 32 in Manchester.
Since the early 70's, families of low-paid military recruiters and other support-staff members have been allowed to live in the military housing complexes built in the East in the 1950's for the crews of Nike anti-aircraft missiles. The missiles had been intended to shoot down high-altitude Soviet bombers.
The announcement of plans to install Nike missiles on Bayberry Lane and North Avenue in Westport had upset residents who feared the military's presence would lower land prices and corrupt the town's young women. The ruckus inspired Max Shulman's 1957 novel, ''Rally Round the Flag Boys,'' which was made into a film starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.
But by the early 1960's, the missile sites were abandoned after the Army announced that the Nikes would be replaced by anti-ballistic missiles. The Town of Westport later took ownership of the former missile site and uses the buildings for municipal offices.
The recent decision to shut down the military housing is the result of a law passed by Congress in 1988 ordering the closing of obsolete bases and the sale of some military property.
A Congressional report issued before the base-closing law was passed said that the cost of operating the Connecticut properties was double the Army's average for housing sites. Helen Mulligan, community affairs director for Fort Devens in Massachusetts, the parent base for the housing installations, said that operating costs for fiscal 1989 for the 12 Connecticut sites came to $891,182.
The law said the houses must first be offered to other branches of the military and to other Federal agencies. If no purchasers are found, then the properties will be offered to state and local agencies for use as low-income housing or shelters for the homeless.
The Coast Guard is negotiating with the Army to buy the Milford and Ansonia housing, said Roger Blake, a real estate specialist with the Army Corps of Engineers office in New York City, which is overseeing the properties in Connecticut. Those complexes each contain 16 units. Other agencies that had expressed an interest in the Army properties ''have pretty much dropped out,'' Mr. Blake said.
Most of the military personnel who live at the Fairfield and Westport sites work in recruiting stations in Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Their average stay is around three years before they are transferred to other assignments, the residents said. Depending upon the region where they are stationed, those who live in civilian housing receive a monthly housing allowance of between $500 and $700.
 
Priorities Questioned
Members of the military families who gathered in the Chericos' home recently said they supported the Government's attempts to cut military spending. But they said they believed that Congress, in passing the base-closing law, should have considered the repercussions of displacing the residents.
''They think they're going to save money by doing this, but it's going to end up costing them more to raise allowances in order for people to live in this area,'' said Sergeant Cherico, who works at the Army recruiting station in Stamford.
''Their priorities are all wrong,'' said Barbara Stubbs, the wife of an Army sergeant. She recalled news reports of the Pentagon's unveiling of the Stealth fighter bomber, which cost $6 billion to develop and build.
''When I saw that black, ugly thing on TV, it made me so angry,'' Mrs. Stubbs said. ''Why in the devil couldn't they have taken that money and put it into housing?''
The Stubbses, who moved to Wassell Lane in early March, said they waited a year to get their home. Before that, the couple and their 6-year-old son lived in a two-bedroom condominium in Naugatuck for $750 a month plus utilities. Sergeant Stubbs, who works as a recruiter in Norwalk, has been in the Army for 14 years. He receives an annual base salary of $20,000.
''Naugatuck was an economic nightmare,'' said Mrs. Stubbs, who added that living in civilian housing made her feel isolated from of her friends among the military families. ''I couldn't wait to get down here,'' she said. ''We're all like one big family.''
 
Some Are Transferring
The evictions will fall hardest on the young families with children, said Myron Verville, an assistant operations officer for the Coast Guard, who lives with his wife, Nancy, in the Fairfield complex.
Some, like the Chericos, who will transfer to California in May, will not be affected by the eviction order. But for those who still have a year or more to serve in Connecticut, the future is uncertain.
''We put in for a transfer,'' said Mrs. Stubbs. ''How much good that will do we don't know. You pretty much live where they tell you to.''
Julie Rosson, a spokeswoman in Washington for United States Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Stamford, said the base-closing bill, for which the Congressman voted, was intended to ''reduce the Federal deficit and raise money for the Government.'' She said Mr. Shays had assumed that the closings involved major military bases. ''He was surprised they counted housing, too,'' Ms. Rosson said.
She added that Representative Shays has written to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney on behalf of the military families living in the Fairfield County sites, asking him to be sensitive to their needs.
Connecticut's Housing Commissioner, John Papandrea, said his department would like to help municipalities or nonprofit organizations buy the properties, if state and Federal officials can negotiate an acceptable price. ''We would like to turn it into affordable housing,'' he said. ''And I know the local governments would certainly be interested.''
Ms. Abbott, the director of the Westport Housing Authority, said that if the town could afford to buy the housing units for low-income families, military personnel would be qualified to live in the homes a moderate rents.
Standing in the front doorway of her Fairfield ranch house, Mrs. O'Donnell she said she will probably move with her two children back to North Carolina while her husband finishes his final two years of duty in Connecticut. Dozens of other military families, she added, are facing similiar futures.
''And they want to throw us out of here to put in the homeless,'' she said shaking her head. ''Well what the heck do they consider us?''

HEADLINE: THEATER;
The Joy of Five Characters All Talking at Once

BYLINE: By SUZANNE RUTA; Suzanne Ruta is the author of ''Stalin in the Bronx and Other Stories'' (Grove).

 BODY:
For years people told the novelist Jose Yglesias that he ought to write a play because his dialogue was so good. He even thought like a dramatist: ideas would come to him in the voices and accents of well-defined characters. This writer of Spanish and Cuban descent would find himself thinking, for example, in the voice of a snobbish New England matron.
But even in his 60's he hesitated. ''I felt and I still think it's true,'' he said recently in a Lower East Side coffee shop, ''that I dare not write plays because I have not been a theater worker, like Shakespeare or, up to the present day, Odets. But I've always kept up with it. The gossip of my life would be theater and movies'' - and the gossip of that morning, when he threw in anecdotes about Henry James, the W.P.A., Jules Feiffer, Howard da Silva, Lorenzo da Ponte, John Garfield and Brecht's actress-daughter, among others.
''And then,'' he continued his thought, ''I just reached a stage where I finished a novel eight years ago, where I said, 'Hey, I'd better have the chutzpah to do it.' I sat down and did a play. I did three plays.'' 
This trilogy drew on the life of his family and their hometown of Ybor City, a section of Tampa, where from the turn of the century poor Cuban, Spanish and Sicilian cigar factory workers made a rich world of their own. For Mr. Yglesias it has been an inexhaustible subject. ''None of us thought of ourselves as immigrants in Ybor City. This was our place. It was those barbarians, the Americans with hair on their teeth. They had no culture. You know, Caruso came to sing in Tampa; he was booked by the Latin colony. If you lived on the other side of town life was a desert. If you lived in Ybor City, it was full of life, political ideas, all sorts of things. You had all the benefits the New Deal tried to bring on in later years. Mutual aid societies. The two best hospitals in town. Daily newspapers.''
There were also the social clubs, Cuban and Spanish, with their ''great ballrooms'' and theaters, Mr. Yglesias remembers, where touring troupes from Spain and Mexico performed, and the local workers staged zarzuelas.
Ybor City was also a political education for him. Jose Marti, the hero of Cuban independence, gave his most important speech in Ybor City. Mr. Yglesias' grandfather shook his hand. ''My background was very class-conscious radical. You know how people say'' - he mimics - '' 'I vote Republican because my parents did'? I'm socialist because my parents were socialist.'' (In one reference work Mr. Yglesias lists his politics: ''I should like to overthrow capitalism.'') So there was never any question as to what he would write about in his plays. And , as he says, the mechanics of playwriting gave him little trouble.
The hard part for him, a much-published member of a family of writers - his wife, Helen, and his son Rafael are both prolific novelists - has been waiting to see a work produced. The Ybor City trilogy has had public readings at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Florida and in-house readings by actors at the Public Theater and Circle Rep in New York. But Joseph Papp's plan to put on all three plays at the Public one day, ''with a long break like Maurice Evans's 'Hamlet,' '' fell through, Mr. Yglesias said, for lack of funds. He is philosophical. ''There's a profound lack of interest in Latins. We're not bankable. The audiences pay to see what interests them and the theatergoing public is not very Latin.''
Then he wrote a fourth play, ''New York 1937,'' an autobiographical comedy set in Manhattan's Washington Heights during the Depression. In the 30's, as the demand for cigars, a luxury item, dwindled and the factories in Ybor City shut down, the cigar makers came to New York looking for work. Mr. Yglesias himself arrived in 1937, fresh out of high school. ''It was like with the Puerto Ricans in the 50's,'' he said. ''You walked into any cafeteria and you went into the kitchen and you called, 'Anybody here from Ybor City?' and there was always somebody.'' At first he lived on 163d Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, near the family cigar store. ''We were the only Latins on the block.'' Most of the neighbors in those days, of course, were German-Jewish refugees from Hitler.
When Mr. Yglesias showed the director Charles Maryan, a fan of his since the Circle Rep readings, his new play about Tampa Latins in New York and their German-Jewish neighbors, Mr. Maryan took it to the Jewish Repertory Theater, where he had already directed several plays. ''New York 1937'' opens at the Jewish Rep on East 14th Street on Thursday, the first of Mr. Yglesias' plays to be staged anywhere. The theater's Israeli-born artistic director, Ran Avni, explained the connection: ''We do plays that have some aspect in them related to the Jewish experience. This play is about people escaping from other cities, other countries. Jews are still escaping from Europe.''
''New York 1937'' turns on a love affair, a pregnancy (involving a different couple), a labor strike and a bankruptcy, all in the space of three days. Something he couldn't do in his novels, Mr. Yglesias often has four or five characters talking at once. ''It's a play of non sequiturs,'' he said proudly. The pathos behind the comedy lies in the close parallel between the plight of political refugees from Hitler and the economic refugees from the Depression in Tampa. The two groups are reduced to shifty expedients to stay afloat. In both there are tensions between timid elders and their radical children. The Latins and the upper-middle-class Germans have been brought up to practice an exquisite courtesy, a definite handicap, as Mr. Yglesias remarked, in the rough and ready United States.
On the second day of rehearsals the sound engineer asked Mr. Yglesias if he had ever seen ''You Can't Take It With You.'' ''My secret was out,'' he said, enjoying the joke on himself. ''This play is my tribute to George S. Kaufman.'' In fact, ''You Can't Take It With You'' was the first play Mr. Yglesias saw in New York on arriving in 1937. He was working, he recalled, as a dishwasher at Hector's Cafeteria at 50th Street and Broadway. ''On my first day off, I went, and with my Southern accent'' - he mimicked himself at 18 with a Florida drawl - ''I asked, 'Do you have a seat for a dollar ten?' '' He saw all the plays on Broadway that summer at 55 cents a throw. The other big events in his life then were union organizing and demonstrations for the Spanish Republic. When he talks about the 30's, nostalgia creeps in. He looks back 50 years to the long-gone days of ''political trade unionism.'' ''You felt there was a future, that you could fight for it,'' he said. At one point in the play, a character sings two lines from ''The Peat Bog Soldiers,'' the German song about concentration camp inmates. When the sound engineer came up with a tape of the song recorded in Madrid in the late 30's by German Communists of the Thaelmann Brigade, Mr. Yglesias said he took it home and listened and cried. But there's nothing nostalgic about the play, he insists. ''It's entirely ironic. Everybody in the play is very prejudiced and the irony of it is that the one person who isn't, the least prejudiced person in the play, is German.''
Mr. Yglesias had written novels and memoirs about his family before he put them in his plays. Did the plays reveal anything new? ''I felt I had to know people in a quite different way,'' he said. ''I had to know their outwardness.'' Casting the play - when words became flesh - was the final revelation.
''In the young people we saw an enormous number of Latin actors who are terrific. One of the guys is wonderful. We cast him as soon as he said the first line. But you know what's hard to find? Latin actors past their mid-40's. To find Sofia'' - the aunt who holds the family together - ''was very difficult.'' Then they found Antonia Rey, a Cuban actress already established when she left her country in 1961. ''I don't have to explain the slighest nuance of her character to her. She's totally authentic.'' Other members of the extended Cuban family are played by a Chicano from California, a bilingual actress who works in English and French and an Italian from Washington Heights ''who has lived with a Latin.''
Will there be more plays to give work to some of that young Latin talent? ''I have a play I'm working on so dark and terrible I don't know why I should write it. I have one I call my WASP play, which takes place in Maine, with no Latins in it. It's the only thing I've written that has no Latins in it. Then I have a couple of others that deal with Tampa Latins. But nobody wants them. You get the feeling, why write another play?''
For solace he draws on his stock of theater gossip. ''It was 10 years before Shaw got a creditable production. And then, poor Chekhov, his first production had three days of rehearsal, the first of which was spent by the actors screaming at one another about who was upstaging whom.''
That morning, a Saturday, the 14th Street YMHA that houses the Jewish Rep's 100-seat theater, with a larger theater under construction, was empty and quiet. Other days, Mr. Yglesias said, it is full of people from the Lower East Side, including Latin immigrants, taking classes, using the gym - an appropriate setting, he feels, for his stage debut.

HEADLINE: Millions Join Battle for a Beloved Planet

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Two decades after the birth of the modern environmental movement, millions of people around the nation and the world renewed the call to arms for an endangered planet yesterday with an exuberant and bittersweet celebration of Earth Day 1990.
It was not quite The Day the Earth Stood Still, as an avalanche of publicity in recent weeks had prophesied, but by day's end organizers of the sequel to Earth Day 1970 said 200 million people in 140 nations had taken part in the largest grass-roots demonstration in history.
And a vast patchwork quilt of marches, rallies, concerts, festivals, street fairs and other events in 3,600 communities in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa and North and South America seemed to bear them out.
''It's like earth's birthday,'' said Gordon Vestnys, a 25-year-old roofer, strolling at a fair overlooking San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. ''It's a gathering of people becoming more aware - and hopefully continuing after today with more consciousness and less Styrofoam.'' 
 
From Italy to Nepal
Diverse, contradictory, extravagant: the bewildering global panoply of happenings included a trash-picking trek up Mount Everest in Nepal, a 500-mile human chain across France, a gathering of space travelers at the United Nations, an ''eco-fair'' on a landfill island in Japan and a roadway ''lie-down'' by 5,000 people to protest car fumes in Italy.
In New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta and cities and towns across this country there were tree-plantings, litter sweeps, recycling exhibits, workshops on wildlife and endangered species, fairs and a sunrise-to-sunset clamor for environmental morality that often mimicked the hoopla of a political campaign.
President Bush went fishing in the Florida Keys and used a telephone hookup to address thousands at an Earth Day rally on the Columbia River near George, Wash. Members of Congress, governors, mayors and hosts of other officials got on the bandwagon.
But it was not a day for politicans or corporations, though many of them embraced the common good with solemn pronouncements upon polluted air and oceans, fouled rivers and beaches, the perils of acid rain and tropical deforestation, toxic wastes and mountains of garbage.
Rather, it was a day for ordinary people and the meanings they chose to give it, a day to turn away from the memories of cold war and a hard focus on economic growth, to gather in vast throngs or quiet settings and express something about themselves and their world.
 
'Start Saving the Earth'
''It's really necessary to start saving the earth,'' said Kathy Bernstein, 60, at a festival in Chicago's Lincoln Park. ''I've got grandchildren, and it's necessary to imbue in them that you have to save things, not just be users.''
At a fair in the Playa Del Rey district of Los Angeles, Leslea Meyerhoff, 22, explained: ''I'm here because I think an individual can make a difference if they are aware of recycling and conservation. One way to let people know of the environmental crisis is through activties like this that promote public awareness.''
For some, like Philip C. Martinez, a drum-maker from the Taos Pueblo Indian Reservation in New Mexico, the urgency was greater. ''We're here to save our land,'' he said at a rally in Washington, D.C. ''They're trying to put both an airport and a nuclear waste dump near our reservation. Ten years ago, if we had said anything about it, nobody would have listened. Today, people care.''
 
The Weather Seemed to Approve
And in London, Andrew Lees of the British branch of Friends of the Earth said, ''If Earth Day does nothing else, it will give the clear message to politicians that millions of people are aware of the problems facing the earth and what needs to be done about it.''
It was a balmy spring day in most of the United States. The sun arched over the continent in a sky that was pristine blue in the east and resembled a summer sea flecked with whitecaps in much of the rest of the country. Not everyone, however, turned out because of the day's gentle beauty or a commitment to the environment.
''I'm here to see Bob Weir - I'll admit it,'' said Matt Herren, 18, at a blustery, rainy San Francisco Earth Day concert featuring the Grateful Dead star. And across the nation in Times Square, scene of an observance early yesterday, Jeffrey Aym, 21, of Morristown, N.J., acknowledged: ''We're here because we missed Woodstock,'' the peace movement's 1969 rock-and-drugs festival.
But most people said they had come out because they believed their presence would make a difference, and the turnouts in many communities appeared to underscore a new political commitment to the environment by Americans, one coinciding with the fading era of confrontation with Communism.
 
Evocations of the 1960's
Some said the environmental movement had more support than any since the antiwar and civil rights protests of the 1960's.
And, indeed, scenes reminiscent of the 1960's were abundant across the country. In New York, a huge throng -the police said 750,000, but it was like counting jelly beans in a jar - heard a concert in Central Park. In Washington, 125,000 people crowded onto the sun-drenched Capitol Mall: students in tie-dyed T-shirts and young professionals, older people who remembered the marches of a generation ago. Music and Frisbees floated up, and kites rode the breeze.
Many across the land felt no need to attend spectacular events. They stayed home or met in small groups to plant flowers or saplings, clean up roadsides and vacant lots or just talk about their neighorhoods or why the loss of the ozone layer or the destruction of the Brazilian rain forests were important.
It was possible for some, away from the crowds and the noise, to observe scenes of decorous beauty and be aware of the hidden pollution: sunlight shimmering like gold coins on a Connecticut lake choked with algae; vegetables banked at a stand in New York, an artist's palette of oranges, grapes and bright red tomatoes coated with pesticides; and the Hudson River, tainted with PCB's, flowing in stately procession like a doomed blue regiment moving South.
Such awareness was the essential point of the day, its organizers said. ''It is incumbent upon each of us to make environmentally sound choices throughout our daily lives,'' said Denis Hayes, the 45-year-old chairman of Earth Day 1990 and an organizer of the first celebration 20 years ago.
 
The Creation of a Coalition
''If we consider the environmental consequences of our purchases, our options in transportation, our investments, and our votes, we can send a powerful message to our public policymakers and our business leaders to do the same.''
Two years in the planning, Earth Day 1990 was orchestrated by a coalition of organizations - Greenpeace, the National Resources Defense Council, the Rainbow Coalition, the National Education Association, the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood and many others - to evoke the idealism of Earth Day 1970, which launched the modern environmental movement.
Nevertheless, there was a widespread sense that this Earth Day had been sold to the American people with the same techniques employed by peddlers of soap and patriotism, but many also said that that was not a bad thing, given the urgency of the environmental cause.
''It feels mass-marketed,'' said Armando Martis, a Brooklyn dancer who was headed for Earth Day events in midtown Manhattan. ''But that's good because it gets the message out to a lot of people.''
Nearby, Rita Robbins said:''I don't think this is too commercial, although about 12 people have tried to sell me buttons - none of them biodegradable.''
''It's a lot of hype, but for a good thing,'' said Donald Braler, a 30-year-old New York film technician.
 
'Really Fast Start' Is Seen
There were other grumblings about companies with poor-to-disastrous pollution records that for weeks had run Earth Day advertisements expressing concern for the ecology, all without the blessing of Earth Day organizers, who said corporate America had wrapped itself in a green flag.
About 2,000 people were at the Washington Monument for Earthfest '90, an event sponsored by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. John Denver sang a song he had written for the event, ''The Flower That Shattered the Stone,'' and the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, gave a speech about the meaning of Earth Day.
Afterward, he told reporters: ''It seems to me that the President has made a really fast start on the environment. I can't think of any 15-month period that produced as much by way of environemental initiatives, decisions and participation by a President.'' Later, he sat alone backstage, sipping a soda as the reporters streamed past him in pursuit of the actor Tom Cruise.
 
The Tribute in New York
In Central Park, a celebrity-studded concert entertained the crowd in the afternoon, and speakers included Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins, the union activist Caesar Chavez and others who talked of ecological responsibility.
But there were other settings in the park, less noticed, that gave meaning to the day: contrasts of young and old, of death and renewal - last year's faded grass beside a blaze of yellow daffodils; old people on benches, faces upturned to a warming sun, dreaming of long ago, and out on the lake, far from the exhausts of automobiles, a young boatman upright on the prow, floating like an ancient Chinese dragon.
On the Avenue of the Americas, huge throngs of people, at times all but immobilized by their own numbers, sampled a potpourri of arts and crafts, t-shirts and food, blaring rock music and exortations of environmental responsibility.
Much of it had the flavor of a 1960's antiwar festival: amid books on yoga and meditation were booths draped with hand-made jewelry, yogis orange-robed and cross-legged, people strolling hand-in-hand and vendors of vegetarian cuisine like mango nectar and ''Southern fried cauliflower.''
 
Recycling by the Homeless
The avenue was in shade most of the day between walls of soaring skyscrapers that symbolized corporate America - Exxon, the New York Hilton, CBS, Rockefeller Center, Paine Webber, Manufacturers Hanover Trust. The buildings were closed and the avenue, normally choked with vehicles, teemed with life. A stand sold biodegradable bags, recycled denim rugs and bumper stickers and signs that proclaimed: ''Acid Rain Is a Bad Trip,'' ''No Cholesterol'' and ''High Fiber.''
There were oases of beauty: baskets of pink petunias, red fuchsias, orange and purple impatiens, white peace lilies and banks of begonias, geraniums and renunculus. Nearby, a booth sold lovely bonsai: miniature windblown Japanese elms and junipers.
But it was big trees that preoccupied a man on a bandstand. ''Every ton of recycled paper will save 17 trees that give off precious oxygen for our planet,'' he said. He spoke, too, of recycling, but only a few people were actually doing it, as they do every day - the homeless, picking their way through the crowd, collecting cans and bottles.
Despite the vast numbers of people and events, there was something strangely serene about Earth Day. It hearkened back to the measured values of another age, when Americans raised a barn in an afternoon and took walks of an evening or gathered around a radio in a crisis to listen, not just to what they wanted to hear, but to a familiar voice talking sense.

HEADLINE: Bush Denies Any Deal With Iran for Release

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Administration officials said today that the release of the American hostage Robert Polhill was the result of months of messages to the Iranians that if they wanted better relations with Washington, they would have to unconditionally release all hostages.
''I'm not making gestures. I don't trade for hostages,'' President Bush said in Florida when asked whether the release would lead to some concrete expression of good will.
''This is a mission uncompleted,'' said the President, who spoke with Mr. Polhill and his wife, Feryal, by telephone. ''I do not have forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held against his will.'' 
Apparently mindful of the Iran-contra affair, in which the Reagan Administration sought to trade arms for hostages, the Bush Administration emphasized that there would be no material trade-off for Mr. Polhill's freedom other than helping to pave the way for better relations between Iran and the United States. Officials said that messages to that effect had been conveyed to Iran through Japan and Switzerland.
 
What Iran Wants
It was difficult at this early stage to confirm this independently, since a specific reward theoretically might be reaped only after the Iranians arranged the release of the seven other Americans whose destiny they control.
Since the benefits that Iran is believed to want most from the United States - an end to the trade embargo, the unfreezing of Iranian assets and an end to Iran's isolation - are all things that successive Administrations have said they would address once all the hostages are freed, an explicit quid pro quo might not really be necessary.
Nevertheless, Administration officials believe that at least some Iranian leaders are hoping to bargain for some of these gains immediately, or to give the impression of a tradeoff for their own domestic political needs, using some of the seven Americans still being held by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Beirut as bait.
The initial demand by the Islamic Holy War For the Liberation of Palestine that Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs John Kelly come to Damascus to receive the freed hostage was seen by the Administration as a probe by the Iranians or their Lebanese surrogates to see whether the Americans could again be enticed into the hostage bazaar.
The release of Mr. Polhill, the officials said, was probably a probe to see how the United States would react -whether the hostage issue would once again dominate the headlines, whether the President would be pressured anew to negotiate and whether the Administration would make some compensatory gesture.
That was why Mr. Bush reacted in a low-key, stern and ungrateful manner - to signal the Iranians that until all of the American hostages are released, it will be as though none of them have been freed, the officials said. His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, issued a statement thanking Iran and Syria for their help in the release, but it could not have been more terse.
 
A Debate in Teheran
Administration officials also say they are trying to influence what they believe is a debate in Teheran. Some factions believe Iran can and should try to bargain for the other seven hostages, the officials said. Other factions, apparently led by President Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, feel that after the controversy stirred by the Iran-contra scandal, no deal is likely, and holding the remaining hostages only hurts Iran, the Administration officials said.
The officials said that Syria's role in the release was largely confined to logistics, although the United States Ambassador in Damascus, Edward Djerejian, openly praised Damascus. That the Syrians handled the release does not mean that they were responsible for it. Administration officials said the decision was made entirely in Iran.
But one American official said that as a payoff to Syria for its assistance to Iran in Lebanon, Teheran allowed Damascus to convey the good news to the Bush Administration. This was something the Syrians wanted to do because of their own interest in improving ties with Washington.
Administration officials said that the story of Mr. Polhill's release began with Mr. Rafsanjani's inauguration as President last August. Mr. Rafsanjani has long been associated with a faction of Iran's revolutionary elite that feels Iran's future lies in ending its isolation, restoring economic relations with the West and securing an end to the American trade embargo.
Since Mr. Rafsanjani took office, Administration officials say, his Government has been working through two channels, one public, the other private. It has privately made use of the Japanese Embassy and of the Swiss Embassy, which represents United States interests in Teheran, to send messages to the Bush Administration indicating that Iran wanted to improve ties and probing to see what it might expect to receive in return for the release of any hostages.
After he consolidated his rule, Mr. Rafsanjani began to condition the Iranian public to the notion of releasing some or all the hostages.
A series of editorials in the Teheran Times, viewed as Mr. Rafsanjani's mouthpiece, began arguing the case for releasing the hostages. On Feb. 22, the Teheran Times declared that ''Muslim forces should work to get the hostages free with no precondition.''

HEADLINE: Iran Reportedly Gave Weapons To Obtain U.S. Hostage Release

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, April 22

 BODY:
The Iranian Government gave Muslim fundamentalists in Lebanon weapons and financial assistance to persuade them to release American hostages, according to security officials here.
Some of the weapons, which included tanks, armored personnel carriers and multibarreled launchers, were on display here on Friday at parades staged by the Iranian-backed Party of God, said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
The deal was worked out during two trips to Lebanon in the last four weeks by Mahmoud Hashemi, the brother of President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, the officials said. Mahmoud Hashemi, head of the Middle East section in the Iranian Foreign Ministry, also held talks in Damascus with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa. 
 
Circumstantial Evidence Cited
Arab diplomats here said they could not confirm the security officials' assertions, but they referred to what they called circumstantial evidence lending the reports credibility.
They recalled that in mid-March Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine - the faction that today freed Robert Polhill, one of its three American hostages - had issued a strongly worded statement rejecting appeals by Teheran and a senior Lebanese Shiite cleric for the unconditional release of the captives. The clandestine group had said it would kill the hostages if previously made demands were not met.
Then last week, the group said it would free an American captive in response to pleas from Iranian leaders. The hostage designated for release was Mr. Polhill; the two Americans still held by the group are Jesse Turner and Alann Steen.
In February, Teheran began to indicate that it favored freeing all 18 Westerners believed to be held by Lebanese Shiite organizations upholding the principles of the Iranian revolution of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The move to free the hostages appeared to have been sponsored by President Rafsanjani and the Foreign Ministry and was promoted by The Teheran Times, the English-language daily known for its closeness to the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
 
A Move of Conciliation
The gesture, coinciding with the 11th anniversary of Iran's revolution, came as President Rafsanjani was signaling the country's desire for better ties with the West and for Western help to shore up the Iranian economy, depressed after eight years of war with Iraq.
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the Lebanese Shiite scholar called the spiritual mentor of the Party of God, demanded in an address in West Beirut that all foreign hostages be freed ''because their case is being exploited to tarnish the image of Islam and the Muslims.'' The cleric had just returned from Teheran, where he attended celebrations marking the revolution's anniversary.
At the beginning, discreet negotiations produced no results because the kidnappers insisted on something in return for freeing the hostages, security officials said.
Washington had rejected repeated calls by Islamic Holy War for the Liberation of Palestine to pressure Israel for the release of hundreds of Lebanese and Palestinian guerrillas in its jails. Israel said it would be prepared to discuss a swap to free three Israeli soldiers captured during action in southern Lebanon in the past four years.
 
Fundamentalists Look to Future
The Iranians helped create the Party of God in Lebanon eight years ago. But since the rise to power of President Rafsanjani, described as a pragmatist, and the decline of militants inside the Iranian Government, Lebanese fundamentalists have become increasingly worried about their future.
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi lost his position as Iran's Interior Minister in August 1989, when President Rafsanjani formed his Cabinet. Mr. Mohtashemi, now a member of the Iranian Parliament, was instrumental in channeling Iranian assistance to the Party of God in Lebanon for several years. In a recent speech, he urged the Lebanese kidnappers to hold on to the hostages.
Mass rallies and military parades staged by the Party of God on Friday showed that the fundamentalists have gained in strength and will probably try to gain the upper hand with Lebanon's one million Shiites.
Street gunfights last week in West Beirut with rival Shiite militia of the Amal movement indicated that the Party of God has infiltrated many residential quarters in the predominantly Muslim part of town.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
NEW YORK RALLY BACKS LITHUANIA

 BODY:
More than 1,000 demonstrators waving Lithuanian flags rallied outside the Soviet Mission to the United Nations yesterday to protest economic measures taken against Lithuania by the Soviet Government and to call on the United States to recognize the Baltic republic's independence.
After hearing several speakers denounce President Bush for his cautious approach to the increasingly tense situation in Lithuania, the protesters marched down Fifth Avenue to St. Patrick's Cathedral for a special mass attended by Bishop Thomas Vose Daily, the newly installed Bishop of Brooklyn. 
The crowd was orderly but vocal, chanting, ''Don't sell us out!'' On Fifth Avenue many strollers joined in, and many others signed letters to Mr. Bush, asking him to recognize the Lithuanian government and take economic and political measures against Moscow.
Several women wore traditional hand-woven skirts and aprons, adding a festive air to the procession.
 
D'Amato Cites Summit Talks
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who recently was turned back from the Lithuanian border by Soviet guards who would not recognize the visa issued by Lithuania, suggested using the coming summit meeting between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush to apply pressure on Moscow to end the embargo.
Angela K. Nelsas, president of the California-based Baltic American Freedom League, said that in a meeting on Wednesday, the President reiterated his concern that any strong show of support for Lithuania by the United States might hamper President Gorbachev's efforts to change the Soviet political and economic system.
''Mr. Bush right now is not being a spokesman for the ideals this country was built on - freedom, democracy and self-determination,'' she said.

HEADLINE: When Plant Shuts Down, Retraining Laid-Off Workers Is Toughest Job Yet

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CICERO, Ill.

 BODY:
Spread over miles of fissured asphalt and chain-link fences, blocks beyond the western edge of Chicago, lie the carcasses of once mighty factories.
On March 2, yet another factory expired, one where the General Electric Company made refrigerators. It is making them instead in Decatur, Ala., where it pays nonunion workers $9.50 an hour, $4 less than it paid here, helping it to keep up with its competitors.
One of the 1,200 people to lose a job here is Freddie Anderson, 42 years old, divorced and the father of two. He worked at the plant since he finished high school and a stint in the Navy. One day this week Mr. Anderson joined a resume-writing class in a cheery, white-walled room that has been carved into G.E.'s dingy brick administration building. 
 
Ingredients of a Resume
''A resume is like baking a cake,'' one of the five counselors, Melvin Williams, told the class. ''The same ingredients almost always go into a resume - like name, address, phone number, job objective, job at G.E.''
At the outplacement center here, the American factory worker confronts the new world of work in the starkest terms possible. Better production technology and tougher competition, much of it against foreign industries that pay workers far less than the men and women here were paid, have driven down the earning power of people who for years made a good living. Good pay now comes with versatility and good education, and few of these people have either.
''That work force is as dysfunctional as you can get,'' Roberts T. Jones, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training, said of the G.E. plant. ''You have the anomaly of people coming out of a long successful job history and not able to meet entry-level requirements of other jobs. It's a worst-case model. If you can succeed there, you have a shot at succeeding at most other plants.''
General Electric voluntarily set up the Cicero center, with a staff of 14, by using $1.3 million of its own and $2.7 million from the Department of Labor.
Policy makers and labor experts call retraining the antidote to the human dislocations that accompany the demise of old industries. But so far the results have been mixed.
 
His Prospects Are Cloudy
Mr. Anderson had one of the better jobs at the plant, one involving skill, variety and the opportunity to make judgments. But even his prospects are not especially bright.
''My last job was repairman,'' he said. ''I inspected the cases for dents, scratches, paint defects before final assembly. I repaired them. It was a very good job. I loved it.''
He said he had found only two other jobs so far - one driving a school bus four hours a day for $8 an hour, the other as a $5-an-hour, three-month temporary worker at the United States Postal Service, after which he can apply for an $11-an-hour job if one is available. Even then, he would have to submit to a long written test, a task he has never faced.
Most of the workers are relatively old and unskilled. They have little formal education, and 56 percent are black and 24 percent are Hispanic -groups that have had a tougher time finding good jobs than whites.
 
Many Problems, Few Successes
''We have Hispanics who have never had to communicate in English,'' said Claudia D. Brennan, co-director of the program. She said many, including some of the 50 percent who are high school graduates, function at a fifth- or sixth-grade level.
Drawing firm conclusions about the Cicero program is not possible yet. The program was established two years ago but was slow getting off the ground and has one more year to run. Problems have cropped up - some because of the attitudes of the workers, some because of company practices, some because of union hostility.
By G.E.'s own measure of success -placing 85 percent of the workers in jobs that pay at least 75 percent of their G.E. wage - the company has a long way to go. Ms. Brennan, whom the company hired to work with the union's co-director, Salvador Diaz, said 187 people had found other jobs through March. But 148 of them were not really retrained; they transferred to Decatur and other G.E. plants at hourly wages of $9 to $12, with all their old benefits.
But such opportunities with the company have been largely exhausted now. The 39 others who have found new jobs are mostly in manufacturing, jobs that pay an average of $8.50 an hour, or 63 percent of their old wage. About 225 of the plant's 1,200 workers, those over 55 with at least 25 years with the company, have retired with pensions and other benefits. #750 Still Need Jobs And about 250 have been shifted to the one G.E. plant here, making heating coils for electric stoves and heating elements for dishwashers. But those workers simply bumped out others who had less seniority, forcing layoffs down the line.
About 750 people still need jobs, many more at this point than the company first expected.
Because fewer workers than expected have participated in the full retraining program, G.E. advised the Labor Department some months ago to reduce the $4.7 million three-year subsidy it initially offered to the current $2.7 million.
Still, the dislocated workers here have an edge on most others. Many companies provide no retraining at all, leaving their former employees to fend for themselves or seek help through community programs.
 
'One of the Best' in Retraining
General Electric, along with the nation's auto makers, is among the most experienced corporate retrainers in the United States. The company has set up programs to help the more than 100,000 workers it has laid off over the last decade.
''We don't like closings,'' said William H. Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, G.E.'s biggest union. But in retraining, he said, G.E. is ''one of the best.''
In Cicero's case, G.E. went a step further than usual. It gave its workers two and a half years' notice of the closing, far longer than it or other companies had allowed at other plants.
General Electric also provides a week's pay for each year of work; many who have worked at G.E. for 20 years or more have received checks exceeding $10,000.
The company contributes $750 to $1,500 to help workers move to jobs at other G.E. plants. It also lets them keep most of their benefits for a year after they are laid off, and they can apply for up to $7,500 for tuition reimbursement at any time over five years. Moreover, G.E.'s outplacement center is unusually well equipped to lead workers through the often intimidating paces of finding new jobs.
Clifton Collins, 53, who was a punch press operator and forklift driver, is an 18-year veteran who seems to be one of the luckier candidates. He is considering a job that would pay $17.50 an hour. But he is fearful for his health because the job is in asbestos removal.
''They will send me to school to learn safety precautions and get a license,'' he said. ''But it's dangerous work.'' He said he had no other options yet. Adult Education and Job Training The outplacement center provides adult education courses in math, in English as a second language and in preparing for a high school diploma. It provides job-hunting assistance, with help in conducting interviews, filling out applications, writing resumes and negotiating on the telephone.
It also steers workers into on-the-job training with other employers - a dimension of the center's work for which the staff had high hopes. Employers who find a worker qualified in most respects but lacking a skill agree to take him on and teach him the skill. In return, the center gives the employer half the worker's wages until the worker is fully trained, up to 26 weeks.
''It's the best way to get employees hired,'' Ms. Brennan said. But few workers sought such jobs in the first two years of the program. About 200 took the adult education and job placement courses, but few were willing to take the final step and commit themselves to another job.
One reason workers procrastinated was psychological. ''Most of the people said two years is too far away,'' said Mr. Diaz, 60, who worked at the plant for 33 years before he was appointed co-director of the center. ''We tried our best to motivate people, but we didn't start getting numbers of them coming in until six months ago.''
 
Benefits Delayed Job Searches
Inadvertently in some ways, the company encouraged workers to postpone their search. Under a collective bargaining agreement with the union, Local 571 of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, G.E. paid a $900 bonus to everyone who was still working as of last June.
The company's benefit plans are an obstacle, too. By working through the end of last year, for example, workers could collect more vacation pay than they could by leaving early. And G.E.'s separation pay, on top of 26 weeks of Government unemployment benefits, came to $9.30 an hour for the average worker - more than the $8.50 that workers on average are getting in jobs outside General Electric.
For all its experience in retraining, General Electric has learned a few things from its experience in Cicero.
''We've been slowed down by our own benefits,'' said Thomas J. Olander, director of employee and community relations at the plant. ''It behooves people to wait until the very end.''

HEADLINE: Property Taxes Should Be Passed Along to Regulated Rents Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Why Tax Apartment Dwellers More?'' (editorial, April 5) gives the misconception that all New York City residential landlords can pass along part of their real-estate tax increases to tenants. Landlords of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled buildings cannot pass even a penny of real-estate tax increases to residential tenants. 
This is especially scary for small-property owners subject to rent regulations who, in view of Mayor David N. Dinkins's threat to raise property taxes to reduce the city's budget deficit, are forced to subsidize their tenants' ever-growing share of our city's economic burden.
A residential real-estate-tax escalation that reflects a percentage of the actual increase in a building's real-estate taxes, should be added to all regulated residential rents, as for commercial leases.
If such a tax escalation is adopted at the next rent-stabilization-guidelines hearing, and tens of thousands of residential tenants are affected by real-estate-tax increases, the Mayor will be under even greater pressure from both landlord and tenant groups to trim the massive waste and mismanagement in city government, rather than raise real estate taxes again.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
World to Vilnius: Suffer

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When an individual becomes a dissident, he or she is seen by the outside world as a hero: a Sakharov or Mandela stirs the conscience of the world. But when a captive nation becomes a dissident, its resistance to oppression becomes an inconvenience to mankind; it is accused of being an impediment to the Big Picture, a threat to worshipers of the idol of Stability.
That is why European industrialists who insisted that the Kremlin would never use its natural-gas pipeline as a weapon are now so silent at the cutoff to Lithuania. (No mask can be worn to protect civilians against the cutoff of natural gas.) That is why polls say American public opinion treats the reach for independence by the dissident nation to be an annoyance, preferring 2 to 1 that our President continue his policy of paying lip service to the Lithuanian assertion of longstanding independence - while supporting Gorbachev and protecting the summit meeting. 
We have been sold a bill of goods. We are told that we have a great stake in the personal success of Mr. Gorbachev; that his success depends on his absolute control of the Kremlin; and that he would lose control to some neo-Stalinist faction if his freeing of Central European nations extended to the three Baltic republics which were grabbed a few years earlier.
The opposite is true. Our interest in Mr. Gorbachev is limited to his ability to withdraw troops from illegally seized nations and to speed the transition to political and economic freedom; his motive to make these reforms is rooted in the fear of the failed system's impending collapse; and by not putting a price on his reversion to command control, we remove a central impetus for the growth of democracy.
Does pressing Mr. Gorbachev to acknowledge the independence of the Baltic states really jeopardize, as White House backgrounders argue, our greater objective of troop withdrawal and missile reduction?
A minority think not. We believe that the West's toleration of his decision to make economic war on a conquered nation that now dares to assert its freedom is not merely morally wrong, but geopolitically unsound. It breaks the democratic momentum. Our failure to denounce the threat of ''presidential rule'' - the euphemism for dictatorship - bolsters the imperious inclinations of the Soviet strongman and undermines sensibly radical reformers.
But Mr. Bush, following isolationist public opinion in the U.S., and under the cloak of ''consultation'' with European leaders eager to abandon the idea of collective security, is temporizing. The great symbolic dish of the Bush White House kitchen has become the waffle.
In light of this tepid support, what should besieged Lithuanians do?
Negotiating in a vacuum is a non-starter. Offering concessions when the other side answers only with a blockade is taken as weakness rather than reasonableness. The cap of independence has been tossed over the wall; the declaration cannot be undeclared without abject surrender.
Counting on the West for help at the start is another mistake. Our nervous doves (worried about nuclear shakiness of a disintegrating Soviet Union) combine with our ultra-pragmatists (worried about a future charge of ''Who lost Gorbachev?'') to say: America has other fish to fry.
Armed revolt is not an option: as one Balt told me, ''there are no hills here -we cannot do an Afghanistan.''
What's left? Suffering and lamentation; sustained resistance and dramatically expressed resentment; refusal to be starved into submission.
Public suffering can be a powerful force, as individual dissidents have demonstrated. Freedom never comes easily, and rarely does it come from outside.
To prick the conscience of the world, Lithuanians will have to do more than line up cars at gas stations. They will have to parade their jobless, show the ravages of Gorbachev's blockade on their children, passively torment their oppressors and become the grim example of the failure of glasnost.
Moscow's no-gas attack is effective, as is occupiers' brutality, the takeover of printing plants and the imposition of a quisling prosecutor.
But relentless resistance in the cause of long-denied independence begets the shame of bystanders; growing shame changes public opinion; and rising outrage could force politicians to offer recognition, a sealift, serious countervailing economic pressure.
Mr. Gorbachev will set the Baltic nations free only if he must. The Balts, by their courage and willingness to suffer, can shame the world into making sure he must.

HEADLINE: A Warning to Would-Be Federal Judges

BYLINE: By Howard M. Metzenbaum; Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Imagine you are a lawyer looking to join a private club in your community, one known to be a good place to expand your business and professional opportunities. You meet all the necessary qualifications for membership except one: You are a woman and the club bars women.
Now imagine that a male member of this club is nominated to be a Federal judge. The nominee - who, as a judge, will hear sex discrimination cases - has never been particularly troubled by the club's exclusion of women and has never tried to change its discriminatory by-laws. Should this lawyer be confirmed as a judge by the Senate Judiciary Committee? 
A nominee's membership in a club that discriminates on the basis of race, sex, religion or ethnicity is a matter of serious concern for the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the words of former President Reagan's Solicitor General, Charles Fried: ''The committee has the right to insist that a nominee . . . display some personal devotion to the principles of fairness and equal dignity which lie behind the law.''
Membership in a discriminatory club raises serious questions about a nominee's personal commitment to identifying and eliminating discrimination. Such membership also raises doubts about the nominee's understanding of the economic harm suffered by those who are excluded. Let's face it: Contacts are made and business is conducted at these clubs. If you're locked out because you're female, black or Jewish, you're denied opportunities to get ahead.
A nominee's membership in a discriminatory club also undermines the public's confidence in the judiciary. A party or attorney in a discrimination case has every right to doubt the impartiality of a decision rendered by a judge who finds nothing wrong with belonging to a discriminatory club.
There is a growing consensus among members of the Judiciary Committee that it is highly improper for a judge or a senior Justice Department official to belong to a discriminatory club. This view is echoed by the American Bar Association, whose code of judicial conduct says: ''It is inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin.''
Unfortunately, there is not agreement regarding how to assess a nominee who resigns from such a club shortly after - or on the eve of -being nominated by the President. For many, resignation from a discriminatory club suffices to eliminate the concerns raised by the membership.
That is not enough. A nominee who blithely supports a private club's exclusionary policies, but then resigns in order to become a judge, does not display the kind of ''personal devotion'' to fairness and equal dignity referred to by Mr. Fried.
If a nominee fails to grasp the harm caused by the discriminatory policies of a private club that enhances its members' business and professional opportunities, then I have to wonder about his understanding of, and commitment to, equal justice and the principles underlying our civil rights laws.
I do not believe that a nominee should be permitted to swap his membership in a discriminatory club, one that has denied women or other minorities business and professional opportunities that he has enjoyed, for a seat on the Federal bench. Our judicial system should demand more than that.
On the other hand, a nominee who is a member of a discriminatory club but takes a leadership role in trying to change its policies does show sensitivity to fairness and equal justice concerns. I have voted in favor of nominees who, before being nominated, took visible and active steps to change a discriminatory club's policies.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, the President and the American Bar Association must send a clear message to all lawyers who aspire to be Federal judges: Starting now, you've either got to resign from any discriminatory club or start changing the club's policies. Fairness and equal justice demand nothing less.

HEADLINE: Report on New York Deplores Slowness of Environmental Reviews

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
Lengthy and unpredictable environmental reviews in New York City are hampering the development of new homes, schools and businesses, a prominent business group says.
In a study released yesterday, the group, the New York City Partnership, said that the approvals could take as long as three years and that the delays had added $250 million to 44 projects worth $2.5 billion.
The group blamed the problems on overlapping authority of agencies, a shortage of government staff, outdated zoning and inexact methods that left developers uncertain of government requirements.
''We believe the process requires fundamental reform,'' the report says. It calls on the city to reduce the time and cost of the reviews by 25 percent within a year. 
 
'Severe Social Consequences'
In an interview, Ronald K. Shelp, the group's president, said the delays were particularly harmful given the region's ''soft economy,'' which has businesses uneasy about expansion costs. He also said that the delays had ''severe social consequences'' beyond their immediate impact on business.
Mr. Shelp mentioned the city's 10-year capital plan, for instance, which calls for the development of 40 new elementary and intermediate schools and 37,000 new units of affordable housing - goals that he said the delays would make difficult to reach.
''The bottom line is that business knows the current development process is a major obstacle to all kinds of development,'' said Mr. Shelp.
The report examined 288 projects in fiscal years 1988 and 1989 that had to undergo environmental reviews. State law requires an environmental review for any project that requires discretionary government action, like a zoning change. #19 Months for Approval Of the 288 public and private projects, 44 had to submit full-scale environmental impact statements, which took an average of 19 months to gain approval. The environmental reviews of the private developments took the longest, averaging more than two years.
Projects that were not required to have full environmental impact statements still took an average of seven months to gain approval, the report said.
After completing the environmental review, many developments still have to go before several public hearings for approval. That process, called the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, is required to be completed within six months.
Mr. Shelp said that he thought an environmental review was ''clearly essential'' to address citizens' concerns about traffic, pollution, open space and other issues, but that his group found current procedures ''inefficient, far too time consuming, expensive and wasteful.''
Efforts to reach city environmental review officials yesterday were unsuccessful.
 
Zoning Changes Recommended
The report's suggestions for improving the reviews include the following:
* The city needs to revise inappropriate zoning in several important development areas of the city so that individual projects would not have to seek zoning changes. That would allow more projects to proceed without the rezoning rulings that require individual environmental review, and would also allow more comprehensive planning. The report cites Long Island City, Queens, as an area where rapid change has made old zoning outdated.
* Improved management is needed, including the designation of one city agency to coordinate each environmental review. Each is now handled by the city's Planning Department and the city's Department of Environmental Protection. The report also calls for expanded staffs, better coordination between the city and state, and more oversight by the Mayor's office.
* In addition, the city should provide more precise standards for conducting the reviews. The report says developers are often unclear about what assumptions and methods to use.
The Partnership, Mr. Shelp said, has had first-hand experience with development delays through its affiliate, the New York City Housing Partnership. This is a joint-venture with the city that has built 5,000 units of moderately priced housing since it began in 1982.
The report cites one of those projects as an example of the costliness of delays. A plan to build 51 two-family houses in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn took 22 months to gain environmental approval even though a full environmental impact statement was not needed, the report said.
Had the review been completed a year earlier, the report said, the homes could have been priced at $189,000 rather than $201,000. It said the delay led the city to spend an additional $510,000 in subsidies.

HEADLINE: EARTH DAY 1990;
In Europe, the Intentions Outpace Real Progress

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, April 22

 BODY:
Western Europeans observed Earth Day by staging demonstrations, climbing mountains and planting trees today, but these events served to make clear that growing public support for environmental protection has brought little change in the way the nations deal with nature.
Concern for the environment has seeped into everyday language, political debate and party platforms, but a crowded and prosperous Europe continues to turn farmland into highways, to poison rivers and seas and to scar coastlines with tourist developments.
Some government officials nonetheless say progress is being made. In the two decades since environmental movements emerged here, all West European countries have adopted strict laws to curb the worst emissions of cars and industries, while environmental parties and organizations have seen a spectacular rise in membership and votes. 
Over the same period, Europeans have not been asked to abandon habits that environmentalists consider harmful or wasteful, like their ever-greater dependence on private cars and their growing taste for throw-away rather than re-usable products. The average European, though, still produces only half as much garbage as an average American.
 
'There Are Too Many of Us'
''We have done enough research and we know we must economize energy and products,'' said Jacqueline Denis, a French specialist, in an Earth Day debate, ''There are too many of us to carry on this way.''
In Eastern Europe, where the environmental damage from four decades of Communist rule is often termed a catastrophe, Earth Day had the extra dimension of now being possible. Cyclists in Gdansk, Poland, and Vilnius, Lithuania, protested against smog. In East Berlin, strollers looked at exhibits related to East Germany's degraded environment, and in Czechoslovakia a ''Green relay race'' had its start amid the blackened coal fields of Bohemia.
But from Poland to Romania, while demands for a cleaner environment are growing, governments lack the resources or experience to close or convert old coal-fueled factories or to dispose of garbage and toxic wastes other than by dumping them in rivers.
In Western Europe, the gap between intentions and action was well illustrated in the Earth Day observances. In France, groups held hands along the Loire to honor one of Europe's ''last clean rivers.'' At the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, supporters of the Green environmental parties mourned victims of pollution.
Young people in Rome lay in the streets to draw attention to traffic victims, and in smog-laden Madrid a hot-air balloon rose over the city bearing slogans focusing on atmospheric pollution, particularly the threat to the earth's ozone layer.
 
Crowds Smaller Than Expected
But crowds were uniformly smaller than organizers expected. More than demonstrating the determination of their movement, environmentalists drew attention to the problems that remain to be addressed, from global warming and deforestation to acid rain in West Germany, from garbage disposal in the North Sea to toxic emissions into the Rhine River.
Unlike Eastern Europe, countries in the West are debating not whether societies can afford to protect and improve their environments but whether governments and electorates are willing to pay what many experts say would be the price: slower economic growth and higher costs of living.
Over the last 30 years, for example, many Northern Europeans have claimed the right to summer vacations in the sun. As a result, the coasts of Portugal, Spain, France and Italy have become an almost uninterrupted line of hotels and apartment blocks, with green areas ever shrinking.
Similarly, even though three warm winters have hurt the ski resorts of Switzerland, France, Italy and Austria, the unspoiled rural districts in all four countries continue to be eroded by construction of new ski lifts, highways and resort hotels. And today, air pollution reaches even into the Alps.
Despite increasing consumer spending, the quality of life in many European cities is deteriorating. Spain, for instance, celebrated the sale of more than a million new cars there in 1988 as proof of economic success. But traffic jams have begun to paralyze Madrid.
 
Waste Disposal Is a Problem
The European Community has established maximum emission levels for vehicles in the 12-nation region, but the rules are still widely ignored. Levels of the air pollutant sulfur dioxide in Milan, Madrid, Paris, Glasgow and Frankfurt are often at levels considered hazardous to health, experts say.
Less visible in many cities is the problem of waste disposal. Western European nations still bury three-quarters of their garbage, and Britain continues to dump sewage sludge into the North Sea. Experts say that 80 percent of Europe's waste could be recycled at only a marginally higher cost.
Growing interest in environmental protection was apparent in a sharp increase in support for Green parties and movements in last June's elections for the European Parliament, as well as in increased exposure for environmental issues in the press and television.
With the European Community moving toward the creation of a single market after 1992, the plan is for common rules throughout the region, even if the rules do no more than prevent nations that pollute more from enjoying economic advantages over the nations that try to control pollution.

HEADLINE: EARTH DAY 1990: POLITICAL MEMO;
G.O.P. Fears It Is Losing Points on Environment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA JOLLA, Calif., April 22

 BODY:
Rising public concern about the environment looms like smog across the Republican Party's political horizon.
The Earth Day celebration was a case in point. Democrats treated it as if it were their own organizing rally, while Republicans, showing how worried they are by the issue, worked to insulate themselves from a public perception that they are less environmentally committed.
Vice President Dan Quayle, who was here on Friday for a party gathering, accused the Democrats of trying to politicize the environment, which is what a politician says when he knows it would be bad for his side if the other side succeeded in making an issue out of something.
 
Having to Work Harder
The Democrats sought to profit over the weekend from what many poll takers say is a general belief that their party handles environmental issues better than Republicans. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran television commercials around the country proclaiming the party an aggressive protector of the environment and saying that on issues like the handling of nuclear waste and the Exxon Valdez oil spill ''the Republicans waited.'' 
Some Republicans are still able to position themselves favorably on environmental issues. But even the most environmentally conscious Republicans acknowledge that they must work harder than Democrats to establish environmental credentials, just as Democrats must work harder to establish credentials as being tough on crime or spending.
For most of the last two decades Republicans have benefited from an agenda of public concerns on which they were better positioned than Democrats, either by basic ideological leaning or through faster footwork. These central concerns included crime, military strength and taxes.
But now everything in America, from fashion to politics (which often follow the same drummer anyway) is going green. There has been an impression that every politician is embracing the environment and that therefore it will be neutralized as a partisan issue.
 
Conceding the Advantage
But that is not what many political insiders think. Democrats are convinced that this heightened environmental concern will work substantially to their advantage in the 1990's, and some prominent Republican analysts agree.
''The U.S. environmental tide is dividing rather than bolstering the Republican political coalition,'' said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political expert, who was among the first to recognize the Republican Presidential majority that was emerging out of the schisms of the 1960's.
Mr. Phillips's thesis is that environmental concerns drive a wedge between Republican supporters. The issue could divide corporate leaders, who are concerned that tighter environmental regulation will damage their businesses, from voters in middle-class suburbs, who have been a mainstay of Republican victories and are now among the people most concerned about environmental threats.
While voters are generally skeptical about politicians' doing anything to improve the environment, they also make it clear they have greater faith that the Democrats will do something.
Asked to choose between Republicans and Democrats for doing a better job of protecting the environment, 55 percent picked the Democrats and 36 percent chose the Republicans, according to a Harris poll in February.
By contrast, 64 percent said Republicans would do better negotiating with the Russians, and 54 percent picked Republicans to keep the economy prosperous. The margin of sampling error in the telephone poll of 1,250 people was plus or minus three percentage points.
The heart of the problem for Republicans is that the environment is not just another issue. It has become ''a modern secular religion,'' said Martin Levin, a political scientist at Brandeis University.
 
A Changing Cultural Tide
Democrats are hoping, and Republicans are fearing, that rising environmental concern is a central part of a larger shift in the political playing field that will make crucial middle-class voters feel more comfortable again with Democrats.
Politics in America is often driven as much by cultural differences as by more obvious battles. And nothing so clearly indicates the nation's cultural change in the last two decades as Earth Day.
In 1970, the first Earth Day was a liberal exercise. Former Senator Gaylord Nelson, Democrat of Wisconsin, an organizer of the first event, said he got the idea from the teach-ins against the Vietnam War. The point is that Earth Day then was clearly on one side of the cultural schism that divided the country.
But Earth Day 1990 was a mainstream event. ''We love it,'' said Paul Tully, the political director of the Democratic Party. ''On this one, the more you know, the better off we are.''
 
Bush Makes an Effort
Many Republicans, in particular the poll taker Robert Teeter, have been warning the party for several years that it needs to shed its image as an enemy of the environment.
President Bush began that effort in his 1988 Presidential campaign. In office, he has negotiated with Congress for the first revision of the Clean Air Act in a decade.
''The Democrats hope they can politicize the environmental issue to their advantage,'' Mr. Quayle told a meeting of state Republican leaders here. ''They've seen all the other issues slip away. They've lost the peace issue. They've lost the education issue. They never had the tax issue. Drugs and crime has always been our issue. So they're grasping onto the environmental issue. But they're not going to get very far on that for one very fundamental reason.''
That reason, Mr. Quayle said, is that President Bush has been pushing clean air legislation and will be the one to sign it.
That is true. But the political stress Mr. Phillips warned about was apparent several days ago as Mr. Bush, at an international conference he had convened on global warming, was forced to explain that his Administration's desire for more scientific research was not meant as an alternative to action.
 
Facing Skepticism
Of course environmental concerns do not guarantee a Democrat victory. Voters select candidates, not parties, and individual Republicans will succeed in defining themselves as pro-environment.
Here in Southern California, Republicans have a candidate they hope can be a prototype for their future. Senator Pete Wilson, running for governor, is using a television commercial in which he claims to have been concerned about growth and offshore drilling even before there was an environmental movement.
But Mr. Wilson must contend with a skepticism toward Republicans that was illustrated by a front-page headline in The San Diego Tribune on Saturday: ''Bush Delaying on Oil Drilling to Aid Wilson?'' The article quoted environmentalists and local political leaders as suggesting that the President was helping Mr. Wilson by delaying a decision to lease ocean tracts off California for oil drilling.
Other issues continue to matter, of course. While Americans tell poll takers that they are willing to make economic sacrifices for a better environment, Mr. Quayle said they still placed a higher priority on jobs.
Republicans seeking to play down the importance of the environment as a voting issue note that Gov. George Deukmejian was re-elected in 1986 even though he supported offshore drilling and opposed a ballot proposition on the dumping of toxic wastes.
But another Republican on the California ballot that year without the benefit of incumbency, Ed Zschau, lost because he opposed the proposition on toxic dumping, said Mervin Field, California's most prominent poll taker. Mr. Zschau challenged Senator Alan Cranston, a leading advocate of the initative, which set new limits on the release of toxic chemicals in farming or manufacturing.
Mr. Zschau, a moderate, opposed the resolution, saying it was well-intentioned but would cost jobs. The proposition won overwhelmingly, while Mr. Cranston won narrowly over Mr. Zschau. Mr. Field said he was convinced Mr. Zschau would have beaten Mr. Cranston if he had supported the initiative.

HEADLINE: James Stewart Nods at Lady Luck For His Golden Age Film Career

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., April 22

 BODY:
A director who worked with him just after he arrived in Hollywood in 1935 once described him as ''unusually usual.'' Even with a pair of Oscars on his mantel and after a distinguished career of more than 70 films in which he played everything from idealistic young swains to ruthless bounty hunters, James Stewart still likes to cast himself in the role of the average guy who owes everything he has to hard work and lucky breaks.
''It's been an amazing 50 years, and so much of it has been pure good fortune,'' he drawled as he sat in the garden of his Tudor-style home here one sunny afternoon a few days ago. ''I've been in the right place at the right time.''
In fact, he said, had his friend Joshua Logan not persuaded him to give the University Players a try back when both were students at Princeton, ''I'd have gone back to Indiana, Pa., and gotten into my father's hardware store'' and probably lived no less wonderful a life. 
Instead, Jimmy Stewart came West, signed a three-month contract with the old M-G-M studios in 1935 and more than fulfilled the prediction of a comedian named Ted Healy who, Mr. Stewart recalled, told him early on that ''it's a screwy business'' but ''it's possible you just could make it out here.''
 
How an Actor Views Success
On Monday night in New York, the Film Society of Lincoln Center is to pay tribute to the actor, who at nearly 82 years of age is now the last of the major male stars of the golden era of pre-World War II Hollywood. But in typical fashion, Mr. Stewart sees his success in films like ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and ''The Philadelphia Story'' more as a triumph of persistence than of sheer talent.
''The main thing was that you were busy all the time when you were working at a studio,'' he said. ''People today don't realize that you didn't sit around and wait for somebody to call you and send you a script you liked. You went to work every morning at 8 and left at 6:30 and you had big parts in little pictures and little parts in big pictures. You were working all of the time, learning your craft by working, by tackling different things.''
''I've always been absolutely 100 percent for the studio system,'' he continued. ''I don't think it is something that will be seen again, but it's the ideal way to make pictures. Those of us who had that experience - God, so many of us are gone - I think had the good fortune to be connected with this thing, the making of motion pictures, at the best possible time.''
Mr. Stewart's artisan's attitude extended even to the way he regarded his instantly recognizable voice, with all its hemming and hawing and elongated vowels and octave shifts, a voice that has been imitated in hundreds of comedy acts and advertisements.
 
The Filibuster and Hoarseness
''I never thought about it, not even in 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' '' he said. In the moving scenes of Jefferson Smith's filibuster in the Senate, Mr. Stewart explained, his almost hysterical hoarseness was achieved not by tapping into deep wells of emotion, but simply by having a physician apply a mercury solution to inflame and irritate his vocal cords.
''I'm sure the Method people wouldn't have approved of it, but I was in trouble,'' he recalled. ''To this day I don't know what happened to the doctor's practice while he was down at the studio with me. I'd come in every once in a while and say: 'Doc, you've got to do something. It's getting better.' ''
With the same enthusiasm, Mr. Stewart also recalled the hours spent off the set, particularly those in the company of his buddy Henry Fonda, a New Deal Democrat who could not fathom Mr. Stewart's lifelong conservative Republicanism. ''On the political thing, we were complete opposites,'' he said. ''We got into a fight about it way back, in New York, and after not speaking to each other for quite a while, one of us said, 'What about never mentioning politics again?' And you know, we kept that and absolutely never mentioned it again.''
Mr. Fonda and Mr. Stewart roomed with Burgess Meredith on West 63d Street when they were all young stage actors on Broadway. When Mr. Fonda and Mr. Stewart went to Hollywood, they lived for a time in a rented house next door to Greta Garbo, trying unsuccessfully to find a way to meet her.
Often the two went out together on double dates. He recalled that one night Mr. Fonda was with Barbara Stanwyck and he was with Lucille Ball. ''We went over to this railroad car diner on Santa Monica Boulevard for breakfast after being out all Saturday night,'' he said, ''because this was our only free night. We were busy with the girls, I'll tell you that.''
Still, for all his fondness for those days at M-G-M, Mr. Stewart was one of the people who helped break the studio system by becoming a freelance star when he returned from World War II, during which he served as a flight instructor and bomber pilot and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Croix de Guerre. In addition, he was shortly thereafter perhaps the first of Hollywood's big names to accept a percentage of the gross earnings of a film, rather than a salary, as payment for his services, a practice that transformed the economics of movie making and that is now standard. Changing Persona In a Changing Town ''I pretty much left the financial things up to my agents,'' he said. ''After we had done it, people, including my agents Lew Wasserman and Leland Hayward, said it was a gamble. I'm not very good with numbers, but they were very good at explaining things. It was at the time I married my wife, Gloria, in 1949, and I was starting my family, so I probably worked the thing out that way.''
In that changing Hollywood, Mr. Stewart found it easy to reinvent himself by playing darker and more complicated characters. Throughout the 50's, perhaps the period of his greatest popularity, he played cowboys, some of them of dubious character, in a series of memorable westerns directed by Anthony Mann, as well as mature men of experience in Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rear Window'' and ''Vertigo.''
''I've always thought acting is a job you work at and learn, and I don't think you ever stop learning how to act,'' he said. ''The very idea of changing my whole thing from the sort of shy, fumbling fellow to the western was just my work. It's all hard work and dedication, to be able to make a go of it. These things were offered to me. I didn't go to somebody and say I think it's time for me to do a western. I had no idea Lew Wasserman had taken on Anthony Mann's 'Winchester '73' for me, but when he did, the first thing I wanted was to get a horse.''
What is sometimes forgotten, though, is that when Mr. Stewart first returned from World War II, having been drafted nine months before Pearl Harbor, he endured something of a professional dry spell. He recalls being at loose ends with Henry Fonda and the two of them trying to find ways to amuse themselves: ''We came back from the war, and he'd been in the Navy and was married and had a house in Brentwood and he wasn't getting any calls either. And so we flew kites. There were wonderful places to fly kites up there.''
 
And Then Came 'Wonderful Life'
When work did come it was in the form of ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' That movie is now one of the most popular of all time, but when it was first released, it lost money at the box office, and Mr. Stewart and Frank Capra, the director with whom he had earlier worked on ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and ''You Can't Take It With You,'' feared it would derail their careers.
''It was the first picture I did after the war, after being almost five years away,'' he said. ''Frank did everything he could to get these wonderful character people in the thing, people like Ward Bond, and that left everybody feeling good about the picture. So when it didn't do well, it was absolutely a slap in the face.
''It was sort of a bad time for all of us,'' he continued. ''It broke Frank's company, Liberty Films, and he and Willie Wyler and George Stevens had to sell their assets to Paramount. My contract with M-G-M had run out during the war, and they had offered me a new one, but my agents had advised me not to do it. So I wondered: Have I lost my audience? Aren't things working anymore?''
Largely because of those problems, Mr. Stewart has found the classic status awarded ''It's a Wonderful Life'' to be especially welcome and said it was his favorite of all the movies he has made. Its current popularity, ''I think, is probably because today the idea of the family is going through some hard times in this country,'' he said.
''Call the picture pro-family if you want,'' he continued. ''It's probably a good thing to counter some of the things that are happening.''
These days, Mr. Stewart said, he still sees an occasional script, but most of the roles call for ''a crotchety old grandfather'' and he would prefer something that recognizes his age but would not force him to play what he regards as stereotypes. In addition he uses a hearing aid and in recent years has had a heart condition and a bout with skin cancer.
 
'An Old Grandfather' Has a Busy Schedule
''I'll be 82 in a couple of weeks, and so I'm an old grandfather,'' he said. ''I don't think there's much point in getting myself fixed up so that I don't look like that, to try to throw that away.''
Still Mr. Stewart said he remained busy, often showing up in Washington to testify against the coloring of the classic movies in which he and his colleagues of the 30's and 40's appeared, or to attend events honoring ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' which he said ''about half the audience walked out on'' when it was screened for members of Congress in 1938. But there is an even more personal reason that draws him back to the capital.
''We lost our oldest boy in Vietnam,'' he said softly, speaking of his son Ronald, a Marine lieutenant who was killed in action at Da Nang in 1970. ''I was in on the memorial in Washington from the very start of it, and every time I go to Washington I go there. There are 57,000 names there, but I can pick out my son's name almost with my eyes closed.''
In addition, Mr. Stewart said he spent ''at least four or five hours a day at my office, answering all my fan mail,'' which has zoomed past 500 letters a day since the publication of a short collection of his poems last year. More than 300,000 copies of the book have been sold, and Mr. Stewart plans to read the poems for a cassette version to be issued this fall. He also recently recorded a six-minute introduction on the making of ''Harvey'' for the videocassette version of that film, one of 12 Stewart movies to be rereleased on May 10 with a whole new generation of movie viewers in mind.
''In the last couple of years, I've started getting letters from 13- and 14-year-olds, and they all start out, 'My mother and dad told me about so and so, and I turned it on, and I liked it,' '' he said. ''You know, that's enormously gratifying.''

HEADLINE: Slow Death for Drexel in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 22

 BODY:
The improbably sudden collapse of the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group shocked Wall Street in February, as did the United States Government's willingness to stand aside as the firm crumbled to financial rubble. But one of those caught most off guard was Masahiko Yamamoto, manager of Drexel's Tokyo branch.
Along with a Drexel executive from New York, Mr. Yamamoto had spent the week before the bankruptcy reassuring his Japanese clients that the firm was sound. Then, after Drexel abruptly caved in, he called the Ministry of Finance to say he had been ordered to liquidate the office immediately. He was told he could not do so.
''It just was not allowed,'' Mr. Yamamoto recalled, as the still-shaken branch manager led a visitor through Drexel's now-deserted trading room, occupied only by empty desks, chairs and boxes of ballpoint pens for sale. ''They said, 'You have responsibilities to take care of.' '' 
Robert E. Fallon, who had been managing director of corporate finance here for Drexel, added: ''They were calm, but they really couldn't understand how something like this could be allowed to happen. They said, 'We license you - you can't simply close. We have to give you permission.' ''
It may be just a footnote to the remarkable Drexel Burnham drama, but the Japanese Government's paternalistic reaction to the firm's demise provides an instructive contrast to how the situation was handled in the United States. It highlighted what many Japanese see as an incomprehensible American bias toward letting the markets take their course, even if it sometimes causes great pain for some people.
It also underscored the strong Japanese emphasis on maintaining a cooperative relationship between government and business. It is unlikely that Japan would have stood for the kind of bitter and ultimately destructive battle waged with Federal prosecutors by Drexel before it admitted to serious securities law violations and by its ''junk bond'' mastermind, Michael R. Milken, who was said to have agreed Friday to plead guilty to six fraud charges. The situation would most likely have been handled here with a modest public confession, the resignation of senior executives willing to take the blame to save the firm, and as little disruption of the system as possible.
 
Daily Reports Demanded
''When we license a securities firm, it has certain responsibilities,'' explained Nobuchika Mori, deputy director of the Finance Ministry's securities company division and the official who worked closest with Drexel. ''And we work with them to see things are done properly.''
He added, ''Compared to the United States, yes, we probably have a more helpful attitude to firms.''
Under the Government's watchful eye - the Finance Ministry demanded daily reports of Drexel's dealings in Japan from the moment its American parent filed for bankruptcy - the liquidation of Drexel's Japanese operations, which once had more than 100 staff members and produced $50 million a year in revenues, was far more orderly than in New York.
''Our Japanese employees were probably more shocked,'' Mr. Fallon said, ''because they knew this could never happen to a Japanese firm.''
 
A Six-Month Process
Employees had to be given at least a month's notice before being laid off. Some severance payments had to be arranged. Previously agreed-upon pensions had to be guaranteed. Strenuous efforts had to be made to help people find new jobs. Customers' accounts, the Government's top priority, had to be safeguarded and transferred smoothly to other securities houses.
And Mr. Yamamoto, who is 44 years old, and a skeleton staff are going to have to keep the office here open for another six months or so. That is to insure that all problems are resolved and that anyone with a claim has a chance to present it before the doors of the firm's elegant offices, in a modern Tokyo skyscraper overlooking the Imperial gardens, close for good.
Even when the dust settles, Drexel's collapse will not be forgotten quickly, at least not in Japan.
 
A Lift for Japanese Firms
Japanese securities houses and banks, which have lost some of their best traders and investment bankers in recent years to American firms, quietly rejoiced at the news. Since American firms generally pay two to five times as much as Japanese competitors, the Japanese could argue to wavering employees only that working for an American house gave them less job security. That argument is much more credible now.
''You hear a comment repeated every day now, 'The Americans are so unreliable,' '' said Ann Natori, who had been one of Drexel's top Japanese bond salespeople here. She said she had considered joining a European bank rather than another American firm.
Mr. Mori of the Finance Ministry said of American securities firms, ''The impact on their reputations was not negligible.''
 
Emphasis on 'Junk Bonds'
Drexel opened its branch here in 1985, just about the time that its business in America - underwriting offerings of low-grade, high-yield junk bonds and advising corporate raiders in takeovers and buyouts - was beginning to soar. Mr. Yamamoto, who had spent 16 years at Nomura Securities, the largest securities house in the world, was hired to run the Drexel branch.
It expanded steadily, relying largely on its ability to sell securities to Japanese institutions, particularly junk bonds. When the liquidation was ordered in February, it had 105 staff members here, including a dozen Americans.
About half of Drexel's annual revenues in Tokyo of $50 million came from selling junk bonds and United States Government bonds. The rest came from a combination of Japanese and American stock sales to its clients, Japanese institutions.
The profits approached $10 million a year, before taxes, Mr. Yamamoto said. In short, the Japanese subsidiary was modest in size but healthy, and it had no involvement in the abusive practices that regulators were investigating in the United States.
That generally favorable financial status was one reason Drexel's Japanese employees and the Government could not fathom why the office was shut down without some effort to sell it or keep it together.
''Most of the people thought that what they were hearing was just inconceivable - it was impossible,'' said Laurence M. Platoni, a vice president of administration in the office. ''People were orderly, but the Japanese were saying: 'Such a thing is not possible. This is a good business. How can it just close?' ''
Mr. Mori of the Finance Ministry said he was struck most by the fact that American regulators did not seem to have spotted or corrected Drexel's financial problems before they reached a crisis.
''We have early warning systems to catch problems,'' he said. ''When a firm becomes unsound, we take precautions.''
Mr. Yamamoto said the Finance Ministry quickly laid down its priorities. First, customer accounts had to be transferred safely to another firm. Second, the office had to maintain a satisfactory financial condition so that other firms would not suffer losses during the liquidation. Finally, new jobs had to be found for as many employees as possible.
''The Ministry of Finance said that they could not accept a lot of people becoming unemployed,'' Mr. Yamamoto added. ''They helped us quite a lot in finding jobs for people.''
Most of the Japanese employees have found new positions, Mr. Yamamoto said, but a number of the Americans, who face bleak job prospects back on Wall Street, are still unemployed. Drexel had enough money in its accounts to move the Americans and their families home, along with their belongings, Mr. Fallon said.
That move has left Mr. Yamamoto and a handful of his colleagues with the humbling task of sitting in the quiet offices and handling the few remaining chores. There is no receptionist behind the once-busy front desk, neckties are loosened, and the days crawl by.
''As a Japanese, I can tell you this could not happen in one day in Japan,'' Mr. Yamamoto, standing in sandals before the empty picture hooks on his sunny office wall, said with some bitterness. ''It's amazing, just amazing. I still think this must have been a bad dream.''

HEADLINE: Candy Maker Dealt Blow on Sugar Quotas

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
A Chicago candy maker's request to buy sugar at world prices instead of at the sharply higher domestic United States price has been rejected by a Commerce Department examiner, Congressional aides and industry officials say.
The decision, which was disclosed on Friday, could mean that the company, E. J. Brach & Sons, will be forced to close its plant in Chicago and move abroad.
The case has thrown a spotlight on sugar import quotas that the United States has imposed for years to protect beet and cane growers. The cost of these quotas to American consumers is estimated by Government and private economists at several billion dollars a year. 
Although the Agriculture Department wants to get rid of the quotas eventually, it defended the program, warning that similar applications by other candy and food processing companies would hurt domestic sugar producers by undermining Government quotas.
 
Decision Subject to Review
The decision is subject to review by an inter-agency Foreign-Trade Zones Board, headed by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.
Brach, which was taken over in 1986 by Jacobs Suchard, based in Zurich, has said that if it did not receive the exemption to buy the lower-cost sugar, it would move the Chicago operation, which employs up to 3,500 people, to either Canada or Mexico. The company's request was endorsed by Chicago civic officials and lawmakers, including Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The difference between the world sugar price of 15 cents a pound, and the domestic price of 24 cents, would have saved the company $20 million a year. The company said that would be enough to maintain the 68-year-old factory on the economically depressed West Side of Chicago.
 
Exemption Called Unfair
But competitors threatened to seek similar exemptions, complaining that it would have given Brach an unfair advantage.
Brach has been trying to capitalize on provisions of the Foreign Trade Zones Act of 1934 as amended in 1950. It sought special permission to import lower-cost foreign sugar and use it to make candy sold in the United States. The company contends that its effforts to preserve jobs in Chicago entitle it to an exemption from foreign trade zone restrictions.
In a foreign trade zone, import fees and other forms of border protection are generally waived to reduce production costs. These products are then designated for export, and only in rare cases can they be sold domestically.
As the Commerce Department action was disclosed, the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Cotton, Rice and Sugar agreed by a voice vote to raise domestic sugar subsidies as part of a five-year farm law it is writing.
 
Fear of Trade War
John B. Campbell, a deputy Under Secretary of Agriculture, said the Bush Administration opposed the proposals and would seek legislative changes.
''Sugar dynamics are about to explode,'' Mr. Campbell told the lawmakers, warning that the proposals could result in a trade war over sugar ''that could have been avoided.''
Brach executives could not be reached for comment over the weekend. A Commerce Department official said no final decision had been taken, but confirmed that a report by the department's examiner, was ''in the final stages.''
The official also said there had been discussions with Brach. Other officials said the talks had been to inform the company that its petition was being rejected.
Frank R. Samolis, a partner in Patton, Boggs & Blow, a law firm representing Mars Inc., one of the competitors of the Suchard unit, said he had not been officially informed of the decision. But he added, ''It is our hope and expectation that the Suchard application will be denied based on the facts of the case.''
Brach's was founded in 1904 as Brach's Palace of Sweets. Its products include hard red-and-white mints called Starlight Mints, caramels, toffee and a wide variety of other candies. The parent company reported that Brach lost $50 million last year on sales of about $500 million.
The company had been owned by the American Home Products Company, a food, drug and household products company, until December 1986 when it was sold to Suchard for $700 million.

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Difficult Switch For Arms Makers

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
AS military spending shrinks, the big names in American weapons manufacturing - companies like Raytheon, Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing Helicopter - should be making plans to switch to civilian products. They are not. Naturally, these companies are reluctant to give up steady, profitable military work. More important, America's weapons makers say their operations are not suited for civilian production.
History tends to agree that the conversion process is tortuous. During the big cutback in military spending in the 1970's, for example, the Army no longer needed so many of the twin-rotor Chinook helicopters that carried troops in Vietnam. So Boeing Helicopter, the manufacturer, started making subway cars at its factory complex in Philadelphia. Various cities were buying these cars, drawing heavily on Federal subsidies, and Boeing's great hope was to mass-produce the same model for every customer. 
''We thought the Federal Government, acting on behalf of the cities, would offer a contractor the opportunity to bid on 1,000 standard railway cars for a package of cities,'' said John Hayden, a Boeing vice president. But the Government did not impose a single set of standards, and each city wanted a customized car: 50 of this model for Boston, 50 of that one for Chicago. Development and production costs got out of hand.
Boeing also had problems with the quality of its new products. So did the Grumman Corporation, manufacturer of the F-14 fighter, which made buses in the 1970's for New York and other cities -also with the hope that the Federal Government would be the principal customer on behalf of cities.
Presumably, companies capable of manufacturing precisely controlled jet fighters and helicopters solid enough to withstand enemy gunfire can eventually learn to make buses and subway cars that function properly. Weyman Jones, a Grumman vice president, certainly makes this claim.
The real issue, he said, is not quality, but marketing. If the Federal Government is not the principal customer, then a company like Grumman has to go through the painful process of developing a sales force that can win contracts in the competitive civilian marketplace. Grumman, for example, developed and tried to sell a mini-van before Chrysler popularized the vehicle. ''The project failed,'' Mr. Jones said, ''because we did not have the distribution system.''
Military contractors have ways of dealing with the cutback in military spending. The principal one is to jockey for a share of the shrinking weapons market. A military budget that is expected to drop from $300 billion today to $200 billion in the late 1990's, in dollars adjusted for inflation, will still buy a lot of hardware.
A second approach is to try to repackage military goods as civilian products, a tactic that generates some revenue, but not the vast sums spent on weaponry. For example, the developer Donald J. Trump flies New Yorkers to his Atlantic City casinos in two Chinook helicopters. Oil companies also use Chinooks to service offshore drilling platforms. What is more, Boeing Helicopter developed for the Army an aircraft that flies like a plane but tilts up its motors to land and take off like a helicopter.
Clearly, giant helicopters and helicopter-like planes have civilian applications. But the nation's system of public works limits their use; there is not a network of landing pads nor the air-traffic control procedures to support large-scale production, Mr. Hayden said.
Of course, many big military contractors also own subsidiaries dedicated to civilian products, and much effort is going into the expansion of these divisions. Still, conversion is an obstacle. For example, the General Dynamics Corporation, a maker of jet fighters, also makes civilian aircraft at its Cessna division. But retooling a jet fighter plant to make Cessnas would cost much more than expanding the Cessna factory, said Herbert Rogers, president of General Dynamics. That is partly because the engineers and workers at the jet fighter factory would have to be retrained to deal in technologies much less exacting than those used in making fighter planes.
A bill now in Congress would require military contractors to draw up retooling plans and would offer some Federal help for the retraining process. One goal is to prevent the layoffs that come with plant shutdowns. But even after World War II, when huge pent-up demand for consumer goods offered wonderful opportunities for weapons manufacturers, some factories went idle.
The Government sold hundreds of weapons factories at discount prices, but converting them to civilian production was difficult, said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist who studied the period. ''Despite all of the demand and the low unemployment rate, production fell and the economy shrank because many of the factories weren't in use or were under-used,'' he said.
The Korean War provided a remedy to that situation. The factories were pressed back into service and production rose, even with roughly the same work force. The lesson is that companies, once hooked on weapons making, do not easily kick the habit.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
The Mystery Of the Gold Selloff

BYLINE: By H. J. Maidenberg

 BODY:
NEARLY a month after investors in gold suffered their biggest losses in seven years, precious metals analysts are still trying to find out who or what caused the March 26 selloff, and why.
As is often the case in the shadowy world of gold trading, the theories these analysts have put forth will probably reveal more than whatever ''evidence'' eventually surfaces.
What is known is that on that Monday, European bullion dealers were unexpectedly inundated by offers of several million ounces of bullion from sellers who ignored the steady lowering of bids that their actions were causing. The dealers tried to hedge their purchases against further price declines by offering bullion to dealers in New York later in the day. These moves only caused prices to fall further. 
By the close of trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the price of gold had fallen $23 an ounce, to $365.80. It was the biggest one-day loss on the Comex since Feb. 28, 1983, when tumbling oil prices caused bullion to drop $42.50, to $400.50. The Comex spot gold contract closed last Friday at $376.60.
Because foreign-exchange dealers in Europe noticed an extraordinary demand for British pounds on March 26, it was assumed that the buyers were Saudi Arabians and others in the Middle East who normally take proceeds of bullion sales in the British currency. This view was reinforced by the fact that March 27 was the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
''While many Muslim businessmen sharply reduce their activity during Ramadan, Mideast gold dealers are too sophisticated to wait until the eve of Ramadan to sell large amounts of bullion,'' said Frederick R. Demler, minerals economist at Paine Webber Inc.
But demand for gold in the region was falling, in large part because smugglers who supply large amounts of bullion to India feared that the Indian Government was planning to lift its 27-year ban on imports of gold. There has long been a flourishing trade in the smuggling of gold into India, where the metal has sometimes fetched as much as $200 an ounce above the world price.
But India did not lift or modify its Gold Control Act, and how this situation will affect the smuggling trade in the Arabian Sea region will not be known until business there revives after Ramadan.
Mr. Demler of Paine Webber said other factors had undermined gold prices in March, leading some to believe that the Soviet Union had been the big seller because of its need for foreign exchange and its rapidly deteriorating economy. ''The price of gold there has doubled in recent months,'' he said, ''as people try to flee from the ruble.''
The Soviets are also clever and experienced participants in the gold market, and although they normally sell sizable amounts of bullion in the first quarter, they prefer dollars to sterling, because they use dollars to buy grain and oilseeds. The Soviet Union was estimated to have produced 10 million of the 63 million ounces of gold mined globally in 1989, but its annual bullion sales remain a mystery.
And what about Brazil, another leading gold producer? Mr. Demler and other metals experts noted that stringent anti-inflation measures imposed by the new Government in late March included a freeze on assets that has hobbled that country's commerce and industry. The resulting economic squeeze has forced many Brazilians to sell gold and other assets, like green coffee beans, that they normally use as a hedge against the country's rampant inflation.
William B. O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., said it was surprising ''that the biggest buyers and supporters of the gold market in recent years - Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -have not been mentioned as the biggest sellers on March 26.''
He noted that past gold purchases by these countries were aimed partly at reducing the inflow of dollars generated by their trade surpluses, and partly because they feared the dollars would breed domestic inflation.
On March 26, Mr. O'Neill noted, ''the gold market was vulnerable because of its repeated inability to crack the $400 level.'' He continued, ''Each time the price slipped back, the computer-guided investment-fund managers became more discouraged and sold more bullion.''
Also discouraged were the monetary authorities of many countries, including those in Asia, who saw the dollar strengthening and the yields and prices of dollar-denominated stocks and bonds climbing while their hoards of bullion earned nothing. Hong Kong has long been an important transit point for bullion on the way to Europe.
''Above all, the fact is that gold is no longer even a valid inflation hedge,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''This is why gold no longer responds to the rise or fall in oil prices, normally a harbinger of inflation. What gold has been responding to is the recent strength of the dollar.''
March 26 also marked the start of the last week of the Japanese fiscal year, when investment managers try to dress up their accounts with cash and blue-chip securities while eliminating declining assets - like gold - from their portfolios.

Newspaper Advertising Continues To Weaken

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 22

 BODY:
With advertising soft and profits down at many dailies, the annual convention of the nation's newspaper publishers, which starts here on Monday, is not expected to be a particularly happy affair.
A spokesman for the American Newspaper Publishers Association said fewer people were expected to attend this year's convention than any in recent memory, mainly because of budget constraints.
''It's going to be kind of downbeat,'' said John Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington.
 
'Business-Cycle Problem'
While there are spots of prosperity - in parts of Florida and California, for instance - the newspaper industry is economically depressed. 
Miles E. Groves, director of economic research for the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, said newspapers were mirroring their local economies and would rebound accordingly.
''It's a business-cycle problem,'' Mr. Groves said. ''We've had pockets of recession rolling across this country for a decade.''
What seems new is the apparent breadth of the problem, and the fact that it seems to be getting worse.
Though overall newspaper advertising spending continues to climb, the rate of growth is flat or in decline after falling for two successive years. In 1989, advertising grew at an overall rate of 4 percent, compared with 6 percent in 1988 and 9 percent in 1987. $32.4 Billion Spent The Newspaper Advertising Bureau reported total spending of $32.4 billion for advertising last year, and newspapers maintained their usual place as the leading advertising medium over television and magazines, which also had slow growth.
Worst hit in recent months has been classified advertising, which had been the strongest category for a decade, especially after national and retail advertising began to weaken in the mid-80's.
Classified spending grew less than 3 percent last year while the average annual growth for the six previous years was more than 16 percent. Page for page, classified advertising is the most profitable form of newspaper advertising.
''It has been a bright spot and we all became a lot more dependent on it that we'd realized,'' said Judith W. Brown, editor and publisher of The Herald in New Britain, Conn.
In the Northeast in particular, analysts said, help-wanted, real-estate and automotive classified advertising dropped because of the slowing job market and sluggish property sales.
 
Weak Retail Advertising
Newspaper executives had been optimistic that retail advertising would improve in 1990. But department stores continue to suffer and the bottom for retail advertising does not yet appear to have been reached.
For example, the Times Mirror Company reported retail advertising volume in the first quarter decreased more than 17 percent at The Hartford Courant and at least 20 percent at Newsday and The Baltimore Sun. Classified advertising at Newsday on Long Island and New York Newsday was off almost 39 percent.
Even at The Los Angeles Times, one of the few large papers to post an increase in retail advertising, the improvement was just over 1 percent, and classified was off 4 percent.
At The New York Times, advertising declined 11.8 percent in the first quarter and its net profits fell.
Newspaper advertising was also down at Dow Jones & Company, Knight-Ridder Inc, the Tribune Company, McClatchy Newspapers Inc., Multimedia Inc., E. W. Scripps, Affiliated Publications and Media General.
 
Worst Period in Almost 20 Years
The Gannett Company, which is considered to be a bellwether because it owns 83 dailies, reported flat earnings for the quarter and blamed the poorest advertising environment in almost 20 years for the results.
John S. Reidy, a newspaper analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the drop in advertising volume had a powerful effect on profits because fixed costs remained essentially the same.
''There will be a period of pessimism until there is some life in linage,'' Mr. Reidy said.
Newspaper publishers are not likely to be cheered by a report issued last week by Lisa Donneson, a newspaper analyst at County NatWest Bank in New York. She expressed concern about newspaper circulation, which is the second-largest source of revenue after advertising.
''Household penetration, reading frequency and regularity of reading have been declining significantly, particularly among baby boomers and women,'' Ms. Donneson said.
She said newspapers would have difficulty reversing that trend.
''Without circulation growth, it is unlikely that newspaper advertising expenditures can grow at a respectable rate,'' Ms. Donneson concluded. ''And without advertising growth, earnings per share cannot grow at an acceptable rate.''

The World Is Often Too Much to Grasp

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen

 BODY:
AS big publishing houses have gone on an international buying spree, ''globalization'' has become the buzzword of the industry. But now, some people are wondering whether there are really that many advantages in being a worldwide book business.
The stampede to go global has been frenetic in recent years. An Australian, an Englishman and an American - Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell and S. I. Newhouse Jr. - have spent hundreds of millions of dollars establishing far-flung publishing enterprises within their media empires. 
Bertelsmann A.G. of West Germany and Simon & Schuster are among those that have followed suit.
Their theory seems to be that books can be marketed worldwide, that risk can be spread, economies achieved and a growing English-language market tapped for bigger profits. In short, there is more money to be made by publishing books all over the world - just as movie companies distribute their films worldwide - than by selling rights to other publishers in various countries.
For example, the current best seller, ''Barbarians at the Gate'' by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, has been published in the United States by Harper & Row, a subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation. Thus, it would in theory be published in Britain by William Collins or Grafton, the British arms of Mr. Murdoch's book business. And Stephen King's very expensive next three novels, to be published under Penguin's Viking imprint in the United States, would be published under a Penguin Group imprint in Britain.
But when it comes to globalization - a term generally used with the understanding that the globe consists of English-speaking countries - the theory is often far from practice.
''Barbarians'' is in fact being published in Britain by Jonathan Cape, a unit of Mr. Newhouse's group. And Mr. King will be published in Britain by Hodder & Stoughton, an independent company.
''Cape offered more money than Collins for 'Barbarians,' and they were more enthusiastic about the book,'' said William Shinker, Harper & Row's publisher. ''I know that Collins now regrets this.''
The fate of ''Barbarians'' illustrates a basic problem with globalization. Editors in the various parts of a worldwide publishing house have different tastes.
In addition, literary agents are not always prepared to sell world rights. When they do sell these rights, the price goes up, so although the risk is spread, it is also increased.
And books that delight American readers may put the Australians or British to sleep.
''Philips sells its televisions worldwide, but it does not produce 300 different sets each year,'' said Peter Mayer, chief executive of the Penguin Group. ''I am afraid that for books, globalization may be a flawed vision.''
Of course, some books do travel, and sometimes one publisher manages to sell them to readers of English throughout the world.
Bantam, a division of Bertelsmann, has done well with authors like Shirley MacLaine, Louis Lamour and Danielle Steel, coordinating promotion, publishing and marketing. And Mr. Murdoch's Harper Collins is selling Len Deighton under its Grafton imprint in Britain and Harper & Row in the United States.
Moreover, general-interest books constitute less than half of the approximately $19 billion market for books in Britain and the United States. It is widely agreed that educational, reference, technical, medical and scientific books fare much better as global products than general fiction and nonfiction.
Simon & Schuster, for one, has been aggressively developing this side of its business by setting up a string of subsidiaries from Tokyo to London. And Time-Life, with its emphasis on entertainment, educational and reference books, has made international sales a basis of its success.
But ''globalization'' was supposed to amount to more than selling reference books around the world, or even developing individually successful units in different countries. So publishers like Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Newhouse - whose houses are concentrating on general-interest books in the global market - appear to have much to prove.
Still, Richard E. Snyder, chief executive of Simon & Schuster, is still a believer. He said that global publishing was particularly effective in the academic and scientific field, but that success with general-interest books would eventually follow.
''Globalization is efficiency and efficiency always wins out,'' he said.

HEADLINE: POLICY SHIFT URGED TO END DEADLOCK OVER OFFSHORE OIL

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
The Interior Department has proposed a shift in oil leasing policy to open the way for increased exploration and drilling in coastal waters.
The new policy is intended to break a prolonged political deadlock that has effectively halted most oil and gas development in many areas since the Reagan Administration opened the entire 1.4-billion-acre outer continental shelf to drilling. The outer continental shelf begins three miles offshore.
The Reagan program, which was established when James G. Watt was Interior Secretary, prompted an outcry by many coastal communities and environmentalists who feared potential damage to marine life under such a sweeping program. Congress responded by denying money needed to carry out the leasing program in many areas, particularly off California and the East Coast. 
 
Watt Policy Abandoned
The new policy is a compromise that would abandon the Reagan program and sharply restrict the total offshore area that would be made available to oil companies, but still open the way for drilling in areas where it is now banned. Each coastal area would be carefully examined for potential environmental damage that could be caused by drilling before it would be offered for leasing, Interior Department officials said. But the officials said they did not know how many acres would be made available under the new policy.
The hope, department officals say, is that a more restrictive leasing policy could persuade Congress to lift its block of leasing in some areas the oil industry deems as promising.
''We need to do something about offshore leasing.'' said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. ''We need some kind of jump start.''
 
Drilling Off Alaska Likely
Less than one-half percent of the outer continental shelf has been leased for oil and gas exploration, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. Interior Department officials said the new policy would be likely to lead to more drilling off Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico. The new policy is also likely to be bring drilling off California and the East Coast in areas now restricted and in which activity would probably be limited, the officials said.
The new approach to offshore drilling would be embodied in the department's next five-year plan for the outer continental shelf, which would go into effect when the current plan expires in 1992. Interior Department officials said President Bush was expected to ap-prove the measure in the next few weeks. The plan requires no Congressional approval, but Congress still has power over it by controlling the appropriation of money for it.
Initial Congressional reaction was cool, with some lawmakers saying the proposal would not adequately protect coastal waters. But it was unclear if the proposal would stir the same broad opposition as Mr. Watt's policy, even though public sentiment against offshore drilling has intensified after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
 
A Reaction to Oil Imports
With the nation now importing 50 percent of its oil, Mr. Lujan and other department officials said it was vital to develop domestic reserves. They also contended that tankers bringing oil from abroad have proved a greater threat to the coastal environment than drilling.
In the past year Mr. Lujan has mounted an aggressive campaign to promote offshore oil production as a way of maintaining independence from foreign oil producers.
At the same time, Mr. Lujan was the head of a panel that earlier this year urged more study before oil companies are allowed to drill off the coasts of California and Florida. That study was requested by President Bush shortly after he took office. When he ordered the study, the President canceled three sales of leases off California and in the Gulf of Mexico off South Florida.
 
Mild Support by Industry
The oil industry appears to be mildly supportive of the plan. But environmentalists and members of Congress from coastal states are skepticial, saying the new policy is, in essence, a public relations ploy. They contend that the policy will not protect offshore waters from drilling that could damage marine life and the economies of the coastal communities that depend on fishing.
Under the new approach, the first step in the leasing process would be to determine where the marine life would be harmed by oil drilling activities and ship traffic and to withdraw those areas from consideration. ''We will draw a box around those areas and say we cannot go in there,''said Barry A. Williamson, director of the department's Minerals Management Service.
Also under the plan, only those specific offshore areas for which there is strong geological evidence of a potential oil strike would be put up for leasing.
Finally, the plan would share the revenues from offshore oil leasing with the coastal communities near the drilling sites as an inducement to end local opposition. Some revenue from offshore oil development currently goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is given to Federal and state authorities to buy land for recreation.
''This a kinder, gentler but meaner and leaner oil leasing program,'' said Steven Goldstein, the chief spokesman for Mr. Lujan. ''It is a complete reversal of the James Watt-era policy.''
President Bush is currently considering whether to permit the sale of leases off the coasts of Florida and California. Talking to reporters in Florida on Sunday, the President hinted he would reject leasing off the southern coast of that state.
He said a local environmentalist had ''raised with me the very sensitive question of offshore drilling, and I told him there would be an answer very, very soon.'' He added, ''And I didn't think he'd be too disappointed.''
White House officials said later that the President probably would allow some new drilling off California.
Joseph Lastelic, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a major oil industry trade association, said industry would support the new plan if it would provide ''a predictable sales schedule.'' He said that because of uncertainty about the outer continental shelf in recent years many oil companies had been investing in oil exploration abroad rather than in United States waters.
Richard Charter, a lobbyist for California's coastal communities seeking to influence offshore oil policies, said the new plan sounded ''good on paper but in the real world is likely to result in offshore drilling rigs in all the wrong places.'' He said that if the Interior Department made an honest assessment of potential environmental damage it would not permit oil drilling anywhere on California's narrow continental shelf.
Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is a sharp critic of the Government's offshore leasing policies, said he did not think that Congress would accept the new proposal. He complained that the Interior Department had again devised a plan for the outer continental shelf without consulting with the coastal states. ''They are offering it on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,'' he said. ''That doesn't make sense.''
Mr. Miller also said the promise to share oil revenues with communities would not end opposition to offshore drilling. ''The notion they will give us money and we will agree - that is extortion,'' he said.

SOLE OIL REFINERY IN LITHUANIA SHUT BY SOVIET EMBARGO

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Lithuania's only oil refinery shut down tonight, its reserves exhausted by a five-day fuel embargo imposed by the Kremlin in the hope of weakening the republic's spirit of independence.
Albertas Ginbutas, the chief engineer at the Mazeikiai refinery, predicted a rapid worsening of economic hardship in the republic as factories run out of diesel fuel and liquefied gas, and as more drivers are stalled by strict gasoline rationing.
Both the Soviet authorities and Lithuania talked hopefully of compromise, but the talking was confined to rival news conferences. An official delegation from Lithuania killed time in a Moscow hotel, denied a Kremlin audience because it was not authorized to make concessions. [President Bush is expected to announce Tuesday that he will take modest steps to express his displeasure over the crackdown, Administration officials said in Washington. 
 
Page A14.]
Kremlin Reasonableness President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's spokesman today confirmed that the Kremlin had proposed a temporary freeze on Lithuania's declaration of independence, issued on March 11, as a starting point for negotiations, and that Moscow would not demand that the measure be formally renounced. The Lithuanians reported such an offer from Moscow last week and said it might form the basis of a compromise.
''We don't insist that you rescind everything and nullify what you have adopted,'' said the presidential spokesman, Arkady A. Maslennikov. ''We insist on one thing: You come to the fold, you start discussions on the basis of the Constitution. What you do with the laws, with the declarations you have announced, that is your business.''
Lithuanian officials, in turn, proclaimed their willingness to compromise, saying a temporary moratorium on their disengagement from the Soviet Union was negotiable, but they insisted that they would make no concessions as a condition for talks.
Moscow says that Lithuania can have its independence, but only by following the ground rules laid out in a new secession law enacted early this month.
The law requires referendum approval by two-thirds of the republic's eligible voters, a transition period up to five years during which the republic must satisfy the financial and territorial claims of other Soviet jurisdictions, and final approval by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, a legislature dominated by Russians and others opposed to Lithuanian independence.
 
What Moscow Might Concede
Kremlin officials have hinted that they would be willing to accelerate the transition period and in the meantime give Lithuania wide latitude in its economic and political life, if only the republic agreed to play by the rules.
Lithuanian officials - like those in the neighboring Baltic republics, Estonia and Latvia - refuse to follow the new law, saying they were annexed in 1940 and thus are not legally bound by the Soviet Constitution.
In any case, the Lithuanians contend that the law creates so many hurdles and gives Moscow so much leverage that it would be almost impossible for a republic to secede if Moscow was bent on preventing it.
Confronted with a tightening economic squeeze, Lithuanian officials have alternated between cries of alarm and defiant statements of determination.
Kazimiera Prunskiene, the Lithuanian Prime Minister, today announced plans to open Lithuania and its Baltic offshore regions to international oil exploration as a long-term way around the Soviet embargo.
As for the immediate shortages, she said in an interview at a Moscow airport, the republic has opened a bank account in Stockholm and obtained a $100,000 loan from the European Investment Bank.
But Reuters reported from Brussels that an official of the European Community's development bank denied that such a loan had been approved.
In any case, the money would buy only enough imported oil to sustain the republic for 30 minutes at its pre-embargo rate of consumption, and Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman made it clear today that Moscow would decide whether or not to permit oil deliveries to Lithuanian ports.
Lithuanian officials have estimated that the republic has enough fuel to last about two weeks even with strict conservation measures. Some facilities report stockpiles sufficient for a month or longer, but at some factories stocks are so low that work has already stopped or been slowed to a crawl.
Lithuanians say that Moscow has begun a total blockade that has spread from oil and gas to metals, wood, industrial components and food. Soviet officials deny that food is being withheld, but they say the embargo may extend to any goods that could be sold for foreign currency or require imported parts.
''The center has no intention of bringing anyone to his knees,'' Mr. Maslennikov said today.
''Yesterday, somebody from Lithuania was saying 'I'd rather die than sacrifice my freedom,' '' the Kremlin spokesman added. ''There is no need to sacrifice freedom. There is only how to move in that direction. They want to move yesterday. But you see, it's unrealistic.''
Algirdas Brazauskas, the popular leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party and a Deputy Prime Minister, said last Friday that the republic could not withstand a prolonged economic embargo and he urged its legislature to reconsider some of the post-independence measures that have most offended Moscow, including a boycott of the Soviet military draft.
But the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, has said that compromises can come only after the Soviet authorities have agreed to sit down at the bargaining table.

HEADLINE: Tone Is Mild at U.N. Session for Third World Aid

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 23

 BODY:
Representatives of two principal third world organizations pledged today to follow development policies that place greater emphasis on individual initiative, and also called for more aid from the industrial world.
Speaking for the Group of 77, as the developing world is called at the United Nations, Bolivia's Planning Minister, Enrique Garcia, urged a transition from ''societies that overemphasize centralism and state paternalism'' to those where ''individual initiative becomes the driving force of modernization and change.''
In another speech at the opening of a special General Assembly session on third world development, Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar of Yugoslavia disparaged past calls for a new international economic order that would redistribute wealth in its favor. Mr. Loncar, speaking for the group of nations espousing nonalignment, called the idea ''unrealistic'' and said that ''human freedom'' is the ''the supreme value of this decade.'' 
But both third world leaders said that for a more capitalistic approach to development to succeed, the industrial world should do more to ease their debt burden, reduce interest rates, increase financial assistance and try to stabilize falling prices of raw materials.
The two keynote speeches came at the opening of the General Assembly session to discuss revitalizing third world development. The speeches were conciliatory in tone and reflected an approach to development similar to that of the Western world, as well as the turn away from socialist doctrines, a turn implicit in the political changes under way in Eastern Europe.
The goal of the weeklong Assembly meeting, which is being attended by about 90 Cabinet ministers, is to set development goals and priorities for the third world in the coming decade and spell out the industrial world's contribution to their attainment.
The Bush Administration came close to boycotting the session, arguing that the United Nations has no role in promoting economic development, which it says is the task of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
At a news conference last week, the United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, said the decision to take part was made ''with a lot of skepticism and a lot of reluctance'' because such debates were ''a locus for conflict rather than harmony.''
Today's opening speeches were a far cry from the appeals for a radical redistribution of the world's wealth that its representatives made at the 1975 meeting and on many occasions since at the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Iran's Goals With U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Iran has various economic, political and military interests that could benefit from improved relations with the United States if Teheran uses its influence to help gain the release of American hostages in Lebanon, experts on the region said today.
Iran would like to recover assets that were frozen in the United States a decade ago and are now the subject of complex proceedings before a special tribunal at The Hague. These assets totaled nearly $10 billion in 1981, but most of the money has been paid out to Americans or returned to Iran, so perhaps $1 billion remains in various accounts. 
In addition, Iran claims 3,800 items of military equipment in the United States. Iran says that it has paid for the hardware and that it is worth $12 billion, but the United States says the value is much lower.
Iran also wants the United States and other Western countries to put pressure on Iraq to negotiate an end to their border dispute and an exchange of prisoners of war.
Iran agreed to a cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war in July 1988, but the United Nations has been unable to mediate follow-up agreements.
Shaul Bakhash, a professor of history at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., said, ''Iran needs to show enough stability so European countries are willing to invest on a long-term basis.''
The United States could help Teheran obtain foreign credits and investment by ending its effort to isolate Iran economically.
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration continued to press for the release of the remaining hostages while ruling out any negotiations on the subject.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''The United States Government continues to probe all sources of information concerning the hostages.''
''We are not going to trade for our hostages, however, or make deals,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.

LITHUANIA ACTION BY BUSH EXPECTED

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
After meeting with members of Congress on Tuesday, President Bush is expected to announce some limited American actions in response to the Soviet Union's economic crackdown in Lithuania, Administration officials said tonight.
The officials declined to say specifically what Mr. Bush would do, but the options he has been considering include the suspension of one or more of the five sets of trade and commercial negotiations now under way with the Soviet Union.
''We will be taking action, mostly in the economic domain, that will express U.S. displeasure and U.S. concern about Soviet behavior in Lithuania,'' an official said.
Administration officials said the actions contemplated by the United States were not intended to interfere with arms control negotiations or with the schedule for the next Soviet-American summit meeting, which is scheduled to begin late in May. 
 
Allies Are Consulted
The Administration had been delaying any retaliation for the Soviet Union's economic moves against the Lithuanians for as long as possible, hoping the Baltic crisis would resolve itself.
But as the Kremlin's sanctions tightened late last week, the United States began a round of consultations with its allies to make certain it had backing for whatever steps it might take.
The Administration also wanted to make sure it had the support of Congressional leaders before acting, the official said.
Officials said there has been some reluctance in the Adminstration to take action against the Soviet Union over Lithuania out of concern that it might interfere with the progress made over the last year or so in Soviet-American relations and disrupt efforts to forge a new political order in Eastern Europe.
But pressure has steadily built on Mr. Bush to respond in some way as Soviet actions in the Baltic republic have grown increasingly harsh. Mr. Bush discussed his options with President Francois Mitterrand of France last week at a meeting in Florida and with other Western leaders in telephone conversations and other diplomatic contacts over the weekend.
 
Signs of 'Flexibility'
Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said today that Mr. Bush would meet with Congressional leaders on Tuesday morning in the White House to discuss the Lithuanian situation. ''I would not expect any announcement on the courses of action from us before that point,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
Mr. Fitzwater declined to say what, if anything, the White House would do in response. ''The final decisions by the President have not been made,'' he said. Mr. Fitzwater said the United States saw encouraging signs of ''flexibility'' in the most recent Soviet statements on Lithuania.
Two of the negotiations that could be affected by sanctions against the Soviet Union - on civil aviation and on trade - are scheduled to resume on Tuesday. Officials said American negotiators had been instructed to proceed with both sets of talks.
Using the trade talks as leverage against the Soviet Union could be particularly effective since they are a precursor to the granting of favorable tariff arrangements to the Soviet Union and an important milestone in Moscow's efforts to improve ties with the West.
 
Other Talks Under Way
The United States and the Soviet Union are also engaged in talks on an investment treaty, on the extension of import-export credits to Moscow, on tax agreements and on other commerical arrangements that Mr. Bush proposed last December in Malta during his meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The two countries also recently completed negotiations on a new five-year grain agreement that was expected to be signed at the next meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, which is scheduled to be held in Washington from May 30 to June 3.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter, asked about possible sanctions during a luncheon with agriculture writers, ruled out using the grain pact with Moscow as leverage in the Lithuanian crisis.
''I don't believe there's any chance whatsoever of a grain embargo being used in that situation or in any other situation,'' Mr. Yeutter said.
At his daily news briefing today, Mr. Fitzwater was asked about reports from Moscow that quoted a Kremlin spokesman, Arkady Maslennikov, as saying the Soviet Government would not insist on an outright repeal of Lithuanian's declaration of independence. Mr. Maslennikov suggested that the Lithuanians could ''freeze'' their proclamation of independence, perhaps for a period of two years.
Mr. Fitzwater said: ''The statements this morning do appear to show some flexibility. We are hopeful that that's the case.''
He said the statements were ''being factored in'' as Mr. Bush contemplates his response to Moscow's latest moves in Lithuania.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Soviet Experts Say Their Economy Is Worse Than U.S. Has Estimated

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Several senior Soviet economists said here today that the United States had consistently overestimated the size of the Soviet economy and understated Soviet military spending.
The actual condition of the Soviet economy is worse than indicated by data from either the Kremlin or the Central Intelligence Agency, the economists said.
They offered their views after a three-day conference here with scholars from American universities and analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency.
The agency said Friday that the Soviet gross national product was about half that of the United States. The G.N.P., which measures the total output of goods and services, was $5,200 billion for the United States last year. 
Viktor Belkin, a prominent economist from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said Soviet output was no more than 28 percent of the American G.N.P. and might be substantially less. #20 Percent Military Share Likewise, Oleg T. Bogomolov, an economist who serves in the Congress of People's Deputies, said Soviet military spending might account for 20 percent to 25 percent of Soviet G.N.P., as against a C.I.A. estimate of 15 percent to 17 percent.
In the spirit of glasnost, the increased openness under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, another Soviet economist and legislator, Vladimir Tikhonov, attacked the official Soviet data on agriculture. The amounts of Soviet fruit and vegetables lost through waste and inefficiency far exceed the official Soviet estimates, he said.
Soviet agricultural output is actually about 55 percent of the American output, rather than the 85 percent reported by the State Statistical Committee of the Soviet Union, he said, adding, ''One cannot trust the figures given by the state committee.''
Of the 90 million tons of potatoes harvested by Soviet farmers, only 24 million get to consumers because of transportation and storage problems, Mr. Tikhonov said.
At the conference, sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, the C.I.A. found itself increasingly isolated as Soviet economists joined a chorus of American skeptics who have for years been saying that the agency underestimated Soviet military outlays. Many, but not all, of the skeptics are considered politically conservative.
American officials said the data offered by the Soviet economists helped explain why the burden of military spending was becoming unbearable for the Soviets and why Moscow had been willing to make concessions in recent arms control talks.
 
'Can't Find Them Ourselves'
Mr. Bogomolov said the Soviets had difficulty figuring out precisely how much they spent on their armed forces. ''For decades,'' he said, ''we assiduously concealed these expenditures. Now we can't find them ourselves.'' In an interview, Mr. Bogomolov said, ''The C.I.A. figures are not correct.'' But the information available from the Soviet Government is ''insufficient to determine the magnitude of the underestimate,'' he said.
President Gorbachev announced in May that Soviet military spending totaled 77.3 billion rubles in 1989. The C.I.A. estimated that the actual amount in 1988 was 135 billion to 165 billion rubles; it has not disclosed its estimate for 1989.
Igor Birman, a Soviet emigre and economist who is president of the Foundation for Soviet Studies, in Silver Spring, Md., said Soviet military spending was probably close to 200 billion rubles this year. Mr. Bogomolov endorsed that suggestion, and a committee of the Soviet Parliament, investigating the question, came up with a similar estimate.
Mr. Bogomolov said ''the economic situation in our country does not allow any alternative'' to reducing military expenditures.
Reasons for the numerical disparities include disagreements over the purchasing power of the ruble and uncertainties about the prices and quantities of goods and services produced in the Soviet Union.
 
Agency Defends Procedures
James Noren, an economist who has worked at the C.I.A. for more than 30 years, generally defended the procedures used by the agency to estimate military spending and G.N.P. for the Soviet Union. The agency computes total military spending by estimating costs for a series of components, or ''building blocks,'' including weapon systems, military pay and allowances, repairs, research and development and construction.
C.I.A. officials at the conference were conciliatory, offering to work with their critics in America and the Soviet Union to produce better measures of Soviet military spending and G.N.P.
Nicholas N. Eberstadt, the chairman of the conference, said: ''Two years ago a meeting of this kind would have been absolutely unthinkable. After this meeting, it was very clear to the U.S. Government people that there is room for improvement in their estimates of the Soviet economy.''
As an indication that their figures were approximately correct, C.I.A. officials noted that some people in the United States criticized their estimates of Soviet military spending as too high. The critics include Franklyn D. Holzman, a professor of economics at Tufts University, who contends that the agency has ''systematically tended to overstate Soviet military expenditures.''

HEADLINE: DECISION IS URGED ON SOCIAL SECURITY

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Four months after Senator Daniel P. Moynihan of New York lobbed a political grenade into the Congressional budget process by suggesting a cut in Social Security taxes, his Democratic colleagues are being prodded to take a stand.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, plans to compel the Senate Budget Committee to vote on the measure. The committee will begin drafting its version of the 1991 budget on Tuesday.
''My purpose is to get to truth in budgeting,'' Mr. Hollings said today. ''I'm trying to force a political crisis in Washington to avoid having a real crisis in the economy.'' 
That was Mr. Moynihan's purpose back in December, when he proposed the tax cut as a way to force Congress to tackle what he viewed as a serious problem in the management of the Social Security trust funds. He said the enormous surpluses in the funds were being used to offset current spending and were masking the true size of the Federal budget deficit, when their purpose was to finance Social Security benefits for workers who will retire in the early 21st century.
 
Moynihan's Solution
Mr. Moynihan said the solution was to stop treating Social Security funds as though they were general tax revenues. To insure that they were not spent for other programs, he said the payroll tax increases that took effect in January should be rolled back and those scheduled for future years should be canceled.
Democratic Congressional leaders said they would study Mr. Moynihan's suggestion. The policy problems were enormous, they said. It was one thing to cut Social Security taxes, but where would they find the billions of dollars to offset the resulting explosion in the Federal deficit?
But Democrats outside of Congress saw a political bonanza, a way to wrest the high ground on the tax issue from President Bush and underscore the differences between Democrats and Republicans. Let the President argue for his capital gains tax cut that would benefit primarily the wealthiest taxpayers, the Democratic strategists reasoned; Democrats could now favor a tax cut that would benefit mainly working people.
The Democratic National Committee and the more conservative Democratic Leadership Council last month endorsed Mr. Moynihan's proposal.
 
Moynihan Is Delighted
''This was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago,'' Mr. Moynihan said today.
He also cited a statement over the weekend by the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, who said in a television interview that if the proposal was accepted in the Senate, it would also get a vote on the House floor.
In the meantime, Mr. Hollings wants to press the case in the Senate Budget Committee. The measure the panel will be drafting this week is a fiscal blueprint that sets overall spending, revenue and deficit levels for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1.
Mr. Hollings wants the revenue figure to reflect what would amount to a $36 billion tax cut by rolling back the increase in Social Security payroll taxes that is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. But to do that, he will also be asking his colleagues on the budget committee to remove the trust funds from the calculation of the budget deficit and to vote for a 1991 budget that leaves the deficit at a whopping $300 billion.
In an effort to reduce the huge budget deficit, Mr. Hollings plans to put before the panel a variety of other proposals to raise taxes. These include a 5 percent value-added tax on goods and services, a 10 percent oil import fee and an increase in the top income tax rate to 33 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers. A value-added tax is a sales tax paid on products and services at each stage of production or distribution and based on the value added in each stage.
Mr. Hollings acknowledged that he faced an uphill battle and that he might be outmaneuvered in committee with parliamentary tactics to preclude a straight up-or-down vote on the Social Security tax cut.
''They may try to block me,'' he said. ''But we will find a bill by God to cut Social Security taxes. There will be a vote.''

HEADLINE: Blame Japan? No. Save Ourselves

 BODY:
Japan saves six times more per person than the U.S. does and, as the accompanying graph shows, invests at a rate more than twice as high. Sound scary? Many Americans seem to think so.
There is reason to worry, but not about Japan. The two countries are not in a foot race; Japan's gain is not America's loss. In fact, when Japan grows, most Americans benefit. 
American living standards depend primarily on how much Americans, not Japanese, save and invest. On that score, there is cause for concern. Blaming another country for American economic ills only encourages regrettable public policy. The issue is not the leap in Japan's graph line; it's the sag in ours.
Japanese technological prowess provides American consumers with an array of high-quality, low-cost imports. And the steady influx of Japanese savings into American capital markets keeps borrowing costs low. That helps corporate investors and the Federal Treasury.
Particular industries suffer. Detroit auto workers know that. But their specific loss has been more than offset by the general gains from the creation of other American jobs. In fact, U.S. unemployment rates remain low despite the huge trade deficits with Japan.
What's lost in the preoccupation with rival savings and investment rates is a clear view of the U.S. economy. American living standards, correctly measured, dwarf those of any other major country, including Japan. And productivity remains high. Even if Japan were to maintain its current rapid rate of growth, which is implausible, it would still take from 30 to 200 years to catch up to U.S. levels of per capita output. And catching up would not cost Americans one dime.
Meanwhile, America faces formidable social problems - poverty, homelessness, crumbling infrastructure, crime and drugs. The foremost long-term economic problem is the savings rate, low and falling. So far, domestic investment, a primary determinant of future living standards, has declined only gradually because foreign savers have picked up the slack. But there is no guarantee that this good fortune will continue.
All of these problems are home-grown and fully within the nation's power to control.
Japan's success did not cause them and Japan's economic retreat would not solve them.
There is one Japanese practice that might threaten U.S. prosperity. Technological achievement may increasingly depend on which country invests first in high-tech industries. Many observers believe that the Japanese system is superior at targeting such investment.
Even if they are right, the threat has little to do with overall rates of investment in either country. The U.S. may have to find new ways to target assistance to venture capitalists and high-tech industries. There are substantial arguments to be heard about such targeting, and about the risk of further entangling politics and economics. These issues warrant serious Congressional debate.
Meanwhile, to begrudge the Japanese their success reflects either confusion or envy. For America to prosper, what's needed is not for the Japanese to do less but for Americans to do more.

HEADLINE: Finally, End Home Pork

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins will speak for more than New York City today when he appears before a Congressional committee to oppose the completion of a new naval base on Staten Island. The nation's defense needs have changed radically since the Navy proposed an elaborate system of home ports years ago. That system no longer makes strategic or economic sense, in New York or anywhere else. 
In the early 1980's, Navy Secretary John Lehman invented home porting - a costly plan for dispersing the fleet to every Congressional district with a port. Even then, that idea, which critics called ''port barreling,'' was questionable on military grounds. In New York, however, the main criticism arose from ill-founded fears about accidents involving nuclear warheads. Mayor Dinkins still grounds his opposition on that dubious premise. There are better reasons. As long as the Government concluded that the bases were needed for national security, every local community had a responsibility to share the burden. If a community would benefit economically, so much the better. Since then, the dramatic thaw in East-West relations promises cuts, not increases, in defense spending. Cutting has already begun.
If the Navy is likely to shrink, it's hard indeed to argue that 13 new home ports are needed to reduce crowding at existing facilities. The argument that dispersing the ships would reduce vulnerability to military attack seems equally weak given the growing implausibility of a surprise Soviet attack.
The Navy and Congress are now reviewing the whole program and some of the home ports, at least, are likely to go. Logic suggests that the Staten Island base should be among the first. The cost of living is higher in New York than in most other home port sites. Further, most members of New York's Congressional delegation, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, have joined Mr. Dinkins in opposition.
Meanwhile, it's also clear that the economic benefits of the home port won't be nearly as large as once thought. The Navy has decided to mothball the Iowa, with 1,500 crew members, the battleship originally scheduled for Staten Island, along with six other ships. The replacements would be the Normandy, a cruiser with a crew of 360, and perhaps five other ships. Guy Molinari, the Borough President, still argues that losing the port would cost Staten Island millions but that's far from certain.
So far, the Navy has spent $174 million of a projected $198 million for construction of the Staten Island port. But that's no reason to finish, or to spend millions upon millions in annual operating costs on a facility that defends nothing - and offends so many.

HEADLINE: Middletown Has Changed Since the 50's, Mostly for the Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We, as Mayor of Middletown, Conn., and president of Wesleyan University, join to express our consternation over the egregious misimpression created in your April 2 article about both the town and the university.
The article, however well crafted, was neither factual nor reliable. And, although it may seem naive to say, it was not fair. But ''not fair'' needs to be stated in this case, where the quality of life and of education have been so critically impugned by the country's leading newspaper. 
Wesleyan is a small university (2,700 students) known for research and teaching in the liberal arts and sciences. It has also earned its reputation for tolerating the responsible expression of individuals and for the diversity of its student body. There is no stereotypical Wesleyan student; there is a crewcut for every ponytail, whatever inference one might choose to draw from that. But tolerance of protest is not synonymous with license, liberal not synonymous with libertine. Neither implies approval of illegal activities. Our record, rather than our bad press, proves that to be the case. The notion that Wesleyan has an outlaw image is an affront we vigorously protest.
Like other such cities in the United States, Middletown has changed greatly since the 1950's, mostly for the better. True, we share the problems of all small cities in the country, but we have also demonstrated our solutions. We have a better racial balance in our schools and better relations in our neighborhoods; smaller classes and better-paid teachers; a new courthouse complex in the works, and a lively economy, with more jobs and more industries, literally topped not long ago by Middletown's first (if modest by New York City standards) skyscraper. Our Main Street is busy with shoppers and so far has survived the malling of America.
The city and the Wesleyan community have combined efforts to staff, equip and run a soup kitchen and shelter. We are working to improve the delivery of its service.
Hundreds of students volunteer community service through various agencies. Many more support fund raisers for multiple sclerosis, the March of Dimes and the Red Cross. They are caring and committed, concerned with social problems and willing to make a difference.
Your reporter apparently popped into town with his story written. He popped back out with a few quotations, leaving some hard feelings in an otherwise very welcoming community.

HEADLINE: Filming Puts Bronx Vanities Out of Joint

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
The Bronx knew there was something funny about the upcoming film ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' when rain soaked the county courthouse yesterday from a crystalline sky.
''How is it going to be raining on a sunny day when there's no clouds?'' asked Abraham Rivero, a 15-year-old Bronx native, shrugging off the huge sprinklers affixed to two 150-foot cranes on either side of the white-granite cube known as the Mario Merola Building.
Behind Mr. Rivero's skepticism about the special effects, it seemed, lurked the unease of an entire borough over how it might be portrayed.
Few in the crowds that gathered to watch Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and the other actors run around the courthouse location for the director, Brian DePalma, said they had read Tom Wolfe's book. 
 
Criminals and Victims
But many seemed to suspect that the story of a Wall Street bond trader's downfall and redemption cast the State Supreme Court of Bronx County as a lonely island of justice in a teeming sea of criminals and their victims.
And the Bronx shouted its objections.
''If they don't really know what's happening here in the Bronx, they shouldn't come here and talk about it,'' said Felipe Mercado, 36, who suggested that a movie might better be made about his reformed street gang.
Mr. Mercado, who wore a blue ''Bud Lite'' bandana over his long black hair and a black ''Wild Thing'' T-shirt over the many tattoos he said he had gathered in prison, listened silently to another onlooker's brief summary of the ''Bonfire'' plot. Then, he concluded, ''They look at us like we're low lifes.'' With their more ''serious'' gang days over, Mr. Mercado said he and his once rough-and-tumble friends now work to keep their children in school and out of trouble. One year, he said, they even put together a Little League baseball team.
Nearby, a 31-year-old lawyer, who asked to be identified only as a black woman, said Mr. Wolfe's book contributed to a misperception of the Bronx as a ''cesspool'' filled with criminals who live in housing projects.
''It's certainly written from a non-resident-of-the-Bronx-white-man's perspective.''
As well as Mr. Wolfe's novel became known at the end of the decade it chronicled, Warner Brothers, which is producing the movie, did its best to keep the filming under wraps.
 
'Unobtrusive' Is the Goal
Press queries went unanswered. Actors seeking work as extras had to promise not to disclose information about the film. And the Lou Gehrig Plaza parking lot was flushed of its normal complement of lawyers' cars, to better keep gawkers across the street.
''We just want to keep it as quiet and unobtrusive as possible,'' said Robert Harris, who nonetheless had the title of production publicist.
Despite the intense security measures, Mr. Harris admitted, ''in practical terms, we are hiding an elephant in Times Square.''
Mr. DePalma's cameras had no sooner begun to roll when the traffic began to gag at the intersection of East 161st Street and Walton Avenue. Amid the hubbub, the police reported a runaway van whose driver was thought to have fired shots. No one was injured.
 
'Losing All My Business'
And while officials supportive of the filming trumpeted its economic benefits, not everyone in the neighborhood was so flush.
''I'm losing all my business,'' lamented Derrick Phipps, 35, who said he normally earns more than $100 a day feeding quarters into meters for busy lawyers. ''If you lose them for a day, they may find a garage and they may stay there forever.''
The State Supreme Court's administrative judge in the Bronx, Burton B. Roberts, dismissed such grumbling out of hand. ''The parking is taken care of,'' he said. ''It's not interfering with the court. We're not losing anything.''
In an interview, Justice Roberts made no mention of a memorandum from Mayor David N. Dinkins asking city officials to assist movie and television producers wanting to film in the city, whether or not the officials cared for the scripts. But on a wall of photographs in the judge's chamber hung a framed shot of him next to a gaunt man in a white suit and high-necked collar, his ''good friend,'' Mr. Wolfe.
The novel ''Bonfire'' was dedicated to Justice Roberts. He also inspired one of its main characters, Judge Myron Kovitsky, a feisty, somewhat bizarre tryant of the bench who at one point spits on a van full of prisoners to silence their heckling.
''It's a good book and I hope it'll be a good movie,'' he said.
 
Casting at Issue
Others questioned Mr. DePalma's casting, including the choice of Morgan Freeman, the black actor, to play the balding Jewish judge of the novel, and of Tom Hanks to play Sherman McCoy, the bond trader who plunges to the Bronx from glorious perches atop Wall Street and Park Avenue.
''Tom Hanks is not a Master of the Universe,'' sniffed John V. Barbieri, a 29-year-old lawyer, referring to the way McCoy thinks of himself.
About Mr. Willis, who will play the boozy journalist who helps bring McCoy down, a different sort of fan concern seemed to prevail. ''Yo, Bruce,'' one man shouted several times. ''What's up?''
But most of the questions around the courthouse concentrated on whether the building and its environs were really anything like those of Mr. Wolfe's - and perhaps the movie's -creation.
 
'Never Been Mugged'
''It's O.K.,'' said Kern Baptiste, 34, who said he had recently been released from jail after serving 18 months. ''I've been arrested eight times, for marijuana, coke, and this was the first time I've had to do time.''
Judy Gonzalez, 36, who works in the courthouse's microfilm department, boasted, ''I've worked here 10 years and I've never been mugged.''
Willie Watson, 41, a maintenance man at the home for the elderly that occupies the old Concourse Plaza Hotel across the street, said he was disappointed with the scenes being filmed, but not exactly because of what they said about the Bronx.
''I expected more action,'' he said.

Testing Professor: A Big Developer Sues a Consultant

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
Robert W. Lake, a professor at Rutgers, is nationally known for conducting research surveys. ''If money were my goal, I could do focus groups for J. Walter Thompson,'' he said. ''I could do survey groups about cat food or toilet tissue and get paid tons. I could do social-impact statements for big developers.''
Instead, he uses his training to study social issues he cares about, like patterns of racial segregation or inequities in the siting of toxic dumps. Occasionally he has been hired as an expert for groups like Westpride, which opposes Donald J. Trump's huge project planned for the West Side of Manhattan. Professor Lake said, ''If I did the impact study for Trump instead of Westpride, I would have got $150,000 instead of $1,500.'' 
As a result, Professor Lake drives a 1984 Honda with 125,000 miles and a dented fender. His 1981 book, ''The New Suburbanites: Race and Housing in the Suburbs,'' received good reviews. It sold 2,500 copies, netting him $1,000.
It is his choice. He was raised by Quaker parents and was touched by the 1960's. His peers understand his worth. John Kain, chairman of the economics department at Harvard, said, ''No question he's an able researcher on questions of racial segregation.'' A fair-housing expert for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. John Goering, said, ''It would indeed be frivolous to question Lake's qualifications.''
But that is what has been going on in court for 15 months, and the end is not near.
The Housing Coalition of Middlesex County, a group that fights housing bias, felt it had a strong case against the Woodbridge Terrace apartments. A black man had been unsuccessful in his effort to rent at Woodbridge Terrace.
The coalition sent in teams of white and black testers. Whites reported having been told that there were vacancies. Blacks visiting the same day reported no vacancies. In March 1987 a Federal suit was filed against the landlord.
 
The coalition hired
Professor Lake to supervise a telephone survey of the complex to see if there was other evidence of racial steering. It was about three weeks' work; he was paid $500. The results are very technical, but seemed to indicate steering.
In December 1988, Judge Harold A. Ackerman of Federal District Court in Newark felt that the violation of the Fair Housing Act was so clear that he issued a summary judgment against the landlords, Sam and Arie Halpern; Joseph and Harry Wilf, in two tester cases. Other allegations will be resolved at trial. In January 1989 the landlords sued Professor Lake for defaming them. They cited the lead-in Professor Lake wrote for the survey: ''Hi! I'm (first and last name) from the Housing Coalition of Middlesex County. The Housing Coalition is looking into a matter of housing discrimination, and we're doing a survey of households in a few selected developments in Middlesex County.'' The suit said that ''was designed to hold Woodbridge Terrace in contmept, hatred, ridicule, aversion or disgrace.''
Professor Lake felt the suit was frivolous and meant to bully him, but he needed help. Rutgers refused, saying the $500 fee he received made it his personal business. The faculty union put him in touch with a lawyer who said the case was such an easy victory that it would cost $10,000. Just the American Civil Liberties Union agreed to provide a lawyer, Corinne Mullen, pro bono. What surprised Ms. Mullen was how quiet Professor Lake seemed for someone accused of defaming a big apartment complex. ''He's this typical reserved academician,'' she said.
In September, Judge Ackerman dismissed the suit. The landlords have appealed.
Such suits against advocates and their experts have become so common that George Pring, a law professor at the University of Denver, specializes in them. He said 90 percent were dismissed. Of the ultimate outcome of Professor Lake's case, Professor Pring said: ''It's over. He's won.'' He said that in studying hundreds of cases he had never seen one that was dismissed but later won on appeal. ''But this doesn't mean it's through,'' Professor Pring added. ''It may still have 12 to 18 months to run on appeal. Victory lies in abusing the court process to gain time. It pressures activists to fritter away resources, chills their activism, dries up support.''
Professor Lake said: ''This is an enormous distraction. It goes on and on.'' He says it had robbed him of crucial writing time. If he is to be promoted from associate to full professor, he needs to publish more. He is 45 years old and would like the prestige of full professorship, plus the extra $10,000 a year.
A lawyer for the landlords, Allyn Lite, said, ''There is nothing frivolous about the suit.'' Karin Haber, who is handling their appeal, said: ''Harassment? No way. Experts need to be held accountable for the damage they do.''

HEADLINE: Winfield Revitalized On Yankee Road Trip

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ

 BODY:
It was still morning in Texas, still quietly empty in the visitors' clubhouse at Arlington Stadium. There were hours to go before the game would be played that day, but Dave Winfield was already dressed, and he was in a contemplative mood.
It may have been the music that played through his headphones. Barely a half day after belting two home runs against the Texas Rangers, he was back in front of his locker, listening to jazz. 
Winfield has played the game for 16 seasons and appeared in more than 2,000 games, but he still finds pleasure in every moment, from the pregame rituals to the game itself. He has yet to tire of it.
There had been questions about his comeback with the Yankees, but the 38-year-old outfielder may have put them to rest on the recent six-game trip.
 
Five Consecutive Losses
The swing was tortuous for the Yanks, who are burdened by a five-game losing streak as the Seattle Mariners arrive at the Stadium tonight, but Winfield thrived, hitting two home runs off Charlie Hough, adding two more hits Sunday and sending his batting average to .333, second only to Don Mattingly among the regulars on the team.
More than that, perhaps, he has come to realize again how much he still enjoys performing.
''It's how you approach the game,'' he said. ''You might see a guy come to the ball park and hear him complain about the travel and the schedule, and that seems to be the first thing to go. I still enjoy the camaraderie, the challenges, which you don't get in everyday life. When you start losing that, everything else goes with it.''
 
Return to Form
But in the short span of time he has been back, Winfield has appeared enthusiastic again. He runs hard on routine grounders, is slowly reacquainting himself with playing left field and has apparently located the swing that left him 1 for 29 in spring training and had raised doubts.
He explains away his unsightly training camp by saying: ''Mentally, I don't put everything into it. I'm not going to exhaust myself down there. I know how to focus my spring.''
But clearly, after missing a year following back surgery, it caused questions - although none of them came from Winfield.
''I'd planned on having a month of spring training, and I had to rush everything,'' he said. ''I tried to push hard, but it's not my style to do well down there. When the season comes, I lock in.''
He does it this way: ''Every at bat, I take very seriously. After a lot of years, I'm like a gunslinger, and these young kids think, 'If I can get him, I can build a reputation.' Maybe I'm just putting it in that category, but it helps me to think of it that way.''
If there was concern it did not come from Bucky Dent, the Yankees' manager, who allowed Winfield to work at his own deliberate pace in the spring.
 
'Quality Athlete'
''He's a quality athlete,'' Dent said. ''He plays with great intensity, he plays the game hard. Spring training is different from the season. When the lights come on, it's like you're playing for real.''
With his start, Winfield has allowed himself the small pleasure of thinking ahead. He can play five more years, he said, maybe more. He will eventually try his hand at first base to prolong his career. But he isn't sure exactly how long he will go.
''It's like an economist. Who the heck knows?'' he said. ''That's why they quit using those guys. I think I'd like to go that long.''
And he says that he has gotten better with age. The last season he played, 1988, he had one of his best overall seasons: a .322 average, 180 hits, 25 home runs and 107 runs batted in. His two homers Saturday gave him 205 as a Yankee, moving him past Roger Maris and into seventh place on the team's career list.
 
Consistent Player
''They made me different than they made other people,'' Winfield said. ''I've had my best years in my 30's. You hear people say, 'I wish I knew then what I know now.' Well, I've learned things every year that have helped make me consistent. Every year, every game, you never take things for granted.''
He knows that there are those in the organization, specifically the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, who would revel in his failure this season, his 10th and probably last with the Yankees. He simply says, ''I won't do that.''
But neither will he shout emphatically that he is back all the way. It is only the beginning of the season.
''If I'm not back now, I'm close,'' he said. ''If I'm hitting .310 or .320 at the break, I'll tell you.''

Johnson Collection of Sacred Art in Warsaw

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
In Poland, where economic strains have forced cultural organizations like the National Museum in Warsaw to reduce telephone service for staff members, the exhibition entitled ''Opus Sacrum'' is singularly opulent. It is also an inspired event.
The show, which has just opened here, puts on view for the first time anywhere a large assortment of paintings, drawings and decorative objects belonging to Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the art-history student who left Poland with $200 in 1969 and who now possesses a fortune estimated at roughly $300 million, inherited from her husband, J. Seward Johnson Sr., the son of the founder of the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical company, who died in 1983. Mrs. Johnson has spent millions of dollars over the last 18 years amassing at her home in Princeton, N.J., one of the most talked-about Old Master paintings collections in the world.
At a time when important private collectors of Old Masters are thought to have virtually died out with the Fricks and Morgans, Mrs. Johnson has accumulated drawings by Raphael and Sandro Botticelli, and paintings by artists like Peter Paul Rubens, Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. This exhibition consists of roughly 80 religious works from her extensive holdings. Travel plans for the show have not yet been set. ''Opus Profanum,'' an exhibition of her secular art, is to be presented in Warsaw in about two years. 
Both exhibitions are gifts to her former countrymen from Mrs. Johnson, who will not only pay for the events but will also donate money from the sales of the catalogues to a fund for, among other things, the preservation of monuments in Cracow. (The paintings and other works in the exhibitions will not be donated to Poland; they are destined for a private museum in Princeton that Mrs. Johnson is planning to build, she said.) Mrs. Johnson began to organize ''Opus Sacrum'' about two years ago, long before her proposals last spring to buy the Lenin Shipyard at Gdansk. But clearly, after losing face with many people in Poland in January, when her shipyard plan fell through, Mrs. Johnson is hoping ''Opus Sacrum'' will help to restore her tarnished image. She has apparently spared no expense in making it a lavish occasion. The show is presented, through July 31, in the Princes Apartments at the Royal Castle, which have been theatrically reconceived by the exhibition's designer, Franco Zeffirelli. Where it might have been better to let the paintings and drawings speak for themselves, he has installed spotlights, thick curtains, brocade velvet wall coverings, carpets and, in the most obvious gesture of all, constructed vestibules that are like tiny chapels in which a few works are displayed as altars.
Yet the exhibition cannot be dismissed simply as a public relations gesture or as a flourish of capitalist ostentation in this poor country, which has begun its difficult conversion to a free market system. ''Opus Sacrum'' is also an event of genuine artistic and symbolic significance.
By focusing on religious works, Mrs. Johnson has paid homage to the central role that the Roman Catholic Church played during the late 1970's and 80's in dismantling Poland's Communist regime. She has made a similar if more subtle point with her choice of the Royal Castle, the home during the 18th century of the last Polish kings. This was the one building in Warsaw's so-called old town that the Communists refused to rebuild after World War II; only to ease mounting public opposition to the Government did they reluctantly agree, in 1970, to its reconstruction. Since then, the castle has stood as one of Poland's leading emblems of anti-Communism.
And while the show's overblown title and decor may confuse excess with elegance, this is not to detract from the quality of the collection on view. For the dozens of prominent art historians, dealers, curators and collectors who converged on Warsaw from across Europe and the United States to attend the lavish opening, ''Opus Sacrum'' is an opportunity finally to scrutinize what has come to be regarded as one of the two or three premier Old Master paintings collections put together in the last quarter-century, and more specifically, to see important and recently discovered works attributed to artists like Caravaggio and Gentile da Fabriano, which have not previously been on public view.
The display is even more opportune for Poles, who have had few chances during the last half-century to see Renaissance and Baroque paintings of any quality, aside from works in Polish collections, and who may not have many similar chances in the near future. Traveling exhibitions from the West have been painfully rare. With the current Polish Government's economic ''shock therapy'' program, there is no money to cover the insurance and other costs of bringing such events here.
Under almost any circumstances, however, a show that included works like Mantegna's ''Descent Into Limbo'' would be notable. The same could be said of an exhibition that included Orazio Gentileschi's sweet and intimate ''Madonna and Child,'' or Raphael's study for the head and hand of an apostle, both of which are here.
It hardly matters whether ''The Dead Christ Held by an Angel'' is truly from the hands of Giorgione and Titian, as is contended in the catalogue for ''Opus Sacrum.'' This is a work of surpassing beauty and concentration of expression, whoever painted it. Nor does questioning the attribution to Leonardo da Vinci of two drapery studies cast into doubt the suavity of these drawings. By the same token, experts in Italian art may debate the participation of Caravaggio in the painting of ''St. Francis in Ecstasy,'' but the fact remains that this is a deeply moving image.
Even, in other words, with works over which scholars may debate attribution, Mrs. Johnson and her advisers (for years, Harry Bailey and Adrian Ward-Jackson, and most recently Jozef Grabski, a Viennese publisher, who also helped prepare the catalogue) have bought well. Which is not to say Mrs. Johnson has bought flawlessly. Fra Angelico's ''Madonna and Child (Madonna With the Grapes),'' or Filippino Lippi's ''Madonna and Child with Two Angels,'' for example, are among Mrs. Johnson's less persuasive acquisitions. Yet for almost every disappointing work there is a memorable painting like Gentile da Fabriano's ''Annunciation'' or Carlo Saraceni's ''Martyrdom of St. Cecilia,'' or a sculpture like Alessandro Algardi's gilt bronze ''Flagellation'' group.
Moreover, Mrs. Johnson has bought objects that are now typically considered interesting only to museums. Few other private collectors would choose to live with works on the scale and of the religious intensity of paintings like the ''Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew,'' attributed to Jusepe Ribera but possibly by Luca Giordano, or Francisco de Zurbaran's ''Immaculate Conception.'' Mrs. Johnson has sought out such images. She favors big and bold objects. And she has not limited herself to one period or school. ''Opus Sacrum'' starts chronologically with a panel by Corso di Buono from the late 13th century and ends with a canvas by Paul Gauguin from the turn of the 20th that is a Tahitian variation on the theme of the Madonna and Child.
''We live in an aggressively secular world, and the taste of the few people who buy Old Masters seriously reflects this fact,'' the art historian John Pope-Hennessy states in his introduction to the show's catalogue. ''Paintings of religious subjects are, by and large, viewed with some embarrassment,'' he writes. ''What gives this collection so individual a quality is not just tolerance of great religious images but reponsiveness to the message they convey.''
''Opus Sacrum'' honors the constancy of religious life in Poland. It is also a wonderful gift to a country that is in the process of wrenching and heroic change.

HEADLINE: Goldsmith Ends Bid For B.A.T.

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, April 23

 BODY:
Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French financier, ended his nine-month battle to acquire B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. today - and failed to earn a place in the history books for pulling off one of the biggest takeovers ever.
The decision made it seem less likely that giant American-style takeovers financed largely with debt would spread to Europe, as many had predicted when the group led by Sir James announced its first bid of $21 billion in securities last July.
Hoylake Investments' decision to give up on B.A.T. came two weeks after the California Department of Insurance dealt Hoylake, the investor group led by Sir James, a heavy blow. It turned down Hoylake's proposed $4.5 billion sale of Farmers, B.A.T.'s American insurance subsidiary, to Axa-Midi Assurances, the French insurer. Eight other states had not yet ruled on the proposal. 
 
B.A.T.'s Progress a Factor
That setback and B.A.T.'s progress in pacifying shareholders caused Hoylake to call it quits, an official in the Hoylake camp said in an interview tonight. B.A.T. has bought back stock, increased its dividend, is selling its American retailing empire and is spinning off other companies.
The reason for giving up was ''the time, cost and uncertainty of going through the U.S. regulatory hoops, combined with the fact that the board of B.A.T. was doing three-quarters of what we said they should do,'' the official said, adding, ''The bird would have been nearly carved.''
Hoylake also advocated splitting up B.A.T.'s financial services and tobacco businesses, which B.A.T. plans to keep.
In a statement, Hoylake said it ''will not renew its offer for B.A.T.'' and added that ''the directors of Hoylake wish B.A.T. and its unbundled offspring great success within their new structures.''
 
Axa-Midi Quest Ends
Axa-Midi also said it would end its quest for Farmers, but Claude Bebear, Axa's chairman, said his company had not given up its ambitions to expand in the United States. ''While we understand the Hoylake board's decision to cease its bid for B.A.T., we are naturally disappointed,'' he said in a statement.
Mr. Bebear again repeated his optimism that Axa could have addressed regulators' concern that its original plan to borrow the entire purchase price would have endangered Farmers. He said Axa had been prepared to submit a new bid that included up to $2 billion in cash.
Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T.'s chairman, said in a statement that he was ''pleased that Hoylake and Axa-Midi have finally abandoned their bid,'' so ''we can now devote our full attention to running the continuing group.'' He also vowed to continue with the plans to enhance shareholder value that were approved in October.
 
Marshall Field Deal
B.A.T. announced last Thursday an agreement to sell its Marshall Field department stores to the Dayton Hudson Corporation for $1.04 billion. It previously sold the John Breuner Company, a furniture retail and rental chain based in California, for $107.5 million. Argos, its European catalogue showroom retailer, began trading as a separate company earlier this month. And the stock of Wiggins Teape Appleton, its specialty paper business, is scheduled to begin trading as a separate company in early June.
That leaves it with two American retail chains: Saks Fifth Avenue, which analysts believe will sell for as much as $1.3 billion, and J. B. Ivey, a specialty retail chain in the Southeast. B.A.T. said it hoped to complete those sales by the end of June.
B.A.T. has also repurchased 67 million of its shares for a total of 540 million ($883 million). It said last year that it planned to repurchase as much as 10 percent, or about 150 million, of its shares.
 
B.A.T. Receipts Dip
The end of the B.A.T. takeover fight came after the London Stock Exchange had closed. In trading on the American Stock Exchange, the price of B.A.T.'s American depository receipts closed at $11.6875, down 43.75 cents.
Analysts estimated that the takeover battle cost both sides a total of at least $150 million.
Both Hoylake and Axa-Midi insisted tonight that they had incurred only small losses in the takeover bid. A spokesman said Hoylake's loss would be less than 10 million ($16 million), and a spokesman for Axa said its losses would be ''less than Hoylake's.'' Costs were 30 million to 40 million ($49.1 million to $65.4 million), the Hoylake official said, but both Hoylake and Axa said their costs had been largely offset by the dividends and the profits they expect to reap from the B.A.T. stock they own. Hoylake said it owns 19.4 million shares, and paid 6 to 6.50 each for them. The Axa spokesman did not know how many B.A.T. shares the insurer has.
B.A.T. has said that it spent 56 million (about $90 million) through the end of last year defending itself.
 
Sir James's Next Target
Analysts speculated tonight that Sir James might now go after Ranks Hovis McDougall P.L.C. Almost 30 percent of the big British food concern is owned by Sunningdale Holdings, a company controlled by Sir James and his allies, who include Jacob Rothschild, the British financier, and Kerry Packer, the Australian business executive.
The Anglo Group P.L.C., a company controlled by Sir James and Mr. Rothschild, has said it intends to invest in undervalued British companies. An Anglo director who asked not to be named repeated that intention tonight. ''Anglo remains in position and will continue to do what we said it would do,'' he said.
With the end of the fight for B.A.T., it seemed tonight that giant leveraged buyouts were not ready to take root in Europe.
 
Buyouts on the Wane in Britain
That likelihood was already fading, given problems in Britain, where leveraged buyouts have achieved the greatest acceptance in Europe. Most of the buyouts completed to date have been relatively small. And two of the larger buyouts that American investment banks helped to orchestrate in Britain - that of Magnet, a furniture retailer and building supplier, and Gateway, the supermarket chain -have run into some difficulty.
In addition, Britain's economic growth has slowed to a near-standstill and interest rates have soared, posing big obstacles to leveraged deals.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Ex-Treasury Official To New England Bank

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation, the troubled banking company operating under Government supervision while it tries to regain profitability, yesterday announced the appointment of R. T. McNamar, a former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, as vice chairman.
While at the Treasury Department from 1982 to 1984, Mr. McNamar, known as Tim, was involved in some of the decade's most spectacular financial crises. He was the Treasury's principal negotiator during the collapse of the Continential Illinois Bank and Trust Company and in talks to provide an emergency $1.1 billion in loans to Mexico to prevent its banks from closing. 
At the Bank of New England, which had a loss of $1.1 billion last year, Mr. McNamar, 51 years old, said he expected to spend most of his time working with regulators and strengthening the bank's capital position.
Although he has not lived in New England since he earned an M.B.A. degree from Dartmouth College in 1965, Mr. McNamar is familiar with the economic and financial turmoil in New England. Last year, he was part of an investor group that tried to buy the First Constitution Financial Corporation in New Haven, a holding company for a savings and loan association. The deal was abandoned, he said, as falling prices for real estate prevented the company and buyers from agreeing on terms.
''I got a pretty good look last year of what is going on up here,'' Mr. McNamar said. ''I don't think this real estate overhang and economic slump will last forever.
''If we at the Bank of New England do the right things in the next months, and if we have enough time from regulators and can show we are making progress, this is a tremendous opportunity to turn around a company.''
The Bank of New England, which Mr. McNamar described as ''one of the best regional banking franchises in the country,'' has a network of more than 400 branch offices in four states, concentrated in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
But as it acquired other banks to create the regional network, the company was slow to cut costs by eliminating duplicated resources and did not develop strict lending policies that might have protected it against the many real estate loans it made in the late 1980's, which have since turned sour.
The agreements that Bank of New England and its subsidiary banks have signed with regulators require the company to raise more capital, shrink its size and develop better lending policies.
Before moving to Boston, Mr. McNamar was a managing director at Conover & McNamar, a merchant banking firm in Los Angeles. Before his stint at the Treasury, he was an executive director of the Federal Trade Commission and a management consultant at McKinsey & Company.
He and his wife, Karen, will move to Boston, but are still looking for a house. For relaxation and exercise, Mr. McNamar said he is a regular jogger. The move to Boston from Los Angles will be the catalyst, he said, ''to become a proficient cross-country skier.''

HEADLINE: Making German Twain Meet Is Difficult

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Whenever people in one country do business with people in another, they have to exchange their currencies. When Americans shop in Italy, for example, there must be a rate of exchange that tells them how many lire they will get for each of their dollars.
Normally, this figure, known as the exchange rate, is set by free trading in foreign exchange markets around the world. 
But this commonplace process takes on fantastic proportions when the need arises to devise an exchange rate for the merging of two very different economies, as in the case of West Germany and East Germany. It is even more difficult when the value of one currency, the East German Ostmark, or ''east'' mark, is not generally known because by law it has not been allowed to freely trade in the foreign exchange markets.
 
Other Factors Influence the Evaluations
In the foreign exchange markets, the value of one currency to another is based, in part, on how many goods and services a dollar or franc or mark can command in another country. But other factors also enter into the evaluations of traders of what currencies are worth, including the economic outlook for one country versus another, taking into account their rates of growth, inflation rates, interest rates and political developments.
Exchange rates are changing all the time, as economic and political developments shift. For example, the West German decision on the exchange rate announced yesterday knocked down the value of the West German mark against the dollar.
In the case of West Germany and East Germany, the Governments have to make an artificial decision on an exchange rate to convert Ostmarks into West Germany's Deutsche marks because there is no free-market level to provide a figure.
Although there are some official exchange rates in East Germany, these do not reflect the value in the open market because the Ostmark has not been exchangeable outside the old Eastern bloc. The Ostmark is worth very little outside East Germany because it is not officially convertible into other currencies and because there is little confidence in the economy and economic policy behind it.
The official exchange rate for visitors from West Germany is currently three Ostmarks to one West German mark. This exchange is now made at a branch of the state-owned bank in East Germany. But on the flourishing black market, West Germans have been able to get 4.5 to 5 Ostmarks for one West German mark. An East German leaving the country could exchange Ostmarks in the state bank at home at official rates for the country being visited, or try to exchange the Ostmarks on a black market.
 
Political Reasons Outweighed Economic Ones
The one-to-one exchange rate for many transactions announced in Germany yesterday implies that the currencies are at parity, that is, of equal value. But this decision was made more for political than economic reasons. The one-for-one exchange rate is the most attractive for workers of the alternatives considered and is designed to help stop the flow of East Germans into West Germany.
Still the difference in the economic performance of the two countries is shown in the average salary in East Germany, even after the one-to-one exchange. In East Germany, it will be 1,200 marks a month compared with 3,000 in West Germany.
